1
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.510
I feel like if we,
if we were allowed to use music,
we're not totally,

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.260
but if we would,
I would go with the doors riders on the storm right now.

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.460
Two little writers on the stone.

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.750
Doon Doon Doom.
Ryan is on the stone

5
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.200
and to really,
okay,
I'll stop.

6
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.800
Tell Dad what the fuck they're not all the big guy.

7
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.630
The Big Guy dropped off the 27 this episode,

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.800
this 400th episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by

9
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:42.801
legal zoom.com if you have anything that you need to get done illegal style,

10
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.690
like what do you want to incorporate and become an LLC,

11
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.740
which is limited legal corporation or some shit.

12
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.450
I don't know what the fuck that actually stands for.
Um,

13
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.090
if you want to get a will,
if you want to even get divorced,

14
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.790
Bam,
you can get divorced on legal zoom.com.

15
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.120
Essentially what it does is it sets up a structure so that you can do things and

16
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.320
things like incorporating yourself or working on copyrights or trademarks and do

17
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:15.090
it legally without the use of an attorney.

18
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.730
They also will provide you with a contact for an independent attorney if you

19
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:21.840
need additional guidance.

20
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:25.410
So if you feel like you're entering into this and I'm like,
maybe I can do this,

21
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:30.180
and then halfway through you like shit,
they'll help you out so it's not scary,

22
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.230
but you're going to be able to do it.

23
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:35.010
You know how I know you're going to be able to do it.
Brian did it.
Okay.

24
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.040
I want you to think about that.
Drunk at four in the morning.

25
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:39.600
I don't even remember not,

26
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.290
that's not to say that Brian might not be going to jail next week for that very

27
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:48.240
same series of clicks.
It shouldn't be responsible.
He was drinking.

28
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.430
You should be able to sue the alcohol companies for that.

29
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:53.580
Whichever ones were sponsorable legal zoom should have a breathalyzer.

30
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.770
Legal Zoom is not a law firm.

31
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.780
They what they do is they provide self-help services at your specific direction.

32
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.210
It's pretty simple stuff though.

33
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.450
It's very clear to follow and it can save you all a lot of money and I can also

34
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:13.080
save you a lot of time and you can do it.
You know in your fucking house,

35
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:17.580
you don't have to go somewhere.
You can do it it naked.
Nobody can stop you.

36
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.920
Nobody can stop you.
Choke is nobody.
Do you understand this?

37
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.790
So if you have an idea for a business that you haven't done anything about,

38
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.320
you can incorporate that shit online.
The online process couldn't be easier.

39
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.500
Go to legal zoom.com enter the code named Rogan.
You'll save yourself some cash.

40
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.310
All right,

41
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.310
you fucks were also brought to you by stamps.com stamps.com is official delivery

42
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:44.760
system for the desk squad dot t v t shirts.

43
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.730
So if you see those t shirts that Brian has made and designed,

44
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.600
all of those bitches get delivered through stamps.com so we know this is a,

45
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.520
a real legit product.
And what stamped on the calm does,

46
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.010
I should say that clearly stamps.com does.

47
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.410
What they do is they allow you to feel like you're selling shit from your house.

48
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.460
They allow you to do all the weighing and packaging at home.

49
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.310
Then you can print up your own actual postal information.
Joey Diaz,

50
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.480
he talking in the background.
I can hear you well.

51
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:15.630
You guys are arguing over Duncan.

52
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.640
He distracting him in the middle of the fucking all important commercials.

53
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.410
<v 1>How dare you,
how dare you.
You're so nice</v>

54
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.930
<v 0>corporate man.
You can't even help yourself.</v>

55
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.490
You do it almost against your own will.

56
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.280
<v 1>I don't want to get into government.
The power shut down going on right now.</v>

57
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:32.960
Time to advertise.

58
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.210
<v 0>Oh,
that's what I'm saying.</v>

59
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.350
stamps.com is a great way to send out kitty cat tee shirts.
That's my point.

60
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.010
All right.
You don't have to go to the post office and weigh everything out.

61
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:44.740
Everything that you do it at home,
they provide you with a scale.

62
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.960
If you enter in the code word J,
r e they give you a sweet offer,
no risk trial.

63
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.670
$110 bonus offer includes a digital scale,
enough to $55 free postage.

64
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.500
So go and check it out.
Use the code word J.
R.
E.
N.

65
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.900
Get your hundred and $10 bonus offer.
It's,

66
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:04.720
we know it works because Brian uses it so much better than going to the post

67
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:08.260
office and having to weigh all your shit out and talk to people that don't want

68
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:09.094
to talk to you.

69
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.230
So stamps.com we're also brought to you by onnit.com did I say you have to use a

70
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:18.940
code word?
Jre Yes.
Yes.
Codeword Jerry for stamps.
Got comp.

71
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.960
Yeah,
you're right folks.
You look what the fuck.
If we want to use these things,

72
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:24.100
what are you of the same code were you're right.

73
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.070
We've thought about this a million times before.
However,

74
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.810
it's probably never going to happen.
So deal with it.

75
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.420
It's very weird that it's not though.

76
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.010
It's all should be the codeword Rogan yet white.
Mix it up.
I don't know.

77
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.000
People get silly.
I don't understand people.
Brian.
I try.

78
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.320
I don't understand myself though.
What the fuck?
Uh,
anyway,

79
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:47.710
stamps.com codewords Jerry were also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com

80
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.050
that's o,
n n,
I t.
A.

81
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:53.590
Use a code name Brogan and you'll save 10% off any and all supplements,

82
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:56.620
including Alpha brain,
which Joey Diaz is on right now.

83
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.280
He's jacked up for brain smell in the air

84
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.640
<v 1>and I have some brains.</v>

85
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.000
You do get jacked on that shit at charge up Sam.

86
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.310
Here we go.
We're running out of him.
Especially when he was a Tivo.

87
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.130
And I don't mean this,
it takes you to a different fucking level.

88
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.850
Do those things like crackers.
I can't keep a bottle in the house.

89
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.670
It's gone and I feel bad calling the kid.
No,
no,
no.
Don't feel bad.

90
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.450
We'd love you using it.
We love it.
I feel fucking bad.

91
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.780
I got the daily packages left though.
Those are delicious too.
So

92
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.550
<v 0>for all the people that call bullshit on anything like the Alpha brain,</v>

93
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.210
just try it the way we have it set up.
It's so easy there's,
or don't try it.

94
00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:40.860
That's cool too.
But if you want to try it,

95
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.950
there's a 90 day 30 pill money back guarantee.

96
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:47.850
When you buy one of these bottles and one of these bottles of 30 pills,

97
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.140
all you have to do is say this stuff's stocks and you get your money back and I

98
00:05:52.141 --> 00:05:54.930
have to return the product.
No one's telling you anything that's bogus.

99
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.330
All we're trying to sell you is the best supplements that we can find that we

100
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.164
can sell.

101
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.770
Whether it's the best protein power or the best strength and conditioning

102
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:06.090
equipment.
It's all we're interested in doing.
We just,

103
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.880
I want the stuff that I use.
Um,

104
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.650
I'm a big proponent of kettlebells and all this other shit like battle ropes and

105
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.770
club bells.
They're awesome.
I used them all roomed on it.

106
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.700
Addicted like peanut butter.
I love shrimp.

107
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.730
Shroom tech is a quarter steps mushroom supplement that a,

108
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:25.340
it gives you more endurance.
It gives you more juice.
It's,

109
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.560
it's with the Chinese Olympic team used.

110
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.850
They found out about it when China started kicking ass and the Olympics and

111
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:34.130
track and field and you're like,
what the fuck is going on here?

112
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.890
And they found out they were taking this course [inaudible] mushroom and adding

113
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:38.390
it to their training.
Yeah.

114
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:40.760
That was when it was first discovered when he's supposed to take it.

115
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:44.350
Like before you work out.
Yeah.
Take it like an hour before you work out a,

116
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.620
use a code name.
Rogan save 10% off any an all supplements.
And like I said,

117
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:50.780
we've got a full array of everything from,

118
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.810
from health and fitness supplements to strength and conditioning equipment.

119
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.960
We even sell like blenders,
like we,
so just sell the,

120
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.090
like when I used to make Kale,

121
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.750
Kale shakes and smoothies and those Blendtec blenders,

122
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.330
you can stick an iPhone in it.
We're like,
fuck it.
We'll sell it.

123
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.880
We should tell him it's the shit.
So that's it.

124
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.910
Go to [inaudible] dot com use the code word Rogan and save yourself 10% all

125
00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:16.180
right folks,
this is the 401 this big one,
goddamn miles milestone.

126
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.760
Congratulations.
Show ideas.
Donald Trump,
Brian Redman,

127
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.530
choose music 400

128
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.140
<v 2>even.
I love Lucy and got 400 fucking</v>

129
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.153
experience.

130
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.080
I'm the episode of,
I love Lucy.

131
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.250
You can sit there for fucking two years and not watch.
I love he has a kid.

132
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:44.600
They go to Panama,
they meet Superman.
How many fucking,

133
00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:46.730
I love Lucy real quick.
Not to throw you off.

134
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:52.210
How I only take three shroom texts cause one time I took like five dogs and I

135
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:56.810
couldn't control myself.
Really.
Like I quit when I started doing the shroom tech.

136
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.990
I would go to the epileptic when I can only do 77

137
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.740
I can only do seven to nine minutes and I would start getting stressed out now

138
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:10.970
with the,
I got do 45 and that's because I get scared.
I get off,

139
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.860
I hit the bag before I get on the elliptical now for 30 so that's how much,

140
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.950
you know,
I've been working on it for fucking five months.

141
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:23.000
But the shroom tech I'd take you supposed to take them towards the body weight,

142
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.750
correct?
Yeah.
And I don't even know how to do the math on that,

143
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.890
so I just take three of them just to be safe.
But they're fucking,

144
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.030
I'm telling you man,
I like him.
Yeah,
I talked to you take five.

145
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.690
<v 0>That's crazy.
It's just a lot of B12.</v>

146
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.520
A lot of be 12 and a lot of quarter steps mushroom and you know,

147
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.090
it's nothing bad for you.
I've never had a bad experience from taking five.

148
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.560
I wouldn't advise people to take five.

149
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.010
I would say cut it off at two three I get gangster with them.

150
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.200
I found all these football players were getting gangster with it.

151
00:08:52.201 --> 00:08:55.980
They take like five Alpha brains and six room texts and I like,
fuck,
these

152
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.260
<v 3>guys are gigantic.
So I'm like,
I'll try five.
Let's see what fire was like.</v>

153
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.710
But isn't that follow you at that same role that guy told you?

154
00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:04.440
Like don't take too much of,
you know,
like boner pills or something like that?

155
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.150
Well it's,
it's really,
I would say yes,
but it's really,
it's all natural.

156
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:12.510
It's not,
it's nothing like radicals happening to your body.
It's not a stimulant.

157
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:15.600
It's not like I wouldn't worry about it.
I wouldn't take more than five.

158
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.580
I know it's happened because of this.

159
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.360
You're going to be watching cnn.com and you're going to hear about some

160
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:26.390
psychopath wandering into DC with a shotgun and then pictures of Alpha brain are

161
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:31.530
going to start flashing.
He had 700 bottles back seat of his car.

162
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.890
<v 0>Please.
He would be enlightened.
You wouldn't be going with a gun.</v>

163
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.100
He would be going with hugs.
It'd be tried to hug him and they shoot him.

164
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.980
That would get,
yeah,
that gets you killed.
Fat Woman.

165
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.420
She was suffering from postpartum and she,
uh,
was driving around.

166
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:49.730
She was on some sort of medication to travel down on the White House and Scott,

167
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.790
a gunfight with the,
with the Popo.
They wound up killing her.

168
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.460
She had a baby in her car.
I mean,
it's so crazy.

169
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.050
<v 3>Every time I see stuff like that,
I think,
man,</v>

170
00:09:59.051 --> 00:10:02.560
I wish you could do that in grand theft auto.
It's like you can't,

171
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.940
you can't drive kids around.

172
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.780
If you notice that there's no kids in grand theft auto,
not a single kid.

173
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.630
Why would you want to try a little fake kids around?
But why not?
I want to,

174
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.220
I want it to be realistic.
Drop them off at school,
drive them off cliffs.

175
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.380
<v 0>Wow.
And killed dogs in it though.
Yeah.
That's where we draw the line.</v>

176
00:10:21.381 --> 00:10:25.490
You can't have fake killing of babies because if you encourage that in any way,

177
00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:28.400
shape or form,
and then it somehow becomes a reality,

178
00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:31.790
like someone decides to make sport of killing babies cause it's a part of a

179
00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:34.280
video game,
it's going to be a real problem.

180
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.520
How fucking crazy as this is happening now,
every three weeks people,

181
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.880
it's pretty crazy.
This is,
this is not even a joke.

182
00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:44.000
No more like it's happening every three weeks and you know what?

183
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.910
It's going to happen around here at a fucking park,

184
00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.140
stupid basketball game at the fucking taco place.

185
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.800
There's a lot of issues,
a lot of issue fucking issues.

186
00:10:54.801 --> 00:10:57.790
And I'm sitting there going,
you know,
is this a set up?

187
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.820
There's somebody hanging out outside of fucking psychiatrist's office and when

188
00:11:01.821 --> 00:11:05.210
they see some fucking guy come up and give him a gun and then $20 and say what?

189
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.640
I mean,
what the fuck is going on?
I don't think that,
I don't know what the fuck.

190
00:11:09.641 --> 00:11:13.760
I think it's natural when you have this many people,

191
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.960
it was just natural to go.
No,
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying it's natural.

192
00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:21.170
When you get this many people that are on,
first of all on drugs,

193
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.530
you have a massive amount of people in this country that are on all sorts of

194
00:11:24.531 --> 00:11:26.930
drugs,
whether the,
they need them or not.

195
00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.250
Well the reality is the amount of people that are on prescription medication is

196
00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:34.670
very high.
Then you're going to have natural amounts of mental illness.

197
00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:37.940
When you have a high population,
you have higher amounts of mental illness.

198
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.670
They've shown this in rat population density studies.

199
00:11:40.671 --> 00:11:44.070
Apparently I was listening to this podcast about it.
Um,

200
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.290
I think it was psychedelic salon or Mckenna was talking,

201
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:51.140
I forget it might have been art bell either way.
Um,

202
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.070
they were talking about rat population density studies that they did

203
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.480
<v 4>the same thing with,</v>

204
00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.280
with rats where they started them small and put like a hundred rats in a,
in a,

205
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:02.530
in a room together or you know,
10 rats or whatever.

206
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.260
And they just kept ramping it up until they were on top of each other.

207
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.820
And when they're on top of each other,

208
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:09.760
they started exhibiting the same sort of mental illnesses that you see in.

209
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:11.510
People were like they stand in the corner,

210
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.890
would just shake and rock back and forth.
It couldn't handle it.
He's this,

211
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.700
you started to see all sorts of weird aberrant behavior and they think it's from

212
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:22.540
the overstimulation cause then when you get to a population density like that,

213
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.600
it's very difficult for the human body to tolerate.

214
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.990
It's very difficult for the human body to to,
to,

215
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:33.640
to deal with the sheer numbers of people that you interact with on a daily
basis.

216
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:35.800
It's almost completely unnatural for us.

217
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.120
And so the idea is that in these scenarios most of us can keep it together,

218
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.620
but there's going to be a certain amount that have mental illness and coupled

219
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:47.770
with a certain amount of extra stress that are highly populated,

220
00:12:47.771 --> 00:12:51.820
cities are providing with a certain amount of extra craziness because they're on

221
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.290
prescription medication.

222
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.920
And then just the stress of life period and all of that together being

223
00:12:56.921 --> 00:12:59.950
unemployed,
financial stuff,
boom,
powder keg.

224
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.790
<v 3>But isn't this stuff happening mostly in the United States?</v>

225
00:13:02.791 --> 00:13:07.090
And other overpopulated countries.
You don't hear about this.
It's a good point.

226
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.950
<v 4>You do about some the one in Finland where the guy murdered those kids.</v>

227
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.390
That's right.
There was the guy in Finland,

228
00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:17.040
but he's asked him filling or Iceland or Finland.
Finland,
Joel.

229
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.490
The big one was in San Diego and when the kid willing to Mcdonald's.
Yeah,

230
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.260
the kids.
That was the big one.
That's it.
That was the,

231
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.670
you heard about you went home and there was a special eye and report.

232
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.780
They were in San Diego and the guy had a shotgun and yeah,
that that was,

233
00:13:30.781 --> 00:13:35.430
you know,
now it seems like you expect it.
It's a daily occurrence now.
Well,

234
00:13:35.431 --> 00:13:37.140
some are worse than others.
It's also,

235
00:13:37.141 --> 00:13:40.140
there's a lot of people out there that feel disenfranchised and this is where a

236
00:13:40.141 --> 00:13:42.180
lot of people out there that they don't,

237
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.650
they don't feel like they can make up a dent in this world unless they do

238
00:13:46.651 --> 00:13:51.510
something really bad.
There's,
there's people out there that feel like to,

239
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.510
to get noticed and to get people to recognize them.

240
00:13:54.511 --> 00:13:56.340
They can do that if they do something really bad.

241
00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.250
<v 3>I think it's a,
I think it's a love famine.
I think people are starving for love.</v>

242
00:14:01.251 --> 00:14:05.120
People in the United States don't express love in a normal way.

243
00:14:05.121 --> 00:14:09.100
It's a really weird thing.
Like if you ever let you know like that,

244
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.830
like you might be around friends or even just talking to your brother or

245
00:14:12.831 --> 00:14:16.010
something and you have this impulse where you want to say,
I love you man.

246
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.350
I love you,
but you don't,
you don't do it.

247
00:14:18.351 --> 00:14:22.050
There's a thing that triggers in you or you feel,
I'm not going to say that.

248
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.500
I don't want to sound weak.
Right.
I,
I think that's what it is.

249
00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:29.270
I think people are just so turned around backwards,

250
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:34.390
uh,
as to the flow,
the flow of nature,
the flow of life that uh,

251
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.100
they're sort of malfunctioning because of that.

252
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.260
<v 4>Yeah.
There could be that for sure.</v>

253
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.490
There's also this weird transitionary period the human race is going into,

254
00:14:43.491 --> 00:14:47.270
as we get more and more information on a daily basis from the Internet,

255
00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.800
it's more and more obvious that the world we live is fucked.

256
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.660
It's like the system's terrible.

257
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.470
We know that we can operate is as individuals and we can be really friendly with

258
00:14:57.471 --> 00:15:00.890
each other.
You know,
we can,
the people in this room can,
we can party,

259
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:01.970
we can live together.
We can.

260
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.030
If it was just us on the planet and we were the only people that we interacted

261
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:06.260
with,
we'd have a great time.

262
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.650
So why is it then when you get massive amounts of people,

263
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.850
all of a sudden there's all this death and this all this fucking fighting and

264
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:16.610
there's all this chaos and this all this,
you know,

265
00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:20.600
lawsuits and bullshit and what,
what is it?

266
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.430
You know what it is about numbers.

267
00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.520
<v 2>Fucking Kardashians.
You know his dad,
the thing it's,</v>

268
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.240
it's a PR two people can have a life now.
Like even Dunkin,
he did own a business.

269
00:15:30.241 --> 00:15:34.560
Do you know that?
And not even talk to each other.
Yes,
you can live in your home.

270
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.470
You can live in your home.
You don't have to talk to each other.

271
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.120
I'm very insecure way behind like texting once a cure.

272
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.013
I want to hear you.

273
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.130
<v 4>Oh,
you want to know a person's voice?
Hey,
well known tech.</v>

274
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.100
And you don't want even voicemail messages either because you want to

275
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:54.710
communicate.
I'm old school because I don't want to ever lose that.
I don't know.

276
00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:00.720
I don't know how to say the word would disenfranchising ourselves from myself

277
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.220
and that some people can handle it and some people can't.
I can't handle it.

278
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:05.820
You know,

279
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:10.530
I was fucking 30 when I was 20 so I'm an old soul.

280
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.730
I like it.
I liked the contact to me,
I need to hear your voice.

281
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.340
One of the all time,
best douchebag,
acthar stories.

282
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.140
I'm at a restaurant once and this douchebag actors there and he's by himself

283
00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:22.740
eating and he's,

284
00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.570
I think he's crazy and he starts talking to a couple that's near them.

285
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.070
Like they're sitting by themselves on a date and you know,
he's fairly famous.

286
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:36.600
So he starts talking to them like,
how long have you two been together?
You know,

287
00:16:36.601 --> 00:16:39.090
and they're,
they're,
they're,
you know,
they don't know what to do,

288
00:16:39.091 --> 00:16:41.160
but they kind of recognize them.
So it's kind of weird.

289
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.340
So they kind of are stuck in this thing where they have to talk to the guy.

290
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.090
And then I'm watching this play out and he's,
he's talking to him.

291
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:52.560
He tells the woman that she's an old soul.
Jesus.

292
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.950
He told her she was at a,
you're,
you seem like an old soul.

293
00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:01.230
You really seem like an old soul.
You guys really,
I sent something with you too.

294
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.570
Like this is an amazing relationship,
isn't it?

295
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:08.630
It was so fucking strange and I was like,

296
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.810
get me out of this town.
Get me Outta here.

297
00:17:12.811 --> 00:17:16.530
You people with your fucking emotional support dogs.

298
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.730
I told you about that shit.
No restaurant bigger than me.

299
00:17:20.731 --> 00:17:23.480
Got on a plane with a French poodle.
I was cracked.
Right?

300
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:30.030
485 with a fucking French poodle guide.
I'm sorry,

301
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:35.430
just don't even get me started on that fucking issue.
La Has.

302
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.460
People have figured out that there's a work around to this.

303
00:17:38.461 --> 00:17:43.461
Americans with disabilities act and you can say that your dog provides you with

304
00:17:44.611 --> 00:17:48.570
emotional support and you can be like a regular person and you can go into a

305
00:17:48.571 --> 00:17:50.460
restaurant,
a fucking Labrador

306
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.860
<v 3>seed.
This is a thing.</v>

307
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:56.360
This is the thing I got to confess when I was with Natasha,
we would,

308
00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:01.510
we realize this trick that you can put a red vest on the dog with a little cross

309
00:18:01.701 --> 00:18:01.971
on it.

310
00:18:01.971 --> 00:18:06.770
You can order them on the Internet and legally people can't ask you what your

311
00:18:06.771 --> 00:18:09.590
disability is.
So it's like,
cause when you know,

312
00:18:09.591 --> 00:18:12.920
when you see somebody with a Chihuahua,
it might cross your mind to think,

313
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.010
how's this thing gonna help them?
If they start having a seizure,
like what's,

314
00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:18.950
what is it?
What's it really going to do is it's going to let you know he's dead.

315
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.980
Bark,
bark,
bark,
bark.
So like we,

316
00:18:21.981 --> 00:18:25.610
we started saying that we are doing that and then man got a coat.

317
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.360
I got some emails from people who are disabled and they're like,

318
00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.560
you have to understand I have to have this dog.

319
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:36.110
Like it's trained at until either guide me,

320
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.080
it's trained to like help me if I have a seizure.

321
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:44.300
And every time you assholes put one of those fake vast on a fucking dog so that

322
00:18:44.301 --> 00:18:46.550
you can go and eat in a nice restaurant with it.

323
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.390
You're making it that more much more difficult for me to do it.

324
00:18:50.391 --> 00:18:53.840
Cause people are getting increasingly suspicious and increasingly suspicious

325
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.560
where they used to not be at all.
So just leave your fucking dog at home.

326
00:18:57.561 --> 00:19:00.410
If you want to go eat pasta,
don't,
don't gum up the gear.

327
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.290
Don't get in the way of people are actually fucking sick.

328
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.500
Yeah cause there aren't.
You can't.
I was one of those cons

329
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.350
in Columbus,
Ohio.
Christina business gain.

330
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.250
Tom's a girl brought their dog using the same thing.

331
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.520
<v 5>See that shit is so ridiculous.</v>

332
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.590
People with dogs think that just because they love their dogs.
That dirty,
stinky,

333
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.820
open asked animal.
It is not.
Yes it is.

334
00:19:25.821 --> 00:19:28.820
They're rubbing their little asses on chairs and those,

335
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.750
that ass on the chair could have worms in it and the microscopic worms could get

336
00:19:32.751 --> 00:19:37.490
in my hand and I could get worms.
That's real.
It's a dog man.

337
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.660
It's a fucking dog.

338
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.020
It's creepy enough that people drop silverware on the floor and pick it up and

339
00:19:42.021 --> 00:19:45.110
still use it.
Yes.
Like you're going to wipe off with a Napkin.

340
00:19:45.111 --> 00:19:49.100
All the fucking shit eggs that are stuck to the bottom of your shit,
dog.
Shit.

341
00:19:49.101 --> 00:19:53.840
Eggs are clean,
dude.
I love dogs.
You know I do.

342
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.400
I've always had dogs,

343
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.220
but bring dogs to restaurant is a massive douchebag move.

344
00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.780
But on a fucking plane or up just as bad on the plane when I was sitting next to

345
00:20:02.781 --> 00:20:05.420
somebody with a fucking dog.
Listen,
I love animals too,

346
00:20:05.421 --> 00:20:07.970
but I don't expect somebody else like them.
I'm old school.

347
00:20:07.971 --> 00:20:08.870
You want to listen to music?

348
00:20:08.871 --> 00:20:11.890
What you fucking me your phones on and I'll put mine in that.
Yeah.

349
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.300
I hope to hear each other's shit.
You might like something different.

350
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.500
So I'm the same way.

351
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:20.480
I feel like if I was to walk into somebody's space with a dog,

352
00:20:20.481 --> 00:20:24.730
they didn't even know I'd be fucking feeling weird.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,

353
00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:29.120
that's just how it was built up.
Like I'm taking,
I'm wasting your fucking time.

354
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.610
And there's people who think they could do that shit on.
Fine.

355
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.730
I know and guide you from emotional support,
but those as a pot Brownie,

356
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.620
you didn't move on a little half of a pop brown.
He going to a restaurant,

357
00:20:39.621 --> 00:20:42.830
you're okay,
you can leave the fucking dog in the car with the air on.

358
00:20:42.831 --> 00:20:46.850
And you know,
some people can't leave the dog anywhere.
They,
them

359
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.710
<v 2>my cats.
I worry about earthquakes.</v>

360
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:54.490
<v 3>[inaudible] gotta if people ate pot brownies,</v>

361
00:20:54.491 --> 00:20:57.460
like you eat pot brownies and went into restaurants,

362
00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.170
they would need emotional stuff.

363
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.490
<v 2>No,
no,
no.
I'm talking about,</v>

364
00:21:01.491 --> 00:21:04.520
I've had conversations with people that do not smoke marijuana.

365
00:21:04.521 --> 00:21:09.150
Then I pilot the brownies and they've given up the little pieces of brownies.

366
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.370
They'll buy like a hundred milligram Brownie on Monday at divine wellness and it

367
00:21:13.371 --> 00:21:16.880
lasts them for days and they drive to Warner brothers and they communicate with

368
00:21:16.881 --> 00:21:21.140
people and they threw away their fucking bills.
Wow.
Okay.

369
00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.240
I know.
What pills were they on?

370
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:26.300
You know the shit that they give you when you go to the doctor and tell him that

371
00:21:26.301 --> 00:21:29.610
you hear voices,
but whatever the fuck they give you,
whatever they give you,

372
00:21:29.611 --> 00:21:31.910
Jo Adderall,
uh,

373
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:36.570
<v 4>you know,
I can give you ad or off.
So I'm so,
so sorry guys.
I don't know.</v>

374
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.320
It's not my winner.
What you're saying though,

375
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.440
you know that that's how I meant it.
I didn't mean it was real.
In a funny way.

376
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:47.150
It's a real tricky to decide what medication is right for anybody.

377
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:48.490
You know.
I think it's real tricky.

378
00:21:48.491 --> 00:21:52.520
They tried to figure out how another person's mind works and that seems to be

379
00:21:52.521 --> 00:21:54.950
the issue that they have when they're prescribing those medications in the first

380
00:21:54.951 --> 00:21:56.910
place.
Like what our friend was on it.

381
00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:00.460
I think one of the things that came up was that they had a constantly changes

382
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.710
dose.
Absolutely have them different stuff and they,

383
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.320
they will like try this telling me how you feel on this.
Like it's that simple.

384
00:22:06.321 --> 00:22:10.280
I did give you stuff to try and you're like,
wow,
I guess I feel good.
Okay.

385
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.320
It was that you think that's a good dose and you're like,
well,

386
00:22:12.321 --> 00:22:15.950
I feel pretty good.
You know,
everything seems pretty good today.
Yeah.
Like,
okay,

387
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.300
all right,
we're going to keep you at that dose.

388
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.060
And when they start doing shit like that,
it's like,
it's very,

389
00:22:20.061 --> 00:22:22.310
it becomes very subjective.
Like what works?

390
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.850
Why does this one work really good on you?
And that one work really good on him.

391
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:30.890
I was on Zoloft and I was in college while you on it?
I got depressed.
Wow.

392
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.240
What was God get you depressed?

393
00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.930
<v 3>That's,
you know,
I don't know.</v>

394
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.400
I'm not really sure that I like completely figured it out.
But um,

395
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:42.800
I dunno.
How long were you on it for?

396
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:47.890
I was on it for probably six months and I couldn't come.

397
00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.490
Like I,
it made it so that I couldn't come anymore.
Like I could,
I could get it,

398
00:22:52.491 --> 00:22:56.010
I could get it,
get it up,
but I couldn't ejaculate.
Awesome.

399
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.380
Couldn't have any orgasms.
It's Brian's favorite new drugs.

400
00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.770
I know what's it's called.

401
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.790
<v 4>So also really bad for your brain.
No Dude.
Especially if you're not supposed to.</v>

402
00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:08.860
<v 3>Well,
it was,
you know what it did,
what it did was it,
it did produce this,
uh,</v>

403
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.750
feeling the I now associate with when I'm being really healthy,

404
00:23:13.751 --> 00:23:17.770
like when I'm meditating a lot or exercising regularly,

405
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.500
eating right or I want to get all my ducks in a row.

406
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:25.690
This nice clear tranquility will generally come over things that I'm not,

407
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.770
my mind isn't reactive when any weird shitty thing happens.

408
00:23:29.771 --> 00:23:32.320
It's like you just are sort of at this nice tranquil level.

409
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:37.530
It kind of kind of reproduce that at the cost of not being able to have orgasms.

410
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.440
And then,
um,

411
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.660
I just stopped taking it and went out in the woods because I was working in the

412
00:23:43.661 --> 00:23:44.510
summer camp.
We're not in there

413
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.530
<v 1>shot load like a donkey with a cattle prod up his ass</v>

414
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:54.080
first time coming after.
How long?

415
00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.570
<v 3>God,
I don't know man.
It was a,
it was a while.
I mean,
I could,</v>

416
00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.990
it's not like I couldn't come.
It's just like,
it took forever.

417
00:24:00.991 --> 00:24:05.220
Like if you've ever taken a narcotic and tried to jerk off,
it's like that.

418
00:24:05.221 --> 00:24:08.220
It's like it just doesn't happen.
It's like that.
So,

419
00:24:08.221 --> 00:24:13.221
but you can do it if you really apply yourself and work really hard and why you

420
00:24:13.261 --> 00:24:14.580
can like squeeze some juice

421
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.750
<v 1>after it's over.
Does it feel like you've accomplished something?</v>

422
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:21.320
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
It feels like you put your cock and a pencil sharpener.</v>

423
00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.780
You been jerking off for an hour straight.

424
00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.850
<v 1>I've had twice at two points in my life.</v>

425
00:24:29.851 --> 00:24:32.010
I have jerked off to the point where I had a blister on my deck.

426
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.570
Oh is it an actual like a blister?
Yeah.

427
00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.230
No and like you're like a red spot where I like the more through the skin.

428
00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:43.920
I one of those twice to dry.
Jacqueline.
Yes.

429
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.610
On two separate occasions in my life I did that.
That's how stupid I am.

430
00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:52.200
I the one time beat half time position hijacking a when you're young,

431
00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.330
especially when you're young and single,

432
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.760
especially if you're trying to stay single,

433
00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.610
like you're trying to be focused in your career.
It was when I was very young.

434
00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.110
When you're trying to be focused on your career,

435
00:25:01.111 --> 00:25:05.160
the last thing you want to do is be thinking about sex.
And just for me,

436
00:25:05.161 --> 00:25:08.000
my solution was just beat off on the reg and then it was,

437
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.930
and then it becomes an addiction.
Really?

438
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:14.550
<v 3>Yeah.
Should be in the constitution where before politicians make big decisions,</v>

439
00:25:14.551 --> 00:25:18.130
they have to masturbate.
I bet this,

440
00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.370
I bet the shutdown wouldn't happen.
Yeah.

441
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.860
Baner and Obama had to jerk off before they decided to do whatever they're going

442
00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:25.320
to do.

443
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.050
<v 2>There would definitely be less tense or is this still shut down?</v>

444
00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:32.250
It's still shut down.
Yeah,
I got it.
But I don't understand.
You hate emails.

445
00:25:32.251 --> 00:25:35.610
The other day when I went out the end at the workout and on the way home it was

446
00:25:35.611 --> 00:25:39.330
20 to 10 and I saw the Wheatstone like,
oh,
let me go in there.

447
00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:44.340
And on the way home it dawned on me that it's 20 to 10 and the weed store is

448
00:25:44.341 --> 00:25:48.680
still open below I,
the way I word it was the government shutdown and the weeds,

449
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:52.650
doors we store is still open and will be for the next two hours.

450
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.480
Fucking,
I got hate mail slot you,
you fat.
Fuck.
Why is that bad?

451
00:25:57.481 --> 00:25:59.190
Why would you get a hit?
People were like,

452
00:25:59.191 --> 00:26:02.010
you don't have to stay on what's going on with the government.
This is bad.

453
00:26:02.011 --> 00:26:05.160
This is all because of old guys.
It's a fucking tweaked.

454
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.610
Give him saying what's wrong with you?
This is why it shut down.

455
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.460
<v 1>Yeah.
Don't get mad at Joey Diaz for stating the obvious.</v>

456
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.610
<v 2>Can you believe that I have a you.</v>

457
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:20.630
Cause every time there's a stupid article or something on Twitter and on the

458
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.550
media,
we get fucking Twitter from people across the country like haters.
Hey man,

459
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.440
they're going to shut the fuck and stores down.

460
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.910
What are you going to do then no more.

461
00:26:28.911 --> 00:26:32.960
And all of a sudden these fucking stores of still rocking and rolling.

462
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.030
Denver's rocking and rolling.

463
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.300
I was in Portland last week and those motherfuckers don't know what it is.

464
00:26:38.301 --> 00:26:41.870
Not the smoking.
You know those fuckers savages up there.

465
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.610
They walk around with pat trees and shit and knapsacks and yeah,

466
00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.730
I mean that's it.
They didn't have no idea.

467
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:51.140
So all of a sudden the government shut down because they got no [inaudible],

468
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:54.570
but these fucking state,
it's got so much gayness and taxes.

469
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:57.450
I think California is broke,
but at least that generating,

470
00:26:57.451 --> 00:27:00.270
let's look up the fucking numbers.
People,
what's done in the generating,

471
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.670
what's the Denver?
Did you see that 60 minute show

472
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.760
<v 4>be?
It literally is going to turn the economy around.
This is completely clink,</v>

473
00:27:08.761 --> 00:27:12.610
clink,
clink,
clank,
clank,
clank,
clank,
and these dummies,
these,
by the way,

474
00:27:12.611 --> 00:27:14.490
who are the same dummies who are anti drugs.

475
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:19.080
It's almost like secretly they want drugs to be legal and the only way they can

476
00:27:19.081 --> 00:27:22.590
go about it is to have the government completely collapsed so they can't

477
00:27:22.591 --> 00:27:25.200
regulate them anymore.
And then the drugs will take over in the drugs.

478
00:27:25.201 --> 00:27:28.440
We'll let them understand how they fucked up the entire country with their

479
00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:32.350
country egos and then they can then they can apologize with.

480
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:36.450
It's almost like the only thing that can save them at this point is pot at all.

481
00:27:36.451 --> 00:27:38.130
The ones that are dangerous at all.

482
00:27:38.131 --> 00:27:40.770
The ones that you want an instant change in the economy.

483
00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.630
Of course it's not gonna be under corporate control.

484
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.290
You've got to realize that you ready for that because it's going to be under

485
00:27:46.291 --> 00:27:48.840
control.
But anybody who wants to grow pot,
that's the problem.

486
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:51.510
If you make it legal,
how,
how legal is it going to be?

487
00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:54.630
He's going to be legal to grow like a tomato.
Like I have tomatoes in my yard.

488
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.200
Is it going to be okay if I grew up on in my yard?
Because if that's the case,

489
00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:02.160
it's pretty easy to do man.
Good luck.
We're off to the races.

490
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:03.870
The hold co economy's going to change.

491
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.330
Why isn't there a time when we'd was totally illegal,

492
00:28:06.331 --> 00:28:10.290
totally illegal and no one even thought about it for the 1930s and no one even,

493
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.100
it wasn't even a thing.
Like if he,
it was just something else.
You smoked.

494
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:18.230
It was so common and so normal and so used as a textile and a commodity.

495
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:24.360
Like it was so important to the making of clothes and for all sorts of different

496
00:28:24.361 --> 00:28:26.640
things that they had before they came out with,
um,

497
00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.120
the decorticator when they came out with the decorticator,

498
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.590
it led them to be able to process this shit really fucking easy.

499
00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:38.640
And all the difficulties that they had with processing in the past was gone.

500
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:42.660
One machine completely figured out how to take this hemp and turn it into,

501
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.500
instantly turned it into what you could use for paper building materials.

502
00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:50.730
Henry Ford made his first fucking car.
He had the fenders made out of hemp.
It's,

503
00:28:50.731 --> 00:28:52.530
um,
it's an amazing plant.

504
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.190
It's one of the most durable fucking plants that's ever existed.

505
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.820
It's lightweight.
It's really weird.
It's not like any other plan.

506
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:04.560
So the idea of making that illegal was so ridiculous because they had to make

507
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:08.010
the name marijuana.
What they did was Harry,

508
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.130
Harry Anslinger and William Randolph Hearst and Hearst control all these

509
00:29:11.131 --> 00:29:15.600
newspapers.
We also control all this paper.
He controlled all these like he made,

510
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:19.680
he had forests and these forest would chop down this wood and use it to make

511
00:29:19.681 --> 00:29:21.840
paper.
He was going to have to convert all that to hemp.

512
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.810
Like popular science was saying Hampton new billion dollar crop.

513
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:29.160
Like they got it in because of the,
the actual,

514
00:29:29.161 --> 00:29:33.240
the applications for like clothing and nylon and fuel.

515
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.000
That's how they got it.
They got it in as a commodity.

516
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.750
They essentially banned and incredible natural commodity.

517
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:43.900
One of the greatest ones ever so that they can have nylon for like ropes and

518
00:29:43.901 --> 00:29:47.950
shit like that.
So that Wa Hearst didn't have to transfer his a,

519
00:29:47.951 --> 00:29:52.330
his mills over to hemp paper.
Like there's a bunch of weird economic reasons.

520
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.550
It just stuck so good.

521
00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:00.070
The 1930s it's still stuck.
Like we're running around with the fucking Internet,

522
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.160
with cold Syrup and alcohol and fucking antidepressants and everything else.

523
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.570
And to this day,

524
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:12.870
one of the best plants that's ever existed on this planet for people is illegal.

525
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:18.010
Illegal.
I mean if there's no,
you don't need any more proof than that,

526
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:19.540
that we're fucking retarded.

527
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.630
Like you want to talk about backwards assed civilization.

528
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:25.660
They've got the best plant ever illegal,

529
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.530
then nothing else can fuck with it.
There's nothing else you can eat.

530
00:30:29.531 --> 00:30:33.430
Make houses with make clothes with and that mother illegal,

531
00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.440
<v 3>it's going to be interested in seeing that population growth for the places that</v>

532
00:30:36.441 --> 00:30:40.340
are legal now and seeing if there,
if there's a growth in like music and arts.

533
00:30:40.341 --> 00:30:43.400
Like if it's become like Portland becomes the new Seattle and like just two

534
00:30:43.401 --> 00:30:44.234
years,

535
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:48.120
<v 4>it's illegal in Portland.
It is illegal.
It's illegal in Portland.</v>

536
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.620
Portland didn't close or no.
Well you can have,
I,
you're gonna have medical dig.

537
00:30:52.621 --> 00:30:56.070
Dame didn't make it legal statewide.
They only made it legal statewide.

538
00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:58.730
First was Colorado.
Second was,
uh,

539
00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:02.460
shortly after it was Washington state and those are the only two right now that

540
00:31:02.461 --> 00:31:04.020
it's actually illegal in the state.

541
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:08.430
But we knew the Denver had passed a city law way back in the day when they said

542
00:31:08.431 --> 00:31:10.080
weed was legal.
They who said there,

543
00:31:10.081 --> 00:31:12.690
we're not going to arrest you don't smoke it in public.
The cops,

544
00:31:12.691 --> 00:31:15.170
like they openly stated they weren't going to do this.
We were saying,

545
00:31:15.171 --> 00:31:17.330
we used to talk about that on stage back when would you,

546
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.100
when the comedy works in the early two thousands

547
00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:25.850
<v 3>yeah.
It's very strange.
It's a really strange,
a strange phenomenon.</v>

548
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:30.680
And if you look at it not just from the economic perspective of why people

549
00:31:30.681 --> 00:31:34.640
economically might want to ban it,
but also from the uh,

550
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:39.770
Carla consciousness level because of the state that induces is one of deep

551
00:31:39.771 --> 00:31:44.720
introspection.
And if you consider a capitalism

552
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.420
<v 6>okay</v>

553
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:50.050
<v 3>and the effects of it,
like what you just said and you really explore like,
shit,</v>

554
00:31:50.051 --> 00:31:52.810
do I want to be a,
do I want to be,

555
00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:57.640
do I want to subscribe to this system that has actually thrown people in jail

556
00:31:57.641 --> 00:32:02.140
for growing a thing that used to be like one of the number one substances used?

557
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.140
That's the kind of thoughts that come to your mind when you're high along with a

558
00:32:05.141 --> 00:32:07.690
lot of other stuff.
Like,
man,
I think I'm a fucking asshole.

559
00:32:07.691 --> 00:32:10.590
Did I really just say that to whoever I said that too?

560
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.460
Like I think I'm a fucking asshole.

561
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.760
And the more you start like thinking about stuff like that,
that I,

562
00:32:15.761 --> 00:32:18.160
that produces the paranoid trip everyone's so afraid of,

563
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:22.630
but if you take that deeper than what you realize it's happening is the plant is

564
00:32:22.631 --> 00:32:27.460
healing your consciousness and it's identifying aspects of yourself that need to

565
00:32:27.461 --> 00:32:28.930
be worked on.
That's what the effect is.

566
00:32:28.931 --> 00:32:32.560
And also if you get super stoned and just getting to a messy room,

567
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.170
you'll start organizing the fucking room.

568
00:32:35.171 --> 00:32:40.171
Generally you'll start cleaning and scrubbing because you're what it's doing to

569
00:32:40.281 --> 00:32:41.330
you on the inside,

570
00:32:41.331 --> 00:32:46.100
which is organizing all these disparate aspects of your personality and forcing

571
00:32:46.101 --> 00:32:48.980
you to at least acknowledge it if not work on it.

572
00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:53.981
And does that kind of balancing agent work with a society based on denial and as

573
00:32:54.881 --> 00:32:59.240
a society based on ignoring the fact that the whole thing functions by

574
00:32:59.241 --> 00:33:02.390
evaporating human beings and stealing their land.

575
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:07.600
Do you really want a drug that produces that level of understanding in the

576
00:33:08.571 --> 00:33:10.190
bloodstream of the population?

577
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.430
<v 5>Well you do just,
you don't,</v>

578
00:33:12.431 --> 00:33:14.860
if you're the one at the helm of the fucking meat machine,

579
00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.250
if you're the one that's pushing the blades across the land and slashing

580
00:33:18.251 --> 00:33:21.190
everything in front of it,
then you don't.
But if you're everybody else,

581
00:33:21.191 --> 00:33:25.680
of course you do.
Of course you do.
Right?
We're,
we're all better off.
Hi.
It's,

582
00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.550
I've never really known what it is to sit on the couch.
You know,

583
00:33:30.551 --> 00:33:34.510
I don't play games.
No,
I don't play video video games.
I know.
I don't even know.

584
00:33:34.511 --> 00:33:37.700
Play a little pool.
Joey.
Deescalate,
play some pool.
I grew up in a fucking blob.

585
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:43.530
Straight shoot stays the weirdest thing in the mall that we'd always kicked my

586
00:33:44.171 --> 00:33:48.280
ass.
Like it always fucking beat the fuck out of me.

587
00:33:48.281 --> 00:33:50.590
Like when I smoked it in the morning,
like eight in the morning,

588
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:53.950
it would pattern my day for me.
Like first off,
you're not going to sit here.

589
00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.950
Right?
You gotta get the fuck out of the house.
Right.
Okay.

590
00:33:56.951 --> 00:34:00.100
So it made me go out and get like a,
I always love listening to music.

591
00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.450
So I used to get those anytime since 1980 I've always had something around my

592
00:34:04.451 --> 00:34:08.260
ears,
whether it was the big disk,
I never had the big ghetto blaster,

593
00:34:08.261 --> 00:34:12.280
but I had the desert desk and then it's got shorter click cassette and then it

594
00:34:12.281 --> 00:34:16.180
became an iPod.
I don't even know the evolution.
I even had the power booster,

595
00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.240
but I bought on [inaudible] New York electronic.
Oh,
you know,

596
00:34:19.241 --> 00:34:20.140
you could buy anything.

597
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:24.970
I used to buy Sony used to make an amp that you plugged into the Walkman and you

598
00:34:24.971 --> 00:34:27.310
plugged your speakers into the fucking amp.

599
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.260
Well that's how much of a savage I was.

600
00:34:29.261 --> 00:34:31.930
I wanted it because when you're going to New York City,

601
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.860
there wasn't those ear buds denim with speakers,
you know?
Yeah.

602
00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:38.390
But I wanted it loud and I'm pleased to go around with ghetto blasters.

603
00:34:38.391 --> 00:34:42.430
You remember that?
He is at the whole neighborhood,
their own music,

604
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.490
but hip hop a habit to the heaven.

605
00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:49.190
They would like walk down the street like holding on a giant ratio,

606
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:54.230
boom box that it's gotta be one of the Weird radiations loud stereo that you

607
00:34:56.231 --> 00:34:59.490
carry with you and do to bring them everywhere.
Do you remember that?

608
00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:02.020
But let me explain something to you.
Think of the dudes who did it.

609
00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:06.340
It was the same dude.
Sudei whoever.
Pit Bull.
Hmm.
You're right.

610
00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:07.390
The people who had that.

611
00:35:07.391 --> 00:35:11.800
What people who fucking look kind of scary like what they walk in with the don't

612
00:35:11.801 --> 00:35:16.720
look me cause I'm close.
They'll walk into the fucking house with it.
Blasted.

613
00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:16.960
Well,

614
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.040
in some ways it makes life a little bit simpler because you're walking around

615
00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:25.960
with a soundtrack.
You know I had one,
I had a small one.
I remember this.
Yeah.

616
00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:31.120
That's what they used to carry.
That's insane.
Look at that thing,
man.

617
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.260
That looks like something we would plug into the matrix.
This show.
Yeah.

618
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.040
That looks like the podcast equipment.
He's

619
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.880
<v 2>got like sliding scales on that thing.
Look at that.
You're turning on him.</v>

620
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.580
Huey Lewis and the news full blast.
It sipped a base band.

621
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.110
I think that guy,
no,

622
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.250
he's probably listening.

623
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:57.990
Nobody ever took it from Kool g rap and get mugged on their fucking stereo.

624
00:35:58.161 --> 00:36:02.610
Like dog does a help.
Please help us find it.
I'm sure someone must have Joey.

625
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.310
People steal everything.
Yeah,

626
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:10.800
I saw that on fucking believable.
Joey's on the far right.

627
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:15.870
That's insane.
We were so cute.
Sexy,

628
00:36:15.871 --> 00:36:18.900
lucky seven.
Can you get it?
So just as whole body feels.

629
00:36:18.901 --> 00:36:22.070
The scroll was 44 I was 44 there was Logan lucky seven.

630
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:29.010
Wow.
That's so crazy.
Wow.
Look at you dude.

631
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.600
So how old are you in this picture?

632
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:36.120
1414 God damn Joe.
You cute.
You're cute as a button.

633
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.750
Look at David Ruiz.
Turn around and talking to the microphone.
Can hear this too.

634
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.610
That kid right Joey top on this screen to that kid with the Afro was a very

635
00:36:44.611 --> 00:36:46.650
interesting story.
This guy right here,
because we were,

636
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:48.870
we were horrible basketball team at Mckinley.

637
00:36:48.871 --> 00:36:52.800
Can you go full screen when he moved in the neighborhood,
does it do,

638
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:53.761
he could jump.

639
00:36:53.761 --> 00:36:57.930
He was five foot eight but this kid could fucking jump like Julia survey.

640
00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:00.420
So he was Dominican.
His name was Louis Hernandez.

641
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.340
I'm from Jersey and just playing that,

642
00:37:02.341 --> 00:37:05.400
they just cut it short and called him Louie and Nigga.
They said,
fuck it.

643
00:37:05.401 --> 00:37:07.920
We don't care if he's Dominican.
We're not gonna even think about that.

644
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.890
We're just going to,

645
00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:13.160
this is David rule as they call them that to his face to lake Louise and nick.

646
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:17.430
Did he get pissed?
Fuck you bitch.
And he was a tough kid.

647
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:18.990
He get mad at you when you come to was like he,

648
00:37:18.991 --> 00:37:20.700
I think he bit slap two or three people.

649
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:26.310
He did was we used to do acid when we first started smoking weed in the eighth

650
00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:27.060
grade,

651
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:31.080
we go behind the soccer field and north Bergen and he let us blow smoke into his

652
00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:36.081
afro and see the smoke come out of the [inaudible].

653
00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.620
This was the crew.
So I knew all these motherfuckers scroll down to,
all right,

654
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:46.650
this kid has no,
that kid dad was David Black.

655
00:37:46.651 --> 00:37:50.130
We graduated together and I knew him after the fact that one night he came into

656
00:37:50.131 --> 00:37:52.950
Joan married,
it's like dog,
you gotta call you gotta give me a ride.

657
00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.590
If he give me a ride,
I'll give you a rock guy.
We gave him a ride.

658
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.750
He gets out of the corner of New York.

659
00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:02.040
My three minutes later he comes running back bleeding with his head pulled.
I go,

660
00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:05.250
what happened was I went in to rob my sister.
I mean he was serious.

661
00:38:05.251 --> 00:38:08.640
He had coke rocks,
but everybody chunk of his fucking hat.

662
00:38:08.641 --> 00:38:12.480
She caught him on the way out as he was pulling out of the window and she just

663
00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:16.410
took,
he was bleeding.
He robbed
Terrigal

664
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:21.960
cocaine was
dog at three in the morning.

665
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.400
You asked me for a ride.

666
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.490
I got to do what I gotta do you know what I was thinking?
How crazy.

667
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:30.840
That's fucking crazy show.
I wish you could do your own.
Stand by me.

668
00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:36.970
Oh
my fucking God.
This is who is this?

669
00:38:36.971 --> 00:38:40.780
Why is this head so small?
When I got this picture,
I know which one.

670
00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:41.590
The Filipino kid.

671
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.480
Now this guy in the left that kids like a zillion and now his family owns a tow

672
00:38:46.481 --> 00:38:49.030
truck company in northern New Jersey and New York City.

673
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.810
If you get told his family is the one that owns it.

674
00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:01.210
I swear to God,
I believe.
Yeah.
This is fucking crazy shit.
I believe.
Yeah,

675
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.500
it's fucking crazy,
man.

676
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.860
Somebody sent me this yesterday while I was eating.
Wow.

677
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:08.890
And I almost had a fucking heart attack.

678
00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:13.310
I found looking through yearbooks and that's when I was in,
no,

679
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.870
I was smoking dope then.
I was no innocent that I was smoking dope.

680
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.310
I was finger bang and people like I said,

681
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:25.240
you can still be innocent and fingers,
just me and my mom at the house.
She,
Hey,

682
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:27.400
I was okay.
I was okay.
I was going crazy.

683
00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:30.970
Then I smoked my first refer when I was 15.

684
00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:36.630
<v 4>I ganged it from my dad and uh,
I had no idea how strong it was.</v>

685
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:41.850
And we rolled a joint and me and my friend Josh and this girl that I was dating,

686
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:46.710
we smoke this shit and we smoked way too much for 15 year olds,

687
00:39:46.711 --> 00:39:47.544
whatever we were.

688
00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:53.810
And we wound up waking up in various parts of the house like blank,

689
00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:57.420
like blink.
It's never happened to me before,
but like blank,

690
00:39:57.421 --> 00:39:59.340
all of a sudden I'd be on the couch,
blink,

691
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:02.550
all of a sudden I'd be in front of the frigerator like blink all the time in

692
00:40:02.551 --> 00:40:04.080
between the blanks missing,

693
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:09.840
just arriving places like waking up in a bedroom with short term memory,

694
00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.390
not just no short term memory.

695
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.690
It's like my tape gets cut like the,
the,

696
00:40:15.691 --> 00:40:19.380
the events between those two did not exist.
I get so high,

697
00:40:19.381 --> 00:40:23.370
I had zero memory so I would,
what I would think it was,
it was,

698
00:40:23.371 --> 00:40:25.440
I got so high that I would say,
you know what,

699
00:40:25.441 --> 00:40:28.750
I need to just get into the kitchen and maybe get something to eat and maybe

700
00:40:28.751 --> 00:40:29.584
it'll calm this down.

701
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:34.610
So my brain spools up that it's got to figure out to remember to get to the

702
00:40:35.071 --> 00:40:38.970
kitchen to eat.
Cause I'm that high.
And then in between,
during the walking,

703
00:40:38.971 --> 00:40:41.010
I forget everything.
So then boom,

704
00:40:41.011 --> 00:40:42.960
all of a sudden I wake up and I'm in front of the fridge ready to go,

705
00:40:42.961 --> 00:40:43.860
what the fuck.

706
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.610
And she was doing it to my girlfriend at the time and my friend was doing it.

707
00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:50.850
My friend Josh was doing it too.
We were all fucking,
it was,

708
00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:53.460
it scared me off a weed for a long time.

709
00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:55.980
Scared me off of weed for a long time.

710
00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:58.680
I didn't smoke weed again for several years.
After that.

711
00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:01.300
The first time you get high,
you really don't get that design.

712
00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:05.730
It's the second or third time and then you like you're outside.

713
00:41:05.731 --> 00:41:08.580
You really start to understand that you ended up at a bowling alley by the

714
00:41:08.581 --> 00:41:11.580
chocolate milk.
That's why I went and ate.

715
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:14.040
We had French fries and chocolate milk.

716
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:17.840
Have you ever had that happen where you felt like you woke up and replaces the

717
00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:21.870
third?
I remember the first two or three years I just smoked,
you know,

718
00:41:21.871 --> 00:41:25.050
like don't get it.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Nothing.
My Mom's leaving.

719
00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.560
Perfect.
I'm going to call.
Joe will come home with some weed on it home,
Bro.

720
00:41:28.561 --> 00:41:30.780
My brother found that last time.
He's going to rat me out.
Oh,

721
00:41:30.781 --> 00:41:33.950
I fucking will smoke a new yard and we'll going and listen to pink Floyd the

722
00:41:33.951 --> 00:41:34.220
wall.

723
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.440
<v 2>I mean that's not,
even though the wall wasn't even out yet,</v>

724
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:39.380
we listened to the Beatles sergeant pepper,
like that's it.

725
00:41:39.381 --> 00:41:43.370
Like we get together and roll a joint.
In those days.
I used to have a glass,

726
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:44.930
you went to East West,

727
00:41:44.931 --> 00:41:49.280
his headshot and there was a tube and the head was like a flute with this open,

728
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:53.300
but it had a hole and you put the joint in there and you put your finger at the

729
00:41:53.301 --> 00:41:53.750
end.

730
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:57.740
Joe Laid it and you'd like to join and I'd suck it in and I'd hold it back and

731
00:41:57.741 --> 00:42:01.040
then it was like,
that's it.
That was your carburetor.
When you smoke one of those,

732
00:42:01.041 --> 00:42:02.790
you got disarmed,
you address it.

733
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.660
And then we'd sit around and we'd all have money,
you know,

734
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:07.910
like what do you want to do?
How much you got to a quarter,
what do you got?

735
00:42:07.911 --> 00:42:10.160
Three daughters,
I got four.
Let's go to the next.

736
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:14.060
And you walk to the pizza place member and you know,
you just talked stupidity.

737
00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.200
You.
Can you look at each other?
Do I look,

738
00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:21.250
I know you think Nicco say I'm high now.
He's on my,
come on by look.
I know,

739
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.440
but if I seen it was a fucking,
it was tremendous.

740
00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:28.130
They gotta get in the House and walk past your mother and I was sounding like

741
00:42:28.131 --> 00:42:31.940
your mother decided to make cookies so I had to look and talk to her or
whatever.

742
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.460
That's why you smoke pot dog,

743
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:38.810
because it brought something different to your life at 13 it made you feel

744
00:42:38.811 --> 00:42:42.440
fucking alive.
How cool was it?
Like I always want to do right now,

745
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.491
forget about anything.

746
00:42:43.491 --> 00:42:48.491
I would love to get 60 people and chairs and couches and just fucking come out

747
00:42:49.621 --> 00:42:53.150
onstage and give everybody a joint and the table in the middle with joints and

748
00:42:53.151 --> 00:42:56.120
just do time to all those joints of gun.
Well,

749
00:42:56.121 --> 00:42:58.790
you know there's a couple of places.
That's it.
That's it.

750
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:01.140
They're going to start having those in Denver any day.

751
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:04.790
The only problem is it's against health code to be able to be smoking in a

752
00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:05.391
public place.

753
00:43:05.391 --> 00:43:08.990
We just want to crack jokes dog and bring it back to when you were 14 and you

754
00:43:08.991 --> 00:43:13.190
all sat around and listened to his or something might said or that one arm with

755
00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:16.640
the,
with the White House,
you know,
we had great outcomes and I was growing up,

756
00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.170
bicentennial,
nigger,

757
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.860
all those times were brilliant and you'd sit around and with six of your buddies

758
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.220
and listen to George Carlin or Red Fox.
Come on.
You know,

759
00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:29.720
that's what toilets,
that's what hooked us.
That was it.

760
00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.500
Just that feeling of listen to this with this motherfucker's saying,

761
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:37.580
listen to his language.
We don't know anybody who talks like that.

762
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.490
Even George Carlin,
he was so fucking head.

763
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.900
I'm still listening to Lenny Bruce and like being like eight and like turning it

764
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:48.050
off,
like fucking hyping the goal.
That's what was the first time stand up.

765
00:43:48.051 --> 00:43:52.040
You got to expose to Richard Pryor.
That Nigga is crazy.
Why?

766
00:43:52.041 --> 00:43:57.041
No meat to Dracula pushed me over the fucking top rule and crying like,

767
00:43:57.591 --> 00:43:58.910
Mommy,
I got to tell you this joke.

768
00:43:58.911 --> 00:44:00.890
And then putting it on and going back and tell him,

769
00:44:00.891 --> 00:44:04.670
and y'all don't admit the curses you,
I don't meant the curses.

770
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.900
And then you learned,
you know,
and all that age,

771
00:44:08.901 --> 00:44:13.230
I wasn't into fucking the black dude.
Everybody supposed to like,

772
00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:17.430
no,
I was a George Carlin,
Richard Pryor,
man.

773
00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:22.100
Maybe it was later.
It was bill Cosby.
Cosby for me was the first.

774
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:26.150
That was my first had an album and it was um,

775
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:31.410
it was Noah having a conversation with God.
You ever hear that?

776
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.050
No one

777
00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:35.250
<v 4>arc,
no having a conversation with God.
I vaguely remember it.</v>

778
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.160
It's fucking great man.
I mean,
it's great.

779
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.900
He's a totally different style than any of us and I,

780
00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:45.870
I don't think he's right in when he,
like,
he,

781
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:49.440
he gets mad at people for using certain language and yeah.
You know,

782
00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:53.280
like there was a,
Wanda Sykes interviewed him once and uh,

783
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:56.640
he like criticized her language,
like how she,
you know,

784
00:44:56.641 --> 00:45:01.320
phrase the question to him.
I'm like,
come on man.
But as a,
as a comedian,

785
00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:06.040
like the dude's top notch,
he's all timely conservatives.
Very,

786
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.510
he's a very conservative,
very conservative.
Well you know what he is,

787
00:45:09.511 --> 00:45:14.511
he's a super successful man that had to be incredibly driven to get to where he

788
00:45:14.761 --> 00:45:15.210
was.

789
00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:20.040
And he's not tolerating any mediocrity or what he perceives to be mediocrity in

790
00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:23.260
any form,
whether it's language or behavior or the use of,
you know,

791
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:24.600
use of swear words.

792
00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.480
<v 3>Fun Guy.
And it's unfortunate.
I um,
uh,</v>

793
00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:33.190
my first experience with stand up was I was,
I can't remember,
I was very young.

794
00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.080
My parents had a record player.

795
00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:38.620
I put bill Cosby on and would play it.

796
00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.790
And when you're a kid you don't have an immune system for comedy cause you've

797
00:45:42.791 --> 00:45:46.220
never heard it before.
So the first time you hear it,

798
00:45:46.221 --> 00:45:50.470
it knocks you on your ass.
Cause it's so funny you can't stop laughing.

799
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:53.290
You don't have the defense mechanisms.
It's a brand new thing.

800
00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:54.940
You're hearing a whole new rhythm,

801
00:45:54.941 --> 00:45:58.810
a whole new way of storytelling that is always the funniest thing you've ever

802
00:45:58.811 --> 00:46:03.370
heard.
I can remember laying there and not being able to breathe,

803
00:46:03.371 --> 00:46:08.180
just like clutching my stomach because it was so funny and it was like the one,

804
00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:12.190
his joke that I remember from,
from this album was the one about getting drunk.

805
00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.790
Just,
it was just this whole story about throwing up and getting drunk.

806
00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:20.450
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Well he had that great bit about the,</v>

807
00:46:20.451 --> 00:46:24.330
the sun at the football game that the dad works out,

808
00:46:24.331 --> 00:46:27.300
the sun does all this thing,
the sun,
and then finally,

809
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:31.070
you know the cameras turn on him and he's like,
hi mom.
Yeah,

810
00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:37.020
we had one that I remember the one that I got hooked on gangs he got,

811
00:46:37.021 --> 00:46:41.280
but that's the one that really fucked Mincey up that that one really fucked him

812
00:46:41.281 --> 00:46:45.840
up.
Which one was it?
Cosby one.
Cause the co that's,
that's sacred ground.

813
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:49.440
I mean,
as far as standup Comedians,
in my opinion,
there's five,

814
00:46:49.441 --> 00:46:54.000
six sacred comedians and Cosby's one of the sacred ones.
Sure.
Yeah,

815
00:46:54.001 --> 00:46:58.740
no doubt about it.
He's a,
he's a all time genius.
You know this,

816
00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.370
you can't talk shit about him,
but what an odd decision to steal a bill.

817
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.850
Bill Cosby joke.
He fucked up.
He,
he,
I,
you know,
we've,

818
00:47:05.851 --> 00:47:10.290
we've said a lot of things about that guy over the years.
Mitzia you know,
I,

819
00:47:10.291 --> 00:47:13.650
I honestly hope he's got his shit together.
You know,
I wish him well,

820
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.030
I don't have a,

821
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:20.150
you don't have to play that Dude's bug bug joke with the blue thing is one

822
00:47:20.281 --> 00:47:24.960
really flip comedy for me.
He does a bit about playing buck buck.

823
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:30.020
He sits on the stool [inaudible] he doesn't move anybody who ever play buck

824
00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.140
<v 2>buck and was just a moving game.
Right.</v>

825
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.710
He sold me in my mind and that's when I learned the other phase of comedy.

826
00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:40.990
But at time I was maybe 16 or 17 but guess who I was into at that point?

827
00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:45.610
Oh,
David Letterman,
Letterman.
When I let them in first came on.

828
00:47:45.611 --> 00:47:48.720
So weird.
We'll let them fucking tell me about it.

829
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.800
What led them in first hit TV.

830
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:55.210
I was a senior in high school and the first time I was let them and I was gone.

831
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:59.920
Really like that style of seeing cool guy.
Yeah.
Something.

832
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:04.921
And then I watched him from 18 to like 23 you know,

833
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:09.060
whenever I was home at 11 when I wasn't coked up or in jail,

834
00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:13.030
whatever I was doing and not in jail.
And then I didn't watch him again,

835
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:17.110
but I knew that style when he would come up and do his monologue in the

836
00:48:17.111 --> 00:48:21.430
beginning I dug him like I fucking just was sold and I found that it was at the

837
00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:25.450
comedy store and Pri was at the comedy store and I started putting all the

838
00:48:25.451 --> 00:48:27.700
pieces together.
Wow.

839
00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:30.940
And already I have heard the guy from [inaudible] was a joke thief.

840
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.330
<v 7>He's a fucking joke.
Follow me.
Right.
So I heard that already.</v>

841
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.930
<v 2>And then again,
way before I was going to be a fucking comic,</v>

842
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.770
not even thought I went to catch that dude.
And we've said this already on here,

843
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:50.110
wanting to see the dude from Boston.
It's very witty.
Steven.
Steven,

844
00:48:50.111 --> 00:48:51.700
right,
right.
Yeah.
You went,
I,

845
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:55.540
my friend won tickets to the radio in boulder at the big thing on south boulder.

846
00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:00.700
We went,
he was brilliant.
His material was brilliant.
I was blown away.
Wow.

847
00:49:00.701 --> 00:49:05.110
He didn't fucking curse really towards the end.
That's a different style,

848
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.990
you know,

849
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:08.860
and I'm an all of a sudden I went to see him a year later they do the same

850
00:49:08.861 --> 00:49:12.760
material and that was this.
And I said to myself,
I was ever a comic.

851
00:49:12.761 --> 00:49:13.780
I wouldn't do the same volume number.

852
00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:16.250
<v 4>I think he has a real problem with that act.</v>

853
00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:20.970
So it's such a narrow window or that he can write material in,
you know,

854
00:49:20.971 --> 00:49:23.640
what are the things he could write about?
Everything has to be observed.

855
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:27.390
Everything has to be like a little flip on things,
you know?

856
00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.580
<v 3>Yeah.
I,
yeah,
I'm always,
I love comics like that.</v>

857
00:49:30.581 --> 00:49:34.090
Like him and Mitch Hedberg,
they're,
they're amazing.

858
00:49:34.091 --> 00:49:39.040
But I think it must feel a little cross to phobic to get stuck in that form.

859
00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:40.420
Like Steven Reich,

860
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.650
I guess he can't just come out and start doing it a long story because people

861
00:49:44.651 --> 00:49:45.610
will be like,
what the fuck?

862
00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:48.820
<v 4>What if he did it with like a lot of energy.
Yeah.
He's like,
and I was like,
lady,</v>

863
00:49:48.821 --> 00:49:50.680
what the fuck are you tired?
Everybody's like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

864
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:52.690
Where's that mellow guy?
Yeah.

865
00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:53.963
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

866
00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.840
That's so I think that sucks kind of to get stuck or to get pigeonholed in that

867
00:49:57.841 --> 00:50:02.841
one form and once weren't in a fire hydrant factory park anywhere near the

868
00:50:03.061 --> 00:50:03.840
place.

869
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.673
<v 7>Yes.
Yeah.</v>

870
00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:10.030
It's a classic Steven,
right?

871
00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:15.450
That style in a of ways.
Very uh,

872
00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:16.920
Bergin Hedberg

873
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:21.950
<v 4>kind of to like real fucking sell good eye level shit.</v>

874
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:25.150
My favorite Hedberg one is,
well,
it's one of my favorites.
He goes,

875
00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:28.010
somebody asked me if I bought it a frozen banana.
I

876
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.640
<v 1>said,
no,
but I want a regular banana later.
So yes,</v>

877
00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:38.810
I
can imagine if somebody wrote that down for you,

878
00:50:38.811 --> 00:50:41.110
if you're hiring a guy to write jokes and listen to his fellow,

879
00:50:41.111 --> 00:50:44.930
I'm gonna give you a 200 an hour,
right?
Make some snippy material.

880
00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:49.190
I really need to kill him at the club tonight.
And he reads that.

881
00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.890
Ask a guy asked me if I want a frozen banana,

882
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:55.160
what the fuck am I supposed to do with this guy asked me if I want a frozen

883
00:50:55.161 --> 00:50:59.000
banana.
I say no,
but I'm on a regular banana.
Leda so yes.

884
00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:02.840
What the fuck are you?
What the fuck am I paying?
You knew,
right?

885
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.580
Jesus Christ you piece of Shit.
Let me,

886
00:51:07.581 --> 00:51:11.600
while it's brilliant,
it comes at a Hedberg,
the one about doubletree.

887
00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:15.200
How did they name that?
What do you want to call the place?
Two trees.

888
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:20.130
Doubled tree meeting adjourned.
It's

889
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.920
his stuff and his stuff never connected.

890
00:51:24.921 --> 00:51:27.560
Like what we do is like we'll have a subject.

891
00:51:27.561 --> 00:51:31.520
It's so much easier the way we do comedy because you have a subject and like,

892
00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:36.110
like your subject,
like the Liberace bet that you're doing now.
You start on,

893
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:40.080
he'll start on that Liberace movie and he can talk about that fucking movie for

894
00:51:40.081 --> 00:51:40.950
15 minutes.
Yeah.

895
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000
It's a whole series of hilarious things that exist inside of this one subject.

896
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.100
But if you're a Mitch Hedberg Guy,
it's like you're essentially,

897
00:51:49.101 --> 00:51:52.160
you're talking about one thing and then you're talking about Oreo cookies and

898
00:51:52.161 --> 00:51:54.680
then you're talking about,
you know,
heroin,

899
00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.860
whatever and all the bullets you've got to have in your gut.
Man.

900
00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:01.820
You've got to have so many jokes for an hour set.

901
00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:04.920
If your age of your jokes is eight seconds.
Yeah.

902
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.640
And they're all on non connected.
Yeah.

903
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:10.770
But meanwhile Hedberg would just pump it out,
man.
Yeah,

904
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.720
he popped out a lot of shit.
He constantly was writing.

905
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:18.950
That guy was like one of the most prolific guys.
You know,

906
00:52:18.951 --> 00:52:20.990
like you always heard about him writing a lot of it.

907
00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:21.511
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

908
00:52:21.511 --> 00:52:25.080
I heard somebody say they would write with him and they would go meet him to

909
00:52:25.081 --> 00:52:29.610
write and they would have like want maybe one shitty half thought out,

910
00:52:29.611 --> 00:52:34.611
joke written down and you would have like 20 just hilarious jokes.

911
00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:38.730
You just,
he's one of those comics get it just pours out of him.

912
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:45.200
<v 1>Are you breathing in the mic?
Jesus Christ.
I know what of the questions you,</v>

913
00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:49.770
the guilt
Darth Vader in the background.

914
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:54.570
Yeah,
he had that style down.

915
00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:59.250
He figured out his perfect style and that's a great example of why you can never

916
00:52:59.251 --> 00:53:02.100
really teach comedy.
You know,
I thought about doing,

917
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:04.230
I remember we talked about doing this at the store,

918
00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.300
like doing something in the belly room.
Well I was,

919
00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:09.630
I was going to call it like a comics workshop and the idea was like you really

920
00:53:09.631 --> 00:53:09.931
can't,

921
00:53:09.931 --> 00:53:14.490
like anyone who's like a real legitimate comic could go and do it for free.

922
00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:19.290
He can't pay for that.
Can't be charged people for comedy classes.
Yeah.

923
00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:22.020
It just seems too fucking weird.
It's just seems too strange.

924
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:25.980
It's like the entire opposite.
The feeling of

925
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.050
<v 4>comradery that we're supposed to be giving each other.</v>

926
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.360
We're not supposed to be taking money from each other like that.
Right.

927
00:53:30.361 --> 00:53:32.100
You don't feed off of each other.
Well,

928
00:53:32.101 --> 00:53:34.950
we should be doing is promoting the artists stand up.
You know,

929
00:53:34.951 --> 00:53:38.610
if somebody wants to take a course and they're not a convenient and they just

930
00:53:38.611 --> 00:53:42.420
want to find out what it's like and sit in,
then I could see maybe charging them.

931
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:46.380
But someone who was actually comedian trying to be a comedian,
there's that.

932
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.850
So the idea of teaching a class kind of goes against the whole way of,

933
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:55.260
you know,
the,
the,
the whole way of camaraderie that we all enjoy.

934
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.160
But it's also that you can't teach people how to do comedy.

935
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:04.370
You can only give them advice as to maybe how you would do it or maybe if they

936
00:54:04.681 --> 00:54:06.990
shorten things up or had less words.

937
00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:09.590
<v 3>Well,
it's,
it's a little bit like what you're,
it's funny,</v>

938
00:54:09.591 --> 00:54:12.020
I'm sorry to cut you off.
[inaudible] rambling.

939
00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:17.050
What you're saying reminds me a lot of what people say about like Buddhism or,

940
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:23.270
uh,
uh,
spirituality is that they,
they,
they,
they say,

941
00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.420
you know,
you can't read this.
This isn't something like,

942
00:54:26.421 --> 00:54:29.060
you can read all you want,
but it's not going to teach you.

943
00:54:29.061 --> 00:54:33.620
It's the practice of the thing itself.
The teachers use.
So like,

944
00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:34.610
oh,
when I went,

945
00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:38.780
when I went down to hang out with to this Ron doss retreat and there is the Zen

946
00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:42.680
Roshi there.
This is this woman who's been practicing zen for like,
I don't know,

947
00:54:42.681 --> 00:54:43.880
her whole life basically.

948
00:54:43.881 --> 00:54:48.881
And she said that the teacher does not give the student and enlightenment but

949
00:54:49.881 --> 00:54:51.290
sets the conditions,

950
00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:54.920
creates a good condition for realization.

951
00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.950
So in the same way I think you could have a comedy class,

952
00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:00.410
but the comedy classes and something where you tell someone,

953
00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:04.100
here's how you hold the mic and here's the way you write a joke and here's how

954
00:55:04.101 --> 00:55:05.300
you get booked at clubs,

955
00:55:05.301 --> 00:55:10.301
it's more like here's an environment that is conducive to coming up with ideas

956
00:55:11.511 --> 00:55:12.020
and jokes.

957
00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:16.650
I'm kind of free form chaotic place where people just get together and,

958
00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:18.950
and I guess,
you know,

959
00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:22.610
get to be around people like you or like you know,

960
00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:27.611
Cosby or big comics because somehow just being around a very funny person for a

961
00:55:28.281 --> 00:55:30.620
little bit of time can teach you so much.

962
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:35.180
But the actual mechanics of the thing,
the technical aspects of it,

963
00:55:35.181 --> 00:55:37.040
that's I think where comedy classes or

964
00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:37.900
<v 2>some,</v>

965
00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:42.070
I'm going to say this sincerely from my heart that as you were saying is going

966
00:55:42.071 --> 00:55:44.100
to agree with me because we're both on the same page.

967
00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:48.600
I would have loved if somebody would have taken my hand in the beginning and

968
00:55:48.601 --> 00:55:52.560
walk me through a lot of things and there's a lot of things that I could take on

969
00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:55.980
a new comic that we,
all three of us,
all four of us,
everybody in the room.

970
00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:59.950
You could take a new comic and walking around for a couple of weeks with them

971
00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:04.170
three,
four weeks and explain this after that.
It's like,
Hey,
auntie house man,

972
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:05.910
you got to figure it out on your own.
I got it.

973
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.210
Because that's part of the journey.
That's part of your happiness.

974
00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.550
That's Kinda what's going to make you happy later.

975
00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:14.090
<v 4>Yeah,
you too guys are perfect example of it.</v>

976
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:17.900
You two are two of my best friends and you're also two of my favorite comedians.

977
00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:21.820
Thank you.
And you're both completely fucking different and I,

978
00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:26.110
I love both of you.
Perform equally.
You're both totally different.

979
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:30.730
Totally different.
Totally different styles,
but yet both.
Awesome.

980
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:35.230
You know why?
Because you're really you and you're really you.
It's that simple.

981
00:56:35.231 --> 00:56:36.190
You're not playing.

982
00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:41.340
We all know the poor people that are stuck putting together like an act and

983
00:56:41.561 --> 00:56:43.410
they're kind of pretending to be someone they're not.

984
00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.150
And we know those folks and it's a,

985
00:56:45.151 --> 00:56:50.080
it's a terrible Rut to be in now at artistically as a person,
whatever,
we,

986
00:56:50.081 --> 00:56:53.710
you guys aren't in that spot.
So because of that,
you're allowed to figure out,

987
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.050
and I don't know if that's ever going to be you.

988
00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:01.090
You almost have to struggle uniquely and individually to get to,

989
00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:04.900
to become a Duncan Trussell.
It's almost like if you,

990
00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:08.590
if you get advice like they're never going to figure out that this is possible,

991
00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:09.790
that,
that you could be you.

992
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:12.970
Like if you met with someone when you were 20 years old and you're like,
Duncan,

993
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:16.270
would you like to do some day?
I like to smoke pot and play video games.

994
00:57:16.271 --> 00:57:18.040
I like to write about my penis.

995
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:22.330
I would like to go on stage and make people laugh.
And that's really it.

996
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:26.020
They'd be like,
well,
okay,
kill yourself.
That's,
that's cute.

997
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:29.470
But let's think realistically Dunkin.
Right.
What about your real future?

998
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:33.060
Instead of saying,
oh so many people who've done it before this good,
no,

999
00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:35.980
no one is ever going to be able to figure out how to make a Duncan Trussell

1000
00:57:35.981 --> 00:57:36.880
except on controls.
Right?

1001
00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.770
<v 8>Well I think some people,
I think some,
I think comedians,</v>

1002
00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:43.580
there are tendencies and Comedians,
there are similarities and Comedians,
right?

1003
00:57:43.581 --> 00:57:47.240
Wouldn't you say there's,
there's things in comics,
not,
not material wise,

1004
00:57:47.241 --> 00:57:51.140
but there are aspects of comedians that are all seem to be the same.

1005
00:57:51.141 --> 00:57:54.260
One is there,
they tend to be very anti authoritarian.

1006
00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:58.250
So like when when you tell them what to do,

1007
00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:00.470
when you tell them this is what you have to do,
they,

1008
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:04.990
they inevitably want to reject that,
overcome it,
disrupted,

1009
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.250
make fun of it.
And,
and I think that tendency starts,
oh,

1010
00:58:09.251 --> 00:58:11.810
when you're really young and if that tendency is in you,

1011
00:58:11.811 --> 00:58:15.410
you're going to have a hard fucking time anyway getting a regular job because

1012
00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:19.520
it's so such an a front.
Like I can remember listening,

1013
00:58:19.550 --> 00:58:23.870
I in in college there was a career class we had to go to and I can remember

1014
00:58:23.871 --> 00:58:28.790
sitting there and listening to the guy talk about having to wear suits and

1015
00:58:28.791 --> 00:58:33.791
talking about the way you talk to your boss and talking about the way to be

1016
00:58:34.551 --> 00:58:37.560
polite in the workplace and I,
I dunno,
I said,
okay,

1017
00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:39.110
<v 4>no.
What happens when you listen to that guy?</v>

1018
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:42.650
You wind up at a restaurant with your date and some asshole actors starts

1019
00:58:42.651 --> 00:58:45.250
telling your date that she's an old soul and you just take it

1020
00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:49.220
<v 8>yes.
With a bitch.
Slap it out,
dude.
Yes,
exactly.
That's because that's a big turn.</v>

1021
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:49.861
You,
you're right.

1022
00:58:49.861 --> 00:58:54.810
The essence of the thing is just lay on your belly and submit to the master.

1023
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.330
Just the very same thing that like when you see a mother doc,

1024
00:58:57.510 --> 00:59:02.070
like our dog had puppies and I remember watching the mother dog play with the

1025
00:59:02.071 --> 00:59:05.070
puppies and part of the thing it seemed like she was teaching them was the like

1026
00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:08.070
show their belly to like turn turnover on their belly.

1027
00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:09.930
That's the essence of the fucking thing.

1028
00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:12.920
It's like a a [inaudible] subservient submission.

1029
00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:16.230
<v 4>Well,
it's the only way you're ever going to get by in life with a regular job.</v>

1030
00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:17.550
The only way to get by in life,

1031
00:59:17.551 --> 00:59:19.020
if you want to move your way up the corporate ladder,

1032
00:59:19.021 --> 00:59:21.470
you have to follow the rules.
You can't tell dirty jokes at work.

1033
00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:26.090
You can't try to get laid.
You can't try to play pranks on people.

1034
00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:29.630
There's no room for creativity.
You're there from nine to five.
You punching you.

1035
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:32.880
<v 3>I think these are,
that's not all places though,
man.
I just saw,
oh no,</v>

1036
00:59:32.881 --> 00:59:34.230
it's certainly not Google.

1037
00:59:34.231 --> 00:59:38.670
I saw pictures of like somebody working in Google and they were laying in a box

1038
00:59:38.671 --> 00:59:42.930
of colored balls on there.
That's amazing.

1039
00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:46.890
I don't think it's,
I don't think it's all places.
It's an old school model.

1040
00:59:46.891 --> 00:59:50.040
It's an old school model,
which is that it's based on feudalism.

1041
00:59:50.041 --> 00:59:54.450
It's based on the king show obedience to the king shall obedience to your boss

1042
00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:55.403
or your teacher.

1043
00:59:56.410 --> 01:00:00.330
<v 4>Yeah.
Google is the perfect example of how to do a corporation,
you know?</v>

1044
01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:03.280
I mean we joke around about them being skynet,
but the rear,

1045
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:07.120
the reality of Google is they've managed in a short period of time to keep a lot

1046
01:00:07.121 --> 01:00:11.170
of fucking employees happy.
Yeah.
They have a huge business.
They own everything.

1047
01:00:11.171 --> 01:00:13.780
They've gotten maps that they've got fucking music.

1048
01:00:13.781 --> 01:00:17.800
They've got their own operating system for phones that develop their own
browser.

1049
01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:19.750
I mean,
Jesus fucking Christ.

1050
01:00:19.751 --> 01:00:24.751
Has anybody ever kicked ass on the internet the way Google has and yet they're

1051
01:00:24.881 --> 01:00:26.980
really cool.
They're employees.
If you go there,

1052
01:00:26.981 --> 01:00:30.850
their employees get fucking foosball tables and shit and really good food and

1053
01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.000
they can,
you know,
they have a real comfortable working environment.

1054
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:35.200
I have a friend that works there.

1055
01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:39.670
There's a dude that works there who's decided at work.
He wants to be a girl.

1056
01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.310
So he's a guy,
he's married,
he's got kids,

1057
01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.240
but at work he puts on women's clothes and they changed the title,

1058
01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:49.780
his title at work to what his girl name is,
what the fuck.

1059
01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:55.150
And they're like,
okay,
it's wheat.
They're so open minded.
They're not like,
Bob,

1060
01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:57.460
is there something going on man,
you know,

1061
01:00:57.461 --> 01:00:59.770
all of a sudden you're wearing a jet instead of any of that.

1062
01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:04.210
There's none of that.
They're like,
okay,
well how Lynn?
Um,
pleasure to meet you.

1063
01:01:04.211 --> 01:01:08.530
Helen.
If I met you before,
I have met you before,
but I met you as Bob.
Okay,

1064
01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.960
so now we'll pleasure to meet you asked Helen.
So let's,

1065
01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.100
let's take it from here on.

1066
01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:15.070
We're Helen except dinner parties when they go out at night and he brings his

1067
01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:18.580
wife,
then he dresses like a man,
like if the as functions or anything,

1068
01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:22.090
then he's a man and he's married.
He has a y and they're so open minded.

1069
01:01:22.091 --> 01:01:22.924
They are like,
okay,

1070
01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:27.120
as long as you're not putting you on it all this is your friend or this is a no,

1071
01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:30.830
no,
no,
no,
no.
My friend is my friend friend.
I'm like,

1072
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:34.690
are you friends with your buck in the same environment as this person?

1073
01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:37.810
What's my friend works at Google?
That's all cool to you?

1074
01:01:37.811 --> 01:01:41.380
Slip and fall in the bathroom tiles.
Sue.
Google will not like sue.

1075
01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:46.210
You were addressing fucking word.
You want to sue me?

1076
01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.030
You want him to wear a dress?
Cock sucker.

1077
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:50.800
You're you to get your shit together back your pencil.

1078
01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.720
That's what happens when your heels don't fit.

1079
01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:58.310
You'll imagine what the fuck you were fucking dressed.
The work.

1080
01:01:58.311 --> 01:02:00.010
Somebody's going to say something eventually.
I mean,

1081
01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:03.040
well the shoes alone would be reason to not be a woman.

1082
01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.860
If I was a woman I would even if I was like a really sexy,

1083
01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:10.480
like a heterosexual woman,
I think I would dress like a man.
I think.

1084
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:14.440
I think this is like the most comfortable way to move around.
Yeah,
no converse.

1085
01:02:14.441 --> 01:02:19.090
All stars.
Pair of jeans,
nice comfortable shorts.
Why are you wearing those shoes?

1086
01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:21.780
Well those crazy shoes you wear and you can't walk in.

1087
01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:25.190
<v 8>Yeah,
the co I,
you know,
I,
one thing that is probably certain,</v>

1088
01:02:25.191 --> 01:02:28.640
but I guess I'll find out in a second is that those fucking shoes were not

1089
01:02:28.641 --> 01:02:30.170
invented by a woman.
Right?

1090
01:02:30.171 --> 01:02:33.890
Like whoever been at high heels wasn't a Wa wasn't,
oh,

1091
01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.750
no person was like,
you know what?

1092
01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:40.610
I'm going to put myself in uncomfortable stilts that warp my feet.

1093
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:41.511
I'm going to,

1094
01:02:41.511 --> 01:02:45.980
I'm going to put myself in the most uncomfortable shoe where I can't drink.
Yeah.

1095
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:49.360
Probably as a chick probably wasn't.
It's no.

1096
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:53.120
A lot of people like foot bindings there.
There's a whole history of like,
ah,

1097
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:57.190
<v 4>I meant to say it isn't a check.
Yeah.
Med say while Jimmy Choo is a woman.</v>

1098
01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:01.690
Did you know that?
Who?
Jimmy Choo.
That's like a big one with the,
with the gals.

1099
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:04.930
They love the Jimmy Choo shoes.
Jimmy Choo's actually a woman.

1100
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:08.950
A woman created that.
Yeah,
but if you look at the history of them,
what's,

1101
01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.110
find out what he can be a patent on this.

1102
01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:12.161
<v 8>I hate Google.</v>

1103
01:03:12.161 --> 01:03:17.161
You get as a stoner or any of your stupid ideas can instantly be shot down.

1104
01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:20.620
My friend ate it using or wearing high heels the other day,

1105
01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:25.220
<v 4>tore her knee wide open because of this stupid high heels.
Shoes.
Yeah,</v>

1106
01:03:25.221 --> 01:03:27.260
they're fucking dangerous man.
Yeah.
It's like,

1107
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.870
especially when you're walking around on the street and there's cracks in the

1108
01:03:29.871 --> 01:03:32.750
sidewalk and weird shit and divots.
Yeah.

1109
01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:37.610
You can't walk in those things bitch.
You can't work in those things.
Okay.

1110
01:03:37.611 --> 01:03:41.160
Where does it say invention?
The history in high yield history.

1111
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:45.200
You've haunted me with those feet.
Shoot Joe.
They'll footie toady.

1112
01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.770
I see him like every day now.
They're great.
If you wore them,
you would wear what?

1113
01:03:48.771 --> 01:03:52.450
You're so funny to talk shit because you weren't slippers right now wearing

1114
01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:56.500
slippers,
like you just stepped out.
If some Russian bathhouse when they give you,

1115
01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.610
give you one of those,
those massages,

1116
01:03:58.611 --> 01:04:03.400
would they beat you with the gov sticks like a fade or you to do the and Nice

1117
01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:06.710
fucking slap you with that.
The shoes are,
I bet they are company,

1118
01:04:06.711 --> 01:04:07.461
but that's what it looks like.

1119
01:04:07.461 --> 01:04:11.120
Are you shuffling out in the middle of the winter and some Soviet Union gear

1120
01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:15.940
headed to the Banya?
Yeah.
If it gets slapped massage naked.
Yeah.

1121
01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:20.220
<v 8>Or an Alzheimer's patient who slipped out the back door is lost in a city.</v>

1122
01:04:20.330 --> 01:04:22.010
<v 4>Yeah.
All right.</v>

1123
01:04:22.011 --> 01:04:27.011
The first incidence of the wear of high heels involved 1533 marriage between

1124
01:04:27.501 --> 01:04:31.460
Catherine de Mer murky and the Duke of Orleans.

1125
01:04:31.461 --> 01:04:35.270
She wore heels made in Florence for her wedding.
And as a result,

1126
01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:39.490
the Italian high heels became the norm for the ladies in the Duke's Court and

1127
01:04:39.491 --> 01:04:43.320
France.
Unfortunately this reference may be a cripple.

1128
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:44.800
Ooh.

1129
01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:49.640
Apocryphal Apocryphal as the development of heels did not begin to come about

1130
01:04:49.641 --> 01:04:54.320
until the late 1580s based on an iconic graphic evidence.

1131
01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:56.380
And so it was somewhere around the 18th,

1132
01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.610
the the 15 eight to 15

1133
01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.810
<v 8>I heard it's because uh,</v>

1134
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:06.680
everything needs to be covered in shit and a lady didn't want to get her feet

1135
01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.910
and shit puddles.

1136
01:05:07.911 --> 01:05:11.190
And so you would try to use the high yields to like push the feet?
Yeah.

1137
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:13.780
<v 4>Doesn't make sense because the toes down,</v>

1138
01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:17.920
toes still getting kicked and shit better the toes and the entire foot.
Really.

1139
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.700
<v 8>If I have to choose between how much of anything I want covered in shit,</v>

1140
01:05:21.701 --> 01:05:22.610
I'm going to pick a camera,

1141
01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.460
<v 4>I'll go with my heels.
I would rather have shit on my heel.
Then industry,</v>

1142
01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:29.360
my little cute little toast cheese.
Why would you want to get your piggies

1143
01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:34.700
piggies wall?
I said what would that look like?
Reverse high heels.

1144
01:05:34.701 --> 01:05:36.620
That'd be really weird.

1145
01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:39.890
You have like some Gene Simmons style kiss boots,

1146
01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:45.280
you know co call my doc did love with teeth walking through the shit.

1147
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:51.930
Yeah.
That was the cause of a lot of disease back in the day.

1148
01:05:51.931 --> 01:05:56.931
It was the poor sewer systems and the rotting bodies and all sorts of the things

1149
01:05:57.141 --> 01:06:00.590
they had to deal with when people died.
Just our river as shit man.

1150
01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:05.060
And people would also like the,
like,
especially in during times of war,

1151
01:06:05.330 --> 01:06:08.330
like their rivers would get clogged up with bodies,
you know,

1152
01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:12.320
and the bodies would rot and then if you drank river water with rotting bodies

1153
01:06:12.321 --> 01:06:14.270
and it,
you'd get sick as fuck and possibly die.

1154
01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.300
<v 8>People say,
Oh look,
these shootings are happening today.</v>

1155
01:06:18.301 --> 01:06:23.280
It's like you used to watch dead blown up bodies role by your home.

1156
01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:25.290
You used to,
when you walked outside,

1157
01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:29.550
you would walk up to your ankles and plague diarrhea.
Yeah.

1158
01:06:29.551 --> 01:06:31.830
It sucks that people are getting shot right now,

1159
01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:34.080
but it's nothing like what it used to be.
It's

1160
01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.580
<v 4>definitely nothing like what it used to be,</v>

1161
01:06:35.581 --> 01:06:39.990
but the numbers are so high that it seems like it's never ending.

1162
01:06:39.991 --> 01:06:43.500
It's a torrent because we're really not supposed to be paying attention to 7

1163
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.920
billion people at the same time.
That's what I think you're our way or our way,

1164
01:06:46.921 --> 01:06:48.540
or is this going to be how we fix it?

1165
01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.330
Is that this going to be where people don't get ignored anymore,

1166
01:06:51.331 --> 01:06:55.230
where you really have to take and pay attention to the assets of every single

1167
01:06:55.231 --> 01:06:56.730
human being like assets,

1168
01:06:56.731 --> 01:07:00.990
meaning you know you as a person and asset to civilization that all of them have

1169
01:07:00.991 --> 01:07:04.200
to be accounted for and if they're not,
if they feel disenfranchised,

1170
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:05.400
that's when you're going to have problems.

1171
01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:08.370
When they feel left out and they feel a avoided,

1172
01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:09.600
you're going to have fucking problems.

1173
01:07:09.601 --> 01:07:14.010
But people don't get the love that they need from the jump on top of all the

1174
01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.080
real serious mental illnesses that can plague people that just happen.

1175
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:21.210
W I knew a dude who went crazy.
You remember the dude,
the tod?

1176
01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.720
Do remember the Todd?
You don't remember the towel?
I,
yes,

1177
01:07:24.721 --> 01:07:28.890
I actually met him wines.
The Todd is responsible for me getting into this store.

1178
01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:33.540
Wow.
Because when I was doing this,
yes.
Remember him,
friends at Pauley,

1179
01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:34.740
Greg Guy,
man.

1180
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:39.950
He was a a comic and he was on MTV back in the day and he had been in and I went

1181
01:07:42.451 --> 01:07:45.780
up and I did a spot and Mitzi,
she like,

1182
01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:49.740
she gave me nonpaid regular status means I could go on after the show was over.

1183
01:07:49.770 --> 01:07:51.260
So I would go there every night,

1184
01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:54.120
wait till like one o'clock in the morning and get on and you know,

1185
01:07:54.121 --> 01:07:56.430
it was all right.
He was better than nothing,
you know,
I was happy to have that.

1186
01:07:56.550 --> 01:08:00.150
But then I got a second chance to audition for a couple months after that and

1187
01:08:00.151 --> 01:08:04.800
the Todd sat next to her on purpose and just laughed and laughed and he kept

1188
01:08:04.801 --> 01:08:06.960
like slapping the table and saying that I was funny.

1189
01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:10.200
Cause like sometimes Mitzi needs to hear from other people too.
She's like,

1190
01:08:10.201 --> 01:08:11.180
he's brilliant.

1191
01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.490
Meanwhile I was like half have the same material I did three months before that,

1192
01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.040
but it was better then.
I'm

1193
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.300
<v 1>sure I'd more gotten more comfortable with being at the store and show I was</v>

1194
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:22.920
nervous the first time.
I think she also had her ear to the ground.
Yeah.

1195
01:08:22.921 --> 01:08:25.730
If you were coming in there every night,
she knew it.

1196
01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:29.690
She knew it and she knew that was like part of a sign that somebody had

1197
01:08:29.691 --> 01:08:33.560
potential.
I think it was more than just that instantaneous watching thing.

1198
01:08:33.561 --> 01:08:35.350
I think it's a combination of sort of,

1199
01:08:35.351 --> 01:08:39.710
but the Todd actually sent me hip that that's been used before and he told me

1200
01:08:39.711 --> 01:08:43.040
that that's the way I should get my friends into.
So that's what I started doing.

1201
01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:45.470
Like when McGuire did it,

1202
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.230
I sat right next to minutes and laughed hard at McGuire.

1203
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:51.560
You know anybody who ever like was performing for her,

1204
01:08:51.561 --> 01:08:54.320
I would make sure I sat right next to her and laughed.
Man.

1205
01:08:54.321 --> 01:08:57.860
Was that not the weirdest fucking thing sitting next to Mitzi and then watching

1206
01:08:57.861 --> 01:09:02.300
the comics come up and like literally bow to her.
Like comics would come up,

1207
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:07.640
old school,
cold leader,
Guru style.
Bow Down.

1208
01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:12.120
Touch her to like try to touch her and then she would do the Mitzi wave void.

1209
01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:17.030
You remember that?
Anna Mattie here.
Okay.
Hi Annie.

1210
01:09:17.031 --> 01:09:21.620
And watching a show.
You're talking about Todd rendering.
Rendering.
Who's that?

1211
01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:24.450
Why are we talking about him?
What are you talking about?

1212
01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:26.090
He was from MTV back in there.

1213
01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.700
<v 2>No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You want me to say about Todd Rundgren?</v>

1214
01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.450
He was married to the chick.
What's the,

1215
01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:42.040
what's Tyler's Tyler?
Who's daughter?
Oh,
Liv Tyler.
Liv.

1216
01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:42.874
Tyler.

1217
01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:47.770
Just mother was living with that dude.
Okay.

1218
01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.360
And the mother took her to see Aerosmith and Lou Tyler turned around and told

1219
01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:57.040
the mother,
that's my father.
For years.

1220
01:09:57.041 --> 01:09:59.920
They had raised her thinking it was Todd Rundgren.
Whoa.

1221
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:03.700
It was really Steven Tyler,
but she wanted her to figure it out.
True Story Bro.

1222
01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:06.730
I'd rung her is a bad motherfucker.
He's got some bad ass.
Jan,

1223
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:08.950
I know you've heard his job.
What does it songs

1224
01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.320
we can we switch?
You could play something.
Yeah.

1225
01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:18.930
<v 1>Just look up the names of what's the fuck you fuck.
You can do it.</v>

1226
01:10:18.931 --> 01:10:20.430
If they can prove that you're making money off of it.

1227
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:23.970
You absolutely camp one thing.
One thing.
There's something called fair use.

1228
01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:26.170
How's it work?
I,

1229
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:30.030
I think that if you listen to dunk and he ain't got no legal experience.

1230
01:10:30.031 --> 01:10:33.270
Yes he does.
He on legal zoom Tamakoshi

1231
01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:40.360
Oh
hey,
I earned it.

1232
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:43.880
If you're making a commentary over a thing,

1233
01:10:44.610 --> 01:10:48.330
there's some kind of like area where it is okay to like reprint staff,

1234
01:10:48.331 --> 01:10:52.360
but it has not in Berlin.
And I think you can do like,
there's seconds,

1235
01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:56.820
like 10 seconds.
It's all whatsapp thing.
That's interesting.

1236
01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.820
I wish it would get released.
The icehouse chronicles with,
we were talking about,

1237
01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:02.720
uh,
about,
um,
the,

1238
01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:07.320
what I feel is the greatest guitar solo in the history of music.
Pretty Bird.

1239
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:09.980
I don't think anything could fuck with free Freebird and we were playing free

1240
01:11:09.981 --> 01:11:12.180
bird and we're just getting into the song,

1241
01:11:12.181 --> 01:11:14.220
but I'll crazy ones that there's this dirty,

1242
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:19.200
<v 4>stinky Longhair dudes from Florida who are making this insane music.</v>

1243
01:11:19.201 --> 01:11:21.120
And all their songs were about getting away from [inaudible]

1244
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:27.100
<v 8>all their songs,
like a huge percentage of the songs.
Like,
I gotta be free.</v>

1245
01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.040
Um,
they call me the breeze,
I must do this.
You take care.

1246
01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.150
And all their fucking songs are about getting away.

1247
01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:37.030
Give me two steps.
I mean,
everything is like,

1248
01:11:37.031 --> 01:11:39.850
I gotta get the fuck out of this town.
This shit got crazy.
What's your name?

1249
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.050
I'll be back next year.

1250
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:46.060
It's so funny that we're writing songs about this ancient evolutionary thing and

1251
01:11:46.061 --> 01:11:47.350
coded in our genetics,

1252
01:11:47.351 --> 01:11:51.250
which is that you want to put as much DNA into as many people as you can.

1253
01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:56.700
But now like people are actually probably monkeys would seem sing the same song

1254
01:11:57.731 --> 01:12:02.290
if they could any kind of primate with like it's kind of stuck in that awful

1255
01:12:02.291 --> 01:12:07.291
predicament of like having a genetic predisposition to spray just into as many

1256
01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:10.930
holes as possible.
It's just in there.

1257
01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:15.820
And then also the need to like start a family and love someone and be

1258
01:12:15.821 --> 01:12:16.654
monogamous.

1259
01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:21.810
That's one of the great internal wars that is raging around the world right now

1260
01:12:21.971 --> 01:12:25.410
is people trying to figure out how to deal with it,
how to reconcile those two.

1261
01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:26.740
How do you reconcile that shit?

1262
01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:28.350
<v 4>Yeah,
you ha well it's also,</v>

1263
01:12:28.351 --> 01:12:33.351
I think there's a certain amount of conflict that sort of ensures movement and

1264
01:12:35.341 --> 01:12:40.341
shores a lot of activity and when you have two systems that are dueling it out,

1265
01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:44.010
one trying to dominate the other one,

1266
01:12:44.011 --> 01:12:48.150
trying to find a way through whether it's through certain new words they

1267
01:12:48.151 --> 01:12:51.360
introduce into the lexicon,
whether it's or the language,

1268
01:12:51.361 --> 01:12:55.260
whether it's the way they,
you know,
how they interact with each other.

1269
01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.520
But what they're trying to do is everyone's trying to get a little bit ahead.

1270
01:12:59.930 --> 01:13:01.770
Men are trying to get a little bit ahead of women.

1271
01:13:01.771 --> 01:13:04.350
Women are trying to get a little bit ahead of men,
women and feel suppressed.

1272
01:13:04.351 --> 01:13:07.650
We'll try to suppress others.
Men who feel suppressed and tried to do the same,

1273
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:13.040
and there's this crazy battle going on and I think it's almost like designed

1274
01:13:13.381 --> 01:13:13.780
that way.

1275
01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.910
<v 8>Well,
it's a culture of dishonesty.
Don't forget,</v>

1276
01:13:15.911 --> 01:13:17.610
you're not allowed to say these things.
This is,

1277
01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:21.460
<v 4>but it's also the culture that produces the most stuff creatively.</v>

1278
01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:22.900
It's very strange.

1279
01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.770
<v 8>Yeah.
I think that's a very positive spin on it,
man.
But imagine like,</v>

1280
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:28.310
<v 4>and then,
but the end,
but I should say right now,</v>

1281
01:13:28.311 --> 01:13:31.610
it's not to discount any of the Europeans,
Japanese,
Asians,
whatever,

1282
01:13:31.611 --> 01:13:34.070
all the people all over the world that do creative shit.
Right.

1283
01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.550
But there's a certain,
there's no real,

1284
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:41.450
there's no denying the fact that United States is responsible for an insane

1285
01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:46.100
amount of influential pop culture from the 1950s to the present.

1286
01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:50.120
Insane amounts.
Of course,
the Europeans,
of course,

1287
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:53.780
the Beatles and the stones.
And of course the WHO.

1288
01:13:53.781 --> 01:13:57.200
Of course there's no denying that there was a million of them from the UK as

1289
01:13:57.201 --> 01:14:01.190
well.
But when you count in stand up comedy,
when you count in music,

1290
01:14:01.191 --> 01:14:03.660
all different kinds of music,
we,

1291
01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:06.560
there's a lot of weird shit that came out of the United States.

1292
01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.630
<v 8>Do you think that's because you're saying that that's coming from,</v>

1293
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:12.460
it's almost oppression might

1294
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:15.250
<v 4>be something to that.
The need to conquer,</v>

1295
01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:19.060
the need to conquer the crazy genetics that led to these people being willing to

1296
01:14:19.061 --> 01:14:23.200
get in ships and go halfway across the fucking world in a boat with fucking

1297
01:14:23.201 --> 01:14:27.130
barrels of food that might be enough for everybody to eat and you might not get

1298
01:14:27.131 --> 01:14:30.820
scurvy and you don't even have a fucking video that you can watch of what this

1299
01:14:30.821 --> 01:14:31.181
place,

1300
01:14:31.181 --> 01:14:33.700
where you going to try to live in looks like and you going over there with your

1301
01:14:33.701 --> 01:14:37.780
kids.
Yeah,
those are savages.
Those people were fucking crazy.

1302
01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.580
So you have that.
You have the legacy of these people and that's a part of it.

1303
01:14:42.581 --> 01:14:45.970
Like this,
this,
this desire to just move forward.

1304
01:14:45.971 --> 01:14:49.000
They're willing to take the most risks in order to get to America in the first

1305
01:14:49.001 --> 01:14:50.970
place.
I think the news will come as because of that.

1306
01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:54.630
<v 8>People who came over here to I guess support your argument.
Uh,</v>

1307
01:14:54.631 --> 01:14:58.260
many of the people who came over here where some of the most sexually repressed

1308
01:14:58.261 --> 01:15:02.430
people on earth because they were hardcore,
uh,
Christians.

1309
01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:05.630
This is like the scarlet letter.
This is like the,

1310
01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.580
the body was something to be reviled,
but I don't,

1311
01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:14.330
I don't know if it's their oppression that is made that brings inspiration,
that,

1312
01:15:14.331 --> 01:15:19.200
that,
and that's never,
I've never been in a,
you know what maybe it is though,

1313
01:15:19.201 --> 01:15:23.130
because I can think of like times where you're like super horny or,

1314
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:26.420
or like lonely and that does produce.

1315
01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.980
<v 4>Think about music,
man.
Yeah.
Where's the music coming from?</v>

1316
01:15:28.981 --> 01:15:32.700
Where's the greatest music coming from?
Fucking pain,
man.

1317
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:37.170
Coming from fucking pain please baby.
Oh Man.
There's some,

1318
01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:40.530
there's some classic on,
you're my favorite mistake.

1319
01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:44.160
You ever heard that Sheryl Crow Song?
God damn man just gets off.

1320
01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:48.930
God Damn that bitch could sing.
She had this like soft warm voice.

1321
01:15:48.931 --> 01:15:51.420
It's like a hug that you get through your ears.

1322
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:55.020
It's like this loving voice that she has and she's talking about this

1323
01:15:55.230 --> 01:15:59.730
relationship that's just fallen apart and that you're my favorite mistake.

1324
01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:04.170
And you heal the hear the emotions and the love through her voice.

1325
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:08.820
You've got to have pain to feel that man.
You got to have pain to understand it.

1326
01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.070
You've got to have pain to be able to relate to it.

1327
01:16:11.071 --> 01:16:12.420
You've got to have experienced that.

1328
01:16:12.421 --> 01:16:17.240
If you're some fresh faced pop who's never skid his knee and never had a a

1329
01:16:17.241 --> 01:16:18.360
family member die,

1330
01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:21.720
you don't know what the fuck the possibilities of the world are.

1331
01:16:21.721 --> 01:16:25.410
You can't appreciate the full spectrum because you don't know how low the lows

1332
01:16:25.411 --> 01:16:29.760
can get.
Your lows are pretty fucking high.
So when you do hit a low,

1333
01:16:29.850 --> 01:16:31.950
it makes you appreciate the days that are high.

1334
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:36.920
<v 8>I was just reading this,
I'm reading this book called um,</v>

1335
01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.860
the spirits cutting through spiritual materialism and it's by this Tibetan monk

1336
01:16:41.861 --> 01:16:44.320
named Chogyam Trungpa who,
um,

1337
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.350
was just writing about this thing that you're saying and he was saying

1338
01:16:47.351 --> 01:16:52.210
disappointment.
Disappointment is one of the great states to be in to,

1339
01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:55.870
uh,
for for growth and for spirituality.

1340
01:16:55.871 --> 01:17:00.310
Because disappointment means you're having a contact with truth.

1341
01:17:00.610 --> 01:17:02.680
It generally means you're having a contact with truth.

1342
01:17:02.681 --> 01:17:05.860
Something has gone against your expectation,
which is how the universe works.

1343
01:17:05.861 --> 01:17:10.400
And then you find yourself in what he describes as like just the rocky terrain

1344
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:14.090
of truth.
So now the relationship that you thought might work out,

1345
01:17:14.210 --> 01:17:17.660
but you knew it wouldn't,
it didn't,
or your mom has died,

1346
01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:22.250
or you just put your dog to sleep.
Now you're experiencing reality.

1347
01:17:22.251 --> 01:17:25.520
You're experiencing the fact that you are in a Maelstrom of Adam's,

1348
01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:28.640
that 10 that will inevitably dissipate and nothing is.

1349
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:32.210
And that is a really intense fucking place to be in.

1350
01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.810
But he doesn't say stay in a place of disappointment.

1351
01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:40.010
He says that to move past that place into the next place,

1352
01:17:40.011 --> 01:17:45.011
which is the incredible peace and joy that comes from recognizing that you're

1353
01:17:45.630 --> 01:17:49.670
part of this infinite non-ending changing,

1354
01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:52.670
beautiful thing.
You've got to recognize the first part,

1355
01:17:52.671 --> 01:17:55.910
which is you're not going to last.
Nothing's going to last.

1356
01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:58.310
No one you know is going to survive this thing.

1357
01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:01.640
Everything that you've ever said will be lost in time.

1358
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:05.180
We are all part of an infinite shifting,
changing thing.

1359
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:10.360
And what's causing you the problems is your desire to hold on to a form,

1360
01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:13.220
to hold onto the idea of this is who I am.

1361
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.790
This is how things are always going to be.
This is going to last forever.

1362
01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:21.110
That conception will always cause you pain if you have a hangover.
No.

1363
01:18:21.111 --> 01:18:23.570
If you're having a terrible trip and you start thinking,

1364
01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:27.800
I'm going to be freaking out forever,
man,
that will only make the trip worse.

1365
01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.200
And if you're with someone you love and you think I'm going to be with this

1366
01:18:30.201 --> 01:18:31.034
person forever,

1367
01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.610
you're setting yourself up for some pretty severe disappointment because you

1368
01:18:34.611 --> 01:18:35.420
won't.

1369
01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:39.950
And so that disappointment that comes from realizing that that's the place where

1370
01:18:39.951 --> 01:18:44.750
you start growing.
How do you Krishna
disappointed while you're freaking me out,

1371
01:18:44.751 --> 01:18:48.140
but the trestle buckle fucking with my head.
Duncan Trussell.

1372
01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:50.170
I walked through the heat of the sun was up.

1373
01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:53.270
I don't think we all need Elton John Song.
There's a,

1374
01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.360
there's an old expression that a wise man learns from the mistakes of others.

1375
01:18:56.361 --> 01:19:00.230
A fool learns from his own.
Yes.
You know,
I think that,
I don't know.

1376
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:05.030
I don't know if we need to have massive fucking chaos for people to understand

1377
01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:08.120
and appreciate how cool life can be,
but it helps.

1378
01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.190
And the people that I know that are the most interesting,

1379
01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:13.940
all had fucked up lives.
All of us.
They all,
I fucked up lives.

1380
01:19:13.941 --> 01:19:17.060
None of nobody here in this room was on the Brady bunch.
Well,

1381
01:19:17.061 --> 01:19:19.130
it gets you out there,
man.
It's like,
you know,

1382
01:19:19.131 --> 01:19:23.120
you always hear about people who it's who get cancer and then all of a sudden

1383
01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.900
they're skydiving.
They're like running from the bulls.

1384
01:19:26.901 --> 01:19:31.130
They're doing anything they want.
They're talking guys,
right.
Telling the truth.

1385
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:34.080
They're telling the truth.
And that's really,
that's really,
um,

1386
01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:36.080
I think that's like a,
that's a,

1387
01:19:36.081 --> 01:19:39.740
that's a tragic thing in the sense that for people to actually start

1388
01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:44.210
appreciating their existence,
they have to be a dying.
You know,

1389
01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.940
dying is in within a year.
We're all dying.

1390
01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:49.880
But it's like suddenly when you wake up to the fact that you're dying,

1391
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:53.750
that's when you actually are born.
And a lot of people don't get that.
Yeah.

1392
01:19:53.751 --> 01:19:55.380
There's a wake up call.
There's that,

1393
01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:59.840
that reality check when this was the real game.
Yes.
Is the real shit man.

1394
01:19:59.870 --> 01:20:03.740
And you're really affecting people.
Well,
it's so easy to get complacent.

1395
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:05.510
It's so easy to just get lazy.

1396
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:08.160
So easily just look at life and not appreciate the fuck

1397
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:11.420
<v 5>out of this crazy ride we're on.
Yeah.
Especially us.
We're,
we're,</v>

1398
01:20:11.490 --> 01:20:15.180
we're on the craziest ride of all the,
the ride of the professional comedian,

1399
01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:20.160
you know,
we get drugs from the audience,
we tell jokes and they give us drugs.

1400
01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:23.820
Like the drug of laughter,
that's a drug.
We're all addicted to it.

1401
01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.110
The drug of killing,

1402
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:28.880
<v 1>you know,
man,
I think it's a crazy ride,
but I think the whole,
any,</v>

1403
01:20:28.881 --> 01:20:32.950
if you have been blasted out of a pussy onto this planet,

1404
01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:35.560
you're having a crazy ride.
Everyone you are.

1405
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:37.570
There's no way to not have a crazy ride.

1406
01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:40.720
And the was just young and Brian put her on camera.

1407
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:43.450
Why you talking to me about rise died.

1408
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:46.690
Trussell I'm going to ride back home to my bed.

1409
01:20:46.691 --> 01:20:51.380
You keep talking and I'll fuck you too fucking they're obese.

1410
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:56.350
Just started smoking weed a week.
He would say that for the first like 10 years,

1411
01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:59.500
Joe Rogan been smoking weed for a year.
You've been smoking weed for two years.

1412
01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:03.940
Joe Rogan,
you've been smoking weed for three years.
Shut the fuck up.
Joe Rogan.

1413
01:21:03.941 --> 01:21:06.100
It's only been 10 years.
You don't even know about weed yet.

1414
01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:10.070
I have four more years.
Then you understand the nuance,
the subtleties,
sorry.

1415
01:21:10.071 --> 01:21:14.350
In a fucking Twat is Rogan.

1416
01:21:14.351 --> 01:21:15.640
It's been fucking half your life.

1417
01:21:15.970 --> 01:21:18.940
There's a whole half of your life you did without weed,
so shut the fuck up.

1418
01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:22.420
<v 5>You did and all.
Yeah.
It's amazing what you did do without the,</v>

1419
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:26.170
we'd like now to shut it off for a while.
God.
God,
hello.
We're really happened.

1420
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:30.440
Yeah.
God,
Praise Eddie Bravo.
Praise Zeus and praise Odin.
Freddy Bravo.

1421
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:32.330
Because if it wasn't for him,
I would've never started smoking weed.

1422
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:33.800
I thought it was for losers.

1423
01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.290
That'd be so weird to see the difference in your life.
Yeah,

1424
01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:41.210
I'd probably be like way more aggro.
It's,
um,
it's a beneficial substance,

1425
01:21:41.211 --> 01:21:41.511
man.

1426
01:21:41.511 --> 01:21:44.450
And that's the real problem that I have with people that want to go on and on

1427
01:21:44.451 --> 01:21:47.480
about people who are addicted to it.
Like,
you know,
I love doctor drew.

1428
01:21:47.481 --> 01:21:49.130
I think he's a good person.
I really do.

1429
01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:52.520
But whenever I hear him talk about people being addicted to weed,
I'm like,

1430
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:55.580
let's get all those people that are addicted to it in the room and find out what

1431
01:21:55.581 --> 01:21:59.720
the fuck else is going on.
I guarantee you,
you,
you,
you shouldn't blame weed.

1432
01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:03.490
It's not a physically addictive thing.
I always feel something.

1433
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:06.650
I always feel that you have an addictive personality.
You know,

1434
01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:10.040
we've discussed when you were on the cone with the listening and quake quake

1435
01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:15.270
dropping this on me and I'm like,
where's this dog?
You don't know.

1436
01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.880
When I used to leave you guys at the store,

1437
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:19.790
I go home and I played til seven in the morning.

1438
01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:22.460
And for people to recognize that that's what it,

1439
01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:25.990
that's what a gift comes in because somebody would write that off.
Like,

1440
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.820
that's just what he does every fucking night in the morning.

1441
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:33.350
And it's weird how I have always believed,
especially for me,

1442
01:22:33.351 --> 01:22:36.680
it's always been the transfer of addictions.
Okay.

1443
01:22:36.710 --> 01:22:40.640
And then at the end of the game,
he was just the simplest way of solution.

1444
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:43.130
If you're going to have a fucking light addiction,

1445
01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:47.990
you might as well let it be the cheapest and the less harmful and the mines,

1446
01:22:47.991 --> 01:22:52.280
it's always been the weight,
you know,
it makes me better at night when I ride,

1447
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:56.060
it makes me,
they'll calms me down in the daytime,
you know,
whatever.

1448
01:22:56.061 --> 01:23:00.220
I make it believe that it does.
It fucking does.
If it's not a make belief,

1449
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:04.970
I know you.
I see what happens when you get high.
Well,
it first of all,

1450
01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:06.070
never see you sober.

1451
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:09.940
<v 4>Not You sent me so three times,
but you've seen him.
He's documented them.</v>

1452
01:23:09.941 --> 01:23:13.720
I wrote them down.
Believe Joey Diaz is sober and then I look at his pocket.

1453
01:23:13.721 --> 01:23:15.260
He's got an empty chair.
But you rappers,

1454
01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:19.030
I might be incorrect number is a relative term,

1455
01:23:20.530 --> 01:23:23.170
but it's really weird.
Like sometimes I go,
you know what,
Monday,

1456
01:23:23.171 --> 01:23:24.380
I'm not going to leave smoking that though.

1457
01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.550
Eat nothing and by Tuesday is not like I'm Jonesing.

1458
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.620
I'll just find myself with a joint,

1459
01:23:29.621 --> 01:23:34.120
a five or the afternoon when I'm writing something more,
but I like it guys.

1460
01:23:34.121 --> 01:23:38.380
Out of all the addictions,
whether it's going to strip clubs,
drinking,
gambling.

1461
01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.730
I could been hooked on a thousand fucking things.
We ended up with reefer.

1462
01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:46.960
I enjoy it as a ritual.
I enjoy it as a ritual before I write.

1463
01:23:47.410 --> 01:23:51.940
I enjoy it as a ritual like before we do podcasts.
I like it as a ritual.

1464
01:23:51.941 --> 01:23:53.980
I like it.
It's like signifies that we're,

1465
01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:56.890
we're going to shut off our phones and get into this space.

1466
01:23:57.090 --> 01:23:59.950
Whether it's a space of doing stand up by the space of writing or the space of

1467
01:23:59.951 --> 01:24:03.820
doing a podcast.
I like it in that way,
but also like the facts.

1468
01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:08.560
The facts are undeniable man for me is that introspective aspect of it that you

1469
01:24:08.561 --> 01:24:11.350
talked about earlier is so important.
Very important.

1470
01:24:11.351 --> 01:24:14.800
I've been talking about it on stage.
The,
the term paranoia.

1471
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:17.410
You know the people like,
I don't like weed.
It makes me paranoid.
I'm like,

1472
01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.410
you really should be paranoid.
If you're paying attention,

1473
01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:23.890
do you really want to just open yourself up to all the possibilities?

1474
01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:28.450
It's insanity out there.
Everywhere you go,
you're a bag of blood,

1475
01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:32.080
a fleshy bag that's holding a couple of gallons of blood,

1476
01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:33.550
and if any of it spills out,

1477
01:24:33.551 --> 01:24:36.990
you're fucking doomed and you're running around in metal boxes.

1478
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.840
Everybody's flying by going 60 plus miles an hour.

1479
01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.540
They don't know what the fuck they're doing.
They're running over motorcycles.

1480
01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:47.350
You see that shit in New York.
She that she see that shit and for motorcycles,

1481
01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.320
the motors.
Well,
he ain't,
there was some craziness that went on.

1482
01:24:50.321 --> 01:24:54.430
I don't know who started water,
who did what,
but I know that that dude ran over.

1483
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:58.060
I've got the bikers could have been,
however,

1484
01:24:58.061 --> 01:25:02.440
how he handled it might have been incorrect also,
I don't know what happened.

1485
01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:04.810
The Guy,
the guy got,

1486
01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:09.040
apparently someone slowed down in front of him and he bumped the bike and then

1487
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:11.520
the guy stopped his bike and they,
they're,
they're the,

1488
01:25:11.521 --> 01:25:14.590
the assumption is that the guy did it on purpose being a dick and he was trying

1489
01:25:14.591 --> 01:25:16.900
to box in this guy in the truck and make him slow down.

1490
01:25:17.170 --> 01:25:21.220
We also don't know what their interaction was before this video started.

1491
01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:24.240
We don't know if this had been going on for a while,
like maybe the,

1492
01:25:24.241 --> 01:25:28.030
the biker panicked and cut someone off the bike or was an agent driver.

1493
01:25:28.031 --> 01:25:31.900
I'm not saying,
I'm not saying,
I'm not saying the agent drivers are terrible,

1494
01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:35.530
but a lot of Asian drivers are terrible.
Are We?
Are we,

1495
01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:38.710
are we in agreement on this?
But that doesn't mean it's not,
it's not that.

1496
01:25:38.970 --> 01:25:42.700
It's not that all of them are terrible,
but it,
that is the goddamn stereotype.

1497
01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.900
Okay.
And I'm not saying that this guy is responsible goddamn stairs.

1498
01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:50.800
It's like 99.9% it's the God damn stereotype.
And it's not,
it's not 100% true,

1499
01:25:50.801 --> 01:25:54.400
of course.
Just like it's not 100% true that all Italians beat their wives.
Okay.

1500
01:25:54.401 --> 01:25:57.690
But that,
and me being Italian,
I can say that,
but,

1501
01:25:58.110 --> 01:26:00.820
but the reality is is that this guy,

1502
01:26:01.090 --> 01:26:03.470
we in the video drives over there,

1503
01:26:03.471 --> 01:26:07.460
they're yelling at him and he drives over this bike and drives over a guy and

1504
01:26:07.461 --> 01:26:11.330
broke his body.
Mean the guy he drove over him with a fucking SUV.
Yeah.

1505
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:14.870
I don't know if that had to have happened.
I don't know.

1506
01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:16.490
I don't know what happened before that.

1507
01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.030
I certainly think it's a terrible tragedy on both ends that the guy in the car

1508
01:26:20.031 --> 01:26:23.090
got beat up and that the guy got ran over.
It's a terrible tragedy.

1509
01:26:23.091 --> 01:26:26.690
But besides my,
my horrible racist Asian joke,

1510
01:26:26.691 --> 01:26:29.600
which I apologize for profusely,
I was just joking around and making a point,

1511
01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:33.380
but I don't know what happened.
I really don't know what happened.
So,

1512
01:26:33.381 --> 01:26:34.460
but when I'm looking at,
I'm looking,

1513
01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:38.390
I look at a guy who drove over somebody and then I looked at another guy went

1514
01:26:38.391 --> 01:26:41.840
insane and beat the guys window in like,
why has a baby in the car?

1515
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:45.500
So to me it says tragedy on both sides.
It's a tragedy.

1516
01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:50.360
It's a tragedy of over,
over reacting on both sides.
For sure.

1517
01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:52.520
A horrible tragedy.
Yeah,
it sucks.

1518
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.920
Horrible tragedy that the guy who got pulled out of his car and beat up,

1519
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:57.090
horrible tragedy,
that guy got polos calling.

1520
01:26:57.110 --> 01:27:00.500
He got pulled out and he got beat up.
You got up face?
Yeah.

1521
01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:04.670
Well there was all this glass that broke too,
cause the guy broke the window.

1522
01:27:04.671 --> 01:27:08.070
He's breaking the window with his helmet and smashing the window with his
helmet.

1523
01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.940
It's,
the whole thing is crazy.
And the whole thing is spike strip out.

1524
01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:15.200
Did they really?
That's what I rad.
What's a spike strip?
Potts popped his tires.

1525
01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:18.970
Who threw it out?
The bikers.
They had a spike strip line is what I read.
Okay.

1526
01:27:18.971 --> 01:27:22.730
You are not googling this.
You're not even trying to substantiate this.
Google it.

1527
01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:26.450
Okay,
I'll pull it up.
Okay.
Bikers threw down spike strip.
Okay,
here we go.

1528
01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:29.960
You know,
I'm watching this and I'm thinking,
you know,
you,
your wife,
your kid,

1529
01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:35.720
what the fuck?
I know they're there.
Also there was,
there was um,
um,

1530
01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:38.570
tinted windows so they might not be able to see that this guy had his wife and

1531
01:27:38.571 --> 01:27:41.600
his kid in the car.
Um,

1532
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:44.600
it doesn't say that Duncan,
I read it.

1533
01:27:47.210 --> 01:27:51.650
Isis plates on the things,
uh,
biker Bra.

1534
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.010
They popped his tires.
That's why I couldn't keep going.
No,

1535
01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:59.990
I'm apparently someone stabbed his tire.
Did.
That was one of the,
uh,
one of the,

1536
01:27:59.991 --> 01:28:02.030
that's not real.
Dot.
Brian,
you can't trick me.

1537
01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:03.200
I know what a video game looks like.

1538
01:28:03.201 --> 01:28:06.140
You Fuck it looks pretty God damn good though.
Look how good that looks.

1539
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:10.310
Isn't an amazing,
like the textures of the road.
It's so beautiful.
Oh,

1540
01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:14.340
show the timelapse show.
Have you seen that?
The timelapse I'm still fascinated.

1541
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:16.090
I'm never going to get into this game.
I've,

1542
01:28:16.091 --> 01:28:19.310
well I cannot do it because it's just too,
it's,
it looks like it's too good.

1543
01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:22.100
Have you not having had him lay down at all?
No,
I know me man.

1544
01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:24.530
I don't fuck around.
I know me.
I'm crazy.

1545
01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.640
What about this oculus rift thing in Kuwait?
I said,
I know me bitch.

1546
01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:33.410
Quake is supposed to be oculus rift friendly at all the things I'm allowing

1547
01:28:33.411 --> 01:28:36.110
myself at.
All the things that get me crazy addicted.

1548
01:28:36.230 --> 01:28:40.220
I'm allowing myself to just fuck with pool because the pool is,

1549
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:43.610
I think I get something out of it that I don't get out of video games.

1550
01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:48.710
I get like a a body calmness because it's all about like meditating on the

1551
01:28:48.711 --> 01:28:52.670
distance that the ball was going to go and calming yourself down and putting

1552
01:28:52.671 --> 01:28:54.890
yourself into a very sensitive state where you're playing.

1553
01:28:55.190 --> 01:28:58.460
I don't get that from video games,
so when I looked at it objectively,
I'm like,

1554
01:28:58.550 --> 01:29:00.620
like Joey said he got addictions.
You know,

1555
01:29:00.621 --> 01:29:03.480
you've got to pick which is the best one.
And for me the best one is pool.

1556
01:29:05.530 --> 01:29:09.330
Yeah.
Oh Nice.
Is it to go to a,
I mean,

1557
01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:14.140
I don't even like a nice pool halls if I'm going to go to a pool or I want to

1558
01:29:14.141 --> 01:29:17.520
see it for what it is,
but I don't mind stupidity like hard times.

1559
01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:20.790
You ever go to hard times with me?
You have been a hard time.
Where have we gone?

1560
01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:24.090
Went to the old Hollywood billiards,
which was an awesome,
right?

1561
01:29:24.091 --> 01:29:29.091
We went to the place in New York City 10 years ago cause it go in Manhattan and

1562
01:29:29.791 --> 01:29:33.600
then we went somewhere else.
That was Chelsea.
We went to Chelsea billiards.

1563
01:29:34.170 --> 01:29:38.670
That was a Chelsea billions after.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Chelsea billions after.

1564
01:29:38.671 --> 01:29:41.960
I think it had already changed names.
Chelsea billiards was the legendary places.

1565
01:29:41.961 --> 01:29:43.560
Like sometimes they'll see me wear this jacket.

1566
01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:46.600
It's like a varsity jacket that says Chelsea billiards in the back.

1567
01:29:46.601 --> 01:29:47.370
Have you seen that?

1568
01:29:47.370 --> 01:29:51.900
That at an all time great pool halls for pool hustlers and action.

1569
01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:55.590
That's the greatest or one of the greatest next to hard times in California,

1570
01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:57.390
one of the greatest in the history of the world.

1571
01:29:57.510 --> 01:30:01.640
That places a 24 hour pool hall where half the people in there,

1572
01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:02.730
you'd go at three o'clock in the morning,

1573
01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:05.220
half the people in there were vagrants that could rob you,

1574
01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:06.810
but I mean Robbie playing pool,

1575
01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:10.230
they could get out homeless dudes who knew how to fucking get out.

1576
01:30:10.231 --> 01:30:12.600
They knew how to play safety,
know that fuck you up.

1577
01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:14.490
They would get you on those tables.
Especially at gap,

1578
01:30:14.491 --> 01:30:18.150
what they would call a gaff table is a table where one pocket rolls to the
right.

1579
01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:19.950
And if you know that pocket rolls to the right,

1580
01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:22.200
you could put someone in a position where they don't think they can make the

1581
01:30:22.201 --> 01:30:25.030
ball but they can't.
And you know it a little shit.

1582
01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:27.900
Things like you can scratch on shots where you don't think you can have,

1583
01:30:27.901 --> 01:30:31.530
you know,
a table,
especially what they call a gaff table.
It's,
it's huge,

1584
01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:34.620
very important.
If you're a pool player on the team advantage,

1585
01:30:34.630 --> 01:30:36.810
which is rob people,
they would rob people.

1586
01:30:36.811 --> 01:30:40.590
But there was also like really high stakes gambling between like high level pros

1587
01:30:40.591 --> 01:30:45.420
to really interesting stuff to watch both the drunks getting robbed and then you

1588
01:30:45.421 --> 01:30:46.201
know,
by the,
the,

1589
01:30:46.201 --> 01:30:49.600
the hustlers and then the real big sharks come in and they would,
you know,

1590
01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:52.140
match up and put the money on the light.
And you know you're in,

1591
01:30:52.141 --> 01:30:54.210
you're in the middle of fucking New York City.
Dude,

1592
01:30:54.211 --> 01:30:57.960
it's four o'clock in the morning and dudes are playing for $10,000 and when

1593
01:30:57.961 --> 01:31:01.020
you're a kid and you're watching that and you know it's a,
it's an exciting shit.

1594
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:02.730
That was a part for me.

1595
01:31:02.731 --> 01:31:07.731
It was like being a part of this really rare underground society that I knew was

1596
01:31:07.891 --> 01:31:09.210
not going to last very long.

1597
01:31:09.450 --> 01:31:13.110
Like I'm like this crazy 24 hour pool hall life where people were players and

1598
01:31:13.111 --> 01:31:16.060
the gambling and they're bringing their own money and then that matching up and

1599
01:31:16.061 --> 01:31:17.340
he barking at each other.

1600
01:31:17.341 --> 01:31:19.640
You ain't got no heart and they're fucking get in there.

1601
01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.660
That's a crazy underground world.
These guys were making a living,

1602
01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:26.050
paying their bills completely off the grid,
no taxes,
no nothing.

1603
01:31:26.051 --> 01:31:27.660
No one's no tax it.
Stop,
stop,
stop.

1604
01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.700
I'm staying at this fucking boarding house down the street does.
I'm in a,

1605
01:31:30.701 --> 01:31:33.270
I'm in a house with 10 other dudes.
I got my pool cue,

1606
01:31:33.271 --> 01:31:35.040
I put it under my blanket when I sleep.

1607
01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:38.460
I get up in the morning and I go down to Chelsea and you're like,
whoa,

1608
01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:40.140
these guys were living there.

1609
01:31:40.170 --> 01:31:44.610
They were getting an education in this gangster life at this 24 hour pool hall.

1610
01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.520
I know several dudes.
You've got arrested while I was playing there.

1611
01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:51.950
One Dude who was a three card Monte champion.
He would,
he was a bad motherfucker.

1612
01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:53.880
Three card money.
He's just slick Puerto Rican dude.

1613
01:31:53.881 --> 01:31:56.760
He would go out and he'd just have all these dumb white people from Nebraska

1614
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:59.980
that had never been to New York City before and he would be doing this three

1615
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.680
<v 2>card Monte Shit and this is all before the Internet and they couldn't,</v>

1616
01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:05.400
you know they would come on right up here sir.
You look like a winner.

1617
01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:07.990
You looked like you know how to play a game,
my friend.
Come on over here dog.

1618
01:32:08.110 --> 01:32:10.780
How much money you got on you,
my friend,
my friend.
Where are you from?

1619
01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:14.410
Do you got a beautiful suit?
That's a beautiful suit.
Does that a,
is that Amani?

1620
01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:17.140
What is that bro?
Yo,
that's beautiful.
Hey listen man,

1621
01:32:17.141 --> 01:32:18.310
this is a game called three car.
Mine.

1622
01:32:18.311 --> 01:32:20.290
We just like to have a little fun here in New York City.
Especially.

1623
01:32:20.291 --> 01:32:23.970
People come in for the first time.
They're showing you real simple,
real simple.

1624
01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:26.990
This is the three of them and now they're giving it to you Duncan.

1625
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:29.530
They can give it to Jessie.
I'll give you a couple of free one gets it.

1626
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:31.150
There it is.
Bam.
There you go.

1627
01:32:31.151 --> 01:32:33.830
You will just want him some money and all of sudden there's a partner next to

1628
01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:34.900
him.
So how do we do it?

1629
01:32:34.901 --> 01:32:38.180
You see the partner getting close to then y'all got to Blackton,
right?

1630
01:32:38.181 --> 01:32:39.490
You got a Pete and Duncan,

1631
01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:43.270
he showed it to you and the next thing you know Dunkin,
it all goes to hell.

1632
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:45.580
Well this is the cups and there's also three card money.

1633
01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:48.490
There's the cups we tried to figure out to is free carb mine on Sunday.

1634
01:32:48.491 --> 01:32:53.491
The 20 goes down and the guy wins and the next 20 goes down again and the guy

1635
01:32:53.851 --> 01:32:56.110
doubles his money and that's it.

1636
01:32:56.111 --> 01:33:00.850
Now he gets the guy from the brass would come in and throw 40 and he ones and

1637
01:33:00.851 --> 01:33:02.680
the wife is like,
do it again,
do it again.

1638
01:33:02.681 --> 01:33:04.180
Cause everybody wants to come to New York.

1639
01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:09.050
You ever seen a guy try to walk away with
Yo,
they will attack

1640
01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:13.300
that table going,
this is a table Dunkin.

1641
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:16.600
So right there they'd have two guys suck then and one of their own.

1642
01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:20.320
So you'd be working with me and you're 20 you'd be doubling up.

1643
01:33:20.321 --> 01:33:22.210
You're already won one this.

1644
01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:25.930
But I know I got three people in the audience and I at the Tyson and I'm letting

1645
01:33:25.931 --> 01:33:28.570
them know they're going to win.
They just come to New York.
You know what?

1646
01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:31.090
I got $200 in my pocket.
If I double it,

1647
01:33:31.091 --> 01:33:33.490
that's $400 I mean this is how you're thinking right there.

1648
01:33:33.491 --> 01:33:37.000
It's a do or die situation.
And all of a sudden right there when they got you,

1649
01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:38.460
boom,
the black Bam,

1650
01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:42.310
they take up 1200 the Puerto Rican yells the police and they take that money and

1651
01:33:42.311 --> 01:33:46.780
sweet tourist to like what the fuck?
And they're gone just happened.
Hey,

1652
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.100
and the guy's got a carton,

1653
01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:51.220
like a bottom of a carton for cans and he just throws it up in the air and

1654
01:33:51.221 --> 01:33:53.380
that's it.
That's their residence.
It's a carton,

1655
01:33:53.650 --> 01:33:56.290
the three cups of gun and the beans and their fucking mouth,

1656
01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:59.320
and they're walking on the street and there ain't no fucking cops and they're

1657
01:33:59.321 --> 01:34:02.410
all gone in different directions and now they hook up again and I will at the

1658
01:34:02.411 --> 01:34:05.830
same place.
And they do that same scamming and they would do that five times,

1659
01:34:05.831 --> 01:34:08.140
make six grand.
That's how good it was.

1660
01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:10.210
I got caught on one day with a buddy of mine.

1661
01:34:10.630 --> 01:34:12.760
They took me for 20 the guy was yelling at me,

1662
01:34:13.090 --> 01:34:16.690
next know guys that was with laid out 20 a piece,
Bam,

1663
01:34:16.691 --> 01:34:20.620
60 bucks and next thing you know,
boom,
the police,
they blow a whistle.

1664
01:34:20.830 --> 01:34:25.510
What's going on here?
The cops,
everybody runs I think tremendous.

1665
01:34:25.511 --> 01:34:28.330
They got your money.
Fucking tremendous man.

1666
01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:32.410
You know when you made that turn on 42nd street?
It was,

1667
01:34:32.411 --> 01:34:37.411
it was when you were 1312 it was something that already says that when you walk

1668
01:34:38.231 --> 01:34:38.770
around to it,

1669
01:34:38.770 --> 01:34:42.880
you walked past people you know and all of I'm sudden like go under that breath.

1670
01:34:42.881 --> 01:34:45.370
They'll go weed and like five feet.

1671
01:34:45.371 --> 01:34:48.100
You've look around and go look at you and Austin.
They come back up to you.

1672
01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:51.340
It was completely different when you cut that corner on 42nd street,

1673
01:34:51.341 --> 01:34:55.750
Dunkin you to hit every drug in the world.
Weed,

1674
01:34:55.810 --> 01:34:57.040
marijuana to

1675
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:00.200
<v 0>joints,
loose joints,
acid.</v>

1676
01:35:01.690 --> 01:35:05.260
Because the acid in the Spanish,
I see them.
No fucking Aussie though.

1677
01:35:05.530 --> 01:35:08.110
Fucking marihuana headwind.
Okay.

1678
01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:11.540
Now but equal fucking with different God.

1679
01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:15.380
I was stupid rich like Bill Gates rich.

1680
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:19.730
I would by Chelsea billiards and I would reinstate it.

1681
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:22.760
I would bring it back.
I'd make it 24 hours a day.

1682
01:35:22.761 --> 01:35:25.340
I'd make it the last bastion of the pool house is open.

1683
01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:31.120
It's like some fo pool hall now where they have like red cloth and fucking shiny

1684
01:35:31.641 --> 01:35:34.340
lights and they play horrible music.
That makes me want to throw up.

1685
01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:38.150
If you go to a pool hall and not playing Classic Rock,
turn around,

1686
01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:41.390
turn around and leave.
Just if you walk in,

1687
01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:44.000
if you don't hear some layered scattered,
some Smith,

1688
01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.890
if you don't hear sweet home Alabama,

1689
01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:50.870
get out of there cause they got red cloth and you plan on buckets and no one's

1690
01:35:50.871 --> 01:35:54.290
level these fucking tables.
It's a disaster.
It's not real pool.

1691
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:58.880
I only didn't he get is an old hamburger or fucking bag of fries.

1692
01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:02.120
The place that I used to play out in white plains,
New Jersey or white plains,

1693
01:36:02.121 --> 01:36:05.590
New York got turned into a disco.
It's basically a disco now.

1694
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.270
It was executive billiards executive.

1695
01:36:08.271 --> 01:36:10.850
Billy is in white plains right down the street from Nicky's pizza.

1696
01:36:10.851 --> 01:36:13.670
The greatest white pizza the the earth has ever known.
If you want to,

1697
01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:17.000
if you want to get off your gluten free diet,
go to fucking white plains,

1698
01:36:17.001 --> 01:36:19.490
New York.
Go to Nicki's pizza and get the white pizza.

1699
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:21.080
It's got white cheese on it.

1700
01:36:21.081 --> 01:36:25.670
Ricotta cheese with garlic and olive oil and it will knock your Dick Right into

1701
01:36:25.671 --> 01:36:30.320
the cat litter box.
It's an unfuck unbelievably good.

1702
01:36:32.150 --> 01:36:34.310
It's better than better than digging the dirt.

1703
01:36:34.311 --> 01:36:35.600
I was just struggling for a metaphor.

1704
01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.020
Cat Litter box better than your dick in a pile of shit.

1705
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.730
Those crumbs stick into the tip of your helmet.
The uh,
the,

1706
01:36:44.731 --> 01:36:49.070
the place was like a great place back in the day,
in the 90s.
That was the spot.

1707
01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:52.010
Like pool hustlers would come in from all over the world.
They would come,

1708
01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:55.520
like there was step make stops in New York if were in the New York area,

1709
01:36:55.521 --> 01:36:57.740
there's a few places they would play and one of them was,

1710
01:36:57.741 --> 01:37:00.150
they would always check in and executive and you know,
if you were,

1711
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:04.370
my buddy owned the place,
so he'd be on the phone,
you know,
and then get a call,

1712
01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.980
you know,
in the,
in like the middle of the day,
you know,

1713
01:37:06.981 --> 01:37:10.490
he's a Polish and balls and shit.
And he'd get a call that Jake,

1714
01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:12.140
the snake is in town,
you know,

1715
01:37:12.141 --> 01:37:15.830
this is dude Jake the snake who played one pocket and you'd come down and you

1716
01:37:15.831 --> 01:37:18.450
know,
and they would call George the Greek.
This guy wants to play one pocket way.

1717
01:37:18.451 --> 01:37:22.250
This motherfucker's got no hot and then everybody would meet up at the pool hall

1718
01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:25.880
like 10 o'clock at night and you'd see the dude practicing knocking balls around

1719
01:37:25.881 --> 01:37:27.680
the table like,
oh shit,
it's going down.

1720
01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:30.620
And then they would put this big stack of money and there was this Guido

1721
01:37:30.621 --> 01:37:32.020
gangster dude who was always there.

1722
01:37:32.021 --> 01:37:34.520
He had a gun just in case somebody tried to rob a steak.

1723
01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:39.470
It was fucking crazy place to be a part of.
Sounds cool.
I was fucking,

1724
01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:42.350
it was run you nest.
It was a movie.
I mean it was,

1725
01:37:42.351 --> 01:37:47.270
it was like a crazy movie about the depression except there's no depression.

1726
01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:50.690
It was just going to diners and watching guys gamble their life away.

1727
01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:54.980
And me being a visitor in the world,
I was not really a player.

1728
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:56.280
I couldn't play that good.

1729
01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:59.220
<v 4>I played okay.
Like for a regular person I played amazing.</v>

1730
01:37:59.490 --> 01:38:02.890
But for these guys I would play and I would always lose.
And I've never,

1731
01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:06.480
I won like one or two tournament's ever.
Most of the time I would lose.

1732
01:38:06.690 --> 01:38:08.130
I'd have to get really lucky to win.

1733
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:12.990
So I got the chance to see these people lived entirely off of this one crazy

1734
01:38:12.991 --> 01:38:14.520
game.
That's all they did.

1735
01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:18.660
All they talked about was the different conditions of the cloth and what kind of

1736
01:38:18.661 --> 01:38:21.300
chocolate you using and what we're fucking tip have you got,

1737
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:23.940
you've got a sniper on this motherfucker.
When did you get the sniper?

1738
01:38:23.941 --> 01:38:25.320
Is that better?
And they would try.

1739
01:38:25.321 --> 01:38:28.620
Everybody's trying to constantly figuring out an edge because they're playing a

1740
01:38:28.621 --> 01:38:33.150
game where their life with the eat or no,
whether they go hungry,

1741
01:38:33.151 --> 01:38:38.151
whether they have money for a hotel room is all based on fractions of an inch

1742
01:38:38.850 --> 01:38:43.770
with a ball roll slightly to the left too far or bumps the other ball and gets

1743
01:38:43.771 --> 01:38:44.760
in the perfect position.

1744
01:38:44.810 --> 01:38:49.260
The the fucking differences between those things are the tiniest fraction and

1745
01:38:49.261 --> 01:38:52.020
the cue ball where you hit it and they're obsessed with it,

1746
01:38:52.021 --> 01:38:56.190
obsessed with the movements and just trying to live off those movements.

1747
01:38:56.470 --> 01:39:01.000
<v 1>That gives me an anxiety attack.
It's madness,</v>

1748
01:39:01.330 --> 01:39:04.810
but it's also beautiful when you watch it done right.
It's an art form.

1749
01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:07.720
That's what people don't understand about the game.
When people say,
Oh,

1750
01:39:07.721 --> 01:39:11.350
you're fucking boring.
You talk about pool.
It's just so fucking boring to me.

1751
01:39:11.351 --> 01:39:14.780
It's not,
trust me when you,
it's,

1752
01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.200
it's one of those things when you appreciate it,

1753
01:39:17.230 --> 01:39:21.160
when you know how difficult it is to do,
then it becomes an art form of ballet.

1754
01:39:21.190 --> 01:39:24.590
Exactly.
Exactly.
When you talk about scarp starcraft,

1755
01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:28.750
I go blank because I have no point of reference.
I don't understand the game.

1756
01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:31.660
I've never tried it.
I'm terrified of it.
I see you.

1757
01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:34.660
I see you fucking start sweating when you talk about it.

1758
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:38.290
I see your face starts sucking in like your body is trying to conserve water

1759
01:39:38.490 --> 01:39:40.210
cause you know you're not going to be your body.

1760
01:39:40.210 --> 01:39:43.930
You say starcraft and your body goes into like the hybrid native state where it

1761
01:39:43.931 --> 01:39:46.750
knows it's not going to get nutrition for the next three days.

1762
01:39:46.751 --> 01:39:48.580
Don't you lie that stuff you would stay quit.

1763
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.650
I didn't quit because of the addiction.

1764
01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:52.870
I quit because they demoted me to a bronze league again.

1765
01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:57.520
I'm not dealing with that shit anymore.
I'm like number 75 and bronze league.

1766
01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:02.260
I had made it up to the silver and then I,
man,
your ego reveals you my brother.

1767
01:40:02.290 --> 01:40:06.220
Why do you give a fuck if you're in bronze loop,
you BM bronze league,
Joe.

1768
01:40:06.221 --> 01:40:09.900
It's an end.
So I wouldn't even be in Bronson getting beaten by the dealers.

1769
01:40:10.090 --> 01:40:15.090
I would be an aluminum scrap aluminum playing against fourth graders who are

1770
01:40:15.311 --> 01:40:18.870
crushing me.
I used to play against somebody.
No,

1771
01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:21.910
it's why you ageist.
It's a young man's sport.

1772
01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.550
You're in the Atrius patriarchal household.

1773
01:40:25.090 --> 01:40:29.380
Your male a just privilege is showing you.

1774
01:40:30.010 --> 01:40:33.650
You basically hate women,
but it in your blog.
I don't care.
Basically hate women.

1775
01:40:33.670 --> 01:40:35.650
I'm going to have to blog about you Duncan Trussell.

1776
01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:40.480
If you hate women and you're an ageist.
I love women.
I hate bronze league.

1777
01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:43.780
I don't say I love women.
You know what I say?
I love Nice women.

1778
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:46.990
I don't say I love men either because a lot of men that are cunts,

1779
01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:50.300
a lot of men suck.
Remember we were talking about big foot.

1780
01:40:50.301 --> 01:40:54.010
Somebody actually killed him.
They didn't just kill one.
Oh,
you mean that game?

1781
01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:57.940
Spoiler that don't spoil it too.
Spoiler.
Hey,
don't spoil it.

1782
01:40:58.510 --> 01:41:00.310
Duncan thinks it's important.
Not Spoilers.

1783
01:41:00.850 --> 01:41:04.690
I'm not looking at show it to me offline.
Instead of,
Oh,
you son of a bitch.

1784
01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:07.810
Boy doesn't even care.
This is insubordination.
If this was any other company,

1785
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:08.833
if it was not,

1786
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:11.860
it was working for any other company besides the death squad as affiliated

1787
01:41:11.861 --> 01:41:15.310
company,
like the Freak Party.
Hey,
right here.
He gets him.
I don't give a fuck bro.

1788
01:41:15.490 --> 01:41:18.410
I don't want to see him shoot big foot.
Big Foot.
Probably a man.
Oh look.

1789
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:23.380
So sad.
That is sad.
Well,

1790
01:41:23.381 --> 01:41:25.570
let's put it something happy to balance this out.
Okay.

1791
01:41:25.571 --> 01:41:29.230
Pull up the Godzilla trailer.
Oh Dude.

1792
01:41:29.231 --> 01:41:34.180
They have Oppenheimer quoting the Bhagavad Gita.
Ah,
wonderful.
Brilliant.
Find it.

1793
01:41:34.181 --> 01:41:36.220
You've got to find it's on daily motion.
It's on my Twitter.

1794
01:41:36.221 --> 01:41:38.260
If you go to my Twitter,
it's one of the most recent posts,

1795
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:43.390
but it's the trailer for the new Godzilla.
No,
mother fucker does this look good.

1796
01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:44.410
Can't wait to see.

1797
01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:48.220
I got a three quarter staff just watching the first 10 seconds of the trailer.

1798
01:41:48.250 --> 01:41:50.230
I didn't even know.
I was just like,
oh,
they're doing it right.

1799
01:41:50.231 --> 01:41:52.890
They're doing it right.
It's not out.
Apparently it's a,

1800
01:41:52.891 --> 01:41:55.330
it's a concept and they were about,
they're building it right now,

1801
01:41:55.420 --> 01:42:00.040
but it's a Warner brothers.
Wait,
say a property,
check this shit out.
Sign.

1802
01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:03.670
Are you giving them
full attention?
Yeah.

1803
01:42:12.650 --> 01:42:16.150
<v 9>Two
people cried.</v>

1804
01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:20.050
Most people were silent.

1805
01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:25.060
<v 1>Look at this shit.
We're looking at smashed buildings.
You could find it online.</v>

1806
01:42:25.061 --> 01:42:27.570
Folks can stop the Internet.
You can't take p out of the ocean.

1807
01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:28.690
<v 9>Hindu scripture.</v>

1808
01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:30.530
<v 1>Tara seven.</v>

1809
01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:35.450
I don't know why they it to try to remove this for some reason like it's on

1810
01:42:35.451 --> 01:42:37.550
youtube sites.
It's pulled down.
You know what that is?

1811
01:42:37.670 --> 01:42:39.650
That's some ancient dumb ass thinking.

1812
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:42.270
That's some executives that don't get [inaudible]

1813
01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:43.370
<v 9>this motherfucker.</v>

1814
01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:52.640
No,
I am becoming a destroyer of worlds.

1815
01:42:58.260 --> 01:42:59.093
Okay,

1816
01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:17.090
<v 1>listen,
if that doesn't take,
get your Dick hard moved to France.
Alright,</v>

1817
01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:19.910
just go get the fuck out of America.

1818
01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:23.330
If that doesn't get your Dick hard quit.
Meanwhile,

1819
01:43:23.331 --> 01:43:26.780
the Japanese invented God's will.
By the way,

1820
01:43:26.781 --> 01:43:28.410
this sends a parody of a,

1821
01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:32.550
a really racist nationalistic American comes out in 2014

1822
01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:36.800
the well just the attitude that they have in creating that clip.

1823
01:43:36.801 --> 01:43:37.371
When you taught me,

1824
01:43:37.371 --> 01:43:40.120
you know you got Oppenheimer talking about the Bhagavad Gita and when they,

1825
01:43:40.330 --> 01:43:44.750
when they Oppenheimer for folks who don't know is the guy who like was the most

1826
01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:47.900
critical aspect.
The Manhattan project was a huge project obviously,

1827
01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:52.100
but the most critical aspect was Oppenheimer and he's as being the guy

1828
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:56.300
<v 0>who figured out how to make a fucking atomic bomb.
Yeah,
that fucking,</v>

1829
01:43:56.330 --> 01:44:01.310
that is an incredible verse,
man.
I have become death.
The destroyer of worlds.

1830
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:06.470
That is so bad ass dude.
That's really cool.
Yeah,

1831
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:09.160
so that's going to be,
that's going to be intense.
So big.

1832
01:44:09.190 --> 01:44:12.200
Bigfoot's dead and there you go.
There's a bunch of people say they saw it,

1833
01:44:12.201 --> 01:44:15.590
they've,
they've found bigfoot this week.
There's a new video,
a big foot,

1834
01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:18.050
and we won't even show it because I'm not gonna fucking salt you.

1835
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:23.030
The shit is read that.
That's not the idea.
This is more,
I didn't even,
big foot.

1836
01:44:23.070 --> 01:44:25.220
He thinks it doesn't have to it.
He's like,
Oh shit.

1837
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:28.310
Is this grand theft auto because it's got a mask.
They,

1838
01:44:28.311 --> 01:44:32.480
this is fucking huge spoiler dude.
Stop Brian.

1839
01:44:32.481 --> 01:44:34.600
That's so rude.
I hope some of the,

1840
01:44:34.601 --> 01:44:37.730
actually just use the grand theft auto engine to create that and that wasn't

1841
01:44:37.731 --> 01:44:40.790
real.
No,
this is the sleeping big foot and it's a female.
How did they know it?

1842
01:44:40.791 --> 01:44:43.790
Totally.
Well,
they smell this pussy pussy a mile away.

1843
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:48.260
Smell like a tuna that got hit with a musket line out there in the middle of the

1844
01:44:48.261 --> 01:44:51.980
woods.
What do you think it sounds?
It must be a female.

1845
01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:55.160
A male can't smell that fishy.
What is that?

1846
01:44:55.190 --> 01:44:59.470
This is a piece of a big fight.
Shit that they found.
Yeah,

1847
01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.210
that's mountain line shit.
It's got l Karen it dump console.

1848
01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:03.860
I'll tell you right now,
I've only been hunting for a year.

1849
01:45:03.861 --> 01:45:06.500
I can tell you what the fuck that is.
I might be wrong by the way.

1850
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:09.500
I'm very confident and what I did.
Don't mistake that for being accurate.

1851
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:15.740
This is a,
well,
these people are crazy as fuck.
Todd does hotel,

1852
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:20.780
who's a professor at Nyu,
who we had on that podcast.

1853
01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:25.190
If there's one thing that we answered on the Joe Rogan questions,
everything.

1854
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:26.930
It's not within our big foot is real,

1855
01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:32.050
but it's whether or not the evidence that has been purported to be big foot DNA

1856
01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:37.460
has been acquired in the most non contaminated way.

1857
01:45:37.461 --> 01:45:39.920
And that answer is clearly no,
this isn't,

1858
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:43.910
there's not a direct chain of command between finding this and like documenting

1859
01:45:43.911 --> 01:45:46.820
the fact these guys were rubber gloves.
They had masks on,

1860
01:45:46.821 --> 01:45:50.300
they picked this up with tweezers.
When you find human DNA,

1861
01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:54.140
it's amazing how easy it is for humans to get DNA on shit.

1862
01:45:54.141 --> 01:45:58.940
Now they can get DNA.
They,
if you sneeze,
if you breathe,

1863
01:45:58.970 --> 01:46:02.810
if you touch something with your sweaty skin,
you get human DNA on things.

1864
01:46:02.811 --> 01:46:05.180
It's incredible how sensitive these pieces of equipment are.

1865
01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:09.260
So when you get some fucking piece of shit that a hunter found the woods,

1866
01:46:09.261 --> 01:46:13.310
it was just squatch Turd squatch came by shit on my elk carcass.

1867
01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:16.520
You don't know what the fuck happened before that thing got to you.

1868
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:20.630
And when you start testing it,
it's very irresponsible scientifically.

1869
01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:23.330
So whether or not these people were telling the truth,
I believe they are.

1870
01:46:23.331 --> 01:46:26.630
I believe they really believe that it's a big foot Turd,
whether or not,

1871
01:46:26.631 --> 01:46:28.670
or hair or whatever the fuck they claim they have,

1872
01:46:28.671 --> 01:46:30.380
or many pieces of evidence that claim they have.

1873
01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:35.150
The real problem is all of them have been extracted from the crime scenes

1874
01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:40.180
unscientifically so me as executive bros or Duncan Trussell s cohost of Joe

1875
01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:45.650
Rogan questions,
everything we say,
go fuck yourself.
That shit ain't real son.

1876
01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:50.010
That's a fucking chick with a Sasquatch costume.
I really don't think

1877
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:53.220
<v 1>anyone thinks it's real though.
Even the news,
when they showed it on the news,</v>

1878
01:46:53.221 --> 01:46:55.590
they were like,
oh,
here we go again.
Oh,
that's not true.

1879
01:46:55.591 --> 01:46:58.650
I saw some dummies that were being interviewed that seemed like they really

1880
01:46:58.651 --> 01:47:00.600
believed in it.
That's so,
there was a few dummies.

1881
01:47:00.601 --> 01:47:02.430
I really think they acted like they believed in it.

1882
01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:04.440
<v 8>I don't know the answer,
man.
That's what,</v>

1883
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:08.150
that's what I learned from this show is I just,
I have no fucking idea and I,
and,

1884
01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:10.560
and anytime I think I know something,

1885
01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:13.260
it always turns out to be something wrong.

1886
01:47:13.261 --> 01:47:18.150
And generally if I let myself just be in the state of not knowing if things get

1887
01:47:18.151 --> 01:47:20.610
a lot more interesting anyway,
I don't know if there's a big foot,

1888
01:47:20.850 --> 01:47:23.070
there could be a big foot anywhere.
There could be undergrad.

1889
01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:26.010
They could live in the earth like Hornets in a hive.

1890
01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:30.620
<v 1>No,
it's more likely than bigfoot is that little tiny person thing.</v>

1891
01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:34.750
That orange pen deck.
Sure.
That's more likely they found these motherfuckers.

1892
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:39.530
14,000 years old,
Joey,
three feet tall,
hobbit dudes.
They had spears.

1893
01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:42.170
They might've like actually like a find them.

1894
01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:44.210
They found them on the island of Flores.

1895
01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:48.470
They're called the Homo Floresiensis IHSS or something,
something like that.

1896
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:51.800
They're there.
They were the real live 14,000 years ago.
They ain't shit.

1897
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:56.060
And they have legends about these little people who could fly or they rode birds

1898
01:47:56.061 --> 01:47:58.600
or something.
But you imagine those giant fucking get out.

1899
01:47:58.610 --> 01:48:02.270
How to fucking kidnap eagles.
How about this giant wasps?

1900
01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:05.060
Insane killing people in China.
And by the way,

1901
01:48:05.061 --> 01:48:09.530
this was like a week after we were talking about wasps on a podcast with Josh

1902
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:13.190
Barnett.
Josh Barnett obsessed with wasps.
How crazy gangster wasps are.

1903
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:16.100
And they could just fucking,
they kill everything.
They killed tarantulas.

1904
01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:20.060
There's videos of wasps fucking up trenches.
Cause wasps can keep stinging.

1905
01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:23.300
Have you ever been stung by a wasp?
They can kill you.
No,
I haven't,
but I have.

1906
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:27.530
It is awful.
The ones in,
you're seeing these Chinese ones are Japanese ones.

1907
01:48:27.710 --> 01:48:30.530
These are giant.
Oh,
he's are enormous wasps.

1908
01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:33.130
They're stingers or like hypodermic needles.
Yeah.

1909
01:48:33.190 --> 01:48:37.390
And they're just punching holes in Chinese.
Did the size of a small mouse.
Okay.

1910
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:39.170
It's a sense of a handle.
Fuck that.

1911
01:48:39.230 --> 01:48:42.820
Look at the size of that guy's hand or girl's hand.
Gowe should we say Gal?

1912
01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:46.550
That's it.
I don't to send anybody that's a last,
last young maiden.

1913
01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:49.370
I think it's a dude.
It looks like,
I hope.
I hope whoever they are,

1914
01:48:49.371 --> 01:48:54.240
they're not sensitive.
So dire.

1915
01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:56.660
It would be boom,
being so needy.
Oh,

1916
01:48:56.661 --> 01:48:59.030
can you imagine getting swarmed by one of those things?

1917
01:48:59.031 --> 01:49:03.890
Would they've killed 42 people and injured 160 plus in China over the past,

1918
01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:07.460
you know,
the past few months.
Well,
they don't know what's going on,
but these,

1919
01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:08.750
they're fucking huge.

1920
01:49:08.751 --> 01:49:12.560
I know what's going on at portals opened up to hell and those things are

1921
01:49:12.561 --> 01:49:16.880
climbing out of it.
The apocalypse is a slow moving event.
It's glacier like,

1922
01:49:17.210 --> 01:49:22.130
it's not like an asteroid.
The apocalypse.
There's no apocalypse.
Listen,

1923
01:49:22.131 --> 01:49:24.350
cock sucker.
You want to smell my ass?
That's the apocalypse.

1924
01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:30.620
I pulled my pants down.
I'll unleash that in and out.
Double double and your face.

1925
01:49:30.621 --> 01:49:32.330
Speaking of the fucking apocalypse,
man,

1926
01:49:32.331 --> 01:49:36.280
I got fucking hockey was riffed waiting in my house right now.
Don't get enough.

1927
01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:39.550
Don't get back.
You're sweaty,
man.
Why are you sweating?

1928
01:49:39.551 --> 01:49:42.200
You're not going anywhere because you're hanging out at the end of this podcast.

1929
01:49:42.230 --> 01:49:45.290
Where am I going?
There's people that are listening to this.
Depending on you.

1930
01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:48.190
Don't be so selfish.
Don't get caught up in the wave

1931
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:52.360
<v 8>of selfishness that is addition.
I wasn't going to abandon.
Oh,
it's not addiction.</v>

1932
01:49:52.361 --> 01:49:55.090
It's going into an alternate universe.

1933
01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:57.400
That's not addiction.

1934
01:49:57.401 --> 01:50:01.580
I want to see Skyrim in three D so I'm going to shit.

1935
01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:06.170
<v 0>Doon Doon Doon Doon Doon.
Wow.
Oh my God.
Fuck that.</v>

1936
01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:07.970
Oh my God.
Those are like puppies.

1937
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:12.990
Big is a photo of a guy or a gal with four of these giant Hornets.

1938
01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:18.470
You really do need to know if it's like a Shaquille O'Neal size hand or if it's

1939
01:50:18.471 --> 01:50:21.710
like a sand.
Yeah,
small.

1940
01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:26.040
Let's put it on the last little Lester's hands.
Little less stressed.

1941
01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:27.133
<v 8>Tiny.</v>

1942
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:33.180
<v 0>Hi,
Arizona's still these seats</v>

1943
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:36.550
DC Trussell what happened?
What did I miss?

1944
01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:40.870
He putting it in you taking those babies and getting them killed by Hornets and

1945
01:50:40.871 --> 01:50:44.980
your game.
You can't,
there's no gain in your mind.
If you had one though.

1946
01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:47.110
If you had a baby that was alone in the crib,

1947
01:50:47.111 --> 01:50:50.500
like the mom was on math and the mom fell asleep and the game is right next to

1948
01:50:50.501 --> 01:50:52.930
the baby passed out,
but a window opened up in a hornet,

1949
01:50:52.931 --> 01:50:53.980
figured out its way through.

1950
01:50:54.130 --> 01:50:57.070
Would you allow all the Hornets to come in and kill the baby just so you can see

1951
01:50:57.071 --> 01:50:57.830
what it would be like.

1952
01:50:57.830 --> 01:51:01.340
<v 8>This is like this.
This is like,
um,
what was that?</v>

1953
01:51:01.341 --> 01:51:05.090
What was that movie with Harrison Ford total.
Not Total recall.
Blade runner.

1954
01:51:05.150 --> 01:51:06.060
It's like questions.

1955
01:51:06.450 --> 01:51:09.650
Here's the questions you ask to android to make them start malfunctioning.

1956
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:12.980
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm trying to fit all this laying on its back.

1957
01:51:12.981 --> 01:51:15.020
Its legs are waving in the air at camp.

1958
01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:19.320
<v 0>I'm trying to figure out whether the a tortoise,
what's a tour it is.</v>

1959
01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:20.193
It's a turtle.

1960
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:25.060
I'm trying to figure out whether the uncomfortable moments and the,
the,
the,
the,

1961
01:51:25.130 --> 01:51:29.950
the animosity that you face in your life is turned you irreversibly towards the

1962
01:51:29.951 --> 01:51:33.580
dark side.
I'm trying to figure out whether they can introduce you to the force.

1963
01:51:33.870 --> 01:51:38.230
<v 8>Yours.
You are saying that if I was to let Hornets attack it digitized baby,</v>

1964
01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:42.760
I would be evil.
Well that you would want to experience that will,
what about,

1965
01:51:42.761 --> 01:51:42.830
yeah.

1966
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:47.830
<v 0>If you had the options between Hornets and a slew of Bikini pageant contest,</v>

1967
01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:53.100
entrance blowing the kid,
let

1968
01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:56.220
<v 8>me tell you something man.
If you ever played fallout three,
no.</v>

1969
01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:58.950
The game where you wander through the new,
the,
the,

1970
01:51:59.010 --> 01:52:01.910
the apocalypse and fallout three.
Well there's a,

1971
01:52:01.950 --> 01:52:05.790
there's a mission and fallout three where there's a little like commune of

1972
01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:10.440
orphans.
You are living in some kind of cave.
One of the missions is then there's,

1973
01:52:10.441 --> 01:52:13.920
uh,
there is,
uh,
an,
an part of this world.
There's a,

1974
01:52:14.190 --> 01:52:18.210
there's like a compound of slavers so you can bring them people,

1975
01:52:18.211 --> 01:52:20.040
you can sell people to slavery there.

1976
01:52:20.190 --> 01:52:24.270
And one of the missions built into this game is you go into that fucking

1977
01:52:24.271 --> 01:52:29.271
compound of kids kidnap one and bring it back to the slavers to do whatever the

1978
01:52:29.971 --> 01:52:31.290
fuck they're going to do to the kid.

1979
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:36.060
And they give you some weird special executioner's mask that gives you powers

1980
01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:37.950
and that's encoded into the fucking game.

1981
01:52:38.190 --> 01:52:42.370
So that's what's weird about video games is there's this like,
uh,

1982
01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:46.670
people will do awful shit and games you went to,

1983
01:52:46.780 --> 01:52:51.520
<v 0>oh,
I wouldn't,
no,
I wouldn't do that,
but I probably,</v>

1984
01:52:51.790 --> 01:52:56.740
I probably would on you.
You know,
like if I had an option,
you know,

1985
01:52:56.741 --> 01:52:59.750
if you could like pick who would want,
you know,
he'd,
well,
I'll give,

1986
01:52:59.751 --> 01:53:01.930
you could say like a public figure,
you know,

1987
01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:04.680
like who think of someone who really annoys you some,

1988
01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:06.280
I don't even don't even mention the name.

1989
01:53:06.610 --> 01:53:10.640
Let's just take some horrible foreign dictator type character,

1990
01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:14.140
some Kony,
whatever it happened to kone boy did there.

1991
01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:18.940
Is there a fucking cause it went away any quicker than that Kony 2012 thing.

1992
01:53:19.150 --> 01:53:22.360
All you got to do is whip your dick out and run around the St Pete and off and

1993
01:53:22.361 --> 01:53:25.720
then it doesn't matter how many babies die in Africa.
Everybody's like,

1994
01:53:25.721 --> 01:53:29.650
it's this fucking,
this topic is over.
He went to Oprah.
Did he?

1995
01:53:32.650 --> 01:53:35.980
Well,
the guy was in the middle of the fucking street beating off in San Diego.

1996
01:53:36.130 --> 01:53:39.610
The Guy who likes started this organization and put the whole thing together.

1997
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:43.660
He see me.
You can find that video,
Brian,
whatever it's caused by.

1998
01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:47.320
I don't give a fuck.
It's,
there's a lot of kinds of stress in this world.

1999
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:52.500
This one step of trust.
It's called fighting off the gay DCT.

2000
01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:57.200
What did you think when this whole thing went down?

2001
01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:59.920
This guy got arrested and he was beaten off the middle of street.

2002
01:54:00.170 --> 01:54:01.930
Does that makes sense?
Right.
Totally makes sense.

2003
01:54:02.010 --> 01:54:04.410
<v 8>No,
I thought it was something even deeper than that,
man.</v>

2004
01:54:04.411 --> 01:54:08.160
I thought it was some kind of attack from the guy in mind on him because he was

2005
01:54:08.161 --> 01:54:11.670
ripping people off.
I don't know if he was for sure,
but I was suspicious of him.

2006
01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:16.080
And so I thought that it did reach this like psychic,
uh,

2007
01:54:16.110 --> 01:54:20.790
some kind of psychic magnitude of negativity just swirled down on him and

2008
01:54:20.970 --> 01:54:25.680
temporarily exposed him to the world in this is somebody that maybe isn't

2009
01:54:25.681 --> 01:54:28.440
reliable or somebody that you shouldn't be sending money to.

2010
01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:31.440
I don't know exactly how they were using the money that they're getting,

2011
01:54:31.441 --> 01:54:35.780
but I know with a great many charities,
um,
legally they should

2012
01:54:36.650 --> 01:54:40.330
<v 0>look at them.
You're totally right.
By the way,
I hate to interrupt you there,</v>

2013
01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:41.860
but you're totally right.

2014
01:54:41.861 --> 01:54:45.490
This is him walking around naked and the old man behind him during San Diego,

2015
01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:48.910
it's all like ex military and shit down there.
They're like son of a bitch.

2016
01:54:49.330 --> 01:54:53.660
I stormed the beaches of with Gemma and you fucking cock sock or run around my

2017
01:54:53.661 --> 01:54:56.560
neighborhood showing you and dick to my wife.
I'll fucking kill you.

2018
01:54:56.890 --> 01:54:58.540
<v 8>But this is something I write though.</v>

2019
01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:03.693
What is that?

2020
01:55:05.410 --> 01:55:08.050
It's about this south park song about this.
Oh,

2021
01:55:08.051 --> 01:55:11.830
south park had a song about whacking it in San Diego.
By the way,

2022
01:55:11.831 --> 01:55:14.530
if you watch this season of South Park,
brilliant shit,
man.

2023
01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:18.260
<v 0>You got to get back on the southpark horse going out to everybody.</v>

2024
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:22.880
God bless them.
God bless them.

2025
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.490
When you're someone like South Park that has that kind of power,

2026
01:55:25.491 --> 01:55:26.390
the way they use it as,

2027
01:55:26.391 --> 01:55:30.800
so just they wield the fucking all mighty sword of,

2028
01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:35.600
of retribution,
of comedy,
of,
of,
of ethics.

2029
01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:39.890
They're just right there,
right.
So many times I never disagree with them.

2030
01:55:40.570 --> 01:55:43.860
It's cut to,
I'm shitting on me.
Did you see the book of Mormon?

2031
01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:49.440
<v 1>I loved it.
Yeah,
I saw.
I seen it.
Yeah.
It's great.
I mean,
I'm not in the musicals,</v>

2032
01:55:49.530 --> 01:55:53.730
so for me to love it is,
it shows how good,
it was really fun.
Yeah.
I was,

2033
01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:57.400
I was way lit when I went to see it too.
It's really,
it's an,

2034
01:55:57.450 --> 01:56:01.110
it's a really interesting thing today.
They're so like,
they're,

2035
01:56:01.111 --> 01:56:02.190
they're so prolific.

2036
01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:07.320
They do that show every week and somehow they managed to find time to develop

2037
01:56:07.321 --> 01:56:10.920
not just a musical,
but a really good one.
Yeah.
And it just makes you go,
God,

2038
01:56:10.921 --> 01:56:12.770
I'm such a lazy bitch.
Ah,

2039
01:56:14.190 --> 01:56:17.580
as Duncan thinks about how much time oculus rift is going to chew out of it.

2040
01:56:17.581 --> 01:56:18.080
Yeah,

2041
01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:22.950
<v 8>I,
that's the thing,
man.
You know,
I understand the lazy bitch theory,
but fuck,</v>

2042
01:56:23.210 --> 01:56:26.790
like what are we supposed to be doing on this planet if not burrowing into the

2043
01:56:26.791 --> 01:56:30.600
imagination and digitally experience alternate realities for the,

2044
01:56:30.601 --> 01:56:34.890
for something that's for the first time in human history is that has happened.

2045
01:56:34.891 --> 01:56:37.500
It's a brand new experience.
What am I supposed to do?

2046
01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:40.080
Go to some fucking pool hall and bet 15 bucks.

2047
01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:42.420
<v 1>Show ideas.
Let him know what the fuck's wrong with what he just said.</v>

2048
01:56:42.810 --> 01:56:46.920
I have no idea.
No fucking idea.
Because I'm looking at him.

2049
01:56:46.921 --> 01:56:48.150
I know he's a brilliant dude.

2050
01:56:48.151 --> 01:56:52.080
So you'll go home right now and when will you be outside in the daylight?
Again,

2051
01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:57.090
the truth,
because I know there's times years ago you'd disappear.
Depends on it.

2052
01:56:57.091 --> 01:56:59.850
There's daylight in the oculus rift land that I visit.

2053
01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:05.550
So you sign up tonight,
you shut your phone and lock the door.

2054
01:57:05.590 --> 01:57:09.030
I do window in new headlines.

2055
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:14.010
Young gamers finding Oculus riff makes their body produce vitamin D without the

2056
01:57:14.011 --> 01:57:18.780
sun.
Yes.
Exclamation point,
fingers.
It actually triggers it.

2057
01:57:18.781 --> 01:57:19.270
You don't need that

2058
01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.810
<v 8>sunlight.</v>

2059
01:57:19.810 --> 01:57:23.860
Listen you first world or as they're all stuck on your fucking son in the light,

2060
01:57:23.861 --> 01:57:26.260
when will you see the sun again?
When you see light

2061
01:57:26.490 --> 01:57:29.940
<v 1>solid B,
this guy?
Yeah,
that's it was Omni Directional treadmill.</v>

2062
01:57:30.690 --> 01:57:34.110
I got to get one of those.
Know it's,
fuck that guy though.
No one.
No one wants.

2063
01:57:34.111 --> 01:57:37.470
Fuck that guy.
Someone wants to fuck.
You'd Dunkin.
Take advantage of that.

2064
01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:39.210
Let's see.
What does he have on the wall?

2065
01:57:39.450 --> 01:57:43.980
Big Girl with giant tits that we'll never have sex with them voluntarily unless

2066
01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:44.873
her rent is late.

2067
01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:50.560
<v 8>I think there might be a great many people out there who aren't being fucked at</v>

2068
01:57:50.561 --> 01:57:51.290
this moment.
Why?

2069
01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:55.810
For sure they get to run on a treadmill and experience some magical,
weird realm.

2070
01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:57.270
<v 1>I think they should,
but it's,</v>

2071
01:57:57.510 --> 01:58:01.080
I find it shocking that the first incarnations of it involve violence and not

2072
01:58:01.081 --> 01:58:04.040
sex.
The first incarnations of now my friend,
yeah.

2073
01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:08.910
<v 8>Put on Oculus Rift Porn.
Yeah.
He says that you look down and you see here today.</v>

2074
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:11.340
<v 1>Yeah.
Well what are we looking at right here?
We're looking at violence.</v>

2075
01:58:11.370 --> 01:58:12.230
This is Darrin Patriot.

2076
01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:14.820
Do we look in dudes with guns when they're running around?

2077
01:58:14.821 --> 01:58:17.910
They're hiding behind barrels and trying to snipe on people being assholes.
Yeah.

2078
01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:21.330
<v 8>So like,
you know when you give a squeaky toy to a dog,
oh boy.</v>

2079
01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:25.420
And you realize that that squeak is the sound of an animal dying.

2080
01:58:25.450 --> 01:58:28.090
And that's why they liked the squeak because that sounds the sounds.

2081
01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:31.720
I never thought about that until right now.
That's what it is.
So,
so like,

2082
01:58:31.870 --> 01:58:34.120
you know,
your sweet little dog's chewing on this thing,

2083
01:58:34.121 --> 01:58:36.910
it's squeaking just like an animal would if it were biting it.

2084
01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:40.180
Well that's what these games are for humans.
There's squeaked toys.

2085
01:58:40.181 --> 01:58:41.770
They like let humans

2086
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:46.780
<v 3>experience the aggressive side that exists in all people.
You know,</v>

2087
01:58:46.781 --> 01:58:50.080
there's this thing where people are always shocked like to think that we're

2088
01:58:50.081 --> 01:58:54.400
using this for violence,
but it's like what we are.
I think it's Cathartic.

2089
01:58:54.610 --> 01:58:59.510
It's Cathartic,
I think.
I think it's Cathartic and it helps people,
you know,
uh,

2090
01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:03.370
get out aggression or just experience like,
you know,

2091
01:59:03.371 --> 01:59:05.200
bizarre states of being

2092
01:59:05.330 --> 01:59:07.370
<v 0>Joe,

You've never fucked with games except pool when you're,

2094
01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:13.730

2100
01:59:34.490 --> 01:59:35.420
The one with the missiles.

01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:39.620
They didn't do the ones that you to start from scratch.
All that shit.

2102
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:44.510
Pawn stars too.
I know this one stars,
they fucking sell those games,

2103
01:59:44.511 --> 01:59:47.720
so it's amazing.
He's has one the solid do a bar.
Oh,
they have it.

2104
01:59:48.050 --> 01:59:51.590
<v 3>Why did I,
the guy that sent those out,
four k TVs,
he sent us one,</v>

2105
01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:54.790
like a bigger arcade.
It has like 500 games on it.
Is that called name?

2106
01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:55.870
Is that what that is?
I think it's amazing.

2107
01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:59.440
<v 0>Do you know that people think that I'm a fucking Nazi because of that stupid</v>

2108
01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:02.350
Zombie robot?
People are so stupid.

2109
02:00:02.530 --> 02:00:06.610
There's so many people that are like looking to find some sort of crazy

2110
02:00:06.611 --> 02:00:08.830
conspiratorial connection.
Did they've,

2111
02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:13.000
they've decided that because it Brian Studio at the Ice House,
which by the way,

2112
02:00:13.001 --> 02:00:17.400
I have zero,
zero input.
How he designs it.

2113
02:00:17.410 --> 02:00:20.950
He just does it himself.
I'm not a control freak and uh,

2114
02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:24.250
Brian has a fucking Zombie that this dude.
Do you remember homeboy's name?
Yeah.

2115
02:00:24.251 --> 02:00:28.780
Let me find it real quick.
Um,
Dude's a,
uh,
he makes those for movies.
You know,

2116
02:00:28.781 --> 02:00:31.090
like that movie dead snow.
Did you see dead snow?

2117
02:00:32.290 --> 02:00:36.850
I don't think I saw great fucking movie.
Stupid as shit,
but great.

2118
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:39.700
And it's all about zombies that were,

2119
02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:42.460
they were Nazis and somehow know they became zombies.

2120
02:00:42.461 --> 02:00:45.250
He got frozen up in the fucking south pole or some shit.

2121
02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:48.160
And these people are out there that camping out and then the zombies come and

2122
02:00:48.161 --> 02:00:50.740
get them.
The Nazi zombies.
It's hilariously stupid.

2123
02:00:51.310 --> 02:00:55.540
So he has one of the zombies from dead snow.
It's a fucking movie.
Okay.

2124
02:00:55.541 --> 02:01:00.541
He's got the Zombie at his studio and I get all these messages from people that

2125
02:01:00.551 --> 02:01:04.030
are saying,
yeah,
I always knew that he had a problem with Jews.

2126
02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:09.030
That's why he's got a Zombie at his studio that has a swastika on Joey's falling

2127
02:01:09.031 --> 02:01:13.540
asleep.
What?
Domo falling asleep,
falling asleep.
She only had his eyes closed.

2128
02:01:13.541 --> 02:01:17.610
He was like this,
I'm going to take a nap.
You wake up early

2129
02:01:18.650 --> 02:01:19.540
<v 3>seven I like,</v>

2130
02:01:19.541 --> 02:01:24.430
I'll wake up and like look on Twitter and Joe has been tweeting since 4:30 AM

2131
02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:28.650
<v 0>can I go to bed?
We,
we change off.
We have strict,
you know,</v>

2132
02:01:28.651 --> 02:01:32.340
you ever see that cartoon with as a sheep dog and the coyote and they meet.

2133
02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:36.270
I'm the coyote.
He's a sheep dog.
We meet Martin and Frank Ahrens.
Sam.

2134
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:41.180
<v 5>I was doing fine.</v>

2135
02:01:41.190 --> 02:01:45.880
Three the whole day was going great and I stopped at the weed store at about

2136
02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:49.460
1230 1215 in the afternoon?
Yeah.

2137
02:01:49.461 --> 02:01:52.310
Just have a few were there last night that wasn't telling us the night before

2138
02:01:52.311 --> 02:01:54.820
last we were there.
No,
no.
Which night you also,

2139
02:01:54.850 --> 02:01:57.830
it was only tweeted the thing I went in there this afternoon.

2140
02:01:57.831 --> 02:02:02.040
I went to the one on Lankershim to lock up.
They have edibles and reefer.

2141
02:02:02.050 --> 02:02:05.990
They got a lot more selection here.
Other places has strong pocket of weed.
Right.

2142
02:02:05.991 --> 02:02:09.740
This one has a pre rolled joints.
Dynamite.
As we've got edibles,

2143
02:02:09.741 --> 02:02:11.430
a dynamind weeds is dynamite.

2144
02:02:11.431 --> 02:02:14.270
I going there this afternoon and it shouldn't have to get,
he goes,
hey,

2145
02:02:14.271 --> 02:02:15.800
I got this new thing I want you to try.

2146
02:02:16.190 --> 02:02:19.280
It's a fucking little Brownie thing.

2147
02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:23.000
It's just he goes to these people always have solid stuff.

2148
02:02:23.001 --> 02:02:23.834
Tell me what you think.

2149
02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:26.600
I took a bite out of it and I could tell it was going to be a ride.

2150
02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:31.520
I can tell I took a bite out of it.
Like a little bite.
Yeah.
And I'm like,
wow.

2151
02:02:31.521 --> 02:02:33.560
And also it's been hit me this afternoon,
but I'm more right.

2152
02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:35.570
These crazy hippies are so inconsistent.

2153
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:38.870
This is so inconsistent with their product like you will get well,

2154
02:02:38.871 --> 02:02:42.650
five x cookie that's not that big a deal and then you get one that makes you

2155
02:02:42.651 --> 02:02:47.060
think about everything that went wrong from ages three to six.

2156
02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:50.210
You'll see it all

2157
02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:52.630
<v 3>play out in front of you,
man.</v>

2158
02:02:52.650 --> 02:02:57.610
I bought one of these chocolate bars and took a little bite of one tiny,

2159
02:02:57.611 --> 02:02:58.091
tiny,

2160
02:02:58.091 --> 02:03:03.091
tiny little bite and I fucking like within tasted within two hours you could

2161
02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:07.210
taste it.
I'm like,
it's a,
it was a,
it was when we were having the heatwave.

2162
02:03:07.450 --> 02:03:10.360
I'm so paranoid that I'm like,
I'm just going to go fucking jogging.

2163
02:03:10.361 --> 02:03:13.080
I want to go jogging and try to sweat it out.
I'm Robb,

2164
02:03:13.150 --> 02:03:17.710
I'm running by the La River.
Look down,
see some guy taking his pants off.

2165
02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:21.610
Perfect.
Suck his cock.
What it tastes like.
It tastes like river water.

2166
02:03:22.270 --> 02:03:25.750
God,
it's like a Brownie.
I found

2167
02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:30.760
<v 5>the perfect dose for me.
Edible wise.
It's a la speed weeds,
gummy bears too.</v>

2168
02:03:30.761 --> 02:03:33.010
Gummy bears.
Perfect,
right?

2169
02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:36.640
There's a little confusion when it comes to like the breast strips.

2170
02:03:36.641 --> 02:03:38.710
Breast chips depressives are very tricky.

2171
02:03:38.711 --> 02:03:41.550
I never go with a full breast trip cause you don't know what the fuck you,

2172
02:03:41.610 --> 02:03:43.210
you're,
it can get too scary.

2173
02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:47.140
But the gummy bears for some reason seem to be pretty consistent.

2174
02:03:47.170 --> 02:03:51.850
I think it's how they make gummy bears.
I don't know man.
Who knows?
It's illegal.

2175
02:03:52.210 --> 02:03:53.890
That's why we have to have this fucking conversation.

2176
02:03:53.970 --> 02:03:57.150
<v 3>Well you've gotta be careful cause you know a lot of people they go and get</v>

2177
02:03:57.151 --> 02:04:01.230
their prescription and then they go next door and buy some marijuana brownies

2178
02:04:01.231 --> 02:04:02.460
and they think,
oh it's just a Brownie.

2179
02:04:02.461 --> 02:04:06.730
I'll eat the whole Brownie and then Satan is dragging them by their

2180
02:04:07.390 --> 02:04:09.130
<v 5>kicked my ass a little couple of minutes ago.</v>

2181
02:04:09.310 --> 02:04:11.110
But that hasn't been fucking wrestling man.

2182
02:04:11.170 --> 02:04:14.020
I took one bite of it but I knew how it was packaged.
The whole thing.

2183
02:04:14.021 --> 02:04:17.500
These are real.
Yeah,
I know these people.
I'm like wow,

2184
02:04:17.530 --> 02:04:20.140
this is pretty fucking good.
Yeah.
Well you know what?

2185
02:04:20.141 --> 02:04:25.060
I think that it is important and people that hear this and go,

2186
02:04:25.061 --> 02:04:28.960
guys guys are talking too much shit about a weed and talking about weed,
Bro.

2187
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:33.040
It really is something that people need to hear.
They really do.
Unfortunately,

2188
02:04:33.041 --> 02:04:36.100
the eating of the Brownie can really fucking be psychologically devastate.

2189
02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:38.650
<v 8>Yeah.
Or chocolate bar or whatever.</v>

2190
02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:42.570
Any edibles can really fuck your world.

2191
02:04:42.620 --> 02:04:46.700
<v 2>Your world up,
Joey.
Yeah,
you gotta be careful and sometimes I tell you,</v>

2192
02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:49.430
even like I learned what?
Acupuncture,

2193
02:04:49.431 --> 02:04:54.260
I never get high before I go to acupuncture because it turns into a complete

2194
02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:57.740
different realm.
I feel.
I feel every needle go into my skin.

2195
02:04:58.550 --> 02:05:01.940
I feel every needle break the skin.
I can hear it.

2196
02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:06.890
It's like having Spiderman sense.
You can hear it.
You could hear the needles hop.

2197
02:05:07.070 --> 02:05:12.030
If you could just feel the needle car was spot on with your skin.
Well,

2198
02:05:12.031 --> 02:05:15.950
I'm not high.
I don't feel that.
And when,
and that's what kills me.

2199
02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:17.720
That's what stresses me the fuck out.

2200
02:05:17.721 --> 02:05:21.320
Once I feel a little bit of pain from a needle,
it shoots up to my brain.

2201
02:05:21.590 --> 02:05:24.380
If I'm straight,
I'm fine.
But if I'm stoned,

2202
02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:27.860
it takes that little bit of pain and does something else with it.
And next,

2203
02:05:27.861 --> 02:05:29.690
you know,
I'm having a goddamn anxiety attack.

2204
02:05:30.770 --> 02:05:34.700
So that's why you gotta be careful with situations like that.
Well,

2205
02:05:35.540 --> 02:05:37.570
<v 8>like I say about bombing,
the,
the,</v>

2206
02:05:37.571 --> 02:05:40.320
the best I've ever gotten out of standup comedy.

2207
02:05:40.321 --> 02:05:43.580
He was one of bombed and realized that I need to fucking make some sort of

2208
02:05:43.581 --> 02:05:47.450
corrections.
Those,
that's,
that's the best improvements that I've ever gotten.

2209
02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:51.350
If similar to the,
the feeling that you get when you eat,

2210
02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:54.260
you eat a Brownie or whatever and you freak the fuck out.

2211
02:05:54.290 --> 02:05:58.340
I've been reading this book called the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.

2212
02:05:58.341 --> 02:06:02.950
Have you heard this if this book or do you have to checking g Pecan?
Julie?
No,

2213
02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:07.450
that's but tangent.
But they talk about how the mind ah,

2214
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:12.510
how there's a term called [inaudible] and Richie's is the term for a wave of

2215
02:06:12.891 --> 02:06:13.724
thought.

2216
02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:18.590
And so like your mind is basically all these waves of thought rolling through at

2217
02:06:18.591 --> 02:06:22.580
rolling through it.
Each of those are of ritzy and those things are sort of uh,

2218
02:06:22.930 --> 02:06:27.620
um,
you are created by things in the external world or other thoughts or feelings

2219
02:06:27.621 --> 02:06:30.590
that come into your mind.
So when you get super high,

2220
02:06:30.770 --> 02:06:34.310
what's happening is you're suddenly amplifying those.

2221
02:06:34.311 --> 02:06:38.330
Richie's you're seeing these thought patterns that normally are way under the

2222
02:06:38.331 --> 02:06:41.960
surface and those thought patterns or it's usually shit you've been ignoring.

2223
02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:44.930
Like for me,
I'll start thinking about like,
you know,

2224
02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:48.290
well like when I had cancer that's,
that would come to my mind like shit,

2225
02:06:48.291 --> 02:06:51.320
I'm probably going to die.
I might die,
this could kill me.
Or you know,

2226
02:06:51.321 --> 02:06:55.190
whatever the thing is that you've been trying to ignore or forget about it just

2227
02:06:55.191 --> 02:06:57.710
will grab your face and push you right into it.

2228
02:06:58.100 --> 02:07:02.450
And so the answer is to just embrace that thing,
dissolve into it,

2229
02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:06.740
go into it,
go into it,
fly into the f.
It's like Dante's inferno.

2230
02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:10.850
The only way out of hell and Dante's inferno is by going to the middle and

2231
02:07:10.851 --> 02:07:12.380
climbing down Satan's leg.

2232
02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:14.760
<v 0>Cause getting Dante never tried to suck.
Satan stick.</v>

2233
02:07:14.970 --> 02:07:17.370
If you suck his dick as he comes in your mouth,

2234
02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:22.460
your brain explodes and you appear in the garden of Eden with Eden and she

2235
02:07:22.621 --> 02:07:24.720
hasn't given the apple to the snake yet.

2236
02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:26.960
Hayden's the stripper that live in the guard whenever,

2237
02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:30.730
whatever her name is that the whore that was eve eve spread.

2238
02:07:32.070 --> 02:07:34.280
There's just some like dirty girl who lived there too.

2239
02:07:34.290 --> 02:07:37.210
They never done you all talk about it because all she did was just clean her

2240
02:07:37.211 --> 02:07:40.270
house.
She had like wet warm towels.

2241
02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:42.610
She had just wiped her ass after he shot the field.

2242
02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:46.330
She always stopped you on it and Brian stuff video.
Start putting a video on him.

2243
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:51.510
You gonna change the whole tone of this fucking show,
son of a bitch shades.

2244
02:07:52.710 --> 02:07:56.860
Joey Diaz.
What are you doing this weekend?
Making a movie cause way too high.

2245
02:07:57.190 --> 02:08:00.460
I got til the eighth on this thing.
What is this thing you're doing right now?

2246
02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:05.830
Your,
your life has changed.
No,
I always do one of these big heavy,
yeah,
but yeah,

2247
02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:09.370
me yet.
I was at the fucking,
the storyteller's show the other day.

2248
02:08:09.610 --> 02:08:13.160
Your life is changed.
No brother.
That was a good fucking thing.
The other,

2249
02:08:13.190 --> 02:08:16.050
it wasn't,
it was a lot of fun.
It was a lot of harsh.
If you're a storyteller,

2250
02:08:16.060 --> 02:08:19.930
show a,
this is not happening on comedy central.com.
I had to leave,

2251
02:08:20.050 --> 02:08:23.260
I had to do Kevin and being in the morning I had to get out of there.
But uh,

2252
02:08:23.261 --> 02:08:26.620
the reaction that you got when you even walked in the building,
your,
your,

2253
02:08:26.621 --> 02:08:29.420
your uh,
your life has changed.
Rocking your,

2254
02:08:29.890 --> 02:08:31.980
you're limited a different world and you were living in,

2255
02:08:31.981 --> 02:08:35.650
in a couple of years and you know,
I'm fine.
I'm still the same.
I know you are,

2256
02:08:35.651 --> 02:08:37.460
but it's interesting to watch,
man.
Interesting.

2257
02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:40.990
Watch what was the last Gig we did together?
Where the fuck,
where are we?
Boston.

2258
02:08:41.340 --> 02:08:45.690
Milwaukee.
No walking one of those.
Yeah.
Milwaukee and Boston were both in sanity.

2259
02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:49.900
Are you doing another,
uh,
those dog movies?
Yeah.
Which one is this one?

2260
02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:54.220
Easter.
How many times his dog?
Gonna fucking say that.

2261
02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:59.040
Cause it's a fifth one Gary time.
Pat Valentine Pass.

2262
02:08:59.041 --> 02:09:01.510
Or they brought you back?
No,
I always come back.

2263
02:09:02.050 --> 02:09:06.160
But you're saying the gallery Valentine's time passed on this one.
Wow.

2264
02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:10.450
Dean Cain.
This is,
he took a little pit stop before searching for bigfoot.

2265
02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:12.770
This is full.

2266
02:09:12.770 --> 02:09:16.240
It's got a new show and he's got a new shell and spike with my pal Todd.

2267
02:09:16.241 --> 02:09:17.900
This hotel,
they go searching for bigfoot

2268
02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:24.100
the girls girl's makeup.
Is that what it was?

2269
02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:27.550
They dress you up like a girl and you know,
why do you know why?

2270
02:09:27.550 --> 02:09:31.630
Cause it scared you.
Just like they do with black men.
What?
My Ada,
think about it.

2271
02:09:31.631 --> 02:09:35.030
All the black man,
they dress up like women.
It was the third movie we did.
Yeah.

2272
02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:38.230
That ever dressed me up.
Like Dave Chappelle had a whole,

2273
02:09:38.231 --> 02:09:41.770
a speech that he did on one of those talk shows about it.
About man,

2274
02:09:41.771 --> 02:09:45.100
why is it when black man gets famous,
they always try to dress them up.

2275
02:09:45.150 --> 02:09:49.840
A girl as true Eddie Murphy,
thinking about all the different people.
Jamie Foxx,

2276
02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:52.450
think about all the different people that addressed the Kenai wanes.

2277
02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:56.440
Thinking about all the different Tepa big,
strong black man.
And it's hilarious.

2278
02:09:56.441 --> 02:10:00.490
They dress up like women.
Why Joe is why they do it to you?

2279
02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:03.940
That was just a third because they've seen your Dick Online.
That's what it is.

2280
02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:07.480
They've seen the Cuban,
that girl floating out there like the death star.

2281
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:09.550
Deep Space.
What's wrong with you?
You know what I'm saying?

2282
02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:13.920
It was stolen until the guilt Dunkin for the right.

2283
02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:17.650
Let me read bend to the left of me and you gotta be over here when you jumping

2284
02:10:17.651 --> 02:10:21.520
back into the comedy world again.
This Saturday I'll be at the comedy store.
Oh,

2285
02:10:24.190 --> 02:10:24.870
what type?

2286
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:29.870
Cocksucker 10 40 1110 45 that's something about that place,

2287
02:10:30.971 --> 02:10:34.040
right?
Still to this day,
exotic.
He

2288
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:37.700
<v 1>sonic place.
Isn't that weird?
Fucking Hobo made his debut.</v>

2289
02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:42.530
That's exactly where he made.
Who's Hobo?
Oh,
the store.

2290
02:10:43.190 --> 02:10:47.960
What's the new Hobo like?
I,
I've retired.
How about shut the fuck up.

2291
02:10:47.961 --> 02:10:49.550
Why would you do that when it's on video?

2292
02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:53.090
So why does everything have to be on video?

2293
02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:55.010
Because the other people should enjoy it too.
Well,

2294
02:10:55.011 --> 02:10:57.740
you developed or something that was really beautiful was real.
Well,

2295
02:10:57.770 --> 02:10:59.870
you know the problem there was a technical problem,

2296
02:10:59.871 --> 02:11:04.730
which is that it uses a pink Floyd song and I super doubt that if I email them,

2297
02:11:04.731 --> 02:11:05.361
they're going to be like,
yeah,

2298
02:11:05.361 --> 02:11:08.990
you could use are one of the most famous songs on earth for your comedy out.

2299
02:11:09.890 --> 02:11:14.000
Guess what?
That's a small part of that,
but very small.

2300
02:11:14.090 --> 02:11:18.110
It's not even one 10th of 1% of that bit.
That bit is,

2301
02:11:18.230 --> 02:11:20.510
I don't want to say anymore because I don't want it to be a spoiler.

2302
02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:23.550
You don't need that song,
Dude.
That's silly,
but I feel,
you know,

2303
02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:25.460
like the next time I go back out in the road,

2304
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:30.140
I don't think I can bring little Hobo Joe Diaz tell him to put that fucking shit

2305
02:11:30.141 --> 02:11:33.260
down on wax.
I can't keep doing it though.
I can't.

2306
02:11:33.261 --> 02:11:35.810
You can't keep doing something then I don't have to keep doing it.

2307
02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:39.590
You just have to do it and get it on DVD or get it on a video to put it on the

2308
02:11:39.591 --> 02:11:41.600
Internet for that Little Hobo bit,

2309
02:11:41.601 --> 02:11:44.870
to not get out there in the world is a crime against humanity.

2310
02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:48.530
You need to figure that out.
Thank you.
You need to figure that out.

2311
02:11:48.531 --> 02:11:50.450
You need to figure out how you're going to get that out.
Okay.

2312
02:11:50.810 --> 02:11:54.260
Cause I can't tell you how many times a fucking howled with laughter at that
bit.

2313
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:57.990
I've seen that bit close to a hundred times maybe.
I mean,

2314
02:11:58.010 --> 02:12:01.100
all the times we work together.
I love doing it.
It's a fucking great bet,
dude.

2315
02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:05.870
You need to,
people need to see that.
It's fun and it's so you,
so you,

2316
02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:08.570
if anybody was like wondering what can I count?
Counties Dunkin do,

2317
02:12:08.830 --> 02:12:11.540
but he got six minutes.
Sit down and watch this.

2318
02:12:11.541 --> 02:12:13.790
You know what's fucking cool though,
man.
I can't get,

2319
02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:18.400
I can't give too much of it away,
but I am going to be puppeteering.
Uh,

2320
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:20.380
I pop that.

2321
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:24.380
I'm going to be using a puppet for this show we're doing for MTV digital that

2322
02:12:24.381 --> 02:12:28.310
we're shooting right now.
It's going to be really cool.
A lot of spooky,

2323
02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:32.150
spooky sketches.
Okay,
let's get into the Dunkin psyche.

2324
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:34.510
Let's find out what that's all about.
Joey Diaz.

2325
02:12:34.511 --> 02:12:37.070
He used to always say there's a motherfucking Dunkin is always playing around

2326
02:12:37.071 --> 02:12:38.650
with the devil one of these days.

2327
02:12:38.651 --> 02:12:41.720
You gonna fucking realize that devil's is gonna bite him right in the ball sack.

2328
02:12:41.721 --> 02:12:46.000
They did do.
It doesn't really,
I'm off.

2329
02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:52.730
I don't really know.
I was just kidding.
No,
no,

2330
02:12:52.731 --> 02:12:55.000
no,
no.
You know,
listen man,
there's no dark side.

2331
02:12:55.010 --> 02:12:58.790
You can't be fucking around with the devil.
Duncan Trussell well being cute.

2332
02:12:58.791 --> 02:13:02.000
All he,
he's in house watching the cartoons

2333
02:13:04.010 --> 02:13:06.770
get them.
My point is,
I'm just joking around about that,

2334
02:13:06.771 --> 02:13:11.510
but my point is like what is your fascination with this demonic idea?
You're,

2335
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:15.560
you're drawn to that angle so often.
Like what,

2336
02:13:15.610 --> 02:13:20.120
what is it drawn to it?
To what angle drawn to the angle of,
you know,

2337
02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:24.230
obviously I don't believe that you think in these things like as far as being

2338
02:13:24.231 --> 02:13:29.150
reality,
but the idea of a demonic entity,
the idea of evil incarnate.

2339
02:13:29.310 --> 02:13:33.280
You've often talked about evil as like a philosophical idea,

2340
02:13:33.281 --> 02:13:36.180
like a location that you can get to.
You know,
man,

2341
02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:41.100
I've changed a lot in my life and there is a time when I actually did believe

2342
02:13:41.101 --> 02:13:43.230
that there was some there,
there and I still have,

2343
02:13:43.231 --> 02:13:46.080
I know people who do believe in this kind of thing.

2344
02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:49.290
But you know why you don't anymore.
What you know,
why you're doing anymore.

2345
02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:53.970
Why your girlfriend's 24 you think that's why I don't believe in evil anymore.

2346
02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:56.461
As you look looking vagina,

2347
02:13:56.461 --> 02:13:59.310
it's like drinking out of a spring when you've been traveling a desert,

2348
02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:02.070
you traveling the designee come down the hill.
And what is this?

2349
02:14:02.071 --> 02:14:04.710
This is this an oasis?
Is this a hallucination?

2350
02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:08.460
And you're getting that cold Colorado spring water and just lap it up.

2351
02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:12.030
24 is not old Joe.
That's not what I'm saying.

2352
02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:15.150
I get it.
I know it was a joke.

2353
02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:21.730
I think it's more of a um,
you know,
he knew what I liked.

2354
02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:25.500
Is that too?
Well,
I think that that's a good point.
It's not,

2355
02:14:25.501 --> 02:14:29.460
that is not a refuge point.
Joe Diaz.
I like to say that that is a savage.

2356
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:36.660
You guys are embarrassing me.
I,
um,
but I,
I,
I like the a in Hinduism,

2357
02:14:36.661 --> 02:14:38.130
I liked the whole cycle of things.

2358
02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:41.350
I was panicking and it goes straight to the Bhagavad Gita.
That's what I

2359
02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:45.750
fucking him time

2360
02:14:47.370 --> 02:14:50.850
Congress and the Diebold voting machines.
Man,
fucking lottery ticket.

2361
02:14:50.851 --> 02:14:54.450
I'm gonna get that midnight moon.
Whatever the fuck that is smelling good.

2362
02:14:54.451 --> 02:14:58.050
A little blurbs were drinking moonshine here.
Dunkin,

2363
02:14:58.410 --> 02:15:02.010
I pushed one in front of you.
You're not drinking anymore.
I scared.
I'm trying to,

2364
02:15:02.011 --> 02:15:04.290
I'm trying to lose weight so I'm not drinking alcohol.

2365
02:15:04.291 --> 02:15:07.230
That's not going to help you.
Being a pussy is not going to help you lose weight.

2366
02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:09.720
It's the exact opposite of what's going to help you lose weight.

2367
02:15:09.721 --> 02:15:12.060
It fucking what's going to help you lose weight is being a savage.

2368
02:15:12.220 --> 02:15:14.880
And what a savage does is occasionally they have a drink because they're a

2369
02:15:14.881 --> 02:15:18.120
fucking man.
They do whatever they want to do and then they do squats.
Well,

2370
02:15:18.121 --> 02:15:20.010
what I want to do is not drink.
Listen to me.

2371
02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:22.470
I have kettle bells here in this building.
I can help you burn.

2372
02:15:23.250 --> 02:15:26.640
I'm going to help you work out after this podcast is over.

2373
02:15:26.850 --> 02:15:30.570
I'll show you a squat routine and you can do with a fucking 32 kilogram.
Okay,

2374
02:15:31.110 --> 02:15:31.943
great.

2375
02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:40.040
Uh,
thousands like Holt's evil.
God,

2376
02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:43.890
it'll hurt your mother if you drank that shit.
You're,
you're,
you're dead.

2377
02:15:43.891 --> 02:15:47.160
Parents will fucking kick around in their graves if you,
if you drink that shit.

2378
02:15:47.161 --> 02:15:52.070
Kids you grew up with in high school crashed into trees.
Fucking shit.

2379
02:15:52.170 --> 02:15:55.860
It's so strong.
It's ridiculous.
People you've never met.
We'll get drunk.

2380
02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:00.510
People you'll meet in a week.
We'll fucking pass out at work.
Does it tastes good.

2381
02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:03.770
It actually tastes pretty good.
It's,
it's not as strong as the runner.

2382
02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:09.320
You think good is anybody talking about good koolaid know about doing as good

2383
02:16:10.270 --> 02:16:14.250
with ice cube?
What it tastes like.
It's,
it's not that brutal.

2384
02:16:14.370 --> 02:16:18.240
It's interesting they did whatever this is Jamie,
what is this?

2385
02:16:18.241 --> 02:16:21.570
What's the name of this company as smokey old smokey.
I think it is.
Whatever.

2386
02:16:21.571 --> 02:16:23.460
Whoever these people are,
they're bad motherfuckers.

2387
02:16:23.730 --> 02:16:27.270
They know how to make some real moonshine cause I've had some scary moonshine

2388
02:16:27.271 --> 02:16:30.400
that hurts.
And I've had some like this is pretty

2389
02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:32.580
<v 0>fucking smooth while letting</v>

2390
02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:36.490
<v 2>you know that it's fucking you up.
But,
but if you talk to somebody in Kentucky,</v>

2391
02:16:36.491 --> 02:16:37.150
there would be again,

2392
02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:39.960
that's like the wine cooler of moon shines compared to them.
You know,

2393
02:16:39.980 --> 02:16:41.520
like building it in the backyard.

2394
02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:45.980
<v 0>I don't know man.
This stuff's pretty good.
Brick Duncan and I Dunkin,</v>

2395
02:16:46.020 --> 02:16:47.670
I had some stuff in North Carolina.

2396
02:16:47.671 --> 02:16:51.750
I remember when we ate at that slam and barbecue joint.
Yes.
Do you remember that?

2397
02:16:51.810 --> 02:16:55.050
Yup.
That was it.
What was it called?
Was it called?
I can't remember,

2398
02:16:55.051 --> 02:16:58.050
but it's fucking good if you're in Raleigh.
Hold on a second.

2399
02:16:58.051 --> 02:17:02.910
I need to let these mother fuckers get the props.
Raleigh Barbecue BBQ.

2400
02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:06.960
Um,
we,
uh,
we aid the pit.
Was it the pit?

2401
02:17:07.260 --> 02:17:11.070
That's exactly what it was.
I thought it was,
they gave us some moonshine,
some,

2402
02:17:11.100 --> 02:17:15.270
some like peach moonshine.
Oh my God.
It was good.

2403
02:17:15.900 --> 02:17:19.290
God Damn,
it was good.
First of all,
the barbecue there.
If you're in Raleigh,

2404
02:17:19.291 --> 02:17:23.490
that place is sensational.
Oh,

2405
02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:28.380
it's so good.
It has four stars.
If you go to like the reviews online,

2406
02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:32.550
but that's just because 10% of the people in the world have their fucking head

2407
02:17:32.700 --> 02:17:37.050
deep in their ass.
Like in if,
if,
if the world was just in pure,

2408
02:17:37.170 --> 02:17:39.780
that would be a five star place.
No doubt about it.

2409
02:17:40.020 --> 02:17:45.020
And they had this insane peach moonshine and he would drink it and you go,

2410
02:17:45.150 --> 02:17:49.780
whoa.
And you also like it because he knows it's illegal.
You know what?

2411
02:17:49.781 --> 02:17:54.390
I hate booze,
right?
I hate the taste of booze.
Yeah.
It's fucking delicious.

2412
02:17:54.391 --> 02:17:56.550
This is good.
That's delicious.
They know what they're doing.

2413
02:17:56.650 --> 02:17:58.980
<v 2>Um,
real moonshine is,
uh,</v>

2414
02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:02.190
over a hundred proof as high as 150 proof,

2415
02:18:02.191 --> 02:18:06.190
which is about 75% alcohol.
So you're drinking.
Yeah.

2416
02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:08.940
You're pretty much just drinking it.
Freebasing booze.

2417
02:18:09.090 --> 02:18:12.780
And what is this stuff should stay on the side of it and say the proof.
Yeah.

2418
02:18:12.781 --> 02:18:17.040
I should say right on the bottle.
Eat this and you drink this.

2419
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:23.000
It'll save you all the HPV.
I don't kill all the fucking time.

2420
02:18:23.010 --> 02:18:26.100
You won't go on.
Michael Douglas won't be spitting fucking,
I can't remember.

2421
02:18:26.101 --> 02:18:27.230
Yellow buttons tomorrow.

2422
02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:32.740
<v 6>Uh,
two two,
two,
two,
two.
I can't read the proof.
Where's it?
Say it.</v>

2423
02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:37.780
<v 0>There's a sign in the front.
He goes,
I'm sorry.
Oh</v>

2424
02:18:37.870 --> 02:18:40.140
<v 6>yeah,
that's good too.</v>

2425
02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:41.800
<v 0>It says 50%</v>

2426
02:18:41.950 --> 02:18:42.783
<v 6>okay.</v>

2427
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:46.330
<v 0>Is that a hundred proof?
Why wouldn't you say a hundred proof?</v>

2428
02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:47.613
<v 6>Wow.</v>

2429
02:18:47.700 --> 02:18:51.240
<v 0>Oh,
it does say a hundred proof and the spot.
Yeah,
it's a hundred proof.</v>

2430
02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:55.260
It's not bad.
That's not bad.
It's pretty much whiskey.
90 90 proof.

2431
02:18:55.540 --> 02:18:58.020
So it's just a little stronger than whiskey.
That tastes delicious though.

2432
02:18:58.680 --> 02:18:59.513
Some ice cube.

2433
02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:04.950
<v 2>What an ice cube,
but a little mouse and gone guys are not a big one.</v>

2434
02:19:04.951 --> 02:19:09.300
The little one,
three hours to kill may be something to watch.

2435
02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:14.160
And a fucking casino in Vegas while you're on know Monte Cristo went on thing.

2436
02:19:14.161 --> 02:19:17.220
Yeah,
a Little Monte Cristo.
That's perfect.
The problem is,

2437
02:19:17.221 --> 02:19:19.530
is when Jamie first originally gave it to me,
I thought it,

2438
02:19:19.590 --> 02:19:21.360
I didn't think it was that strong,

2439
02:19:21.361 --> 02:19:25.140
so I was just drinking it like a drink and I almost drank like a half a bottle

2440
02:19:25.141 --> 02:19:27.870
of it and that's like drinking a half bottle of Jack.
Yeah.
You can find

2441
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:30.620
<v 1>how many guys did you fucked that night?
Just you</v>

2442
02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:40.150
like
fucking podcast.

2443
02:19:42.430 --> 02:19:46.010
This is legal to sell.
Yeah,
that's exit.
I could go to a bar,

2444
02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:49.120
I can go to a bar and get this.
Yeah,
this has a barcode on it.
Wow.

2445
02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:52.610
Midnight Moon fucked him.
Delicious ice cubes.

2446
02:19:52.730 --> 02:19:55.520
As long as they have one of those fucking with things on it,
that's legit.

2447
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:58.940
That means it's gone through the government taxes and all that shit.
Man,

2448
02:19:58.941 --> 02:20:02.300
I wonder what the fuck is going to happen to this country now that we realize

2449
02:20:02.301 --> 02:20:04.010
that these assholes can't communicate.

2450
02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:08.780
They can't get along so badly that they're shutting the government down like

2451
02:20:08.781 --> 02:20:11.810
they're throwing a temper tantrum and then they're not working their way through

2452
02:20:11.811 --> 02:20:13.020
this and they're shutting the government down.

2453
02:20:13.021 --> 02:20:15.710
I read this thing on Reddit that I thought was a really cool solution,

2454
02:20:15.711 --> 02:20:19.400
which is the adding to the constitution some way that if this happens to,

2455
02:20:19.401 --> 02:20:23.750
I do reelections for everyone so that we can just,
um,

2456
02:20:24.380 --> 02:20:28.560
we can,
we can wipe the slate.
That's a good idea.
That's in competence.

2457
02:20:28.580 --> 02:20:32.000
That's clear in competence.
Apparently if like all the states wanted to do that,

2458
02:20:32.001 --> 02:20:33.140
there's a way to do that.

2459
02:20:33.141 --> 02:20:36.380
There's actually a way for the states to band together so that we can do

2460
02:20:36.381 --> 02:20:39.650
complete reelections and get,
get,
you know,
since it's not working,

2461
02:20:39.651 --> 02:20:42.860
they can't do their jobs.
It's not working.
Let's get new people in there.

2462
02:20:43.160 --> 02:20:46.400
But then they're seen rand Paul and some other dude got taught,

2463
02:20:46.430 --> 02:20:50.420
got caught in a conversation with their mics on about the reactions that people

2464
02:20:50.421 --> 02:20:52.280
are going to have to all this.
Now what do they say?

2465
02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:53.840
They're just talking about hedging their bets.

2466
02:20:53.841 --> 02:20:56.900
So just talking about saying all the things that talking points are all the

2467
02:20:56.901 --> 02:20:59.510
things they were willing to compromise on with the president wasn't.

2468
02:20:59.511 --> 02:21:02.130
And it's really spooky stuff cause it's,
it,

2469
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:07.040
it comes down to this gigantic system grinding to a halt because a bunch of

2470
02:21:07.041 --> 02:21:09.620
people were in an ego battle and they're playing a game of chess.

2471
02:21:09.640 --> 02:21:13.700
Well it's almost like the founding fathers built into the machine.

2472
02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:18.880
I thing that I think it's supposed to alert the population that we have to do

2473
02:21:19.161 --> 02:21:23.840
something more.
I think that's what that is.
I mean I just saw,
I hate saying this,

2474
02:21:23.841 --> 02:21:24.890
I mean,
I don't know why I hate saying it,

2475
02:21:24.891 --> 02:21:29.600
but I just saw Jesse Ventura on Pierce Morgan and he was giving this very like

2476
02:21:29.870 --> 02:21:34.700
intelligent,
cogent a description of what's happening.
And he was saying,

2477
02:21:34.701 --> 02:21:35.150
we,

2478
02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:38.660
this means that we need to have a revolution and it doesn't have to be violent,

2479
02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:43.960
but we do need to revolutionize the way government works because right now it's

2480
02:21:44.061 --> 02:21:48.870
not working.
And the reason it's not working is because,
um,
there is a,

2481
02:21:49.060 --> 02:21:52.070
a percentage of people who don't believe that they should have to get,

2482
02:21:52.210 --> 02:21:55.920
the government can impose a health insurance or that,

2483
02:21:55.921 --> 02:21:58.190
that that can make people buy health insurance.

2484
02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:01.490
I think the government has to adapt just like the porn industry did.

2485
02:22:01.970 --> 02:22:05.870
The porn industry came along and the Internet came along and clipped the fucking

2486
02:22:05.871 --> 02:22:09.540
legs out of the porn industry.
Is they're still porn available,
Brian?
Yes,

2487
02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:12.800
there is.
That's right.
You know,
why?
Cause they adjusted.

2488
02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:16.370
They did what they had to do and I think the government needs to do the same.

2489
02:22:16.390 --> 02:22:20.210
What the Internet does not allow the government to be the same entity.
Right.

2490
02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:23.450
It's too obvious where the money comes from.
We know too much about lobbyists.

2491
02:22:23.451 --> 02:22:25.980
We know too much about the influence of corporations.
We

2492
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:29.160
<v 0>know too much about Congress and now congress has been influenced to the point</v>

2493
02:22:29.161 --> 02:22:34.050
where they're willing to actually Lau corporations to vote as humans and with

2494
02:22:34.051 --> 02:22:35.370
their money and,
and,
and,

2495
02:22:35.430 --> 02:22:38.910
and have no limits on how much they can contribute to individual candidates who

2496
02:22:38.911 --> 02:22:41.610
will eventually serve their business needs.
Once they get into office,

2497
02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:45.300
it's nonsense and we know it's nonsense now because the internet,

2498
02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:50.400
just like we know that 3,999 for a DVD with,
you know,

2499
02:22:50.460 --> 02:22:52.800
insert the blank.
Tara.
Patrick does not.

2500
02:22:52.830 --> 02:22:57.120
You don't have to do that when you can go to youtube youporn and just,
it's free.

2501
02:22:57.150 --> 02:23:01.320
Just beat off online and we know that now.
So that,
that that kicked out the legs.

2502
02:23:01.430 --> 02:23:04.890
Yes.
Digital information ones in near in a very different way.

2503
02:23:05.070 --> 02:23:06.300
But it's the same thing.

2504
02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:10.920
The Internet has kicked off the legs of politics and politics is holding on by a

2505
02:23:10.921 --> 02:23:11.820
fucking claw.

2506
02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:14.840
They're hanging on like that kitten in that we have to hang in there.

2507
02:23:15.330 --> 02:23:18.700
<v 8>It's getting to the point where we have to do something like [inaudible]</v>

2508
02:23:19.090 --> 02:23:24.090
<v 0>worse or it will happen just like the ice age eventually stopped or just like</v>

2509
02:23:24.910 --> 02:23:26.440
war eventually ends.

2510
02:23:26.650 --> 02:23:29.500
Just like we got out of Vietnam just like the civil war ended.

2511
02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:34.240
Something will eventually break.
We'll get to a point where we're like,
enough.

2512
02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:36.680
<v 8>Yeah.
Well let's just hope.
I mean,
I don't,
I,</v>

2513
02:23:37.210 --> 02:23:39.820
by the way lately I've just been trying to avoid the news,
uh,

2514
02:23:40.060 --> 02:23:41.980
which is hard when you got,
when you're addicted to read it.

2515
02:23:41.981 --> 02:23:46.390
But I've been trying to avoid it completely.
But the,
um,

2516
02:23:48.190 --> 02:23:51.640
if what they're saying,
if it's,
if it's not just a bunch of bullshit,

2517
02:23:51.700 --> 02:23:52.660
if what they're saying is true,

2518
02:23:52.661 --> 02:23:55.330
then we could go into another recession because of this.

2519
02:23:55.331 --> 02:23:59.020
This could drive us into another recession.
And if that's the case,

2520
02:23:59.021 --> 02:24:02.260
then um,
well then that means that we have to get a new,

2521
02:24:02.410 --> 02:24:05.710
there needs to be a new government because there's no reason for us to go into

2522
02:24:05.711 --> 02:24:09.130
another recession where you know that how many of them are there and the

2523
02:24:09.131 --> 02:24:09.964
government.

2524
02:24:11.100 --> 02:24:12.000
<v 0>Yeah.
How many,</v>

2525
02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:14.950
<v 8>how many senators?
How many congressmen?
That's a really good question.</v>

2526
02:24:14.980 --> 02:24:18.160
How many is it?
I don't know the exact amount.
There's an exact amount.
What is it?

2527
02:24:18.161 --> 02:24:21.100
200 people.
Seven.
Yeah.

2528
02:24:21.101 --> 02:24:25.060
It's an how many people were on the planet or on earth and how many people are

2529
02:24:25.061 --> 02:24:27.760
in the United States because the shit that happens in the United States affects

2530
02:24:27.761 --> 02:24:32.080
the entire planet.
So it's like the fact that there's,
I don't know,
I don't know.

2531
02:24:32.081 --> 02:24:35.320
It's sad that I don't know the number of senators and congressmen and the need

2532
02:24:35.321 --> 02:24:37.780
to,
it's all nonsense.
Whatever this tiny,
tiny,

2533
02:24:37.781 --> 02:24:42.430
tiny number is compared to the ocean of humanity.
Uh,

2534
02:24:42.431 --> 02:24:46.480
the fact that they're creating an unnecessary situation,

2535
02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:51.640
where are we going to all theoretically suffer,
uh,
shows that,

2536
02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:52.540
um,

2537
02:24:52.540 --> 02:24:57.540
we as the people have been conditioned to believe that we're powerless and so

2538
02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:00.670
that that conditioning needs to go away.

2539
02:25:00.850 --> 02:25:03.880
And the moment it did and we organized in a nonviolent way,

2540
02:25:03.881 --> 02:25:05.980
then they would immediately start listening to us.

2541
02:25:06.160 --> 02:25:08.620
It's just that everyone gets so mad,
oh,

2542
02:25:08.740 --> 02:25:11.560
the government doesn't represent the people anymore.
It's like,
well,

2543
02:25:11.561 --> 02:25:12.640
that may be true,

2544
02:25:12.820 --> 02:25:16.630
but what are we doing to organize to make it so that they start listening to us

2545
02:25:16.631 --> 02:25:18.250
again?
We need to do that.

2546
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:21.750
<v 0>Um,
yeah,
and no.
I mean,
yeah.
And that little,</v>

2547
02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:25.570
something's got to change and no in that really what would be optimal is if the

2548
02:25:25.571 --> 02:25:28.360
people that were in positions of power realize that there were fucking over the

2549
02:25:28.361 --> 02:25:31.450
world that would be the best.
And they just said,
hey guys,
you know,
we,

2550
02:25:31.451 --> 02:25:33.790
we ate some pot and we realize we're a bunch of cons.

2551
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:38.110
So we're willing to like try to figure out how to figure out a way how to reward

2552
02:25:38.111 --> 02:25:40.370
people for the work they've already done,
but yet,

2553
02:25:40.371 --> 02:25:43.990
and move forward in a much more ethical way of distributing wealth.

2554
02:25:44.050 --> 02:25:47.440
Good luck man.
Good luck.
Cause that's socialism talk you fucking calming,
right?

2555
02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:50.340
<v 3>These people are fucking human fossils.
Look at,</v>

2556
02:25:50.510 --> 02:25:54.780
imagine taking pot with Bainer.
Imagine like,

2557
02:25:55.940 --> 02:26:00.260
can you imagine looking across at that guy and he's like transforming into howdy

2558
02:26:00.261 --> 02:26:04.640
duty in front of you.
His eyes are glowing red.
No Way,
man.

2559
02:26:04.641 --> 02:26:07.760
I don't know if it's possible.
It seems like these are,
uh,

2560
02:26:07.790 --> 02:26:09.860
earlier versions of human beings.

2561
02:26:09.861 --> 02:26:13.640
You whose entire operating system is,
uh,

2562
02:26:13.940 --> 02:26:18.230
is needed an update since the 70s.
There is no imagine if you're,

2563
02:26:18.290 --> 02:26:21.860
if you had an updated your iPhone since when I phones came out.

2564
02:26:22.130 --> 02:26:24.280
That's what these people are like with information.

2565
02:26:24.470 --> 02:26:27.530
<v 0>But they're way worse than the iPhones.
These motherfuckers murder.</v>

2566
02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:32.360
They're on a bbs board in the early nineties.
Yeah,
with a 14,
four modem.

2567
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:34.790
And the shit cuts out every five minutes,

2568
02:26:34.791 --> 02:26:36.320
then they might want to top of the ball.
Yeah.

2569
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:40.390
<v 3>Yeah.
Well it's,
it's the whole thing's fucking wrong,
man.
I really liked that.</v>

2570
02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:44.820
I had Christopher Ryan on my podcast and he was talking about how in indigenous

2571
02:26:44.821 --> 02:26:45.660
cultures,

2572
02:26:46.470 --> 02:26:50.340
the people who never are allowed to become leaders or the people who indicate

2573
02:26:50.341 --> 02:26:51.630
that they want to be leaders,

2574
02:26:51.930 --> 02:26:55.170
like those are always the ones people avoid is being the leaders and the ones

2575
02:26:55.171 --> 02:26:59.220
who end up being leaders are the ones who know the most about certain things

2576
02:26:59.221 --> 02:27:03.610
like fishing or hunting.
Those people are naturally followed,
right.

2577
02:27:03.630 --> 02:27:07.680
They don't fucking throw makeup on and try to get in front of a try to hypnotize

2578
02:27:07.681 --> 02:27:11.700
a country by saying the exact same thing.
Everyone always says,
good evening.
Yeah,

2579
02:27:11.970 --> 02:27:15.630
my fellow American president talk that weird cadence.
Why are you talking?

2580
02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:17.100
<v 0>What the fuck is exactly right?</v>

2581
02:27:17.430 --> 02:27:22.140
We've talked about that a hundred times on this show you and if you were sitting

2582
02:27:22.141 --> 02:27:24.720
at home with a guy and he started talking to you like that,
you would stop him.

2583
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:27.630
He'd be like,
what the fuck are you doing?
Are you trying to hypnotize me?

2584
02:27:27.650 --> 02:27:30.360
He imagined it.
Joey Diaz just sitting across from Obama.
Joey,

2585
02:27:31.100 --> 02:27:32.070
what we're doing right now.

2586
02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:33.410
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2587
02:27:33.410 --> 02:27:37.520
<v 0>Bipartisan efforts have been reached.
We have reached out to Republicans.</v>

2588
02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:38.440
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2589
02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:43.270
<v 0>For unwilling to bargain.
Yeah.
Even like you're fucking killing me dog.
Yeah.</v>

2590
02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:46.510
You're talking to me like that.
Oh yeah.
And also the way it give me the fuck out.

2591
02:27:46.511 --> 02:27:50.890
I was born,
I was North Bergen,
New Jersey,
1978 look at this picture.
Look at me.

2592
02:27:50.891 --> 02:27:53.350
Motherfuck I'm on a basketball team with a bunch of guineas.

2593
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:57.490
One black guy and a Filipino.
Why are you talking to me like that?

2594
02:27:57.510 --> 02:28:02.350
It's what's happening is diffusion of,
it's gone.
You're so gone.

2595
02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:06.170
I'm gone.
I'm watching my boy and what?
Listen.
It'll via,

2596
02:28:06.430 --> 02:28:08.500
how high are you on a scale of one to a billion.

2597
02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:12.640
I'm like six for Joey Diaz to be this high man.

2598
02:28:12.641 --> 02:28:14.960
Whatever you took the fallen,

2599
02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:21.470
that shit must have come out of a time machine
do that.

2600
02:28:21.471 --> 02:28:22.550
We met in Utah,

2601
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:26.060
<v 1>the black hole of the bulletproof wolf that pops out a portal,</v>

2602
02:28:26.061 --> 02:28:30.710
opened up a worm,
vomiting it out,
whatever you ate.
The orbs basically.

2603
02:28:30.770 --> 02:28:34.780
Basically the orbs.
Yeah.
Man,
I cookie to,
Jody has his house.

2604
02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:36.200
I've never seen you like this.

2605
02:28:37.260 --> 02:28:40.540
<v 5>Ooh.
Smoked dope and people who won't smoke dope.</v>

2606
02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:45.280
And how the people don't smoke dope worry me because the people who don't smoke

2607
02:28:45.281 --> 02:28:48.250
dope have just called me eight times after I told him from the glass,

2608
02:28:48.251 --> 02:28:52.870
they days that I was doing your podcast for them from one through whatever.

2609
02:28:53.770 --> 02:28:56.950
They've continually called me today.
And then the people who don't smoke,

2610
02:28:57.040 --> 02:29:00.810
the people who smoked dope,
they don't bug me at home.

2611
02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:03.520
They ain't trying to fucking call me.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?

2612
02:29:03.521 --> 02:29:06.550
People who don't see that?
A friend of mine that wanted to do something Friday,

2613
02:29:06.650 --> 02:29:09.730
I said I'm gonna be busy from like one thought,
like five,

2614
02:29:09.731 --> 02:29:13.270
maybe six maybe I won't see it,
but I'll call you when I get out of there.

2615
02:29:13.810 --> 02:29:17.750
He's already called me three times since I've been in there.
Yeah,

2616
02:29:18.750 --> 02:29:21.250
you're getting mad.
No,
no I'm not.
I'm not getting mad.

2617
02:29:21.251 --> 02:29:25.270
I just thought I spoke to him about it and it's just weird how people don't

2618
02:29:25.271 --> 02:29:28.660
fucking listen.
They don't listen.
They don't care to listen.

2619
02:29:28.661 --> 02:29:32.940
They don't want to listen.
You know?
It just,
it's always,
you know,

2620
02:29:34.130 --> 02:29:37.300
so that's it.
That's what I was thinking.
That's it.

2621
02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:39.520
This is motherfuckers don't want to listen.
They don't want to fucking listen.

2622
02:29:39.900 --> 02:29:43.780
I don't last for much.
Who does want to listen,
Joey?
Nobody.
Me Neither.

2623
02:29:43.930 --> 02:29:45.300
I don't want to listen.
That's why we,

2624
02:29:45.410 --> 02:29:47.660
<v 1>they're too busy with my own shit.
I'm trying to sort out my own shit.</v>

2625
02:29:47.690 --> 02:29:51.620
That's right.
It doesn't need to listen to anybody.
That's right.
Duncan Nelson,

2626
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:55.880
you get around somebody who's listening to you.
It's the coolest thing ever.

2627
02:29:57.950 --> 02:30:02.900
Wow.
Hence the 24 year old girlfriend.
Mystified use string words.

2628
02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:06.470
I go wizard.
No,

2629
02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:10.560
<v 5>like body.
You know I love you.
You're a savage.
You take these girls.
I love it.</v>

2630
02:30:10.590 --> 02:30:11.423
We teach them.

2631
02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:16.190
<v 1>I'm not,
I'm not getting,
I'm not teaching this and she's really super fun.</v>

2632
02:30:16.610 --> 02:30:21.030
We're just joking around.
Yeah.
These are jokes is honorable because,

2633
02:30:21.031 --> 02:30:23.610
because you like her so much.
This is where you stopped choking.

2634
02:30:23.850 --> 02:30:27.690
You like halted jail.
You'll come on guy.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2635
02:30:27.810 --> 02:30:31.650
Like you can't even joke around about it because you actually liked her.
Sweet.

2636
02:30:31.870 --> 02:30:35.670
It's sweet.
It's beautiful.
You're supposed to do that.
You are,
you are.
Well,

2637
02:30:35.671 --> 02:30:36.504
it just shows that that,

2638
02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:39.700
<v 5>so you really are,
you know that you're,
you know,
you really liked the check.</v>

2639
02:30:39.730 --> 02:30:43.330
She's cool.
Nothing wrong in being 24 I was 24 ones by the way.
When I was 24

2640
02:30:43.410 --> 02:30:46.680
<v 1>I was dumb as fuck.
Who wouldn't want to be friends with me?</v>

2641
02:30:46.890 --> 02:30:48.630
If I was 24 and I was in this room,
you'd be like,

2642
02:30:48.631 --> 02:30:53.200
get that Dick had out near go Mary.

2643
02:30:53.230 --> 02:30:54.063
So dumb

2644
02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:58.570
<v 5>when I can.
We didn't have the Internet.
What?
We didn't have the Internet.</v>

2645
02:30:59.530 --> 02:31:00.363
We didn't have it.

2646
02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:04.860
<v 1>Well I,
I had rudimentary,
we,
we had rudimentary intermit Lee's,</v>

2647
02:31:04.940 --> 02:31:09.700
he didn't have the real internet internet download jpegs and I take a long time.

2648
02:31:09.701 --> 02:31:13.120
He just hope that it would like click over the tits so you could start

2649
02:31:13.121 --> 02:31:13.960
masturbating.

2650
02:31:14.140 --> 02:31:19.120
That's what porn used to be is waiting for those wines of pixels to roll down

2651
02:31:19.140 --> 02:31:19.973
the screen.

2652
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:20.581
<v 3>Well,
you know,</v>

2653
02:31:20.581 --> 02:31:23.640
I think that it took a long time for us to figure out what to do with it.

2654
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:24.660
So the early Internet,

2655
02:31:24.661 --> 02:31:27.510
like I was on the Internet in [inaudible] 94 but I didn't learn a God damn thing

2656
02:31:27.511 --> 02:31:30.850
until 2003 I didn't learn anything.

2657
02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:35.850
It was all just talking Shit and message boards and downloading porn and

2658
02:31:35.851 --> 02:31:36.780
nonsense.

2659
02:31:36.781 --> 02:31:41.520
And then somewhere along the line that all got boring and I started learning

2660
02:31:41.521 --> 02:31:45.570
shit.
I think we started paying attention more things.

2661
02:31:45.780 --> 02:31:48.750
It was also like the three years into my pot journey.

2662
02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:52.380
I started with the weed around 2000 so that's when I started questioning a lot

2663
02:31:52.381 --> 02:31:55.140
of different things in about 2000 delving into the infinite,

2664
02:31:55.141 --> 02:31:58.290
deeper God for the Internet.
It's revolutionizing everything,
man.

2665
02:31:58.291 --> 02:32:03.180
Even like fucking taxis.
Uber,
it's amazing.
Are you fucking shitting me man?

2666
02:32:03.181 --> 02:32:07.350
It's the exact same price as a taxi.
Tell people what it is.
There's a,
there's a,

2667
02:32:07.530 --> 02:32:10.530
I'm not sponsored by them at all.
I just love him.
I just used them.

2668
02:32:10.531 --> 02:32:13.680
I only use them once.
It was incredible.
But there's a company called Uber.

2669
02:32:13.710 --> 02:32:16.290
It's an APP.
And you go onto Uber,

2670
02:32:16.500 --> 02:32:21.360
you click a button and within when I did it the first time there,
there's a,

2671
02:32:21.361 --> 02:32:25.260
it's they send like a limo to your house and it was there in two minutes.

2672
02:32:25.350 --> 02:32:30.180
It's the exact same price,
maybe $5 more than a taxi.
And it's incredible.

2673
02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:34.560
Yeah,
it's just we move,
it's great in New York City,
it's a,
it's amazing.
And it's,

2674
02:32:34.561 --> 02:32:38.640
and the taxi companies in La took them to court and tried to sue them so they

2675
02:32:38.641 --> 02:32:41.400
couldn't exist really because it's such a competition.

2676
02:32:41.401 --> 02:32:45.300
I just talked to the taxi driver all about this and he said there's good reasons

2677
02:32:45.301 --> 02:32:47.580
for it to my friend,
I not friend,

2678
02:32:47.581 --> 02:32:50.520
this guy I know drove for one of the Uber type things and he like,

2679
02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:51.413
I think it was Lyft,

2680
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:54.870
he got in a car accident with three other people while he was driving.

2681
02:32:55.170 --> 02:32:59.010
And you would think like Lyft or this company would insure everything.

2682
02:32:59.040 --> 02:32:59.731
Everybody would know.

2683
02:32:59.731 --> 02:33:04.731
He's getting sued by everybody in the car and his insurance isn't supposed to be

2684
02:33:04.921 --> 02:33:06.840
covering,
you know,
when he's working.

2685
02:33:07.170 --> 02:33:09.660
And a lot of these people don't have the right insurances.

2686
02:33:09.661 --> 02:33:11.370
So when you're in an Uber or something like that,

2687
02:33:11.371 --> 02:33:14.370
they're not getting approved by the state.
They're not getting insured.

2688
02:33:14.380 --> 02:33:17.490
So they're there.
It's kind of almost illegal in some ways.

2689
02:33:17.700 --> 02:33:19.710
So what I would never do anything illegal,

2690
02:33:20.130 --> 02:33:23.710
but the taxi drivers have now all have their own apps now.
Like,
like the,

2691
02:33:23.740 --> 02:33:27.000
like the yellow cab APP has,
it's the exact same thing Uber has announced.

2692
02:33:27.001 --> 02:33:29.500
So they're actually catching up trying to do that shit still.

2693
02:33:29.640 --> 02:33:31.350
Even if the yellow cab APP works,

2694
02:33:31.351 --> 02:33:33.720
you're still in the back of a fucking taxi with Uber.

2695
02:33:33.721 --> 02:33:38.500
You're in like a super nice car,
bottled water in the back and it's the same PR.

2696
02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:42.990
The main crazy thing about it is it's some $5 more,
they can't compete.

2697
02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:44.850
There's no way they're going to compete with that.

2698
02:33:44.851 --> 02:33:46.860
Like once people start really finding out about it,

2699
02:33:46.861 --> 02:33:49.980
who's gonna fuck call the fucking cab?
Why?
Yeah,
why would you?

2700
02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:53.910
And it takes longer to get a cab.
When I,
when I did the Uber thing,

2701
02:33:53.911 --> 02:33:55.200
it was there in two minutes.
Like,
you know,

2702
02:33:55.201 --> 02:33:59.700
when you see your dog take a shit and instantaneously there's a fly on the shit

2703
02:33:59.701 --> 02:34:04.610
and you're like,
how is that possible?
Where did they come from?
Everywhere are,

2704
02:34:04.650 --> 02:34:08.160
there was so many people out there driving limos.

2705
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:12.630
The number of people driving limos was pretty gigantic.
It's amazing.
Yeah.
I mean,

2706
02:34:12.930 --> 02:34:15.170
think about where you're at.
You're in the Los Angeles area,

2707
02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:17.950
the amount of airplane pickups,
airport pickups,

2708
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:20.500
<v 0>airport pickups,
or what limo driving is all about,
right?</v>

2709
02:34:20.501 --> 02:34:25.030
I worked for Fifth Avenue Limo and Boston and 90% of my work was uh,

2710
02:34:25.390 --> 02:34:30.130
airports,
airport pickups.
I pick people up,
take them to New Hampshire,

2711
02:34:30.190 --> 02:34:32.170
take them anywhere from Logan Airport,

2712
02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:36.700
all look like in a hundred miles spiral,
you know,
in any direction.

2713
02:34:37.510 --> 02:34:40.090
Awesome.
Yeah,
so there's always a bunch of people waiting around.

2714
02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:44.260
Like that's the other crazy thing about limos is those motherfuckers work insane

2715
02:34:44.261 --> 02:34:49.180
amount of hours.
Like it's not just a,
a crazy like regular job,

2716
02:34:49.181 --> 02:34:53.740
like 12 hours a day,
1617,
18 go back home,
sleep for a few hours.

2717
02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:57.160
They'll call you in the morning.
I worked until two o'clock in the morning.

2718
02:34:57.161 --> 02:35:01.090
He's mother fuckers were calling me at six asking me to come back in.
I was like,

2719
02:35:01.091 --> 02:35:03.700
you're fucking crazy.
And then we're like,
look,
you got debt,

2720
02:35:03.701 --> 02:35:06.130
you've got credit card payment problems,
you've got this,
you've got that,

2721
02:35:06.131 --> 02:35:10.390
we'll take care of you.
Well,
I'll tell you what,
we got a fucking bounty of work.

2722
02:35:10.540 --> 02:35:12.790
And they're like,
see Mikey Mikey over here.
The guy had,

2723
02:35:12.850 --> 02:35:17.050
he had a Boston college sticker on his Cadillac,
didn't go to college.

2724
02:35:17.290 --> 02:35:19.870
He just liked Boston College.
Right.
It was just the limo driver.

2725
02:35:19.871 --> 02:35:23.800
It was kind of a sad character,
just guide.
This was all he did was work.

2726
02:35:24.100 --> 02:35:27.190
And he's like,
he makes a good living.
He doesn't have to bust his ass.
You know,

2727
02:35:27.191 --> 02:35:30.730
he's in here 16 1718 hours a day sometimes.
And they was like,

2728
02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:34.270
that's how you do it.
And he gets in his car and he drives off and we're like,

2729
02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:37.690
like,
he's got a nice apartment.
He's got a nice Cadillac.

2730
02:35:37.691 --> 02:35:40.510
He's driving me while this guy was a slave.

2731
02:35:40.750 --> 02:35:44.080
He was a slave to veal Scallopini at the nice Italian restaurant that he could

2732
02:35:44.081 --> 02:35:45.100
get it anytime he wants.

2733
02:35:45.340 --> 02:35:47.770
He was a slave to the fact that in a nice apartment with a nice view,

2734
02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:48.551
we looked out his window,

2735
02:35:48.551 --> 02:35:52.570
he felt like a winner and he was a slave to his Cadillac with his BC sticker on

2736
02:35:52.571 --> 02:35:56.980
it.
And this fucking guy worked every day.
And you could do that.

2737
02:35:57.130 --> 02:36:00.400
The good thing was if you were in a hole,
you're in a financial hole was good.

2738
02:36:00.401 --> 02:36:03.070
They paid well,
you could work and you can make good living.

2739
02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:06.250
That guy made more than 60 grand a year driving limos.

2740
02:36:06.251 --> 02:36:10.780
And this was back in 1999,
99.
Even 1989.

2741
02:36:11.020 --> 02:36:15.460
So it was a long time ago.
I'm sorry Jerry,
I'm sorry.

2742
02:36:15.940 --> 02:36:18.420
No,
go ahead.
Go Uber.
And so you know,
listen,

2743
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:20.860
Uber obviously is $5 more than the cab.

2744
02:36:21.700 --> 02:36:24.730
So what that does is that on the cuts everybody again,
yeah,

2745
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:28.200
like that lowers the price.
I mean it's good for us,
but it's like,

2746
02:36:28.201 --> 02:36:33.190
so what's good for them too.
It's just bad.
It's bad for calves.

2747
02:36:33.191 --> 02:36:36.150
They're busy,
you know,
at least,
uh,
instead of,
you know,

2748
02:36:36.430 --> 02:36:40.510
that same ride because 85 now with a little bit probably cause 55.

2749
02:36:40.630 --> 02:36:45.610
That's how he ever tell you.
When I drove Jeff Beck,
I drove Jeff Beck.
Uh,

2750
02:36:45.700 --> 02:36:48.520
well I time I didn't,
I don't know if he was,
yeah,

2751
02:36:48.521 --> 02:36:52.420
he was in my van and uh,
the,
the,
um,

2752
02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:55.210
the manager,
it was some,

2753
02:36:55.330 --> 02:37:00.030
I was picking up rock stars on a regular basis and the manager for,
um,

2754
02:37:00.130 --> 02:37:04.060
Annie Lennox was there too.
And we went to some hotel where we saw Annie Lennox,

2755
02:37:04.061 --> 02:37:06.760
but I couldn't,
I wanted to get Stevie ray Vaughan.

2756
02:37:06.761 --> 02:37:10.300
I was a big Stevie Ray Vaughan fan.
Steve Ray Vaughan refused limos,

2757
02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:14.470
would not take limos,
wrote it in cabs.
All he did was riding calves.

2758
02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:17.660
You have a limo waiting for Steve Ray Vaughan and be like,
hmm,
thanks.

2759
02:37:17.930 --> 02:37:20.480
And he's like [inaudible] he put his hand up,

2760
02:37:20.481 --> 02:37:24.860
get a taxi throws bag and fucking the backseat and bring his guitar in there

2761
02:37:24.861 --> 02:37:28.610
with them and that's it.
And he was gone.
He didn't want to ride in your Limo,
man.

2762
02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:32.200
He wasn't interested.
It's really kind of interesting because they had,

2763
02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:37.360
they had a limo for him at la or at Logan Airport in Boston and he's like,

2764
02:37:37.730 --> 02:37:38.990
yeah,
I'm not interested.
Yeah,

2765
02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:42.720
<v 3>probably like the thick smell of soup farts and Cologne.
Well,</v>

2766
02:37:42.721 --> 02:37:44.550
he probably could do heroin,
which more comfortable.

2767
02:37:44.710 --> 02:37:46.460
<v 0>The back of a car.
Yeah.
Right.</v>

2768
02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:50.020
I don't know if this is the time where he was doing heroin or if he was just

2769
02:37:50.140 --> 02:37:54.220
being authentic.
Oh,
you know,
some people just decide that like you got to,

2770
02:37:54.730 --> 02:37:59.210
in order to do real art like that,
like real Stevie Ray Vaughan type music.
Yeah.

2771
02:37:59.290 --> 02:38:02.830
You got to be down in the gutter.
You gotta be down with the people.

2772
02:38:02.831 --> 02:38:05.320
It's not about the gutter.
I mean,
oh,
cab drivers,
not the gutter,

2773
02:38:05.500 --> 02:38:08.470
but a cab drivers down.
That's a real dude.
You know,

2774
02:38:08.471 --> 02:38:12.730
you're driving around a city and you taking a cab and the cab is driven by guy

2775
02:38:12.731 --> 02:38:17.080
lives in the city.
That's a guy was working,
but he's also on the grind.

2776
02:38:17.110 --> 02:38:18.730
That's a real dude,
you know?

2777
02:38:18.930 --> 02:38:22.470
<v 3>Sure.
Man.
That's one way to look at things.
But every time I get in a fucking cab,</v>

2778
02:38:22.471 --> 02:38:25.140
I feel like somebody would just amaze me with your car.

2779
02:38:26.040 --> 02:38:27.780
I don't feel like I'm with a fucking people.

2780
02:38:27.781 --> 02:38:32.730
I feel like I'm in a gas chamber filled with Shitty Cologne.
Well,

2781
02:38:32.731 --> 02:38:33.564
Dzhokhar's.
All right

2782
02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:35.080
<v 5>man.
If you're trying to get laid and you live,</v>

2783
02:38:35.410 --> 02:38:38.220
<v 3>not when it's mixed with garlic burps and the smells,</v>

2784
02:38:39.070 --> 02:38:43.480
so money's rati to us.
The smell at somebodies rotting prostate,

2785
02:38:45.490 --> 02:38:47.000
we're there every day.

2786
02:38:47.020 --> 02:38:50.980
They just poured your car under their ass hole to try to cover up this rotting

2787
02:38:50.981 --> 02:38:52.420
stink of their intestines.

2788
02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:00.790
<v 5>Writers on the stone.
[inaudible]</v>

2789
02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:07.120
Dunkin Saturday night comedy store.
Yes.
Joe Diaz.

2790
02:39:07.150 --> 02:39:09.280
Where are you going to be at next week?
I'm good.

2791
02:39:09.281 --> 02:39:14.281
Ari Shaffir at cubs suck upon it both Friday and Saturday.

2792
02:39:14.291 --> 02:39:17.500
Sucks upon it and get your shit together.
That's a fucking fantastic.

2793
02:39:17.970 --> 02:39:22.870
Motherfuck on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.
Don't fuck around.
Joey Diaz.

2794
02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:26.550
Ari Shapiro is very funny right now,
man.
He's on.
He's on point.
Yeah,
no,

2795
02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:30.070
we got this some point and shows a great show.
Well,
you know,

2796
02:39:30.071 --> 02:39:33.250
everybody's been accelerating.
It's been fun to watch.

2797
02:39:33.580 --> 02:39:34.840
I'm not going to say the bit,

2798
02:39:34.841 --> 02:39:37.300
but the bit that you and I talked about on the phone that you're doing now.

2799
02:39:37.330 --> 02:39:39.820
I don't want to say what it is,
but it's fucking hilarious.

2800
02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:44.350
I love watching everybody like hit some new levels.

2801
02:39:44.810 --> 02:39:49.660
Liberace bit.
It's one of the funniest bits I've seen in decades.
Right?

2802
02:39:49.700 --> 02:39:53.130
No shit man.
It is hard.

2803
02:39:53.140 --> 02:39:54.860
Hard to write and took something away,

2804
02:39:54.861 --> 02:39:58.660
angle on it or write something around it and you get on stage.
But you know what?

2805
02:39:58.661 --> 02:40:01.130
I'm getting into the 50 minute bit now I'm,

2806
02:40:01.131 --> 02:40:03.190
I'm starting to dig those loans sets now.

2807
02:40:03.650 --> 02:40:08.170
It's starting to realize that the fee is the 15 minute fuck around and sit in

2808
02:40:08.171 --> 02:40:10.960
town was working now just stay home and sleep.

2809
02:40:10.961 --> 02:40:14.130
I just go into town that night early and do Thursday night and bring the
notebook

2810
02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:18.930
<v 2>with me and by Friday I'm fucking loose man.
It's,
it's,
it's really nice to,</v>

2811
02:40:19.130 --> 02:40:22.280
<v 0>is it different game?
You notice a difference game and our game,</v>

2812
02:40:22.580 --> 02:40:24.230
our game is different than the 15 yeah.

2813
02:40:25.020 --> 02:40:28.170
<v 2>Come on man.
It's and the only way to do with this to do it,</v>

2814
02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:30.820
it's like anything else.
Do it.
You can talk about,
you can write,

2815
02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:33.380
I'm trying to write my hour.
You're not going to write it bro.

2816
02:40:33.381 --> 02:40:35.070
You got to get up off your ass to go out and do it.

2817
02:40:35.290 --> 02:40:37.660
<v 0>I felt the difference in when I lived in New York too.</v>

2818
02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:41.230
It's one of the reasons why I did very few sets in New York City.
I was like,

2819
02:40:41.231 --> 02:40:45.220
this seven minutes set.
It's just not cotton at seven 10 10 minutes.

2820
02:40:45.221 --> 02:40:48.100
That's not cotton.
It either like I barely got warmed up,

2821
02:40:48.310 --> 02:40:52.570
I barely got get barely get cranking and when you're going on the road and

2822
02:40:52.571 --> 02:40:53.980
you're doing these long sets,

2823
02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:57.880
it's the difference between doing a trailer and doing a movie.
Right?

2824
02:40:58.130 --> 02:41:02.260
You know the trailer,
you know you,
you develop a totally different style.

2825
02:41:02.620 --> 02:41:06.400
You have this like real quick,
get to the point quickly shock them early,

2826
02:41:06.580 --> 02:41:10.180
be nice to him,
but yeah,
I get your point across.
You did.
You do thank you.

2827
02:41:10.220 --> 02:41:13.870
Goodnight.
And it's a sprint.
It's a wild sprint.
You're running up a hill,

2828
02:41:14.260 --> 02:41:15.190
but the set,

2829
02:41:15.250 --> 02:41:19.660
when you're doing an hour and 10 hour and 15 hour and 30 that's a different

2830
02:41:19.661 --> 02:41:24.130
animal.
That's an animal.
You were establishing a mindset.
Yeah,

2831
02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:27.850
you got to do that all the time to do that and that's such a jarring thing when

2832
02:41:27.851 --> 02:41:31.300
you've been doing that and then you come back and do it.
15 minutes set,

2833
02:41:31.301 --> 02:41:35.140
it feels really fucking weird.
It's less jarring though than the other way.

2834
02:41:35.350 --> 02:41:36.790
The other way is wait brutal.

2835
02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.850
When you're going from a 15 minute set and you think you know what you're doing

2836
02:41:39.851 --> 02:41:43.600
and all of sudden you have to do 45 and you get 35 minutes in and you're like,

2837
02:41:43.630 --> 02:41:48.400
I'm done.
Like I like C's.
I got no material left.

2838
02:41:48.430 --> 02:41:51.970
Where are you from,
sir?
Ah,
in the fucking panic.
In your eyes.

2839
02:41:52.510 --> 02:41:54.940
And just thinking too,
I have any jokes I haven't done.

2840
02:41:54.970 --> 02:41:57.400
Is there anything I haven't done or anything I'm working on that I haven't done

2841
02:41:57.430 --> 02:42:02.430
rambling through their Rolodex of your stone brain desperately for some scrap of

2842
02:42:02.561 --> 02:42:05.590
a joke.
Well for me,
back then it was not even stoned.
It was hot.

2843
02:42:05.650 --> 02:42:10.210
It was totally straight,
totally straight brain.
For the first few years,

2844
02:42:10.211 --> 02:42:12.220
I didn't even like come up beer before I went onstage.

2845
02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:14.260
I didn't want to have that as a crutch.

2846
02:42:14.770 --> 02:42:17.290
I remember the first time I went on stage,
I was shitting my pants.
I was like,

2847
02:42:17.291 --> 02:42:20.830
maybe I should go get a drink.
Calmed myself down and I was like,
stupid.

2848
02:42:20.831 --> 02:42:23.400
If you do that,
you're going to need a drink every time we go on stage.
Right.

2849
02:42:23.410 --> 02:42:24.490
Just take your medicine dummy.

2850
02:42:24.610 --> 02:42:28.480
I remember telling myself that and I just went out 21 years old,

2851
02:42:28.481 --> 02:42:30.130
took my medicine,
smart boy,

2852
02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:35.410
luckily crazy and smart at the same time.
Crazy enough to know.

2853
02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:39.670
It's like a really smart kid who gets a 500 horsepower car and really shouldn't

2854
02:42:39.671 --> 02:42:42.400
be able to drive it.
Like you gotta be careful,
stupid.

2855
02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:44.110
You got to know what the fuck you're doing with this thing.

2856
02:42:44.140 --> 02:42:46.150
You're going to hit the gas and fly off a cliff

2857
02:42:53.170 --> 02:42:57.400
looking sharp with the fucking UV,
abandoned the Fedora.
Is this permanent?

2858
02:42:58.090 --> 02:43:01.420
I've abandoned and can I shake your head?
No,
no.

2859
02:43:02.860 --> 02:43:07.210
Look at this,
my friend.
Look how that's what freedom looks like.
No way man.

2860
02:43:07.250 --> 02:43:12.060
Oh you say no way.
No Way.
No Way.
I'm never shaving fucking head man.

2861
02:43:12.130 --> 02:43:15.580
That's it.
I am happy that I made all the mistakes that I made.

2862
02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:19.960
All the mistakes that I made made me who I am today and I've made them work for

2863
02:43:19.961 --> 02:43:22.360
me.
But if I could change one thing,

2864
02:43:22.540 --> 02:43:26.650
it would be not that I would necessarily,
I like the fact that I,

2865
02:43:26.780 --> 02:43:30.610
I I talk about the fact that I panicked about losing my hair and so I got hair

2866
02:43:30.611 --> 02:43:33.260
transplants and I got stupid scar on the back of my hand.
Yeah.

2867
02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:37.540
But logically the one thing that makes us the least amount of sense,

2868
02:43:37.541 --> 02:43:40.930
I should shave my fucking head.
When I was like 21 I was,
she said,
you know what?

2869
02:43:40.931 --> 02:43:43.930
This ain't going to last.
I should have just went with it.

2870
02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:49.000
Cause this is like so comfortable.
It's so like easy to do.
It's so relaxing.

2871
02:43:49.030 --> 02:43:52.690
It's a non factor now.
And I know it's still a factor for you,
my friend.

2872
02:43:52.720 --> 02:43:54.880
Here's the thing,
man.
Here's the real factor.

2873
02:43:55.330 --> 02:43:58.600
You do every single thing called leaders do

2874
02:43:59.010 --> 02:44:02.100
<v 1>and I figured it shaving my head,</v>

2875
02:44:02.101 --> 02:44:06.600
I might as well go to the airport and start handing out USBs with your podcast.

2876
02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:11.330
Just a little Fyi,
if I ever do started called.
Yeah,
I'm not interested.
Right.

2877
02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:15.580
<v 0>A leader?
No,
of course not.
They you're a leader.
You're a leader.
You can be lead.</v>

2878
02:44:15.581 --> 02:44:18.700
Tell him what to do.
I'll let you go.
I don't give a fuck.
You can be the leader.

2879
02:44:18.720 --> 02:44:20.060
Sure.
This is what they

2880
02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:23.420
<v 1>play on the documentary after suicide.</v>

2881
02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:29.560
Listen,
behind that comment is a spaceship.

2882
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:32.710
It is a spaceship,
but they won't take you once you cut your balls off.

2883
02:44:32.950 --> 02:44:33.783
So it's up to you.

2884
02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:38.680
You want to leave on this earth and be in perpetual hell or do you want to cut

2885
02:44:38.681 --> 02:44:41.790
your balls off?
Put It on the Nike is get on the fucking spaceship.
Yeah.
Why?

2886
02:44:41.870 --> 02:44:44.800
God Dunkin.
Why not take some Alpha brain before you do it?

2887
02:44:44.830 --> 02:44:49.630
Take six and do some jumping jacks.
Alpha brain fouls shave.

2888
02:44:50.450 --> 02:44:54.770
Um,
for us.
Uh,
what does the vanilla come on out anyway?
It's out.

2889
02:44:55.330 --> 02:44:59.000
<v 0>Yeah,
we just,
I just got a new bottle of it.
It's vanilla with Asai,</v>

2890
02:44:59.250 --> 02:45:02.680
a hemp force protein powder.
It's fucking special.
What's available?

2891
02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:07.150
It tastes delicious.
It's so good.
Then we nailed it.
We took a long time.

2892
02:45:07.510 --> 02:45:11.110
This is not a slow process.
It's been really,
first of all,

2893
02:45:11.111 --> 02:45:13.080
Aubrey is an amazing,
yeah,

2894
02:45:13.100 --> 02:45:18.100
I'm talking about a pure person guy with pure intentions and a hard working dude

2895
02:45:18.641 --> 02:45:23.110
and a smart guy and deserves every good thing that's happened to him.

2896
02:45:23.290 --> 02:45:27.480
He's just an amazing guy.
He's a really unique individual and you,

2897
02:45:27.481 --> 02:45:29.140
you get it from his podcast,

2898
02:45:29.141 --> 02:45:33.390
he get it from is he puts down these videos like he,

2899
02:45:33.391 --> 02:45:36.280
he's made this one video about the psychedelic experience.
Me,

2900
02:45:36.281 --> 02:45:41.140
he's a smart motherfucker and I,
you know,
I found no weaknesses in his fence,

2901
02:45:41.470 --> 02:45:44.290
you know,
like a poke at people's fences and shit and try to figure out where the

2902
02:45:44.291 --> 02:45:48.310
weaknesses,
he's a,
he's the real deal man.
He's a young guy too.

2903
02:45:48.311 --> 02:45:53.311
It's very admirable watching someone go about trying to make a business and do

2904
02:45:55.181 --> 02:45:59.380
it correctly and do it in this day and age with all the scrutiny of the Internet

2905
02:45:59.381 --> 02:46:03.250
and all the cons,
just raining down shit,

2906
02:46:03.251 --> 02:46:06.490
rain on your head,
just opening their ass hole above your head

2907
02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:13.280
is emptying their bowels of failure upon your head and every point always like

2908
02:46:14.780 --> 02:46:17.000
and in their defense and their defense,

2909
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:20.960
if you pay attention to most of human behavior,

2910
02:46:20.961 --> 02:46:25.430
you're going to find people tend to gravitate towards the worst if they can get

2911
02:46:25.431 --> 02:46:29.450
away with it.
You know they get away with what they can get away with.
But the,

2912
02:46:29.750 --> 02:46:32.630
the beautiful thing about people who are true psychedelic explorer's,

2913
02:46:32.910 --> 02:46:35.600
and that's a fucking gross term,
but I'm going to use in any way,

2914
02:46:35.601 --> 02:46:36.710
even though it's been co opted,

2915
02:46:37.010 --> 02:46:40.220
the true psychedelic explorer's really are trying to do the right thing at all

2916
02:46:40.221 --> 02:46:43.340
times and they understand that you have this beautiful way of describing this

2917
02:46:43.341 --> 02:46:44.460
thing about acting in,

2918
02:46:44.461 --> 02:46:49.310
in a famine state and that it fucks people up because they act in this famine

2919
02:46:49.311 --> 02:46:51.110
state in the same amount of resources are available.

2920
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:55.010
But you go into a panic where someone who acts in a state of community and

2921
02:46:55.011 --> 02:46:58.790
abundance has a much different reaction from the same amount of resources,

2922
02:46:58.791 --> 02:47:02.360
the same circumstances,
the same completely based on the attitude.

2923
02:47:02.860 --> 02:47:07.150
<v 8>Well,
yeah,
and and to get that sense of abundance,
you actually have to,
it's,</v>

2924
02:47:07.210 --> 02:47:11.320
you actually have to experience that there is abundance.
That's the thing.

2925
02:47:11.321 --> 02:47:12.370
You can't fake it.

2926
02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:17.880
You need to connect with what some people call the source or whatever you want

2927
02:47:17.941 --> 02:47:20.080
to call it,
but once you connect with that thing,

2928
02:47:20.081 --> 02:47:23.980
you realize that you're going to be fine.
Your body isn't going to be fine.

2929
02:47:24.850 --> 02:47:29.740
The planet,
as George Carlin says,
the planet's fine,
but humans are fucked.
Well,

2930
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:32.140
you'll,
you go into that state,
you realize,
well,
you're not permanent,

2931
02:47:32.141 --> 02:47:36.790
but you realize there's a much,
much greater thing happening then you,

2932
02:47:37.030 --> 02:47:38.140
and once you plug into that,

2933
02:47:38.141 --> 02:47:42.160
it gets more difficult to get back into those ego games.

2934
02:47:42.161 --> 02:47:45.550
They're usually based on defending whatever you consider to be the most

2935
02:47:45.551 --> 02:47:46.690
important thing in your life.

2936
02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:51.540
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
I completely agree.
Yeah.
I completely see where you're coming from.</v>

2937
02:47:53.490 --> 02:47:54.450
Joey Diaz,
he had done,

2938
02:47:55.580 --> 02:47:59.900
<v 5>you know my dog.
I'm just waiting there for some though.
I need to see an opening.</v>

2939
02:47:59.901 --> 02:48:04.850
I need to see some of the feet there was telling him about Arizona stone

2940
02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:09.230
funding.
Galactic goes talking about North Bergen,
New Jersey in 1978.

2941
02:48:09.231 --> 02:48:13.440
Swinging Dick like a fucking Volvo ranchy on a trapeze wristband.

2942
02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:16.560
What's going on in your carpet roll?
Fucking quiet Red Bay.

2943
02:48:16.561 --> 02:48:19.460
You're not feeding me lines.
You're not upsetting me about Joey.

2944
02:48:19.461 --> 02:48:22.720
This is not red bands.
Fall the micro.
Fuck you guys.

2945
02:48:22.721 --> 02:48:25.100
You're not fuck to me about the fuck in the,

2946
02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:28.830
not that you don't get a chance to talk on this podcast.
Oh right.

2947
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:32.970
I'm over here waiting for something to drop knowledge,

2948
02:48:32.980 --> 02:48:35.600
but nobody's giving me a fucking lob.
That's nonsense.

2949
02:48:35.680 --> 02:48:38.210
I'll even throw me a fastball.
They just draw me curves.

2950
02:48:38.420 --> 02:48:40.610
Who has the biggest dick in your high school basketball team?

2951
02:48:40.670 --> 02:48:45.070
Can you show that picture by the way?
You do know,
you were telling me about that.

2952
02:48:45.410 --> 02:48:48.170
Jodie has has,
uh,
uh,
this slide podcast he does once a month.

2953
02:48:48.171 --> 02:48:51.110
And I was on his last one and it was probably one of the funniest,

2954
02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:54.950
one of the most fun times I've ever had a good line.
You only do it once a month.

2955
02:48:54.951 --> 02:48:59.360
Now the live ones,
if I'm busy,
I can't do Saturdays and one I want.

2956
02:48:59.390 --> 02:49:03.230
I switched up last,
uh,
the end of September into the Saturday night or Friday.

2957
02:49:03.231 --> 02:49:06.260
Man,
it was great.
We had a fucking blast.
It really was a blast.

2958
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:10.800
Really was a blast because a lot of people work during the week.
Right,
right,

2959
02:49:10.820 --> 02:49:13.950
right.
We can't give him sobbing,
trying to work it out,
but this month I got busy.

2960
02:49:13.951 --> 02:49:15.060
I can only do a Wednesday,

2961
02:49:15.660 --> 02:49:18.900
but I'll try and November to do a Saturday night or something.
Yeah.

2962
02:49:18.901 --> 02:49:21.420
I think those,
uh,
there are different dynamic,
you know,

2963
02:49:21.421 --> 02:49:23.250
I don't think it's the best way to do all of them,

2964
02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:27.120
but it's fun to do some of them some way really is to see what you draw from the

2965
02:49:27.121 --> 02:49:31.170
audience and that spot is a great spot to do it.
And you get blase.

2966
02:49:31.510 --> 02:49:36.480
It's dark and you go up there and it's the perfect place and time to be funny.

2967
02:49:36.690 --> 02:49:39.270
Yeah.
It's like going to where they shot gladiator.

2968
02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:42.720
You got to fucking kill some more the fuck.
And they throw you in that stage.

2969
02:49:42.810 --> 02:49:47.710
Correct.
Policy on same thing at the ice house in that little stage two.
Yeah.

2970
02:49:47.850 --> 02:49:50.790
Energy is so against you.
Remember you have people to the left to you,

2971
02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:53.970
people to the right of you and people in fucking in front of you,

2972
02:49:54.510 --> 02:49:58.290
which is very rare.
You have people taking your corners away,

2973
02:49:58.710 --> 02:50:02.520
but not that wall.
You can't bond that.
There's no way to run.

2974
02:50:02.521 --> 02:50:06.000
You know what I'm saying?
There's no way.
It's just,
and it's perfect.

2975
02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:10.310
So you're up there and you're fucking,
it's like that little cheat of yet.
Right.

2976
02:50:10.710 --> 02:50:13.580
That little stage was perfect.
Even though you have people made you,

2977
02:50:14.100 --> 02:50:16.080
sometimes that type of shit is good.

2978
02:50:16.590 --> 02:50:19.200
You're forced to be real and they innervate environment like that.

2979
02:50:19.201 --> 02:50:21.540
You only get five rows.
Like Cheetahs was like five,

2980
02:50:21.541 --> 02:50:26.070
six rows and it couldn't have been better.
Like those,
you know,

2981
02:50:26.071 --> 02:50:29.310
that story that I told that was the best average told an ever and part of it is

2982
02:50:29.311 --> 02:50:33.060
because the energy of the other general same thing of the Ice House with that

2983
02:50:33.210 --> 02:50:37.080
now to do a podcast and the theater,
that's not for me,
I don't think.

2984
02:50:37.800 --> 02:50:41.130
I think it would turn it into a game show host condition.
Duncan,
look,

2985
02:50:41.131 --> 02:50:42.150
someone send you a tweet.

2986
02:50:42.210 --> 02:50:46.740
It says looking at the inevitable look beautiful.

2987
02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:50.670
What does it look beautiful?
It's Dunkin Bob.
That's really good.

2988
02:50:50.671 --> 02:50:54.090
I'm going to read.
I'll retweet it Brian.
And uh,
we went to prison tomorrow.

2989
02:50:54.091 --> 02:50:56.760
You come on in 10 years,
that's what you look like.
Nobody would recommend.
Okay.

2990
02:50:56.761 --> 02:50:58.240
I just retweeted it.
Don't get shot.

2991
02:50:58.380 --> 02:51:00.710
<v 1>Hold on online bro.
You look sexy as fuck.
Like yeah,</v>

2992
02:51:00.711 --> 02:51:02.760
I had a fucking swastika the forehead and

2993
02:51:05.780 --> 02:51:08.450
go towards evil.
Fucking come on.
Right.

2994
02:51:08.451 --> 02:51:12.890
And what about all the Jews out there?
They get it.
The there were fans.

2995
02:51:13.230 --> 02:51:16.680
<v 5>Is Your bitches talking about Manson?
Big Time.</v>

2996
02:51:18.040 --> 02:51:22.740
Sorry.
Good.
That's sexy.
That doesn't look that bad.
That it looks beautiful.

2997
02:51:24.170 --> 02:51:27.200
<v 1>Dunkin.
And I'm telling you,
yeah,
that looks better than me.
Look,
right?</v>

2998
02:51:27.210 --> 02:51:31.720
Han did not accurately depict my hydrocephalic head.

2999
02:51:32.020 --> 02:51:36.880
That's a nice
shape and you don't even know what you're talking about.

3000
02:51:36.881 --> 02:51:39.850
I have a fucking smiley scar in the back of my head.
It doesn't matter.

3001
02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:42.040
It's the ultimate test of your ego.

3002
02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:45.670
Your Ego is trying to convince you that you look better with hair.
You do not.

3003
02:51:45.671 --> 02:51:49.360
You look different with hair,
but okay,
that's great then,
but I want to,

3004
02:51:49.460 --> 02:51:50.350
you don't look different.

3005
02:51:50.380 --> 02:51:54.310
Why is there a compulsion and all cult leaders to have people shave their head?

3006
02:51:54.340 --> 02:51:58.900
This is something that really should submit because you can't make a fucking

3007
02:51:58.920 --> 02:52:02.740
weird cause you can't make him shave their Sol.
That's what nobody else is like.

3008
02:52:02.741 --> 02:52:05.890
You got to shave your head.
No one I know is like your head.

3009
02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:08.620
<v 0>It'll free you there on the stove.</v>

3010
02:52:11.680 --> 02:52:13.420
You can file Duncan Trussell on Twitter.

Duncan Trussell in the motherfucking house.

3013
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:25.060
Don't bother following him on Facebook cause most of those people aren't even

3014
02:52:25.061 --> 02:52:28.330
really Dunkin.

It seems like it doesn't even make sense.
