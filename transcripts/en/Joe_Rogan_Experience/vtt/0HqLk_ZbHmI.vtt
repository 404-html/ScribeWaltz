<v Speaker 1>I'm so fucking excited.</v>

68
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to ask you,</v>

69
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck do you eat for breakfast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

70
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 1>how did you get so fucking smart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

71
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just remember things.</v>

72
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's the difference.</v>

73
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between being smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just remembering a lot.</v>

74
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:10.830
<v Speaker 1>remembering things is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps.</v>

77
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Certainly helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.080
<v Speaker 1>But what is smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Smart is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you solve equations?</v>

80
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Can you figure things out that other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can't figure out?</v>

81
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things other people don't know.</v>

82
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just remember shit that smart people </v>

83
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>have already figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you accumulate situations.</v>

84
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>It was like Jimi Hendrix experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiential.</v>

85
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>So if you remember those things over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

86
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>you're going to become a wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're with.</v>

87
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>You're so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

88
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.970
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I watched your show and I </v>

89
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:41.500
<v Speaker 1>watched the beginning right before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked out on stage.</v>

90
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.530
<v Speaker 1>The triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd say two things that came to my </v>

91
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.960
<v Speaker 1>attention was one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were talking with your producer,</v>

92
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>whoever they said there's your chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

93
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>you bottled waters right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need those guys.</v>

94
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

95
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:59.221
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is you were sitting </v>

96
00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>on the couch alone reading your notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you show that it's a beautiful </v>

98
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.520
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't live without my notes.</v>

99
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fly at such a speed,</v>

100
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>such an altitude that I can't remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I did yesterday,</v>

237
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:36.130
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

238
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.440
<v Speaker 1>It's how you feel personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you've been through in your </v>

239
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.230
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those vibes of those songs.</v>

240
00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Wilson picket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little Richard.</v>

241
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean the allman brothers started </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

242
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you listen to the allman </v>

243
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:51.850
<v Speaker 1>brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

244
00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.820
<v Speaker 1>you're in the room were Greg said to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>

245
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.010
<v Speaker 1>let's do this song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think it is?</v>

246
00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Because all those talented people </v>
<v Speaker 1>perform there and they,</v>

247
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.810
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it soak into the building.</v>

248
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's,</v>

249
00:11:02.151 --> 00:11:04.430
<v Speaker 1>there's places that do have like a magic</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

250
00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:06.410
<v Speaker 1>I always talk about the comedy store </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

251
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.020
<v Speaker 1>The comedy store is a magic to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're there,</v>

252
00:11:09.021 --> 00:11:14.021
<v Speaker 1>there's something about that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like it feels like great things have </v>

253
00:11:14.021 --> 00:11:15.480
<v Speaker 1>happened that place before you feel it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the.</v>

254
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Would you feel it in the carpet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

255
00:11:17.631 --> 00:11:20.570
<v Speaker 1>it's in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel like that was muscle shoals,</v>

256
00:11:20.571 --> 00:11:25.571
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because all those great artists </v>

257
00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:26.480
<v Speaker 1>have performed there and like almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the room has a memory of it?</v>

258
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I think so because there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists that think that things have </v>

259
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:32.320
<v Speaker 1>memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

260
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to prove idea.</v>

261
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

262
00:11:35.001 --> 00:11:36.620
<v Speaker 1>when you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you know that you,</v>

263
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.020
<v Speaker 1>that you're on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you die,</v>

264
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.750
<v Speaker 1>and if the table is you're being weighed</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you die,</v>

265
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.470
<v Speaker 1>it goes down a number 27 grams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

266
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:47.900
<v Speaker 1>That's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

267
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that people would say,</v>

268
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.720
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

269
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.430
<v Speaker 1>There's no way of really measuring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

287
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:38.250
<v Speaker 1>when you were being born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was walking around New York City with </v>

288
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.600
<v Speaker 1>John Belushi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocking on everybody's door to get some</v>

289
00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:40.870
<v Speaker 1>blow.</v>

290
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean we were good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

291
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.030
<v Speaker 1>it's what you did back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believed that,</v>

292
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the spirit of music was,</v>

293
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.660
<v Speaker 1>think of it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think they call blue spirits?</v>

294
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.180
<v Speaker 1>And when you listen to your favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>song,</v>

295
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.460
<v Speaker 1>you want to fuck your wife?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

296
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that spirits in know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever it takes you,</v>

297
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 1>whatever feeling it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

298
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.650
<v Speaker 1>When I went to muscle shoals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put my hand on the wood.</v>

299
00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I felt the room because I knew that </v>
<v Speaker 1>little Richard's stood right in front of</v>

00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:16.591

<v Speaker 1>All I gotta do is close my eyes and go </v>

301
00:13:16.591 --> 00:13:16.591
<v Speaker 1>back in time for a second.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they put it on the two inch tape oxide,</v>

314
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.750
<v Speaker 1>the old fashioned two inch tape and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there ready to sing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

316
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.320
<v Speaker 1>they started rolling and I'm listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

317
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I got everything turned up and I hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob walked into the studio,</v>

318
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I hear the drummer sit down with a drum </v>
<v Speaker 1>set and this is stool squeaks.</v>

319
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Any farts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

320
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.670
<v Speaker 1>but is he can hear him pick up sticks </v>
<v Speaker 1>you here.</v>

321
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.660
<v Speaker 1>You're the bass player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking around with his base and talking</v>

322
00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:15.661
<v Speaker 1>to Bob Mun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you fucking would you feel how </v>

323
00:14:15.661 --> 00:14:15.661
<v Speaker 1>you're feeling today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

324
00:14:15.661 --> 00:14:18.580
<v Speaker 1>and I'm in the room with Bob Marley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is spirit if that's not it,</v>

325
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I made them play that back again for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just closed my eyes and you're</v>

326
00:14:23.141 --> 00:14:24.190
<v Speaker 1>in the room with Bob Martin.</v>

327
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.260
<v Speaker 1>What is certainly something right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you hear a song,</v>

328
00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:31.261
<v Speaker 1>a great song from the past and you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>goose bumps and just feel it inside of </v>

329
00:14:31.261 --> 00:14:31.261
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do something.</v>

330
00:14:31.261 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 1>You get moved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what does it have to do with booze?</v>

331
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 1>I think booze is called spirits because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it puts you in that place.</v>

332
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Tony releases falsely mission and </v>
<v Speaker 1>releases in innovation.</v>

333
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:41.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so great truth.</v>

334
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Misner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

335
00:14:42.551 --> 00:14:45.160
<v Speaker 1>but is it false or is it just that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just gets abused?</v>

336
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

337
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 1>It makes you say things you wish you did</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go.</v>

338
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>I was lying fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

351
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.280
<v Speaker 1>but I've done a lot of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you said in that last,</v>

352
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 1>that last documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just joking.</v>

353
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.480
<v Speaker 1>You are farthest from the army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people.</v>

354
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 1>It's worth that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You thought not to do that.</v>

355
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seems like one that I would like</v>

356
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:44.561
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why I never </v>

357
00:15:44.561 --> 00:15:44.561
<v Speaker 1>fucked with speed either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'd be like,</v>

358
00:15:44.561 --> 00:15:46.700
<v Speaker 1>now I can get things done if you drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee,</v>

359
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's mild coffee doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack is fucking mile.</v>

360
00:15:50.701 --> 00:15:52.520
<v Speaker 1>This man is just mild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He what is it?</v>

361
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Kim Chameleon which changes your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin into another color.</v>

362
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.740
<v Speaker 1>This is a cold brew cold brew coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

363
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is really.</v>

364
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not coffee.</v>

365
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:06.380
<v Speaker 1>It's called Lucky Jack's nitrile cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>brew coffee.</v>

366
00:16:06.381 --> 00:16:07.820
<v Speaker 1>You might as well just stick this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your arm.</v>

367
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

368
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know because I've never </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped anything like that.</v>

369
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.850
<v Speaker 1>My arm neither have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am just saying on that.</v>

370
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:16.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty strong actually.</v>

371
00:16:16.821 --> 00:16:21.620
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not like what I make in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning is like Kona coffee.</v>

372
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I love Kona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl and I fill that fucker at the top.</v>

373
00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.170
<v Speaker 1>It's so dark when you pour it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't see through the stream.</v>

374
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:32.390
<v Speaker 1>That's when you know you're going on Joe</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogan and going to spew some shit.</v>

375
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Some real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck him.</v>

376
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Hot Lava.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hot Lava from Kona.</v>

377
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.580
<v Speaker 1>So then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we did that.</v>

378
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:42.581
<v Speaker 1>So we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did branch out with me and Nuno </v>

379
00:16:42.581 --> 00:16:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Betancourt and we got all the players </v>
<v Speaker 1>from way back then the horn section </v>

380
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:45.460
<v Speaker 1>sections got curls to sing it.</v>

381
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.840
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to be bobby womack sat </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that room and he did.</v>

382
00:16:49.841 --> 00:16:52.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to love you,</v>

383
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's all over now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was that day.</v>

384
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Marvin Gaye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in this room with all this tape.</v>

385
00:16:58.011 --> 00:17:01.400
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a musician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel the vibes.</v>

386
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.270
<v Speaker 1>If your comedic and you go to the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

387
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.270
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you're walking around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>placenta.</v>

388
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a recording spot for </v>

389
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:14.730
<v Speaker 1>comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

390
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:14.730
<v Speaker 1>you guys have a bunch of performing </v>
<v Speaker 1>spots,</v>

391
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:19.060
<v Speaker 1>but you also have recording spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only really have performing spots as </v>

392
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.330
<v Speaker 1>we record in those performance buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm performing.</v>

393
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I go into.</v>

394
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.930
<v Speaker 1>I just had these on last night fixing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lyrics and when I.</v>

395
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 1>When you have them on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're listening to the track.</v>

396
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something you can't explain.</v>

397
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Nobody understands that and it's akin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tripping on acid.</v>

398
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.870
<v Speaker 1>It's akin to being drunk and sucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>face with a girl,</v>

399
00:17:44.871 --> 00:17:48.920
<v Speaker 1>making out with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's akin to watching your kids be born.</v>

400
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.120
<v Speaker 1>It's an elevated experience way </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevated,</v>

401
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.870
<v Speaker 1>and if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you buy it and you push the top floor</v>

402
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 1>like I do way past the penthouse bloom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I know you do it.</v>

403
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.820
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm reading this off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a day.</v>

404
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.790
<v Speaker 1>This is a a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what it was.</v>

405
00:18:04.791 --> 00:18:05.460
<v Speaker 1>A month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

406
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:07.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also.</v>

407
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:10.590
<v Speaker 1>You've been doing this a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like a life where.</v>

408
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean the reason why you don't have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>

409
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:17.390
<v Speaker 1>it's because you've probably filled all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your hard drive space with crazy </v>

410
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.390
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well said.</v>

411
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have forgotten more than most people </v>

412
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.000
<v Speaker 1>could ever remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could you not wear the.</v>

413
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.940
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck could you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything you've ever done.</v>

414
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.550
<v Speaker 1>He'll talk to a farmer about some shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened in the fifties or old.</v>

415
00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:29.640
<v Speaker 1>That was the day that Carol wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>give us milk.</v>

416
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.670
<v Speaker 1>They remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's two things going on here.</v>

417
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm surrounded by people that are always</v>
<v Speaker 1>remind me.</v>

418
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.960
<v Speaker 1>That's good too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a good team.</v>

419
00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes they got to be on,</v>

420
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:44.580
<v Speaker 1>like live on the tonight show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing I did was with that beautiful</v>

421
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:49.581
<v Speaker 1>blonde entertainment tonight was I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched it back.</v>

422
00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:54.651
<v Speaker 1>I thought that's the best interview I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think I've ever done because she looked </v>

423
00:18:54.651 --> 00:18:55.650
<v Speaker 1>me square in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was beautiful.</v>

424
00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:59.250
<v Speaker 1>She asked the right questions and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just perfect.</v>

425
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.650
<v Speaker 1>And you got to be on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those moments.</v>

426
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

427
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

428
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you miss being not sober sometimes?</v>

429
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

430
00:19:11.591 --> 00:19:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

431
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:16.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I miss a pros and cons that,</v>

432
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.520
<v Speaker 1>that if I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll wind up doing too much for sure.</v>

433
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:20.970
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

434
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.340
<v Speaker 1>I can't control it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the way you are,</v>

435
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:28.550
<v Speaker 1>just the way I am and I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to push it again because </v>

436
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.930
<v Speaker 1>when I get that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids don't talk to me.</v>

437
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.260
<v Speaker 1>I get a divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm throwing out on my own band.</v>

438
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

439
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else?</v>

440
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I lose everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

441
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:42.300
<v Speaker 1>it's happened enough times for me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally realize,</v>

442
00:19:42.301 --> 00:19:43.320
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not worth it.</v>

443
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying and I got a lot of </v>

448
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got two sponsors,</v>

449

<v Speaker 1>way?</v>

459

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't do that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Looking back and take it into the </v>

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:34.970
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't continue your aftercare by </v>

467
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.391
<v Speaker 1>going to a couple meetings every now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to wind up using </v>

468
00:20:37.391 --> 00:20:37.391
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

469
00:20:37.391 --> 00:20:40.950

<v Speaker 1>Janis Joplin up there.</v>

470
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1968,</v>

471
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:49.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got bangles and beads like this </v>

472
00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:53.281
<v Speaker 1>shit on and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's drinking southern comfort and </v>

473
00:20:53.281 --> 00:20:55.060
<v Speaker 1>she's spitting and using the f word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking cigarettes.</v>

474
00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Nobody did that back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was powerful watching her and she's </v>

475
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 1>fucking the power in song.</v>

476
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.780
<v Speaker 1>That's why I covered that on my country </v>
<v Speaker 1>album.</v>

477
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

478
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.620
<v Speaker 1>To this day I listen to that song like </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least once every couple months.</v>

479
00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Just put that in the headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see us,</v>

480
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.070
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

481
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

482
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.620
<v Speaker 1>when you grew up in the sixties and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did was we experimented,</v>

483
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you think about what they tell</v>

484
00:21:26.291 --> 00:21:31.291
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Columbus discovered America </v>

485
00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:33.571
<v Speaker 1>know the bow of his boat was full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>booze and he fucked Queen Elizabeth or </v>

486
00:21:33.571 --> 00:21:34.150
<v Speaker 1>whoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

487
00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:34.820
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good boy,</v>

488
00:21:34.821 --> 00:21:39.821
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she sent him on his way with some </v>

489
00:21:39.821 --> 00:21:40.570
<v Speaker 1>money and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring me back some countries you think.</v>

490
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.360
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't the first person here.</v>

491
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.730
<v Speaker 1>That's what America wants us to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

492
00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:46.930
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Christopher Columbus,</v>

493
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.780
<v Speaker 1>he's got that in his head to go to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>check shit out.</v>

494
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

495
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.080
<v Speaker 1>He's drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going by the stars at night.</v>

496
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.700
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you never took lsds have taken</v>

<v Speaker 1>you look out.</v>

499
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.710
<v Speaker 1>We used to take acid in high school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we would,</v>

500
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.940
<v Speaker 1>we'd go to these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a ski slopes in the summertime,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And we got our stuff from San Francisco,</v>

503
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.490
<v Speaker 1>from Mosley who I would call him up and </v>

540
00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.611
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are wary about attempting them </v>

541
00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.180
<v Speaker 1>at this stage after your sobriety.</v>

542
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:11.720
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love to trip again.</v>

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

544
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you could do it and you </v>

545
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:17.850
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's just like you just don't.</v>

546
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's getting fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the bad thing.</v>

547
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Like just getting fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just getting drunk and coked up and </v>

548
00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe no,</v>

549
00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:25.770
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kindness,</v>

550
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.850
<v Speaker 1>shamanically ceremony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it wouldn't be a problem at all.</v>

551
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all one thing getting fucked up,</v>

552
00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:34.190
<v Speaker 1>shamonic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

553
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:36.020
<v Speaker 1>If you take in drugs and you fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucked up.</v>

554
00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:38.780
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if it's romantic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

555
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:42.350
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get high and that tweaks,</v>

556
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.020
<v Speaker 1>that little thing in my brain that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>on here.</v>

557
00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember in your brain for 30 years,</v>

558
00:24:48.261 --> 00:24:50.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from the sixties,</v>

559
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With the best of them.</v>

560
00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I got high and it took them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them,</v>

561
00:24:56.001 --> 00:24:56.630
<v Speaker 1>most of them.</v>

562
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 1>You came through it remarkably unscathed</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it.</v>

563
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you God.</v>

564
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you God.</v>

565
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

566
00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Think about that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

567
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could talk for two hours.</v>

568
00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:12.900
<v Speaker 1>About Times I did shit and almost died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sure.</v>

569
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I could also tell you how many </v>

570
00:25:19.161 --> 00:25:23.180
<v Speaker 1>times I took shit and wrote things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

571
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to this guitar lick that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe's playing.</v>

572
00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.410

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

573

<v Speaker 1>fucking sleepy loop play these riffs.</v>

574
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:33.900
<v Speaker 1>And I come down the hallway because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

575
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.890
<v Speaker 1>as I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course not as ace it,</v>

576
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:43.300
<v Speaker 1>but as I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were up in New England and he was </v>

577
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:43.300
<v Speaker 1>playing at a place and I mowed the lawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

579
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:48.870

<v Speaker 1>I was no more bands.</v>

582
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.310
<v Speaker 1>The dream was over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drives up in an mg.</v>

583
00:25:55.550 --> 00:26:00.550
<v Speaker 1>We go and he's playing that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God this happened and so we </v>

584
00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:06.461
<v Speaker 1>decided to move down to Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all in an apartment because I </v>

585
00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:08.330
<v Speaker 1>thought I knew why those bands didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it.</v>

586
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.520
<v Speaker 1>But I knew in my heart did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had a broan abandoned,</v>

587
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.650
<v Speaker 1>like I'm making a keith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the kinks.</v>

588
00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>

589
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.380
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know ray,</v>

590
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.780
<v Speaker 1>any of those bands they had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

591
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.080
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was two guys that were really tight.</v>

592
00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.000
<v Speaker 1>They feed off each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Fed off each other.</v>

593
00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.430
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we moved down there.</v>

594
00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I got really tight with Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear him.</v>

595
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.050
<v Speaker 1>He'd get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get so swept.</v>

596
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.320
<v Speaker 1>We were so stoned on bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boone's farm.</v>

597
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.990
<v Speaker 1>You mean fucking.</v>

598
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you say?</v>

599
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.770
<v Speaker 1>What'd you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

600
00:26:43.771 --> 00:26:48.771
<v Speaker 1>but he would play these licks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so fucking for every song you've </v>

601
00:26:48.771 --> 00:26:48.930
<v Speaker 1>ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweet emotion.</v>

602
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Every one of those legs walk this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 20 that got lost in the ether </v>

603
00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:02.770
<v Speaker 1>ether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went out and bought a little thing </v>

604
00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:02.770
<v Speaker 1>called the tape recorder back then </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember this was 71.</v>

605
00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of shit.</v>

606
00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:05.850

<v Speaker 1>no cell phones.</v>

607
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Speaker 1>So I would record that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyway,</v>

610
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.721
<v Speaker 1>stuff would come out of my head while I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like sweet white.</v>

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Well Fuck,</v>

618
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:47.810
<v Speaker 1>I started writing even better shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go in a room with four guys and say </v>

619

<v Speaker 1>fucking song and a good one and one that</v>

622
00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:03.840
<v Speaker 1>would live way past all those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check that shooter.</v>

623

624
00:28:09.001 --> 00:28:12.050
<v Speaker 1>moments when you came up with a song </v>
<v Speaker 1>like sweet emotion or riff or.</v>

625
00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.640

<v Speaker 1>We couldn't,</v>

672
00:30:35.011 --> 00:30:39.480
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get lost and everybody left and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all their tents and sleeping bags were </v>

673
00:30:40.181 --> 00:30:44.050
<v Speaker 1>just left there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of acres of tents.</v>

674
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:47.200
<v Speaker 1>There's no pictures on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked around and I thought,</v>

675
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.420
<v Speaker 1>so I stole a coke cooler and I still </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that to this day.</v>

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:52.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

678
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:57.600
<v Speaker 1>But I was a great from Coca Cola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they were selling your shit and </v>

679
00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:57.730
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

680
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.100
<v Speaker 1>where the opening on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

681
00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:06.210
<v Speaker 1>but I remember walking down this path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was called groovy way and I stole.</v>

682
00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I stole this banner off the trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we used for the,</v>

683
00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.600
<v Speaker 1>for errors within the beginning I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>these girls duplicated.</v>

684
00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:19.450
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was two guys looking at each other,</v>

685
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:24.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking a joint and at that was the </v>

686
00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:25.000
<v Speaker 1>aerosmith thing in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I was at Woodstock,</v>

687
00:31:25.001 --> 00:31:30.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm walking down groovy way and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where can keasy and the magic,</v>

688
00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:35.290
<v Speaker 1>the pranksters had older buses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm tripping on acid and these </v>

689
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:40.231
<v Speaker 1>helicopters are coming by with 500 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds of hot dogs and they're dropping </v>

690
00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:42.200
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropping them in the field.</v>

691
00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.770
<v Speaker 1>You hear this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're not.</v>

692
00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:49.860
<v Speaker 1>And then another giant pile of pots and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pans to cook the hot dogs.</v>

693
00:31:51.371 --> 00:31:52.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a disaster area.</v>

694
00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Woodstock,</v>

696
00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.520

<v Speaker 1>so I grabbed the pots and pans.</v>

697
00:31:58.530 --> 00:31:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>

698
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.110
<v Speaker 1>so when the guy walks over and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

699
00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.080
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

700
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:11.960
<v Speaker 1>another guy comes over and he starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this.</v>

701
00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:19.300
<v Speaker 1>By the time I was done in an hour later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was 50 people banging on every </v>

702
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.370
<v Speaker 1>pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a moment and then when I got up</v>

703
00:32:22.371 --> 00:32:27.050
<v Speaker 1>from that tripping my ass off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked down a path and walking towards</v>

704
00:32:27.051 --> 00:32:32.051
<v Speaker 1>me was one guy and it was joey cream </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my trauma who I knew from high </v>

705
00:32:32.051 --> 00:32:36.360
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I met there later on to become.</v>

706
00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.090
<v Speaker 1>I was a drummer for aerosmith in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

707
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Move forward now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six or 70,</v>

708
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.110
<v Speaker 1>all the bands that broke up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went up to sunapee.</v>

709
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I was mowing the lawn at place called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trial Rico.</v>

710
00:32:47.841 --> 00:32:50.660
<v Speaker 1>My family place that I did my whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

711
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:52.130
<v Speaker 1>It's what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I'm a country boy.</v>

712
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred and 60 acres that my </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian family bought that came over </v>

713
00:32:57.651 --> 00:33:02.651
<v Speaker 1>from Calabria in 1918.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety five brothers.</v>

714
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:06.290
<v Speaker 1>There were musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they worked in New York City.</v>

715
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.920
<v Speaker 1>They made a little money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for four grand they bought 300 acres,</v>

716
00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:14.920
<v Speaker 1>so every year of my life when I was born</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fucking 1940.</v>

717
00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like what,</v>

719
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:26.120
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people would say that,</v>

720

<v Speaker 1>it was like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My daughter,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We went to a meeting that night and </v>

784
00:36:23.071 --> 00:36:28.071

<v Speaker 1>They're producing this album called and </v>

787
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:38.690
<v Speaker 1>they asked me to sing on it and Dr </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

788
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.690
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

789
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:45.210
<v Speaker 1>and the fucking record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the first times musicians,</v>

790
00:36:45.211 --> 00:36:50.211
<v Speaker 1>when you get your shirt put on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>protools and it gets fixed into you </v>

791
00:36:50.211 --> 00:36:50.840
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

792
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm from the old school where if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice and get good,</v>

793
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:58.190
<v Speaker 1>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you did at the comedy store the </v>

794
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.260
<v Speaker 1>first time you can do in your basement </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of your kids,</v>

795
00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:03.890
<v Speaker 1>we just as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't you think so pro tools for </v>

796
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:06.560
<v Speaker 1>musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it can,</v>

797
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.570
<v Speaker 1>it can take your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your vocal and fix it.</v>

798
00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.600
<v Speaker 1>You can take your drums and put it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed it to a grid.</v>

799
00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Does that do what are you going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>better?</v>

800
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.670
<v Speaker 1>But it does make the music sound better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never listened to charlie watts.</v>

801
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

802
00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.000
<v Speaker 1>He drags so beautifully and Keith </v>
<v Speaker 1>Richards,</v>

803
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.920
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't my point is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there.</v>

804
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.330
<v Speaker 1>There's something missing from that.</v>

805
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The soul is gone because now it's </v>

806
00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:32.340
<v Speaker 1>computerized and even though it's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

807
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.840
<v Speaker 1>it's still not the same as listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>James Brown just thinking about this.</v>

808
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got a new song,</v>

809
00:37:38.191 --> 00:37:39.900
<v Speaker 1>each brand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

810
00:37:39.901 --> 00:37:42.120
<v Speaker 1>if they're all using pro tools and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fixing shit.</v>

811
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same sound coming out right </v>

812
00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:47.540
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a different singer,</v>

813

830
00:38:31.491 --> 00:38:32.520
<v Speaker 1>many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taken like,</v>

831
00:38:32.521 --> 00:38:36.970
<v Speaker 1>what did I do that on pink?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm down in Florida.</v>

832
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at the island hotel.</v>

833
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm living in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sober as can be.</v>

834
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:50.850
<v Speaker 1>When I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means like when the sun went down </v>

835
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:54.920
<v Speaker 1>and I turned the light on and I start </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading pink is,</v>

836
00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.910
<v Speaker 1>you're in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loops obsession.</v>

837
00:38:59.330 --> 00:38:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Pink</v>

838
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.310
<v Speaker 1>ain't even no question</v>

839
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:05.710
<v Speaker 3>pink</v>

840
00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.670
<v Speaker 1>on the lips or your lover</v>

841
00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.150
<v Speaker 3>pink,</v>

842
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:16.470
<v Speaker 1>what you will discover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's just,</v>

843
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:17.820
<v Speaker 1>that's how it went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

844
00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:21.910
<v Speaker 1>So I did that for until the sun came up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I turned the light off.</v>

845
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.990
<v Speaker 1>So use that time period of the night for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole album.</v>

846
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.780
<v Speaker 1>That whole album was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote everything at night when I was,</v>

847
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I would get so tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel stoned and I would write and then</v>

848
00:39:33.401 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I would take the lyrics of pink and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote seven verses,</v>

849
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:43.680
<v Speaker 1>which you only needed three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wrote seven aerosmith's biggest </v>

850
00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.920
<v Speaker 1>secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrote 21 songs.</v>

853
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.190
<v Speaker 1>like you go in somewhere for three </v>

<v Speaker 1>you hit on you doing your edibles or </v>

856

<v Speaker 1>It gets you off.</v>

857
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:03.730
<v Speaker 1>You hit on three fucking incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

858
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.540
<v Speaker 1>You write them through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come back and if you want to,</v>

859
00:40:07.541 --> 00:40:10.240
<v Speaker 1>you can do all three if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your worst day.</v>

860
00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.240
<v Speaker 1>The worst one is great because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>

861
00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:16.570
<v Speaker 1>you already know what good is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what funny is,</v>

862
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:18.190
<v Speaker 1>you know how to make that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

863
00:40:18.191 --> 00:40:20.110
<v Speaker 1>how to weave something together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright?</v>

864
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:25.170
<v Speaker 1>So I put it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this would be for protools to thing </v>

865
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.871
<v Speaker 1>called a dats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the guy we're working with says,</v>

866
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.110
<v Speaker 1>sing that chorus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say saying that verse.</v>

867
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.120
<v Speaker 1>And so we already had the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sang that first.</v>

868
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:41.260
<v Speaker 1>He just put that verse in all world </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus go.</v>

869
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:43.270
<v Speaker 1>And I listened back and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

870
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.110
<v Speaker 1>we've got such a great song here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it used pro tools.</v>

871
00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:49.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't use it to manipulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never,</v>

872
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:51.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll never fixed my vocal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

873
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.520
<v Speaker 4>but your vocals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something about your vocals that</v>

874
00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.530
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't enhance them if you fixed </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

875
00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:01.980
<v Speaker 4>like you have a raw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>soulful quality to your voice that if </v>

876
00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.750
<v Speaker 4>you fucked with that digitized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd lose all of it.</v>

877
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:10.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure they can do some things that </v>

878
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:10.850
<v Speaker 4>the real artists with pro tools and move</v>
<v Speaker 4>things around.</v>

879
00:41:10.851 --> 00:41:14.710
<v Speaker 4>Those still sound amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's no errors in your singing.</v>

880
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:20.040
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any crackle or pop is just gonna be </v>

881
00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.041
<v Speaker 4>better when you learn that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel that as I thought it was an </v>

882
00:41:23.041 --> 00:41:26.311
<v Speaker 4>adult,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a person who doesn't look for </v>

883
00:41:26.311 --> 00:41:26.311
<v Speaker 4>perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just look for beauty.</v>

884
00:41:26.311 --> 00:41:28.500
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfection is not beauty now.</v>

885
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an unattainable thing.</v>

886
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:35.640
<v Speaker 4>Chase it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can get excellence and wrong </v>

887
00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:35.640
<v Speaker 4>with America</v>

888
00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.030
<v Speaker 1>right now is everybody's trying to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that perfection and stuff.</v>

889
00:41:37.031 --> 00:41:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Fat In their ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

890
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:40.590

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

891
00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:42.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there is no perfection.</v>

892
00:41:42.561 --> 00:41:45.370
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this imperfection.</v>

893
00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm a perfectionist.</v>

930
00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I can't figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people like I was when I </v>

931
00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:21.710
<v Speaker 1>was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't paying.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the and the wife.</v>

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm in fucking pain.</v>

936
00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's the best thing to do?</v>

937
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Is that the best thing to do though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

938
00:43:39.591 --> 00:43:41.330
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's why they do it.</v>

939
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:42.950
<v Speaker 1>What is the best thing to do when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in pain?</v>

940
00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to be a little bit elevated as </v>

941
00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:47.980
<v Speaker 1>humans to know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that case,</v>

942
00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.910
<v Speaker 1>you listen to people like Marianne </v>
<v Speaker 1>Williamson.</v>

943
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who she is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking brilliant.</v>

944
00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you know she has Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't fucking virtual piano.</v>

945
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.870
<v Speaker 1>She's just a spiritual person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spiritual.</v>

946
00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.300
<v Speaker 1>When I got sober,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started listening to her tapes.</v>

947
00:44:07.301 --> 00:44:09.100
<v Speaker 1>I get on the treadmill in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

948
00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:10.840
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't eat it.</v>

949
00:44:10.841 --> 00:44:13.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't even feel alive unless I'm out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of breath.</v>

950
00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:17.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what I get for being a musician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lose a pound a night on stage.</v>

951
00:44:17.951 --> 00:44:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Sweating with aerosmith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

952
00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm up there with standing next to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Joe Perry.</v>

953
00:44:22.181 --> 00:44:26.350

<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

955

<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he was stoned out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

956
00:44:29.921 --> 00:44:30.700
<v Speaker 1>but he's.</v>

957
00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.150
<v Speaker 4>When I get text messages from him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>knew he was something special.</v>

960
00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.410
<v Speaker 4>I knew he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>sound.</v>

963
00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:49.660
<v Speaker 4>You know Joe has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He absolutely has a sound.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like he's expressing himself </v>

970
00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:09.100
<v Speaker 4>through that guitar in a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognizable way into together,</v>

00:49:03.521 --> 00:49:04.330
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1046
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:09.600
<v Speaker 1>So I thought singing really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my dad taught me and the notes and </v>

1047
00:49:09.881 --> 00:49:12.030
<v Speaker 1>write on and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>

1048
00:49:12.031 --> 00:49:12.750
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>

1049
00:49:12.751 --> 00:49:13.800
<v Speaker 1>F,</v>
<v Speaker 1>G A,</v>

1050
00:49:13.801 --> 00:49:15.670
<v Speaker 1>b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a fuck.</v>

1051
00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

1052
00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:21.380
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to.</v>

1053
00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't put inflections into </v>

1054
00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:29.141
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ain't no feeling and there ain't no </v>

1055
00:49:29.141 --> 00:49:29.141
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

1056
00:49:29.141 --> 00:49:31.320
<v Speaker 6>I got you lock.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do last time.</v>

1057
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right where you say it,</v>

1058
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:41.230
<v Speaker 1>but you have to feel it can't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you're trying to feel.</v>

1059
00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:42.700
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be something you actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>

1060
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1061
00:49:43.571 --> 00:49:44.840
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1062
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hats off to him,</v>

1063
00:49:46.651 --> 00:49:47.280
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1064
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.900
<v Speaker 1>the way he played his guitar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice at night,</v>

1065
00:49:50.901 --> 00:49:54.610
<v Speaker 1>he fucking nod out and he'd be sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his chair and the fucking chair,</v>

1066
00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:59.640
<v Speaker 1>the couch caught on fire to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through with a pot of water and he's </v>

1067
00:49:59.640 --> 00:49:59.950
<v Speaker 1>laying smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want y'all.</v>

1068
00:49:59.951 --> 00:50:04.951
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck man get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's playing this riff and we turned it </v>

1069
00:50:04.951 --> 00:50:06.880
<v Speaker 1>into a song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kind of stuff happens so much.</v>

1070
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.610
<v Speaker 1>And he did it away to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking a obviously,</v>

1071
00:50:09.611 --> 00:50:11.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Hamilton,</v>

1072
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:12.140
<v Speaker 1>du Du,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Du,</v>

1073
00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Du,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Du,</v>

1074
00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Du,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Du,</v>

1075
00:50:13.391 --> 00:50:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Du,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Du,</v>

1076
00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Du,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Du,</v>

1077
00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Du,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Du,</v>

1078
00:50:14.691 --> 00:50:19.000
<v Speaker 1>and a sweet motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how band comes together,</v>

1079
00:50:19.001 --> 00:50:24.001
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can't tell you any other way than </v>

1080
00:50:24.001 --> 00:50:24.001
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1081
00:50:24.001 --> 00:50:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Magic and every inch of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason it doesn't feel like I'm 70 </v>

1082
00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:32.560
<v Speaker 1>and I don't feel the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like yesterday we just started </v>

1083
00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:36.340
<v Speaker 1>is because every time I'm on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm singing those same fucking songs </v>

1084
00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:36.740
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way,</v>

1085
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.780
<v Speaker 1>same feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same looking,</v>

1086
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:40.640
<v Speaker 1>same people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different people,</v>

1087
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:43.820
<v Speaker 1>different people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm singing the same songs.</v>

1088
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the guy that's looking to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1089
00:50:46.221 --> 00:50:51.221
<v Speaker 1>so to answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second album sounds a little bit more </v>

1090
00:50:51.221 --> 00:50:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Raunchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more in tune with Joe's guitar and I </v>

1091
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.720
<v Speaker 1>think we found our sound second album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>third,</v>

1092
00:50:56.721 --> 00:50:57.200
<v Speaker 1>fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth,</v>

1093
00:50:57.201 --> 00:50:57.710
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

1094
00:50:57.711 --> 00:50:58.070
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

1095
00:50:58.071 --> 00:50:58.490
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

1096
00:50:58.491 --> 00:50:59.240
<v Speaker 1>12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got it.</v>

1097
00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:04.750
<v Speaker 1>But it took that first album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had songs on it like walking the dog </v>

1098
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:06.310
<v Speaker 1>because we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ran out of songs with.</v>

1099
00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:10.010
<v Speaker 1>That was the only played in clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember we had a contract.</v>

1100
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:11.660
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to do?</v>

1101
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:16.160
<v Speaker 1>So we wrote moving out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the guys would get stoned and drink</v>

1102
00:51:16.161 --> 00:51:17.690
<v Speaker 1>boone's farm and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on you guys.</v>

1103
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:20.150
<v Speaker 1>We fucking wrote this song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

1104
00:51:20.151 --> 00:51:23.660
<v Speaker 1>And flick the joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I remember getting pissed off walking</v>

1105
00:51:23.661 --> 00:51:25.100
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hate me when I tell this story,</v>

1106
00:51:25.101 --> 00:51:30.101
<v Speaker 1>but I remember being really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry walking out to his piano and </v>

1107
00:51:30.101 --> 00:51:32.210
<v Speaker 1>writing one way street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1108
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't play guitar and I wrote about </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go on and do it,</v>

1109
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:39.020
<v Speaker 1>make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't break it first on the first album.</v>

1110
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.850
<v Speaker 1>So some great shit because I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1111
00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.780
<v Speaker 1>in anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1112
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what to do but I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought a,</v>

1113
00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:51.940
<v Speaker 1>used that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wrote a bunch of songs and I think </v>

1114
00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:55.190
<v Speaker 1>it late everybody's fuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that Joe certainly lit mine.</v>

1115
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Tom Hamilton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his outtakes as he called him.</v>

1116
00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Sweet emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Tom Hamilton now through </v>

1117
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.880
<v Speaker 1>throughout this whole time.</v>

1118
00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Were you exercising back then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you do things?</v>

1119
00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:11.330
<v Speaker 1>How do you move around back then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or were you just living life because you</v>

1120
00:52:11.331 --> 00:52:16.331
<v Speaker 1>say you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always trying to be an out of </v>

1121
00:52:16.331 --> 00:52:16.331
<v Speaker 1>breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always doing things physically.</v>

1122
00:52:16.331 --> 00:52:16.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1123
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying now is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when I started getting sober I</v>

1124
00:52:19.191 --> 00:52:19.940
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1125
00:52:19.941 --> 00:52:24.941
<v Speaker 1>I got a treadmill and I got into shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you didn't do that before you got </v>

1126
00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:24.941
<v Speaker 1>sober?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1127
00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:25.340
<v Speaker 1>because we were on tour three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three shows a week.</v>

1128
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I was 127 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just skinny,</v>

1129
00:52:29.871 --> 00:52:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Minnie and just trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no MTV.</v>

<v Speaker 1>people get enamored by that.</v>

1132
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.830
<v Speaker 1>But take it out of the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got high.</v>

1133
00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:46.610
<v Speaker 1>I got high because my manager was </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting stoned too.</v>

1134
00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:52.180
<v Speaker 1>They loved it when bands were stoned </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can hand us a piece of </v>

1135
00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:52.400
<v Speaker 1>paper and we would sign it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>your high and get you to on.</v>

1141
00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:14.080
<v Speaker 1>We all got high together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they knew when you were getting </v>

1142
00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:14.080
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

1145
00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:20.190
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

1146
00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Hendricks stoned out of his fuck here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sign this.</v>

1147
00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Lennon thought what was his name?</v>

1148
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.900
<v Speaker 1>New Broom when he got a new lawyer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul was with,</v>

1149
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.450
<v Speaker 1>with the lender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1150
00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.630
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what happens back then.</v>

1151
00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.730
<v Speaker 1>You get your conference today too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1152
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the record business has always been that</v>

1153
00:53:37.951 --> 00:53:42.000
<v Speaker 1>way always because artists are impulsive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not business wise and people</v>

1154
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:43.260
<v Speaker 1>come along and exploit that.</v>

1155
00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very impulsive to think of what it </v>

1156
00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:48.260
<v Speaker 1>takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you study this for a second,</v>

1157
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:52.410
<v Speaker 1>what does it take for a bunch of guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>were not in love with each other.</v>

1158
00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love.</v>

1159
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:56.280

1214
00:56:22.631 --> 00:56:23.350

<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1215
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Because I thought nobody knew who I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows this guy singing and </v>

1216
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:35.000
<v Speaker 1>nobody knew you ever use this guy.</v>

1217
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:40.500
<v Speaker 1>My Mom's passed away and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said they need to see that side of </v>

1218
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.550
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You as a person,</v>

1219
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:44.830

<v Speaker 1>the best way to show that.</v>

1220
00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:48.370
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was the first thing was </v>
<v Speaker 1>what else was.</v>

1221
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I had no managers back then that had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>good sense to offer me anything.</v>

1222
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:58.060
<v Speaker 1>I got the offer from Marti Fredrickson.</v>

1233
00:57:25.751 --> 00:57:27.580
<v Speaker 1>but she'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're harassing me.</v>

1234
00:57:27.581 --> 00:57:30.850
<v Speaker 1>And I'd say who's asked her ass?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1236
00:57:35.851 --> 00:57:36.670

<v Speaker 1>that's missing now,</v>

1237
00:57:36.671 --> 00:57:40.610
<v Speaker 1>but all three of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a whole crew and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but in 50,</v>

1244
00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:05.380
<v Speaker 1>40 people a day would come through all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these 15,</v>

1245
00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:10.381

1248
00:58:20.351 --> 00:58:22.000
<v Speaker 1>You're sitting there doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>50th person.</v>

1253
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:35.740
<v Speaker 1>But that's what people liked though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about American idol.</v>

1254
00:58:35.741 --> 00:58:40.741
<v Speaker 1>We'd like really talented people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also like people who are </v>

1255
00:58:40.741 --> 00:58:40.741
<v Speaker 1>delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1256
00:58:40.741 --> 00:58:45.031
<v Speaker 1>And we trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took me about two weeks to get into </v>

1257
00:58:45.031 --> 00:58:49.750
<v Speaker 1>it because I told myself I am never </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to tell some young girl can't sing</v>

1258
00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:51.640
<v Speaker 1>that she can't say get the fuck out of </v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I don't like?</v>

1260
00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>

1261
00:58:56.110 --> 00:59:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't like your music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Besides which it's country and I don't </v>

1262
00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:01.110
<v Speaker 1>like country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard him say that.</v>

1263
00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:04.690
<v Speaker 1>That seems not that super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's also foolish.</v>

1264
00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.430
<v Speaker 1>He's a weird case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't him,</v>

1265
00:59:06.431 --> 00:59:08.170
<v Speaker 1>because he's not a singer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1266
00:59:08.171 --> 00:59:08.800
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

1267
00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Whatever he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1268
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm singer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can I say that to a girl?</v>

1269
00:59:12.521 --> 00:59:14.800
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There may be some days breastfeeding her</v>

1270
00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:16.540
<v Speaker 1>baby and wants to sing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she wants to.</v>

1271
00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Her baby's sick and she's sitting on her</v>
<v Speaker 1>bed on the bed and wants to sing,</v>

1272
00:59:21.651 --> 00:59:24.920
<v Speaker 1>but J-lo told her she can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have it in me.</v>

1273
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:26.930
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have it in.</v>

1274
00:59:26.931 --> 00:59:28.820
<v Speaker 1>You mean that's his Shtick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1275
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.030
<v Speaker 1>His shtick is to be a mean guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people liked that.</v>

1276
00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:33.150
<v Speaker 1>They liked that mean guy shit.</v>

1277
00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.280
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would say to me,</v>

1278
00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:37.220
<v Speaker 1>it kind of take it up a notch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say that,</v>

1279
00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:40.370
<v Speaker 1>that the producers send them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want the fuck they're doing.</v>

1280
00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:42.060
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1281
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:47.110
<v Speaker 1>they got me a couple times ago the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>they got you to turn it up and then you </v>

1282
00:59:47.110 --> 00:59:48.440
<v Speaker 1>feel bad about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disingenuous.</v>

1283
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>

1284
00:59:49.191 --> 00:59:54.191
<v Speaker 1>like there will be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be moments where we were in,</v>

1285
00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.490
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were some Texas.</v>

1286
00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I look over and the boom started going </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

1287
01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:05.500
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we started getting it in.</v>

1288
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:08.600
<v Speaker 1>They would say number one because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the shot,</v>

1289
01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then so I would whip out my,</v>

1290
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>a Limerick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1291
01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:17.951
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got time for a lumberjack and stop </v>

1292
01:00:17.951 --> 01:00:19.130
<v Speaker 1>everybody when we stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say something like,</v>

1293
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a metaphor from Dallas.</v>

1294
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:26.120
<v Speaker 1>She's a dynamite stick for a Phallus.</v>

1295
01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:31.720
<v Speaker 1>They found her vagina in North Carolina </v>
<v Speaker 1>and her asshole and Buckingham Palace </v>

1296
01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.620
<v Speaker 1>and the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd see the boom going like this,</v>

1297
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:37.220
<v Speaker 1>the place where it was just enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it up.</v>

1298
01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:40.880
<v Speaker 1>And we finished two more than we leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was fun like that.</v>

1299
01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.690
<v Speaker 1>And it was a good payday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're asking me to have a house</v>

1300
01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1301
01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.300
<v Speaker 1>And I was made fun of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for doing that.</v>

1302
01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who made fun of you for doing that?</v>

1303
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Joe Perry didn't think it was a smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1304
01:00:51.321 --> 01:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>He said that's one step under Ninja </v>
<v Speaker 1>turtles and he's my bro.</v>

1305
01:00:55.641 --> 01:00:58.630
<v Speaker 1>And I read that and I thought I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Fuck Joe?</v>

1306
01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Keep in mind when I'm alone by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

1307
01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>does he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1308
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>When do I thought to myself what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Dylan do this.</v>

1309
01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had those thoughts were.</v>

1310
01:01:09.351 --> 01:01:14.351
<v Speaker 1>I kind of fucked me up for a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I went saw dylan doesn't have a</v>

1311
01:01:14.451 --> 01:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>house on my way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>

1312
01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have one.</v>

1313
01:01:16.161 --> 01:01:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted one.</v>

1314
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Got a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like much,</v>

1315
01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:20.960
<v Speaker 1>much money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy has got.</v>

1316
01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he's probably got a house in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle and I know I never.</v>

1317
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bought a house on malware with the money</v>

1318
01:01:27.801 --> 01:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>from idle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where we started.</v>

1319
01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>You have kids right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your youngest is what?</v>

1320
01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.470
<v Speaker 1>She just turned eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight.</v>

1321
01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

1322
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:38.750
<v Speaker 1>I have my two last kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chelsea and Taj.</v>

1323
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:43.430
<v Speaker 1>We lived in Marshfield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts and when it could,</v>

1324
01:01:43.431 --> 01:01:48.431
<v Speaker 1>I would take them to either Disneyland </v>
<v Speaker 1>or world or Maui.</v>

1325
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Go to the four seasons and discoverable </v>
<v Speaker 1>right with your kids.</v>

1326
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:58.270
<v Speaker 1>But every morning I'd wake up and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would run to the right and go all the </v>

1327
01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:01.511
<v Speaker 1>way down to La perouse and I run back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think five miles down and five years </v>

1328
01:02:01.511 --> 01:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How we saw this house I thought is that </v>

1329
01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:06.470
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to know who lived there.</v>

1330
01:02:06.471 --> 01:02:11.471
<v Speaker 1>But I thought somebody was the lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>singer of the grateful dead and Jerry </v>

1331
01:02:11.471 --> 01:02:11.471
<v Speaker 1>Garcia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>

1332
01:02:11.471 --> 01:02:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Rumor was he lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept looking at it and I just use this</v>

1333
01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:20.020
<v Speaker 1>beautiful house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a ridiculous amount of </v>

1334
01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:20.020
<v Speaker 1>millions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1335
01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1336
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that when you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>band,</v>

1337
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:25.980
<v Speaker 1>you share all the money plus management </v>
<v Speaker 1>publishing.</v>

1338
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>And then that contract was signed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1339
01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're into mma?</v>

<v Speaker 1>This morning.</v>

1354

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1355
01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:17.000
<v Speaker 1>I finished a vocal last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eleven up Nuno Betancourt's house.</v>

1356
01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Got to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't sleep until four.</v>

1357
01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1358
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:24.530
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

1359
01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:27.320
<v Speaker 1>You're sweet man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your sweet tooth.</v>

1360
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>It's mean one format to talk truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

1361
01:03:33.801 --> 01:03:38.801
<v Speaker 1>when people watch your show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know whose default the shit and </v>

1362
01:03:38.801 --> 01:03:39.230
<v Speaker 1>who's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm for sure after awhile.</v>

1363
01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1364
01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you.</v>

1365
01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:47.790
<v Speaker 1>But the ones that are telling the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know that too and I think you're </v>

1366
01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:49.040
<v Speaker 1>taking it up a whole shit load of </v>
<v Speaker 1>notches.</v>

1367
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:54.150
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what you were saying about </v>

1368
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:56.010
<v Speaker 4>American idol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like before they knew you was just the </v>

1369
01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:59.041
<v Speaker 4>guy behind the microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You sang songs that touched people and </v>

1370
01:03:59.041 --> 01:03:59.041
<v Speaker 4>move people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

1371
01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:01.550
<v Speaker 4>she just put it right over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1372
01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:06.570
<v Speaker 4>she wants a different stack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even that,</v>

1373
01:04:07.931 --> 01:04:10.480
<v Speaker 4>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having a conversation like this,</v>

1374
01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:14.510
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not enough of these out there or</v>

1375
01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.580
<v Speaker 4>will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is now,</v>

1376
01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now there's more of them,</v>

1377
01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:18.940
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for the longest time,</v>

1378
01:04:18.941 --> 01:04:21.670
<v Speaker 4>but you would never be able to have this</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of conversation because of the same</v>

1379
01:04:21.671 --> 01:04:24.130
<v Speaker 4>people that would tell you to turn it up</v>
<v Speaker 4>a notch on American idol.</v>

1380
01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.320
<v Speaker 4>That'd be producers around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be people trying to fuck with </v>

1381
01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:29.890
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>adding their recognition,</v>

1382
01:04:29.891 --> 01:04:32.200
<v Speaker 4>and this is my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the studio notes.</v>

1383
01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:35.110
<v Speaker 4>We have notes is what we want you to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steven,</v>

1384
01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:38.530
<v Speaker 4>and then we want you to talk about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and stop doing that thing where you keep</v>

1385
01:04:38.531 --> 01:04:40.090
<v Speaker 4>singing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't want to hear that anymore,</v>

1386
01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:41.470
<v Speaker 4>but we want you to do is this</v>

1387
01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:47.310
<v Speaker 1>and for you to speak your mind like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do your truth and have someone across </v>

1388
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>from you to speak their truth in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

1389
01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:54.520

<v Speaker 1>That's unusual.</v>

1391
01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Just think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty years ago you couldn't.</v>

1392
01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't say ass on the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you can now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>countries was great.</v>

1399
01:05:20.711 --> 01:05:25.711
<v Speaker 1>I went to Divi up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it is a new freedom in terms of </v>

1400
01:05:25.711 --> 01:05:29.431
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's because of the </v>

1401
01:05:29.431 --> 01:05:30.601
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are getting used to swears </v>

<v Speaker 1>they're going to use to people just </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking on edited.</v>

1403
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>They're getting used to uncensored </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>They're getting used to things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

01:05:34.241 --> 01:05:36.700
<v Speaker 1>it's just words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this uncensored behavior,</v>

1406
01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:39.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is beyond his way past the word.</v>

1407
01:05:39.281 --> 01:05:44.281
<v Speaker 1>Fuck sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The words are just representative of </v>

1408
01:05:44.281 --> 01:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just noises.</v>

1409
01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like the best way to describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in your head is used all</v>

1410
01:05:49.181 --> 01:05:50.580
<v Speaker 1>the words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use them all.</v>

1411
01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Use the ones that are really coming out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your head.</v>

1412
01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Don't hold them back and give me some </v>
<v Speaker 1>watered down version of what your real </v>

1413
01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.141
<v Speaker 1>thoughts are so I have to decipher it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of put it through a filter and </v>

1414
01:06:01.141 --> 01:06:01.300
<v Speaker 1>try to figure out what it Steven mean by</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1415
01:06:02.850 --> 01:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I got so angry at the way things were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going about that I want to say six years</v>

1416
01:06:09.311 --> 01:06:10.720

<v Speaker 1>it's easy to management.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just got to tell them what they want </v>

<v Speaker 1>to hear.</v>

1475
01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.720
<v Speaker 1>They were upset that you were writing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

1476
01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1479
01:08:45.741 --> 01:08:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Back when you're writing a song and </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in band,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you lay the track down,</v>

1482

<v Speaker 1>lyrics,</v>

1483
01:08:56.690 --> 01:08:58.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>W If I don't,</v>

1484
01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:01.790

<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man?</v>

1485
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:05.090
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm trying to get my wife pregnant.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1510
01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:11.740

<v Speaker 4>let's go quickly back to your book.</v>

1541
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I wrote this and I wrote you a little a </v>
<v Speaker 4>suite that you averse.</v>

1544
01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:35.530
<v Speaker 4>We just remember the less hair I got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The morehead you get,</v>

1545
01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:42.860
<v Speaker 4>the more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the less hair you got the morehead you </v>

1546
01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:42.860

01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:19.890
<v Speaker 4>I just fucking love your truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you were telling me about this </v>

1561
01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:19.890

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for that.</v>

1565

<v Speaker 4>Are you going to martial arts?</v>

1566
01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:34.890
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mostly,</v>

<v Speaker 4>my shoulders or they've got some issues </v>

1568
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:43.860
<v Speaker 4>from some years of abuse and tears and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some minor arthritis.</v>

1569
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:48.570
<v Speaker 4>And this one's been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently I had some sort of separation</v>

1570
01:12:48.571 --> 01:12:52.310
<v Speaker 4>on this one some time in the past and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't know it was a lot of tears.</v>

1571
01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:53.260
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1572
01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:55.380
<v Speaker 4>I've had some great success with stem </v>
<v Speaker 4>cells.</v>

1573
01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:58.310
<v Speaker 4>Mesenchymal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you say it was?</v>

1574

1575
01:12:59.881 --> 01:13:04.000
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stem cells had that sucked out of my hip</v>

1576
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:06.180
<v Speaker 4>bone and hip bone and they put it in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>knee.</v>

1577
01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:07.740
<v Speaker 4>I had a knee replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1578
01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:11.790

<v Speaker 4>You walk very well though.</v>

1579
01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:14.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was wrong with your knee?</v>

1580
01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.490
<v Speaker 4>It had a 99 degree valgus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like this.</v>

1581
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:18.390
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>

1582
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.910
<v Speaker 4>Because I had an acl reconstruction.</v>

1583
01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:22.960
<v Speaker 4>I had both of those done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't try.</v>

1584
01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:25.170
<v Speaker 4>Don't believe that the doctors don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nine years,</v>

1585
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.540
<v Speaker 4>nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said for someone like you,</v>

1586
01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:28.580
<v Speaker 4>nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1587
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:32.640
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've one in my left knee that's 24 years</v>

1588
01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:36.710
<v Speaker 4>old and still working awesome kicks with</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

1589
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:39.090
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all about meniscus.</v>

1590
01:13:39.091 --> 01:13:44.091
<v Speaker 4>It's about the amount of cushioning and </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not they do a good job </v>

1591
01:13:44.091 --> 01:13:46.761
<v Speaker 4>replacing the ligament.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I had very good doctors on my left </v>

1592
01:13:46.761 --> 01:13:46.980
<v Speaker 4>and right knee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shout out to Dr Getelman.</v>

1593
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:48.240
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good for you man.</v>

1594
01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 4>Mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't work.</v>

1595
01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.830
<v Speaker 4>So it started going inwards or did you </v>
<v Speaker 4>get it done?</v>

1596
01:13:52.831 --> 01:13:56.370
<v Speaker 4>Forget what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ninety eight.</v>

1597
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:57.480
<v Speaker 4>Mm?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1598
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:59.090
<v Speaker 4>mine was 94.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1599
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:04.160
<v Speaker 4>I have a buddy 93 actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a buddy of mine who had one done </v>

1600
01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:08.391
<v Speaker 4>though and his knee is really fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the point where he is about to get a </v>

1601
01:14:08.391 --> 01:14:11.961
<v Speaker 4>replacement and he actually got a hip </v>
<v Speaker 4>replacement on one of his hips because </v>

1602
01:14:11.961 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 4>of the damage in his</v>

1603
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:12.490
<v Speaker 1>knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1604
01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:17.491
<v Speaker 1>Because if the knees going in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then this is pushing that way and I </v>

1605
01:14:17.491 --> 01:14:18.880
<v Speaker 1>didn't know any of this shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>percocet one.</v>

1607
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:23.260
<v Speaker 1>That's how long ago did you get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>knee replaced?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1609
01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:29.890
<v Speaker 1>It's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last five,</v>

1610
01:14:29.891 --> 01:14:32.500
<v Speaker 1>six years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I got to get the right one done.</v>

1611
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.230
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm going to Europe with my love </v>
<v Speaker 1>of loving merry band.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So you need to get your right one done.</v>

1613
01:14:38.321 --> 01:14:43.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what's going on with the left </v>

1614
01:14:43.321 --> 01:14:43.321
<v Speaker 1>knee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never hurt.</v>

1615
01:14:43.321 --> 01:14:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But never.</v>

1616
01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Never pinching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No nerves.</v>

1617
01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1618
01:14:46.741 --> 01:14:49.690
<v Speaker 1>How right knee.</v>

<v Speaker 1>don't want to kiss you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't miss a thing.</v>

1770
01:21:35.581 --> 01:21:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Came out right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm up and I'm up in A.</v>

1771
01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I know we're jumping around but disagree</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's good to use these as bites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1775
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:52.130
<v Speaker 1>played.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I was getting to before point,</v>

<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1778
01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:02.870
<v Speaker 1>I used to buy these plastic stickers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to go around to each guy's room </v>

1779
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:06.210
<v Speaker 1>with 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 comment and ask them for 20 bucks and</v>

1780
01:22:06.211 --> 01:22:11.211
<v Speaker 1>we'd get 60 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get these stickers with aerosmith on </v>

1781
01:22:11.211 --> 01:22:12.330
<v Speaker 1>it and I would put them on people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>windshields,</v>

1782
01:22:12.370 --> 01:22:17.370
<v Speaker 1>piss them the fuck off because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really sticky and I put them where you </v>

1783
01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:18.550
<v Speaker 1>throw the money when you go through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>toll booth.</v>

1784
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put them to good mood so everyone will</v>

1785
01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:22.830
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

<v Speaker 1>What's that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aerosmith?</v>

1787

<v Speaker 1>name.</v>

1788
01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.790
<v Speaker 1>We just sat around.</v>

1791
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.820

<v Speaker 1>Someone said Aerosmith,</v>

1792
01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Joey Kramer goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about aerosmith?</v>

1793

<v Speaker 1>the fuck does that mean he goes,</v>

1794
01:22:43.741 --> 01:22:46.000

<v Speaker 1>I used to be in a band and we were.</v>

1795
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:49.640
<v Speaker 1>We were called Arrowsmith for awhile and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there was another aerosmith before.</v>

1796
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that I heard from the drummer </v>

1797
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:58.520
<v Speaker 1>who was always bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a really short lived club </v>

1798
01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.990
<v Speaker 1>thing as an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe there was a band that performed</v>

1799
01:23:00.991 --> 01:23:02.700
<v Speaker 1>a couple of times called arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1800
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe who know me.</v>

01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:12.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see anything into it.</v>

1804
01:23:12.090 --> 01:23:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this knack of looking at someone </v>

1805
01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.590
<v Speaker 1>and not necessarily remembering their </v>
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>

01:24:54.450 --> 01:24:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what dunbars numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1847
01:24:56.530 --> 01:24:59.490
<v Speaker 1>What does a number that you can keep of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationships,</v>

1848
01:24:59.491 --> 01:25:04.491
<v Speaker 1>like friendships and close ties with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you know in your head and </v>

1849
01:25:04.491 --> 01:25:07.601
<v Speaker 1>then somewhere around 150,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they think is roughly about the </v>

1850
01:25:07.601 --> 01:25:11.790
<v Speaker 1>size of tribes that people lived in back</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were developing the human.</v>

1851
01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Your genes really take a long time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change and they think that we </v>

1852
01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:20.190
<v Speaker 1>essentially have very similar genes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that live roughly 10,000</v>

1853
01:25:20.191 --> 01:25:21.510
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

1854
01:25:21.511 --> 01:25:23.520
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially how people live.</v>

1855
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:25.320
<v Speaker 1>They live in these small groups of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1856
01:25:25.650 --> 01:25:27.690
<v Speaker 1>One hundred and 5,200</v>
<v Speaker 1>people max.</v>

1857
01:25:28.110 --> 01:25:30.660
<v Speaker 1>And that stuck in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1858
01:25:31.290 --> 01:25:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Then there was another million people </v>
<v Speaker 1>here a million years ago.</v>

1859
01:25:34.110 --> 01:25:36.150
<v Speaker 1>There was another million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think so,</v>

1860
01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:41.210
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean you don't think there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were people here before the last ice </v>

1861
01:25:41.210 --> 01:25:41.210
<v Speaker 1>age?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went underground?</v>

1862
01:25:41.210 --> 01:25:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what you want underground,</v>

1863
01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:44.370
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1864
01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.130
<v Speaker 1>The Grand Canyon goes cage shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Places they went underground.</v>

1865
01:25:48.150 --> 01:25:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1866
01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from just talking to and watch people,</v>

1867
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:53.880
<v Speaker 1>just people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that live 10,000</v>

1868
01:25:53.881 --> 01:25:55.350
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can go back to that.</v>

1869
01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:57.330
<v Speaker 1>It's just the number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why you can't remember.</v>

1870
01:25:57.331 --> 01:25:59.370
<v Speaker 1>So many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You believe that.</v>

1871
01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:01.400
<v Speaker 1>What do you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1872
01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:03.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel feel as though</v>

1873
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.870
<v Speaker 4>there were people here a long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long time,</v>

1874
01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:06.920
<v Speaker 4>long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long time ago.</v>

1875
01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.960
<v Speaker 4>I read Graham Hancock and that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he makes a lot of sense that there's </v>

1876
01:26:13.041 --> 01:26:18.041
<v Speaker 4>been periods of massive loss of life and</v>
<v Speaker 4>cataclysms and comments passing by.</v>

1877
01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1878
01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:27.890
<v Speaker 4>I believe that we're having not watched </v>
<v Speaker 4>unacknowledged.</v>

1879
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:30.380
<v Speaker 4>What is unacknowledged?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotTa Watch unacknowledged.</v>

1880
01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:31.580
<v Speaker 4>What does that one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1881
01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:33.440
<v Speaker 4>You got to watch you and ignore what is </v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

1882
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:36.950
<v Speaker 4>You got to watch her and acknowledged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that that Steven greer movie?</v>

1883
01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:38.120
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

1884
01:26:38.210 --> 01:26:38.930
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1885
01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.620
<v Speaker 4>Listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1886
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:40.810
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1887
01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:42.590
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is this.</v>

1888
01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:47.600
<v Speaker 4>An industry and the industry is in </v>
<v Speaker 4>people wanting to get mystery solved.</v>

1889
01:26:47.781 --> 01:26:51.470
<v Speaker 4>The great mystery of is there life out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and nobody has any answers.</v>

1890
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:54.890
<v Speaker 4>I did this show for Saifai called Joe </v>
<v Speaker 4>Rogan questions,</v>

1891
01:26:54.891 --> 01:26:56.630
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And before that show,</v>

1892
01:26:56.870 --> 01:27:00.530
<v Speaker 4>I was a hardcore believer in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wonky conspiracies,</v>

1893
01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.270
<v Speaker 4>like big foot and aliens.</v>

1894
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:05.470
<v Speaker 4>I just loved them because they see foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't live in big fund.</v>

1895
01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:08.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe it's the most plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks so,</v>

1896
01:27:08.170 --> 01:27:09.070
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1897
01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:12.500
<v Speaker 4>Because there was an animal called a </v>
<v Speaker 4>gigantic pithy kiss that lived alongside</v>

1898
01:27:12.501 --> 01:27:15.320
<v Speaker 4>human beings as recently as 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1899
01:27:15.321 --> 01:27:20.321
<v Speaker 4>It was a real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely real animals and there's </v>

1900
01:27:20.321 --> 01:27:20.660
<v Speaker 4>found fossilized bones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things,</v>

1901
01:27:20.661 --> 01:27:25.661
<v Speaker 4>and they found teeth from an apothecary </v>
<v Speaker 4>shop and China there was a real animal,</v>

1902
01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:31.130
<v Speaker 4>was a gigantic bipedal hominid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was somewhere around eight to 10 </v>

1903
01:27:31.221 --> 01:27:36.221
<v Speaker 4>feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this thing lived at the same time </v>

1904
01:27:36.221 --> 01:27:38.921
<v Speaker 4>people did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is probably the reason why </v>

1905
01:27:38.921 --> 01:27:39.950
<v Speaker 4>there's this myth of big foot that at </v>
<v Speaker 4>one point in time this was a real thing.</v>

1906
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:41.930
<v Speaker 4>And what about the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about the.</v>

1907
01:27:41.950 --> 01:27:43.760
<v Speaker 4>They're walking around now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably not.</v>

1908
01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:45.080
<v Speaker 4>I sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most likely not.</v>

1909
01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.510
<v Speaker 4>That was what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1910
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:47.060
<v Speaker 4>sure it was.</v>

1911
01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:51.230
<v Speaker 4>Jerry put this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know about aliens.</v>

1912
01:27:51.231 --> 01:27:54.410
<v Speaker 4>Tell me about the most is a business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of it is.</v>

1913
01:27:54.690 --> 01:27:58.010
<v Speaker 4>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about the air force general consent</v>

1914
01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:00.100
<v Speaker 4>to Kate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did that tape,</v>

1915
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:03.650
<v Speaker 4>gave it to his wife and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't put this out until I'm dead.</v>

1916
01:28:03.651 --> 01:28:05.860
<v Speaker 4>Did you not feel as though when he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking?</v>

1917
01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:08.570
<v Speaker 4>Any of that was real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you've seen that way.</v>

1918
01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.390
<v Speaker 4>I think too many of you seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen a lot of those.</v>

1919
01:28:11.391 --> 01:28:13.280
<v Speaker 4>I've seen a lot of those people is a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of.</v>

1920
01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:18.400
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of former military people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that say they've seen crazy things that </v>

1921
01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:18.400
<v Speaker 4>it's entirely possible that they really </v>
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>

1922
01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:23.350
<v Speaker 4>It's entirely possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also possible that they're </v>

1923
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.830
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's possible that they love attention.</v>

1924
01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.720
<v Speaker 4>It's possible that they're bored.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's possible their schizophrenia.</v>

1925
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:31.810
<v Speaker 4>It's possible that they have memories </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they've concocted over the years </v>

1926
01:28:31.810 --> 01:28:35.670
<v Speaker 4>and enhancements,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gotten them attention and it's putting </v>

1927
01:28:35.670 --> 01:28:36.590
<v Speaker 4>them in documentaries and it gets them </v>
<v Speaker 4>interviews on television programs,</v>

1928
01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:38.870
<v Speaker 4>but that there's no evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1929
01:28:38.871 --> 01:28:42.860
<v Speaker 4>and the problem with all these peoples,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all have this same feeling about</v>

1930
01:28:42.861 --> 01:28:43.910
<v Speaker 4>them and then not.</v>

1931
01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:48.470
<v Speaker 4>There's very few of them to come across </v>
<v Speaker 4>as rational and objective.</v>

1932
01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:51.500
<v Speaker 4>Most of them come across as there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>something wrong.</v>

1933
01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:54.110
<v Speaker 4>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's wires that aren't connecting.</v>

1934
01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:57.080
<v Speaker 4>If you talk to them about other things </v>
<v Speaker 4>in life,</v>

1935
01:28:57.081 --> 01:28:59.270
<v Speaker 4>like if you had a chance to talk to them</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a long period of time,</v>

1936
01:28:59.271 --> 01:29:02.760
<v Speaker 4>sit down with them for three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ask them about ghosts,</v>

1937
01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:06.210
<v Speaker 4>psychics and all kinds of other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They almost all believe in that stuff.</v>

1938
01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.440
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're believers.</v>

1939
01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:10.890
<v Speaker 4>They want to believe in nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hear you as soon as that crops up,</v>

1940
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm out of the room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's possible.</v>

1941
01:29:13.130 --> 01:29:14.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just possible.</v>

1942
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:19.700
<v Speaker 4>It's 100 percent likely that this alien </v>
<v Speaker 4>life out there like 100 percent more </v>

1943
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:21.750
<v Speaker 4>scared me for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1944
01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:26.780
<v Speaker 4>I think it's likely that the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it kind of had a nice thread </v>

1945
01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:30.020
<v Speaker 4>that movie's horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of those movies that are </v>

1946
01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:30.840
<v Speaker 4>horse shit and that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knows some of that's horse shit.</v>

1947
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:34.590
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a little baby that they had</v>
<v Speaker 4>found as an aborted fetus.</v>

1948
01:29:34.591 --> 01:29:37.440
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to pass that off as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>alien baby for a long time,</v>

1949
01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:39.250
<v Speaker 4>but they have generally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there were,</v>

1950
01:29:39.251 --> 01:29:40.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were hybrids.</v>

1951
01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:46.580
<v Speaker 4>No hybrid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you tell me about the link between </v>

1952
01:29:46.921 --> 01:29:48.960
<v Speaker 4>monkeys and us?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seriously?</v>

1953
01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:54.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>between the frontal lobes and the full </v>

1954
01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:58.070
<v Speaker 4>one monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well we are hominids mean we are </v>

1955
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.830
<v Speaker 4>primates and we're just the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>advanced primary.</v>

1956
01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:01.190
<v Speaker 4>The real question is how did we get to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be so much more than that?</v>

1957
01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I asked you.</v>

1958
01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:07.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's more likely when we found fire and </v>

1959
01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:08.670
<v Speaker 4>our diet change and hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the stoned ape theory,</v>

1960
01:30:08.671 --> 01:30:13.671
<v Speaker 4>which is a very fascinating theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The stoned ape theory is Terence </v>

1961
01:30:13.671 --> 01:30:17.270
<v Speaker 4>Mckenna's theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're human beings found cell site </v>

1962
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:19.590
<v Speaker 4>siliciden mushrooms and that through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>use of psilocybin mushrooms,</v>

1963
01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:22.890
<v Speaker 4>which in low doses increases visual </v>
<v Speaker 4>acuity,</v>

1964
01:30:22.891 --> 01:30:27.891
<v Speaker 4>produces these ecstatic states that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>might've helped us develop language and </v>

1965
01:30:28.081 --> 01:30:33.081
<v Speaker 4>communication and creativity and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>this term was the reason why the human </v>

1966
01:30:33.081 --> 01:30:34.890
<v Speaker 4>brain doubled in size over a period of 2</v>
<v Speaker 4>million years,</v>

1967
01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:37.320
<v Speaker 4>which is the greatest mystery in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>history of the fossil record.</v>

1968
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:42.470
<v Speaker 4>They don't know why they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a very clear path here to a </v>

1969
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:43.680
<v Speaker 4>million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Humans,</v>

1970
01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:48.360
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some form is some form of of primate was</v>

1971
01:30:48.361 --> 01:30:51.730
<v Speaker 4>certainly here tons of years ago as was </v>
<v Speaker 4>dear dear.</v>

1972
01:30:51.731 --> 01:30:54.240
<v Speaker 4>We're here millions of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of animals.</v>

1973
01:30:54.330 --> 01:30:55.630
<v Speaker 4>You mean through our peer plate?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1974
01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:58.380
<v Speaker 4>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I feel that.</v>

1975
01:30:58.410 --> 01:30:59.730
<v Speaker 4>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1976
01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:02.280
<v Speaker 4>just because there was an ice age that </v>
<v Speaker 4>took part that took.</v>

1977
01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:03.210
<v Speaker 4>It was a company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds,</v>

1978
01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:05.460
<v Speaker 4>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years was the ice age,</v>

1979
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:07.650
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's been a bunch of ice ages,</v>

1980
01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.920
<v Speaker 4>but the most recent one ended somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the neighborhood of 12,000</v>

1981
01:31:10.921 --> 01:31:12.150
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was nothing.</v>

1982
01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:17.040
<v Speaker 4>Nothing from beginning to end and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know what caused it.</v>

1983
01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:18.690
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the ice age exists,</v>

1984
01:31:18.691 --> 01:31:23.691
<v Speaker 4>we have to remember that some parts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world aren't experiencing the ice </v>

1985
01:31:23.691 --> 01:31:24.350
<v Speaker 4>age and then humans thrived in Africa </v>
<v Speaker 4>during parts of the ice age.</v>

1986
01:31:24.610 --> 01:31:29.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of human beings that live </v>

1987
01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:32.241
<v Speaker 4>all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real question is where they start </v>

1988
01:31:32.241 --> 01:31:35.061
<v Speaker 4>most likely from Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they could have possibly started </v>

1989
01:31:35.061 --> 01:31:35.210
<v Speaker 4>from some other places too and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting to learn that the people,</v>

1990
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:37.380
<v Speaker 4>the people that are learning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1991
01:31:37.381 --> 01:31:39.630
<v Speaker 4>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's that too,</v>

1992
01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:44.660
<v Speaker 4>but I mean mostly just people traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what you really learned from his </v>

1993
01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:46.770
<v Speaker 4>archeologists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

1994
01:31:46.771 --> 01:31:48.600
<v Speaker 4>the people you learn from and </v>
<v Speaker 4>biologists,</v>

1995
01:31:48.601 --> 01:31:51.780
<v Speaker 4>people that really understand the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>genome,</v>

1996
01:31:51.781 --> 01:31:56.781
<v Speaker 4>they really understand the differences </v>
<v Speaker 4>between people that emerge from China </v>

1997
01:31:56.781 --> 01:32:01.191
<v Speaker 4>versus people that emerged from western </v>
<v Speaker 4>Europe versus people that emerged from </v>

1998
01:32:01.191 --> 01:32:01.930
<v Speaker 4>or native Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1999
01:32:01.931 --> 01:32:06.010
<v Speaker 4>there's so many different types of human</v>
<v Speaker 4>beings that came from different climates</v>

2000
01:32:06.011 --> 01:32:09.610
<v Speaker 4>and that our bodies evolved from these </v>
<v Speaker 4>places and there's real science to that.</v>

2001
01:32:09.670 --> 01:32:12.220
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to get that from these </v>
<v Speaker 4>goofy fucking documentaries.</v>

2002
01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:17.250
<v Speaker 4>These goofy fucking documentaries are </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically a business and the businesses </v>

2003
01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:17.650
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of people out there that</v>

2004
01:32:17.651 --> 01:32:20.380
<v Speaker 4>want to want to know the answers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the truth?</v>

2005
01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:25.500
<v Speaker 4>And so you get a board to secret UFO.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw the magnetic controller that makes</v>

2006
01:32:25.841 --> 01:32:28.840
<v Speaker 4>us travel through the cosmos and bend </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and space.</v>

2007
01:32:28.841 --> 01:32:32.230
<v Speaker 4>It's like a wormhole and they'll say a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of sciencey sound and shit,</v>

2008
01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:35.170
<v Speaker 4>but there's no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does nothing.</v>

2009
01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:36.820
<v Speaker 4>When they talk about there's nothing.</v>

2010
01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Will you let David know that guy says </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he is the reincarnation of Edgar </v>

2011
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Casey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that?</v>

2012
01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you know that?</v>

2013
01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Edgar Casey?</v>

2014
01:32:50.630 --> 01:32:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

2015
01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Famous psychic who never really figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>out anything and thought to be a fraud </v>

2016
01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:59.780
<v Speaker 1>most widely by scientists and kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking too much loud,</v>

2017
01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:02.510
<v Speaker 1>loud them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think?</v>

2018
01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what everything was written</v>

2019
01:33:04.401 --> 01:33:07.950
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was stone Psychedelic,</v>

2020
01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:11.870
<v Speaker 1>second Siliciden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>

2021
01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:15.940
<v Speaker 1>opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now last hundred years you get loud,</v>

2022
01:33:15.941 --> 01:33:16.670
<v Speaker 1>loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loud.</v>

2023
01:33:16.671 --> 01:33:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Glum allowed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was drinking that shit,</v>

2024
01:33:21.230 --> 01:33:22.220
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

2025
01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:25.730
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2026
01:33:25.770 --> 01:33:26.750
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2027
01:33:26.751 --> 01:33:28.680
<v Speaker 1>That shit was in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Japanese there.</v>

2028
01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:33.760
<v Speaker 1>They never left the island to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Japanese have the same ice </v>

2029
01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:34.370
<v Speaker 1>shapes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2030
01:33:34.371 --> 01:33:35.840
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a reason?</v>

2031
01:33:36.230 --> 01:33:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why I didn't leave the </v>

2032
01:33:41.230 --> 01:33:41.230
<v Speaker 1>island and come back after meeting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else.</v>

2033
01:33:41.230 --> 01:33:43.230
<v Speaker 1>So stayed on the land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they're from alien?</v>

2034
01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:44.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely not.</v>

2035
01:33:44.301 --> 01:33:46.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just that they stayed on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2036
01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:47.330
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that plot of land.</v>

2037
01:33:47.331 --> 01:33:52.331
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you agree to American Indians </v>

2038
01:33:52.331 --> 01:33:53.150
<v Speaker 1>from Asian look fairly similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2039
01:33:53.151 --> 01:33:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's variations in the similarities.</v>

2040
01:33:55.210 --> 01:33:57.620
<v Speaker 1>It was similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it took millions of years.</v>

2041
01:33:57.670 --> 01:34:00.030
<v Speaker 1>That's my take look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't prove anything.</v>

2042
01:34:00.090 --> 01:34:01.400
<v Speaker 1>They do believe it took millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2043
01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:06.420
<v Speaker 1>We always finished up by saying I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it right when I go out at night </v>

2044
01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:07.130
<v Speaker 1>knowing walks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk around,</v>

2045
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:09.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm dying to see with Ufo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

2046
01:34:09.741 --> 01:34:12.350
<v Speaker 1>So were you every second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see one.</v>

2047
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:17.870
<v Speaker 1>The second right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will make clear shit like you know </v>

2048
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:24.430
<v Speaker 1>the song I wrote called back when Kane </v>
<v Speaker 1>was able way before anyways about a </v>

2049
01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:26.750
<v Speaker 1>mothership and chip way before I knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about Ufo.</v>

2050
01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see anything when you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics,</v>

2051
01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:31.540
<v Speaker 1>when you did drugs with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you did mushrooms,</v>

2052
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:36.750
<v Speaker 1>saw anything that wasn't there for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not the kind of people I'm not for kind </v>

2053
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:36.750
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>

2054
01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:41.960
<v Speaker 4>People have though and the idea is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there are things that are out there and </v>

2055
01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.960
<v Speaker 4>neighboring dimensions that you really </v>
<v Speaker 4>not capable of accessing them.</v>

2056
01:34:45.170 --> 01:34:46.870
<v Speaker 4>That that's where the real alien slip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2057
01:34:47.730 --> 01:34:52.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't know man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just know that all these people </v>

2058
01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:52.730
<v Speaker 4>that are pushing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all.</v>

2059
01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:54.930
<v Speaker 4>They all have this fuckery involved and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these people.</v>

2060
01:34:54.970 --> 01:34:56.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real problem.</v>

2061
01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear because</v>

2062
01:34:58.260 --> 01:34:59.810
<v Speaker 4>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>

2063
01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.370
<v Speaker 4>You want to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2064
01:35:01.371 --> 01:35:03.800
<v Speaker 4>You want to believe that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>general out there that seen a spaceship.</v>

2065
01:35:03.801 --> 01:35:05.480
<v Speaker 4>It's under the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell me about it,</v>

2066
01:35:05.481 --> 01:35:10.481
<v Speaker 4>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>General and he goes on a lecture tour </v>

2067
01:35:10.481 --> 01:35:12.461
<v Speaker 4>and that you've got to pay money to see </v>
<v Speaker 4>him and he's in a documentary and </v>

2068
01:35:12.461 --> 01:35:12.461
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of those people out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2069
01:35:12.461 --> 01:35:14.960
<v Speaker 4>and I live with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was backstage with Joe Perry.</v>

2070
01:35:14.961 --> 01:35:17.990
<v Speaker 4>What'd you do know my home life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2071
01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.650
<v Speaker 4>so I get what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The wow of the thrill of the story,</v>

2072
01:35:21.651 --> 01:35:23.390
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people love to tell stories.</v>

2073
01:35:23.391 --> 01:35:25.060
<v Speaker 4>Something inside me that says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2074
01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:28.610
<v Speaker 4>They still haven't found that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that missing link,</v>

2075
01:35:29.210 --> 01:35:33.810
<v Speaker 4>that betweens if you talk to biologists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they do.</v>

2076
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:37.070
<v Speaker 4>They have all through Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pithy fossils.</v>

2077
01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:42.190
<v Speaker 4>They have the things that were like us </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are different from a long fucking </v>

2078
01:35:42.190 --> 01:35:42.190
<v Speaker 4>time ago.</v>

2079
01:35:42.190 --> 01:35:44.390
<v Speaker 4>They have those in the size of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

2080
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:46.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To frontal lobe brain changed.</v>

2081
01:35:46.471 --> 01:35:49.430
<v Speaker 4>It doubled over a period of 2 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>years mean that that did happen,</v>

2082
01:35:49.670 --> 01:35:52.790
<v Speaker 4>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know what we used to be.</v>

2083
01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:57.830
<v Speaker 4>There are simple hominids that were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or rather ancient hominids that are very</v>

2084
01:35:57.831 --> 01:36:02.000
<v Speaker 4>similar to human beings and they slowly </v>
<v Speaker 4>became human beings and there's also.</v>

2085
01:36:02.150 --> 01:36:05.270
<v Speaker 4>They keep finding all these different </v>
<v Speaker 4>versions of human beings.</v>

2086
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:07.140
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't just human,</v>

2087
01:36:07.170 --> 01:36:10.040
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't just homosapiens and of </v>
<v Speaker 4>course there was neanderthals and.</v>

2088
01:36:10.041 --> 01:36:11.630
<v Speaker 4>But there was that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one from Russia.</v>

2089
01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.730
<v Speaker 4>What was that called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was in that mood,</v>

2090
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:14.730
<v Speaker 4>that book?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2091
01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:19.750
<v Speaker 4>Hominid what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that a deal?</v>

2092
01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.070
<v Speaker 4>Dee Dee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I can't remember that it starts with</v>

2093
01:36:22.071 --> 01:36:27.071
<v Speaker 4>a d,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's one that they've found very </v>

2094
01:36:27.071 --> 01:36:27.071
<v Speaker 4>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very recently.</v>

2095
01:36:27.071 --> 01:36:28.370
<v Speaker 4>You find a jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2096
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:33.040
<v Speaker 4>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dennis Sovan Dennis.</v>

2097
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:38.050
<v Speaker 4>So Dennis Sullivan did a Sovan hominin </v>
<v Speaker 4>extinct species of sub or subspecies of </v>

2098
01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:39.800
<v Speaker 4>archaic humans.</v>

2099
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:43.480
<v Speaker 4>They found in the 19 seventies by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russian paleontologists,</v>

2100
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:49.330
<v Speaker 4>Nikolai old golf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's been a bunch of different </v>

2101
01:36:49.330 --> 01:36:50.870
<v Speaker 4>forms of humans were just the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful form of human.</v>

2102
01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:54.350
<v Speaker 4>The idea that it's just alien,</v>
<v Speaker 4>DNA connected with people.</v>

2103
01:36:54.351 --> 01:36:56.360
<v Speaker 4>It's sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds fun,</v>

2104
01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:00.710
<v Speaker 4>but there's no evidence here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You isn't what we are as humans.</v>

2105
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:03.020
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are mutations.</v>

2106
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:07.370
<v Speaker 4>We are an ancient thing that slowly </v>
<v Speaker 4>figured its way out and we became better</v>

2107
01:37:07.371 --> 01:37:09.560
<v Speaker 4>at seeing things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've gained better at hunting.</v>

2108
01:37:09.710 --> 01:37:14.710
<v Speaker 4>We became better at harnessing fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Freewill came from a lot of people that </v>

2109
01:37:15.651 --> 01:37:20.651
<v Speaker 4>don't even believe it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They believe they believe in </v>

2110
01:37:20.651 --> 01:37:20.651
<v Speaker 4>determinism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>

2111
01:37:20.651 --> 01:37:20.780
<v Speaker 4>Don't even believe that free will is an </v>
<v Speaker 4>actual thing.</v>

2112
01:37:20.781 --> 01:37:25.781
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard Sam Harris arguing pretty </v>

2113
01:37:25.781 --> 01:37:28.601
<v Speaker 4>successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there is no such thing as free </v>

2114
01:37:28.601 --> 01:37:30.581
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you are an accumulation of your </v>

2115
01:37:30.581 --> 01:37:30.581
<v Speaker 4>genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your life experiences,</v>

2116
01:37:30.581 --> 01:37:32.090
<v Speaker 4>all the things that have happened to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that you've come in contact with.</v>

2117
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:37.070
<v Speaker 4>That's true behavioral and that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>four year old psychology behavior.</v>

2118
01:37:37.130 --> 01:37:42.130
<v Speaker 4>Think about your behavior and how much </v>
<v Speaker 4>of your behavior is shaped by millions </v>

2119
01:37:42.130 --> 01:37:44.930
<v Speaker 4>of adoring fans and people screaming and</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheering you on and singing.</v>

2120
01:37:44.931 --> 01:37:49.931
<v Speaker 4>Songs that move people and literary </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed generations give people </v>

2121
01:37:49.931 --> 01:37:52.940
<v Speaker 4>goosebumps when they hear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean all that stuff has shaped who you</v>

2122
01:37:52.941 --> 01:37:57.941
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean all that stuff changes who a </v>

2123
01:37:57.941 --> 01:38:00.591
<v Speaker 4>person is and who you are now and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way you behave now is in many ways </v>

2124
01:38:00.591 --> 01:38:05.061
<v Speaker 4>shaped by your life experiences as much </v>
<v Speaker 4>as as it is by your genetics and you </v>

2125
01:38:05.061 --> 01:38:09.981
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be this person if you hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>lived that life and the decisions that </v>

2126
01:38:09.981 --> 01:38:12.210
<v Speaker 4>you make from this moment on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Leave the studio and have a conversation</v>

2127
01:38:12.211 --> 01:38:15.900
<v Speaker 4>with someone who will be shaped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least in part by this conversation,</v>

2128
01:38:15.901 --> 01:38:17.970
<v Speaker 4>and mine will be my conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2129
01:38:18.330 --> 01:38:22.220
<v Speaker 4>This is the idea behind determinism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would ask what was.</v>

2130
01:38:22.410 --> 01:38:24.060
<v Speaker 4>Who said this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was into this many,</v>

2131
01:38:24.061 --> 01:38:26.220
<v Speaker 4>many people that come up with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>concept,</v>

2132
01:38:26.221 --> 01:38:29.910
<v Speaker 4>but I've heard it that it was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>argued to me by Sam Harris,</v>

2133
01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:31.470
<v Speaker 4>the most successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2134
01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:34.950
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wonder why then,</v>

2135
01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:37.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain monkeys,</v>

2136
01:38:37.681 --> 01:38:39.560
<v Speaker 4>certain breeds of monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smart ones,</v>

2137
01:38:39.570 --> 01:38:41.580
<v Speaker 4>Benobos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love them because I'm a Panola.</v>

2138
01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:47.780
<v Speaker 4>Have stickers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll put a stick in something and </v>

2139
01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:47.780
<v Speaker 4>pull out [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2140
01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:49.320
<v Speaker 4>well that's also haven't taken going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well wait a minute now.</v>

2141
01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:52.320
<v Speaker 4>Then they haven't got any favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've gone past that.</v>

2142
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:57.350
<v Speaker 4>So do you know primatologists actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>believed that chimpanzees have entered </v>

2143
01:38:57.350 --> 01:39:01.161
<v Speaker 4>the stone age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is one thing that's being </v>

2144
01:39:01.161 --> 01:39:01.200
<v Speaker 4>considered now that they've started to </v>
<v Speaker 4>use of tools on a regular basis.</v>

2145
01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:04.830
<v Speaker 4>They think that they're learning from </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other and they think that they're.</v>

2146
01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:07.020
<v Speaker 4>If they are evolving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2147
01:39:07.021 --> 01:39:09.270
<v Speaker 4>and if human beings evolved over a </v>
<v Speaker 4>period of millions of years,</v>

2148
01:39:09.450 --> 01:39:13.200
<v Speaker 4>we are actually watching chimpanzees </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolve in real time.</v>

2149
01:39:13.490 --> 01:39:18.490
<v Speaker 4>This a long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long process that'll take millions of </v>

2150
01:39:18.490 --> 01:39:19.620
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they have entered the stone age,</v>

2151
01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:23.970
<v Speaker 4>so they think that who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a series of mutations,</v>

2152
01:39:23.971 --> 01:39:26.250
<v Speaker 4>if natural selection with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different things happening,</v>

2153
01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:29.970
<v Speaker 4>what a chimpanzee is today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most likely it will be a different thing</v>

2154
01:39:29.971 --> 01:39:31.350
<v Speaker 4>and 2 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course it will.</v>

2155
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:36.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that totally agreeing that these </v>

2156
01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:36.370
<v Speaker 4>intelligent animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to experiment with things.</v>

2157
01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:40.940
<v Speaker 4>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Macaques often use stolen tools have </v>

2158
01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:40.950
<v Speaker 4>been living in the stone age for 50 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

2159
01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:43.950
<v Speaker 4>so for 50 years these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just 50.</v>

2160
01:39:44.010 --> 01:39:45.600
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That actually about that.</v>

2161
01:39:45.601 --> 01:39:47.640
<v Speaker 4>That's when somebody first saw them </v>
<v Speaker 4>using the stone.</v>

2162
01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:48.540
<v Speaker 4>It true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2163
01:39:48.630 --> 01:39:53.630
<v Speaker 4>in terms of primatologists behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so these archeologists have uncovered </v>

2164
01:39:53.630 --> 01:39:57.600
<v Speaker 4>stone tools they believe these animals </v>
<v Speaker 4>have used or other humans?</v>

2165
01:39:57.680 --> 01:39:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or other humans.</v>

2166
01:39:58.950 --> 01:40:01.140
<v Speaker 4>Either your stone out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you look,</v>

2167
01:40:01.141 --> 01:40:04.040
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about when you look up</v>
<v Speaker 4>and look at?</v>

2168
01:40:04.050 --> 01:40:05.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where I got my girls.</v>

2169
01:40:05.761 --> 01:40:10.761
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely don't know the answers </v>

2170
01:40:10.761 --> 01:40:10.761
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2171
01:40:10.761 --> 01:40:11.130
<v Speaker 4>remember I just said I just repeat shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smart people figure it out.</v>

2172
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:16.310
<v Speaker 4>That's all I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about the stones that are cut cut </v>

2173
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:19.190
<v Speaker 4>up and not much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You tube it up and I know what you're </v>

2174
01:40:19.190 --> 01:40:19.190
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2175
01:40:19.190 --> 01:40:19.960
<v Speaker 4>those laser cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2176
01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.100
<v Speaker 4>not laser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>

2177
01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:22.660
<v Speaker 4>Very precise cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2178
01:40:22.661 --> 01:40:27.661
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoever was likely advanced </v>

2179
01:40:27.661 --> 01:40:28.710
<v Speaker 4>civilizations that have been wiped out </v>
<v Speaker 4>by cataclysm and that's what I'm saying,</v>

2180
01:40:28.711 --> 01:40:31.590
<v Speaker 4>so my mind goes to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet we were here.</v>

2181
01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:35.160
<v Speaker 4>Simply wasn't run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's places I saw movies of it.</v>

2182
01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:38.290
<v Speaker 4>Where are you going to the mountain?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go back three miles in the mountains</v>

2183
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:39.840
<v Speaker 4>seeing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2184
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:43.260
<v Speaker 4>There's this incredible cases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>natural caves,</v>

2185
01:40:43.710 --> 01:40:46.440
<v Speaker 4>rooms like this and is a natural cave </v>
<v Speaker 4>systems in Texas.</v>

2186
01:40:46.441 --> 01:40:47.310
<v Speaker 4>They go back miles.</v>

2187
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:48.600
<v Speaker 4>So mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm just saying,</v>

2188
01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:51.060
<v Speaker 4>so I should say that's where my head </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes with this.</v>

2189
01:40:51.061 --> 01:40:52.130
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ghosts.</v>

2190
01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:53.410
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's your own fear.</v>

2191
01:40:53.530 --> 01:40:55.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what you're talking about.</v>

2192
01:40:55.001 --> 01:40:56.220
<v Speaker 4>Muscle shoals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

2193
01:40:56.420 --> 01:41:01.420
<v Speaker 4>the feeling in that room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There might be a similar feeling when a </v>

2194
01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:03.880
<v Speaker 4>violent encounter happens in a house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That might be what a ghost is,</v>

2195
01:41:04.030 --> 01:41:09.030
<v Speaker 4>what a ghost is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>might be this thing that you can't </v>

2196
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:09.030
<v Speaker 4>capture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't put it in a box,</v>

2197
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:12.510
<v Speaker 4>can't wait on a scale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you get a feeling when you're in a </v>

2198
01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:13.420
<v Speaker 4>place where something horrible happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you could feel it.</v>

2199
01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:18.900
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not impossible to imagine this is </v>

2200
01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:21.930
<v Speaker 4>the case and Rupert sheldrake was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy that I told you believed that and </v>

2201
01:41:21.930 --> 01:41:23.740
<v Speaker 4>he's a scientist and some people would </v>
<v Speaker 4>argue against it,</v>

2202
01:41:23.741 --> 01:41:27.340
<v Speaker 4>but that he believes that things have </v>
<v Speaker 4>memory and then it's impossible.</v>

2203
01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:29.500
<v Speaker 4>It's possible that even this table has </v>
<v Speaker 4>memory.</v>

2204
01:41:29.501 --> 01:41:31.030
<v Speaker 4>All the people that are sat where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>sat.</v>

2205
01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:33.520
<v Speaker 4>I think it's got a vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if this memory,</v>

2206
01:41:33.521 --> 01:41:34.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got memory water.</v>

2207
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:38.410
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows about that border because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it never goes anywhere.</v>

2208
01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:40.090
<v Speaker 4>You can never get rid of water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

2209
01:41:40.150 --> 01:41:42.270
<v Speaker 4>You can boil it steam and it goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes back down.</v>

2210
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:45.460
<v Speaker 4>So I think when they find out the memory</v>
<v Speaker 4>one or I also got to tell you,</v>

2211
01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:50.020
<v Speaker 4>for the billions of babies that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is terrible or new,</v>

2212
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:55.470
<v Speaker 4>strangled people with their heads bashed</v>
<v Speaker 4>in murdered wars,</v>

2213
01:41:57.610 --> 01:42:00.100
<v Speaker 4>billions were there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ghost.</v>

2214
01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:02.080
<v Speaker 4>Where's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's that energy?</v>

2215
01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:05.410
<v Speaker 4>Where is that energy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because in New York City alone,</v>

2216
01:42:05.411 --> 01:42:10.411
<v Speaker 4>there were hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people murdered that Neil's apartment </v>

2217
01:42:10.411 --> 01:42:14.731
<v Speaker 4>building should be going like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>because maybe it's accumulation of all </v>

2218
01:42:14.731 --> 01:42:14.760
<v Speaker 4>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>positive and negative,</v>

2219
01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:18.760
<v Speaker 4>and the negative experiences are </v>
<v Speaker 4>outweighed by the positive experiences.</v>

2220
01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:20.890
<v Speaker 4>For the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the time,</v>

2221
01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:24.160
<v Speaker 4>life is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time life is not filled with</v>

2222
01:42:24.161 --> 01:42:29.161
<v Speaker 4>war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Life is not filled with cannibalism and </v>

2223
01:42:29.161 --> 01:42:29.620
<v Speaker 4>murder and animals eating you most of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

2224
01:42:29.770 --> 01:42:34.770
<v Speaker 4>So most of the memories accumulated in </v>
<v Speaker 4>these individual areas were probably </v>

2225
01:42:34.770 --> 01:42:38.971
<v Speaker 4>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes the idea behind like </v>

2226
01:42:38.971 --> 01:42:41.761
<v Speaker 4>haunted houses and shit like that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that something so extreme happened that </v>

2227
01:42:41.761 --> 01:42:45.100
<v Speaker 4>the remanence of that experience are </v>
<v Speaker 4>trapped in the very fiber of the room.</v>

2228
01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:49.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside the realm of possibility.</v>

2229
01:42:49.151 --> 01:42:51.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't either because I'll tell you who</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks about it.</v>

2230
01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:52.720
<v Speaker 4>Some human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2231
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:54.000
<v Speaker 4>They knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2232
01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:57.010
<v Speaker 4>Here's what I would test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would find out somewhere.</v>

2233
01:42:57.011 --> 01:43:00.040
<v Speaker 4>There's some unbelievable murder was </v>
<v Speaker 4>taken place.</v>

2234
01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:03.250
<v Speaker 4>Don't tell anybody and let 10 families </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep in there.</v>

2235
01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:04.370
<v Speaker 4>See what I had taught at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Duh.</v>

2236
01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:06.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure they have be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go shows.</v>

2237
01:43:06.850 --> 01:43:08.700
<v Speaker 4>You got more notes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you are supported.</v>

2238
01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:10.570
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted to finish that thing about</v>
<v Speaker 4>mma.</v>

2239

<v Speaker 4>who flashes money and talks about her.</v>

<v Speaker 1>royalty rates and treatment for music </v>

2261
01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.270

<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>

2272
01:44:48.141 --> 01:44:53.141
<v Speaker 1>they have to give up merchandise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to give up a piece of their </v>

2273
01:44:53.141 --> 01:44:53.141
<v Speaker 1>concerts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sales,</v>

2274
01:44:53.141 --> 01:44:53.480
<v Speaker 1>they have to give up everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2275
01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:54.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2276
01:44:54.620 --> 01:44:57.500
<v Speaker 1>that's what's going on because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no more money in actual record sale.</v>

2277
01:44:57.530 --> 01:45:02.530
<v Speaker 1>It's called 24 slash seven or some kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of bullshit like some crazy thing where </v>

2278
01:45:02.530 --> 01:45:03.560
<v Speaker 1>they have a piece of everything because </v>
<v Speaker 1>manager see it and they want your money.</v>

2279
01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they also realize that their avenue</v>

2280
01:45:05.721 --> 01:45:08.990
<v Speaker 1>of revenue is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they locked onto merchandise.</v>

2281
01:45:08.991 --> 01:45:11.870
<v Speaker 1>They locked onto ticket sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which used to be all yours,</v>

2282
01:45:11.871 --> 01:45:12.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2283
01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Like when you used to do concerts back </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the day,</v>

2284
01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:17.180
<v Speaker 1>used to get paid for your record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you got fucked over,</v>

2285
01:45:17.181 --> 01:45:19.910
<v Speaker 1>you got some money from the record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you would get all the money for</v>

2286
01:45:19.911 --> 01:45:20.450
<v Speaker 1>the concerts.</v>

2287
01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2288
01:45:21.170 --> 01:45:24.050
<v Speaker 1>but well not unless we were own </v>
<v Speaker 1>managers.</v>

2289
01:45:24.051 --> 01:45:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Ninety 10 means we take 90 percent out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 percent of the Mucosa there.</v>

2290
01:45:28.131 --> 01:45:31.760
<v Speaker 1>So you make $800,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Company gets it.</v>

2291
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's different,</v>

2292
01:45:33.230 --> 01:45:34.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that a different thing?</v>

2293
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Well the record company gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets publishing,</v>

2294
01:45:38.110 --> 01:45:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all these digital outlets of </v>

2295
01:45:43.110 --> 01:45:43.110
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>

2296
01:45:43.110 --> 01:45:46.240
<v Speaker 1>then the record company company decides </v>
<v Speaker 1>to give whatever is left to the artist,</v>

2297
01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.780
<v Speaker 1>which is usually little to nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smokey Robinson,</v>

2298
01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:53.450
<v Speaker 1>my dear friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go up to this guy and I go,</v>

2299
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:54.860
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

2300
01:45:56.750 --> 01:46:01.750
<v Speaker 1>But I love you seeing if that all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>songs phenomenal.</v>

2301
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:07.990
<v Speaker 1>This fucking guy went to the digitals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said you only $250,000</v>

2302
01:46:09.410 --> 01:46:12.400
<v Speaker 1>with proof they offered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They offered for,</v>

2303
01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:17.560
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for his music being played while the </v>

2304
01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:17.560
<v Speaker 1>last five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do they owe him that?</v>

2305
01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Because he was getting nothing back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing was coming to him.</v>

2306
01:46:20.150 --> 01:46:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gone.</v>

2307
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coffers are empty,</v>

2308
01:46:22.930 --> 01:46:24.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says what the fuck?</v>

2309
01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm smokey Robinson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2310
01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:29.720
<v Speaker 1>I hear my music and his music is covered</v>
<v Speaker 1>by thousands of people.</v>

2311
01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:34.670
<v Speaker 1>The guy knew legally $250,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>was owed to him.</v>

2312
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2313
01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:40.100
<v Speaker 1>He was offered 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

2314
01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:43.700
<v Speaker 1>if you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide now smokey,</v>

2315
01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:49.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that kind of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we've done is the smokey </v>

2316
01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Robinson doesn't have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

2317
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.740
<v Speaker 1>So smokey Robinson should be just </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy.</v>

2318
01:46:52.741 --> 01:46:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Look at King.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is not to say he's not.</v>

2319
01:46:56.670 --> 01:47:00.420
<v Speaker 1>If he had no money at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the happiest guy in his wife</v>

2320
01:47:00.421 --> 01:47:05.421
<v Speaker 1>is the sweetest and maybe he's a town </v>
<v Speaker 1>attained something that you and I don't </v>

2321
01:47:05.421 --> 01:47:07.380
<v Speaker 1>recognize yet or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the mass media,</v>

2322
01:47:08.190 --> 01:47:10.290
<v Speaker 1>but he's got something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's rich.</v>

2323
01:47:11.250 --> 01:47:16.250
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to him getting paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually for songs that's really fucked </v>

2324
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:16.250
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2325
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:18.150
<v Speaker 1>So what did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he decided to do a,</v>

2326
01:47:18.151 --> 01:47:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it's going.</v>

2327
01:47:19.411 --> 01:47:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I got to talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But David Israelite,</v>

2328
01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:26.310
<v Speaker 1>the president and CEO of the National </v>
<v Speaker 1>Music Publishers Association and Dina,</v>

2329
01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:28.050
<v Speaker 1>we went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to Washington magic,</v>

2330
01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:30.030
<v Speaker 1>this beautiful blonde in this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2331
01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Now we're in Washington and in me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know saying what's up with this?</v>

2332
01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:38.070
<v Speaker 1>This money is going right out the window</v>
<v Speaker 1>and knocked to the artist.</v>

2333
01:47:38.850 --> 01:47:43.850
<v Speaker 1>These new artists getting nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we decided to do something for the </v>

2334
01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:48.621
<v Speaker 1>first time songwriters will have </v>
<v Speaker 1>representatives overseeing </v>

2335
01:47:48.621 --> 01:47:51.390
<v Speaker 1>administration of mechanical licenses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and administration.</v>

2336
01:47:51.391 --> 01:47:55.290
<v Speaker 1>So someone's now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least not only can he complained,</v>

2337
01:47:55.291 --> 01:47:56.690
<v Speaker 1>but there's someone watching that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2338
01:47:56.691 --> 01:47:57.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2339
01:47:57.630 --> 01:48:01.480
<v Speaker 1>You do in fact legally owe him $250.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smoke.</v>

2340
01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:04.680
<v Speaker 1>You come here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down and for the first time.</v>

2341
01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:07.890
<v Speaker 1>So this is something we're trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>passed in the next.</v>

2342
01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think it should be that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2343
01:48:11.851 --> 01:48:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I do think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the reason why we're not on that.</v>

2344
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:16.890
<v Speaker 1>We're not on spotify and the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not on it,</v>

2345
01:48:16.891 --> 01:48:18.990
<v Speaker 1>it's because it didn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Everyone's sharing songs and I'm sure </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are listening to me and say,</v>

2412
01:50:53.101 --> 01:50:54.900
<v Speaker 4>what a prick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking rich old fuck.</v>

2413
01:50:55.380 --> 01:51:00.120
<v Speaker 4>But what's happened is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it's become the norm.</v>

2414
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:03.870
<v Speaker 4>What's the norm is that people recognize</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can't do that with movies.</v>

2415
01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:09.020
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They recognize that if you're stealing </v>

2416
01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:09.020
<v Speaker 4>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's illegal.</v>

2417
01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:09.480
<v Speaker 4>Like if you get caught with a bit torn </v>
<v Speaker 4>account,</v>

2418
01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:11.970
<v Speaker 4>you got a bunch of movies on there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're letting people download them.</v>

2419
01:51:11.971 --> 01:51:13.150
<v Speaker 4>You can get prosecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2420
01:51:13.650 --> 01:51:17.040
<v Speaker 4>Let me ask you why so much for that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>not for somebody songs.</v>

2421
01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:18.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a thing with songs too,</v>

2422
01:51:18.991 --> 01:51:20.790
<v Speaker 4>but it's just not as common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2423
01:51:20.791 --> 01:51:24.120
<v Speaker 4>Jamie is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have been sued for having tons of</v>

2424

<v Speaker 4>If you're doubling their movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2427
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:36.210
<v Speaker 4>It's just songs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason,</v>

2428
01:51:36.211 --> 01:51:41.211
<v Speaker 4>after napster became something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people think that you should just be </v>

01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's going to buy that toxic </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosis.</v>

2526
01:55:57.211 --> 01:56:01.020
<v Speaker 1>You cut your wife's head off day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on drugs.</v>

2527
01:56:01.021 --> 01:56:03.080
<v Speaker 1>There's some kind of law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2528
01:56:03.081 --> 01:56:07.610
<v Speaker 1>the lawyers were looking to find someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that if he was caught,</v>

2529
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:11.600
<v Speaker 1>they never did a blood test on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my dad was arrested.</v>

2530
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:13.400
<v Speaker 1>My guy came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in jail.</v>

2531
01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:19.060
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychosis is when you do too much </v>

2532
01:56:19.060 --> 01:56:20.240
<v Speaker 1>cocaine or too much speed or too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2533
01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:25.470
<v Speaker 1>He also had a history of domestic abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very violent toward,</v>

2534
01:56:25.490 --> 01:56:30.490
<v Speaker 1>to hit her a bunch of times and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could've just been that he went crazy </v>

2535
01:56:30.490 --> 01:56:32.951
<v Speaker 1>and just stabbed her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but didn't all his friends that he was </v>

2536
01:56:32.951 --> 01:56:35.621
<v Speaker 1>doing blow all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't that guy that he jumped out the </v>

2537
01:56:35.621 --> 01:56:36.090
<v Speaker 1>window so he was selling them blow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2538
01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:37.970
<v Speaker 1>I do look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to.</v>

2539
01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just telling you sometimes these </v>

2540
01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:43.420
<v Speaker 1>things do exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2541
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:46.610
<v Speaker 1>That's sad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The managers.</v>

2542
01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

2543
01:56:48.190 --> 01:56:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how I got there.</v>

2544
01:56:49.810 --> 01:56:51.910
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the lawyers?</v>

2545
01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:54.640
<v Speaker 1>The lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking lawyers.</v>

2546
01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Fucking lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the lawyer brought in this,</v>

2547
01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:01.280
<v Speaker 1>a guru as a guy that knows about drugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>

2548
01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was on drugs at a.</v>

2549
01:57:03.170 --> 01:57:04.850
<v Speaker 1>It kind of softens the blow of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>

2550
01:57:04.851 --> 01:57:06.590
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know what he's doing if he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>convicted,</v>

2551
01:57:06.650 --> 01:57:07.550
<v Speaker 1>if he was conducted.</v>

2552
01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:09.530
<v Speaker 1>So you never know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>

2553
01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:14.560
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was what they were going to </v>

2554
01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:14.560
<v Speaker 1>probably use on appeal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2555
01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:14.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2556
01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:16.400
<v Speaker 1>lawyers in a sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyers will bring in but bring them,</v>

2557
01:57:16.401 --> 01:57:18.830
<v Speaker 1>bringing them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because we now trump won't say,</v>

2558
01:57:18.890 --> 01:57:23.890
<v Speaker 1>I apologize to John Mccain because if he</v>
<v Speaker 1>does doesn't everything else.</v>

2559
01:57:24.591 --> 01:57:28.210
<v Speaker 1>He said then come into light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why you telling me that's a</v>

2560
01:57:28.211 --> 01:57:29.060
<v Speaker 1>good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't.</v>

2561
01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:30.840
<v Speaker 1>He never apologizes about anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember.</v>

2562
01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:34.750
<v Speaker 1>So what did you say he did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's got lawyer.</v>

2563
01:57:35.250 --> 01:57:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Least fucking lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tell him don't.</v>

2564
01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:38.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2565
01:57:38.331 --> 01:57:38.860
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2566
01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Don't apologize now because if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to shed light on all the </v>

2567
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:45.640
<v Speaker 1>other shit you said about mccain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he listens.</v>

2568
01:57:45.850 --> 01:57:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I think trump does whatever the fuck he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants.</v>

2569
01:57:47.801 --> 01:57:49.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's going to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>any.</v>

2570
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:53.830
<v Speaker 1>He's a 72 year old billionaire and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think he listens to anybody.</v>

2571
01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I think he does whatever the fuck he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants.</v>

2572
01:57:55.780 --> 01:58:00.780
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing that explains his </v>

2573
01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:00.780
<v Speaker 1>tweeting and all that crazy shit that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>says all the time.</v>

2574
01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2575
01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:05.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just complete guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2576
01:58:05.290 --> 01:58:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew him.</v>

2577
01:58:06.670 --> 01:58:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Did you fuck here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it feel weird that he's a </v>

2578
01:58:11.670 --> 01:58:11.670
<v Speaker 1>president?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he calls me up and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald,</v>

2594
01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:06.610
<v Speaker 1>you can't use dream on as for causes not</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigns.</v>

2595
01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:10.390
<v Speaker 1>And he did anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did anyway.</v>

2596
01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:15.600
<v Speaker 1>And I had to sue him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got dino's whom send them a letter of </v>

2597
01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:15.600
<v Speaker 1>cease and desist.</v>

2598
01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:17.530
<v Speaker 1>So I've been through that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I kinda know where lawyers live.</v>

2599
01:59:18.370 --> 01:59:19.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't have this whole world's run by</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyers.</v>

2600
01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:23.380
<v Speaker 1>And Donald's got 90 lawyers that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling them what the fuck.</v>

2601
01:59:23.770 --> 01:59:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's not listening.</v>

2602
01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when everyone is saying,</v>

2603
01:59:27.611 --> 01:59:31.300
<v Speaker 1>if you just say John Mccain is a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>hero,</v>

2604
01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:31.960
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2605
01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:37.200
<v Speaker 1>if we don't see John Mccain is a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then how do you expect any young people </v>

2606
01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:41.461
<v Speaker 1>to want to ever join the armed forces?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because for everything they do in </v>

2607
01:59:41.461 --> 01:59:44.971
<v Speaker 1>bullets they take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be laughed at by </v>

2608
01:59:44.971 --> 01:59:44.971
<v Speaker 1>president trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2609
01:59:44.971 --> 01:59:48.250
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you saying Donald?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he said something crazy like,</v>

2610
01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:51.460
<v Speaker 1>but you see what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soldiers that don't get caught thinks he</v>

2611
01:59:51.461 --> 01:59:53.380
<v Speaker 1>said but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do.</v>

2612
01:59:53.410 --> 01:59:55.150
<v Speaker 1>War is war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who wants to.</v>

2613
01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Soldiers don't get caught because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to.</v>

2614
01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just tell you that,</v>

2615
01:59:59.950 --> 02:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not saying anything because he's </v>

2616
02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>being told what to do.</v>

2617
02:00:04.950 --> 02:00:05.570
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

2618
02:00:05.571 --> 02:00:07.460
<v Speaker 4>I think he just does whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>he wants.</v>

2619
02:00:07.461 --> 02:00:09.230
<v Speaker 4>And if the lawyers tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steven says,</v>

2620
02:00:09.231 --> 02:00:10.670
<v Speaker 4>you can't play dream on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2621
02:00:10.671 --> 02:00:11.330
<v Speaker 4>fuck him.</v>

2622
02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:12.910
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He played in way.</v>

2623
02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>So I had sent them a cease and desist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he sends a letter and said,</v>

2624
02:00:15.981 --> 02:00:19.190
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm playing kid rock or something,</v>

2625
02:00:21.050 --> 02:00:23.510
<v Speaker 4>what did he found?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A better song goes,</v>

2626
02:00:23.570 --> 02:00:25.270
<v Speaker 4>I found a better song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>

2627
02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:27.680
<v Speaker 4>I went with them freely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's his thing.</v>

2628
02:00:27.710 --> 02:00:30.810
<v Speaker 4>You know he likes insulting people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I see.</v>

2629
02:00:31.010 --> 02:00:33.230
<v Speaker 4>I see how that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how people get off on his.</v>

2630
02:00:33.590 --> 02:00:37.280
<v Speaker 4>What it is is I get this isn't here </v>
<v Speaker 4>present for this time though?</v>

2631
02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:42.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is the time we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>before the show about people trying to </v>

2632
02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:45.101
<v Speaker 4>drag people down and social media and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so much hostility and people </v>

2633
02:00:45.101 --> 02:00:48.970
<v Speaker 4>looking to be angry and insult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the time for that in a lot of </v>

2634
02:00:48.970 --> 02:00:48.970
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately</v>

2635
02:00:48.970 --> 02:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he's opening something good </v>
<v Speaker 1>pr.</v>

2636
02:00:50.890 --> 02:00:53.960
<v Speaker 1>He's opening Pandora's box for good or </v>
<v Speaker 1>is he opening Pandora's?</v>

2637
02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Our choice voice.</v>

2638
02:00:55.340 --> 02:00:57.590
<v Speaker 4>I think it's our choice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's our president.</v>

2639
02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:03.520
<v Speaker 4>He's the president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think we can respond to this bad </v>

2640
02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:05.450
<v Speaker 4>feeling that we have about those kinds </v>
<v Speaker 4>of actions in a positive way.</v>

2641
02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:10.480
<v Speaker 4>I think that's where there's an opening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the opening is for people to </v>

2642
02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:11.060
<v Speaker 4>recognize that you're not going to live </v>
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>

2643
02:01:11.090 --> 02:01:13.910
<v Speaker 4>You can't insult people into the grave </v>
<v Speaker 4>and feel good when you're dying.</v>

2644
02:01:13.911 --> 02:01:16.640
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter like what makes you </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel good right now.</v>

2645
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:22.000
<v Speaker 4>If something makes you feel good to </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly be knocking people down and </v>

2646
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.420
<v Speaker 4>shitting on their grave that you'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably a terrible person.</v>

2647
02:01:23.450 --> 02:01:26.330
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wants to be a terrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Least the majority of people don't.</v>

2648
02:01:26.630 --> 02:01:31.630
<v Speaker 4>So I think the majority of people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna recognize that this path is a bad </v>

2649
02:01:31.630 --> 02:01:35.171
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it might feel good in the short </v>

2650
02:01:35.171 --> 02:01:35.171
<v Speaker 4>term to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>

2651
02:01:35.171 --> 02:01:36.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to make America great again.</v>

2652
02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:37.880
<v Speaker 4>We're gonna fucking light the world on </v>
<v Speaker 4>fire.</v>

2653
02:01:37.881 --> 02:01:42.560
<v Speaker 4>But I think after awhile when the tide </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes in and the tide goes out,</v>

2654
02:01:42.561 --> 02:01:44.540
<v Speaker 4>people are gonna realize this is not the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way to go.</v>

2655
02:01:45.170 --> 02:01:46.520
<v Speaker 4>I hope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope we're going to learn.</v>

2656
02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:49.130
<v Speaker 4>I think the world's getting better </v>
<v Speaker 4>overall.</v>

2657
02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:54.160
<v Speaker 4>I think there's terrible moments that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have always existed throughout human </v>

2658
02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:54.160
<v Speaker 4>history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think overall,</v>

2659
02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:56.090
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the period of time we </v>
<v Speaker 4>live in now,</v>

2660
02:01:56.690 --> 02:01:59.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Steven pinker wrote a great big book</v>

2661
02:01:59.181 --> 02:02:00.920
<v Speaker 4>about this and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence.</v>

2662
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:02.180
<v Speaker 4>I read his book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2663
02:02:02.181 --> 02:02:03.590
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of evidence that points to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2664
02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:05.680
<v Speaker 4>Every now and then I'll find somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

2665
02:02:05.770 --> 02:02:07.200
<v Speaker 4>I'll preach something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see something,</v>

2666
02:02:07.201 --> 02:02:09.590
<v Speaker 4>and I call my managers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gave me his number,</v>

2667
02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:11.720
<v Speaker 4>called Steven up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm from Boston.</v>

2668
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:15.170
<v Speaker 4>I met him and had lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's great at what he call crab,</v>

2669
02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:17.360
<v Speaker 4>you know you know Boston?</v>

2670
02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:19.280
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the best restaurants on planet.</v>

2671
02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:24.820
<v Speaker 4>The barking and crab fucking met him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had lunch with him and my marriage on </v>

2672
02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:25.700
<v Speaker 4>Macra.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a fucking slamming guy.</v>

2673
02:02:25.730 --> 02:02:30.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a really is fucking smart as can </v>

2674
02:02:30.730 --> 02:02:30.730
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Friendly.</v>

2675
02:02:30.730 --> 02:02:31.060
<v Speaker 4>This is the kind of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the.</v>

2676
02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:36.220
<v Speaker 4>This is the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you when it's time for </v>

2677
02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:36.220
<v Speaker 4>lifting up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2678
02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:39.370
<v Speaker 4>Well I think that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it really natural homeowners?</v>

2679
02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:40.750
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you know,</v>

2680
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:45.790
<v Speaker 4>the more stupid shit goes on like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The more people are to recognize that </v>

2681
02:02:45.790 --> 02:02:45.860
<v Speaker 4>this is not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not good.</v>

2682
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:48.590
<v Speaker 4>Does it make people feel good and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not even good for conservatives,</v>

2683
02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:52.120
<v Speaker 4>but conservatives just like it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's their turn now and they're turned.</v>

2684
02:02:52.121 --> 02:02:54.470
<v Speaker 4>They got a bully on their side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just the boat is going to kick ass.</v>

2685
02:02:54.471 --> 02:02:56.240
<v Speaker 4>It's going to fucking do things the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>we want.</v>

2686
02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:58.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even they're going to realize like,</v>

2687
02:02:58.401 --> 02:03:00.740
<v Speaker 4>this isn't the way you would admire </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2688
02:03:00.741 --> 02:03:02.250
<v Speaker 4>This is the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2689
02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:07.260
<v Speaker 4>there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a possibility to be kind and </v>

2690
02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:07.260
<v Speaker 4>conservative at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These,</v>

2691
02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:08.130
<v Speaker 4>this is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2692
02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:10.970
<v Speaker 4>I think things will balance out that </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

2693
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:12.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only time will tell.</v>

2694
02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:13.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

2695
02:03:13.850 --> 02:03:16.370
<v Speaker 4>overly optimistic at times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so don't listen to me.</v>

2696
02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:18.650
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the best way to be.</v>

2697
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:20.900
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You definitely don't want to go into the</v>

2698
02:03:20.901 --> 02:03:21.980
<v Speaker 4>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2699
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:25.310
<v Speaker 4>Don't look at the music business at </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunter s Thompson.</v>

2700
02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:30.020
<v Speaker 4>Quote the music business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know when it comes to streaming,</v>

2701
02:03:30.050 --> 02:03:30.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know this.</v>

2702
02:03:30.810 --> 02:03:35.810
<v Speaker 4>I love this quote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a cruel and shallow money trench </v>

2703
02:03:35.810 --> 02:03:38.530
<v Speaker 4>along plastic hallway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're thieves and pimps run free and </v>

2704
02:03:38.530 --> 02:03:40.010
<v Speaker 4>good men die like dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's also a negative side.</v>

2705
02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:44.330
<v Speaker 4>I fucking hunter and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were good friends for a bit.</v>

2706
02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:45.550
<v Speaker 4>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2707
02:03:45.690 --> 02:03:47.030
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a giant fan.</v>

2708
02:03:47.090 --> 02:03:48.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a menu.</v>

2709
02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:50.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's wrap this up right here.</v>

2710
02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:51.560
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're the best.</v>

2711
02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:54.260
<v Speaker 4>I fucking hope he says we to do this </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

2712
02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:56.600
<v Speaker 4>I hope we opened up some doors here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did.</v>

2713
02:03:56.601 --> 02:03:59.300
<v Speaker 4>We had to open up some doors with me </v>
<v Speaker 4>about Ufo and shit.</v>

2714
02:03:59.301 --> 02:04:04.301
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to a crystal ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to rethink my ship that it's </v>

2715
02:04:04.301 --> 02:04:08.051
<v Speaker 4>totally possible that Ufo is a real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but be aware of people that tell you </v>

2716
02:04:08.051 --> 02:04:09.920
<v Speaker 4>they know the truth because people want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to know the truth.</v>

2717
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:12.740
<v Speaker 4>So the people that come along and tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>you I know the truth,</v>

2718
02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:15.250
<v Speaker 4>too many of them are full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too easy.</v>

2719
02:04:15.251 --> 02:04:18.270
<v Speaker 4>It's an easy con game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my thought on it.</v>

2720
02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:21.250
<v Speaker 4>Steven Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker.</v>

2721
02:04:21.251 --> 02:04:22.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>respect.</v>

2722
02:04:23.110 --> 02:04:28.110
<v Speaker 4>Can I get A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>hmm?</v>
