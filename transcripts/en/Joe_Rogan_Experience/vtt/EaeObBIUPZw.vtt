00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.230

<v Speaker 1>They're embracing it.</v>

46
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>They're embracing the fact that he's a stoner,</v>

47
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>like heavy duty.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Did you see him on the last fight?</v>

53
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>he just takes time off.</v>

55
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean you don't have to take much time off anymore.</v>

56
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

57
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Two weeks.</v>

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.221
<v Speaker 1>Two days.</v>

59
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:14.851
<v Speaker 1>Two days.</v>

60
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:15.684
<v Speaker 1>Days.</v>

61
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>New Usada rules.</v>

64
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:20.730
<v Speaker 1>You just can't be high when you fight depending where you fight though.</v>

65
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

66
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Cause there there's some issues coming up.</v>

67
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>I forget which state they do it different.</v>

68
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Probably Texas commissions are haters.</v>

69
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>So Dylan,</v>

70
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Dennis,</v>

71
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>this is not as MMA debut.</v>

72
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh against Kyle Walker and Eddie.</v>

73
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:36.050
<v Speaker 1>Tell us about Dylan's Jujitsu.</v>

74
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>He's pretty high level.</v>

75
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

76
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the best around for sure.</v>

77
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:43.791
<v Speaker 1>He had an amazing match with Gordon Ryan at 2017 Abu Dhabi.</v>

78
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean the fight was really close.</v>

79
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>It could've went either way and they gave it the judge's decision gave it to</v>

80
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Gordon and Gordon when I went on to win his division.</v>

81
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>So He's,</v>

82
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 1>he's top of the food chain and you know,</v>

83
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>he was with Marcello Garcia.</v>

84
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>He got his black belt from Marcella Garcia.</v>

85
00:01:58.471 --> 00:01:58.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Marcello kicked him out for shit talking.</v>

87
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

88
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not the deal for,</v>

89
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:02.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.651
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

91
00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>he started hanging out with Conor McGregor and Marcella Garcia is the opposite</v>

92
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>of that kind of shit.</v>

93
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.343
<v Speaker 1>Her humble.</v>

94
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Incredibly humble.</v>

95
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

96
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>You would think though that Marcello and him would work it out though.</v>

98
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>And I have a guy and the guy's a high level black belt,</v>

99
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>like obviously it's just too much drama.</v>

100
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>But Dylan in real life,</v>

101
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>he's a super great guy.</v>

102
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>He's just trying to make some money.</v>

103
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.461
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

104
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

105
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.820
<v Speaker 1>he's smart talking.</v>

106
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>He got shit to Jon Jones and I,</v>

107
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>and here we go.</v>

108
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.151
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

109
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 1>that's stupid.</v>

110
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.840
<v Speaker 1>I know all these guys talking shit that John John's are eventually going to have</v>

111
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:32.870
<v Speaker 1>to meet him and they will get slapped.</v>

112
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>When I saw Dylan,</v>

113
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>when the Conor and Floyd fight,</v>

114
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>me and him sat next to each other,</v>

115
00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:37.910
<v Speaker 1>he was the nicest guy in the world,</v>

116
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

117
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.541
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

118
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:39.121
<v Speaker 1>His fans,</v>

119
00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>he's very Conor McGregor.</v>

120
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Ask With that same coaching.</v>

121
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 1>So coaching,</v>

122
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.733
<v Speaker 1>same camp.</v>

123
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.693
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>

124
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.690
<v Speaker 1>He's got real problems with just striking.</v>

125
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>That dude just stepped in and cleaned him with that left.</v>

126
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

127
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>He got some problems.</v>

128
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.670
<v Speaker 1>His standup is super rudimentary.</v>

129
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Takedowns are they better be good.</v>

130
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Well it's Kinda,</v>

131
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>he's Kinda like the Mackenzie dern,</v>

132
00:02:58.321 --> 00:02:59.154
<v Speaker 1>right of,</v>

133
00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.711
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

134
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>he's obviously closing the distance too,</v>

135
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>which is a problem because it's obvious you're calming in.</v>

136
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>The guy could just wait on you.</v>

137
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>His distance control several times.</v>

138
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>He's been clipped by that left hand.</v>

139
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.333
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>

140
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>If this guy can keep this fight stand.</v>

141
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

142
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

143
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>His kicks are stiff.</v>

144
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

145
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.830
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

146
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>but his Jujitsu is this shit.</v>

147
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>If he gets his fight to these kind of like an alley cat version of Connor,</v>

148
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>like super alley cat.</v>

149
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't real rough.</v>

150
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>He pulls back with his chin straight up in the air to get a clinch.</v>

151
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

152
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.373
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

153
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.910
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

154
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.213
<v Speaker 1>Let's jump to God.</v>

156
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.080
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

157
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.790
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't happen enough fatty now.</v>

158
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen if you get the skills down,</v>

159
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>if he can't take the guy down and you have your dangerous off your back.</v>

160
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Pulling Guard is great.</v>

161
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

162
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.090
<v Speaker 1>He's hooking it and he's about to get them in an arm bar right here.</v>

163
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.091
<v Speaker 1>This is good.</v>

164
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>This guy's in trouble.</v>

165
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>If this guy is gonna sweep,</v>

166
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.963
<v Speaker 1>this guy knows the game.</v>

167
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna pull out of this shit.</v>

168
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

169
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.510
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna.</v>

170
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.171
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna heal her.</v>

171
00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:56.004
<v Speaker 1>Come watch him.</v>

172
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.003
<v Speaker 1>He's got him.</v>

173
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>It's in deep.</v>

174
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.623
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

175
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

176
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 1>That was fun for sure.</v>

177
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>There he goes.</v>

178
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.103
<v Speaker 1>And that's a wrap.</v>

179
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.943
<v Speaker 1>I think he's okay.</v>

180
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 1>He pulled guard and she got to heal hook.</v>

181
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sweet.</v>

182
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

183
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

184
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.123
<v Speaker 1>It was a suite here.</v>

185
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Opponent.</v>

186
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem giving them a warm up fight,</v>

187
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 1>like the source first one first.</v>

188
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>MMA fight your belt door.</v>

189
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>He's still getting worse.</v>

190
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Could be in Pico,</v>

191
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:19.091
<v Speaker 1>your first fight.</v>

192
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

193
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Just so things,</v>

194
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:20.891
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

195
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>when I see a dude get his knee ripped apart like that,</v>

196
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>like that dude's fucked.</v>

197
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.241
<v Speaker 1>Look at him.</v>

198
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.074
<v Speaker 1>He's in pain.</v>

199
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 1>You could get your shoulder ripped apart and come on the exact same way.</v>

200
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:30.311
<v Speaker 1>So I know,</v>

201
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:30.601
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

202
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:31.181
<v Speaker 1>it's weird,</v>

203
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:31.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

204
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

205
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it makes sense to tap.</v>

206
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.170
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

207
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

208
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem is guys aren't too familiar with what goes on with the leg</v>

209
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:37.891
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>

210
00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 1>So by the time they're tapping it's too late.</v>

211
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

212
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm saying is for whatever reason,</v>

213
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:42.101
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

214
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:42.911
<v Speaker 1>when I watch it,</v>

215
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I cringe McCurry with Lego.</v>

216
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

217
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Like if I see a guy get his arm broken,</v>

218
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't bother me.</v>

219
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Like I see a guy get his knee ripped apart cause we're not used to seeing it.</v>

220
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.091
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

221
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:52.331
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

222
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I maybe it's because I know that tap you like,</v>

223
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>you only have so much time to tap.</v>

224
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Like your shit's gonna explode.</v>

225
00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.493
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just,</v>

226
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.753
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

227
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

228
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Speaker 1>But when a guy is really good at it,</v>

229
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:03.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>if you fuck up an ankle,</v>

231
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 1>he's out for a grip.</v>

232
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

233
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>

234
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

235
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.811
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dad.</v>

236
00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I said no asked.</v>

237
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 1>He won't tell.</v>

238
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

239
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 1>nasty toehold.</v>

240
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I had a bad angle as a tone.</v>

241
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 1>That was a heel hook initially.</v>

242
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

243
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>I thought so too.</v>

244
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't really show it.</v>

245
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:17.990
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't see his back was to write it.</v>

246
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.853
<v Speaker 1>He can't see it.</v>

247
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

248
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.291
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

249
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:20.651
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

250
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

251
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 1>I liked the fact that he's in there,</v>

252
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

253
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:27.560
<v Speaker 1>I feel like w just watching him move with his standup,</v>

254
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.480
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see him.</v>

255
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:29.770
<v Speaker 1>That's his first fight.</v>

256
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Brother.</v>

257
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.611
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

258
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>but I'd like to see him to get some more standup training.</v>

259
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Just it seems like,</v>

260
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

261
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:36.551
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

262
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>if he gets guys to the ground,</v>

263
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>they're there in a world of shit,</v>

264
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.190
<v Speaker 1>but you could see from his standup,</v>

265
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>it's like rudimentary super amateur,</v>

266
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:43.991
<v Speaker 1>but how's that?</v>

267
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Any different than Michael Bennett page was zero Jujitsu,</v>

268
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>so much as zero Jujitsu.</v>

269
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

270
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>That starts on the fee.</v>

271
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Michael [inaudible].</v>

272
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 1>He's a straight up black belt as they get,</v>

273
00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:55.804
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to the ground,</v>

274
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.311
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

275
00:05:57.311 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Nickel then and pages tap people.</v>

276
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>He's tapped people.</v>

277
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

278
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

279
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think his Jujitsu is as bad as you think so.</v>

280
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

281
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.153
<v Speaker 1>so that light,</v>

282
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 1>not Michael Dubin page.</v>

283
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.650
<v Speaker 1>He's no Dylan Dennis,</v>

284
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.493
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

285
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.423
<v Speaker 1>Paul Daley.</v>

286
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

287
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.961
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

288
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:12.480
<v Speaker 1>that's a good cause.</v>

289
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.313
<v Speaker 1>It's just use off.</v>

290
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

291
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 1>If you're high level at one aspect.</v>

292
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

293
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.901
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's wrestling,</v>

294
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Jiu Jitsu or striking.</v>

295
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 1>If you're super high level worldclass you can suck at the other two.</v>

296
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.241
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

297
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:23.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

298
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>look at Green Melvin Manhoef.</v>

299
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>He's so dangerous on his feet.</v>

300
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really have any Jujitsu,</v>

301
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:28.941
<v Speaker 1>but it's okay.</v>

302
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

303
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>People still want to see him fight.</v>

304
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.431
<v Speaker 1>We get Damien Meyer,</v>

305
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Jake shields.</v>

306
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.961
<v Speaker 1>My thing is though,</v>

307
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 1>when I see a guy like Dylan Dannis who so good on the ground,</v>

308
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:41.501
<v Speaker 1>I really want them to achieve a certain level of striking proficiency before he</v>

309
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:42.041
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

310
00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:42.650
<v Speaker 1>He fights.</v>

311
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

312
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

313
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like we're going to pay rent the wrestler,</v>

314
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to put him in a world of Joe.</v>

315
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:50.300
<v Speaker 1>He's never been in that in that cage before.</v>

316
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

317
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>So maybe in training he's putting it all together like you're ready to go.</v>

318
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Man Gets in these.</v>

319
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.970
<v Speaker 1>He's like damn.</v>

320
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Hate his nerves.</v>

321
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Never felt those nerves inside the age.</v>

322
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 1>They took those shots to took those shots on the chin.</v>

323
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

324
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 1>you got hit with a couple of good clean left hands and he adjusted.</v>

325
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:05.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'm,</v>

326
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

327
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm about a million percent sure the plan wasn't to go out there and pull guard.</v>

328
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he realized,</v>

329
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

330
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 1>this guy's tagging me and he was kind of hesitant to get in tight to get a</v>

331
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 1>takedown pulling guard show that he can adapt.</v>

332
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

333
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mad at it at all.</v>

334
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

335
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that was probably in the plan,</v>

336
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

337
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.181
<v Speaker 1>Plan B,</v>

338
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>plan c.</v>

339
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.333
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

340
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.750
<v Speaker 1>if he gets guys the ground there in the world,</v>

341
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

342
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.420
<v Speaker 1>most fighters,</v>

343
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.450
<v Speaker 1>they don't have it in their plan to pull guard most down.</v>

344
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Not the ones that,</v>

345
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.063
<v Speaker 1>that I've talked to.</v>

346
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.450
<v Speaker 1>It's never part of the plan.</v>

347
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Like this doesn't work or that doesn't work.</v>

348
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:38.061
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pull guard.</v>

349
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:38.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

350
00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:38.850
<v Speaker 1>that's too bad either.</v>

351
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 1>It's either I'm going to try to take him down until the bitter end.</v>

352
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Speak a pulling guard,</v>

353
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

354

358
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

359
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Was he supposed to be fighting ponds and Obo?</v>

360
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:52.124
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

361
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.000

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.370
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be very interesting to see or to do other things because of a fun,</v>

425
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.313
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

426
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:40.610
<v Speaker 1>tighten it up.</v>

427
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe find a diet and find a doll in the back.</v>

428
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

432
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he wrote it for him.</v>

433
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.003
<v Speaker 1>Could be</v>

434

<v Speaker 1>willing to die.</v>

435
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 1>You're willing to die in that.</v>

436
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:56.120
<v Speaker 1>It might give them a free seminar.</v>

437
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

438

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

441
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.850
<v Speaker 1>especially if the bell torque gives them the right matchup.</v>

442
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:03.591
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you though?</v>

443

<v Speaker 1>He wrestled and wrestled four or five years growing up.</v>

446
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.460
<v Speaker 1>There's some good fights on this card.</v>

447
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nelson versus Mirko Cro cop.</v>

455
00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:29.480

<v Speaker 1>but do you believe their testing?</v>

457
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.210
<v Speaker 1>When I hear a bell tars testing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know I'm super suspicious.</v>

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Super sororities</v>

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 2>that those weren't fake.</v>

539
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:43.721
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

540
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:43.931
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

541
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:44.141
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

542
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 2>And that's not what I mean.</v>

543
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.091
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I mean.</v>

544
00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:47.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean steroids,</v>

545
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean performance enhancing drugs.</v>

546
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're looking at a different human.</v>

547
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.481
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm thinking.</v>

548
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

549
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.513
<v Speaker 2>It comes in the state,</v>

550
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Speaker 2>aren't you guys just saying Bella tour?</v>

551
00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Don't really check with joking around or they do some check in.</v>

552
00:12:58.751 --> 00:13:00.510
<v Speaker 2>They do have state athletic commission,</v>

553
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.001
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>

554
00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:01.900
<v Speaker 2>We know that date.</v>

555
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Well then within Japan,</v>

556
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Japan was encouraging 100% you know,</v>

557
00:13:06.581 --> 00:13:09.340
<v Speaker 2>and who knows who was doing what and who wasn't doing what.</v>

558
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 2>But when you talk to the guys who were over there like ants and anyway,</v>

559
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.360
<v Speaker 2>and he'll tell you they had it in capital letters in the contract,</v>

560
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.660
<v Speaker 2>we will not test you for steroids.</v>

561
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:24.850
<v Speaker 2>And then you look at Vander Lee when he weighed two 18 when he fought cro cop,</v>

562
00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:27.310
<v Speaker 2>he was heavier than cro cop when he fought cro cop.</v>

563
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is just fucking bananas.</v>

564
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:30.881
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at that,</v>

565
00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:31.031
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

566
00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:33.570
<v Speaker 2>you cannot say that about the UFC till you saw that came in.</v>

567
00:13:33.571 --> 00:13:34.404
<v Speaker 2>You definitely can.</v>

568
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.590
<v Speaker 2>You definitely can.</v>

569
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.090
<v Speaker 2>But you can.</v>

570
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Up until the point I think it's a hair less because they cannot test days.</v>

571
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.600
<v Speaker 2>The courage to not TRT days.</v>

572
00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:46.090
<v Speaker 2>You're right about TRT days like Trt v tour,</v>

573
00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:47.950
<v Speaker 2>we always ran yard that was leak.</v>

574
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:48.720
<v Speaker 2>All those boys.</v>

575
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

576
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.650
<v Speaker 2>The guys who were on TRT,</v>

577
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:52.740
<v Speaker 2>including Frank Frank was on TRT for awhile.</v>

578
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.020
<v Speaker 2>They were telling fighters to go up a weight class.</v>

579
00:13:55.021 --> 00:13:55.241
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

580
00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:55.660
<v Speaker 2>you don't want it.</v>

581
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:56.493
<v Speaker 2>You need to go up.</v>

582
00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

583
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.970
<v Speaker 2>they were also telling fighters that will let you win.</v>

584
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.051
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

585
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:02.884

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.910

00:16:46.221 --> 00:16:47.054
<v Speaker 2>wild west.</v>

703
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:55.250
<v Speaker 2>he was winning the fight.</v>

704
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.870
<v Speaker 2>He was whooping his ass through a flying knee.</v>

705
00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:57.421
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

706
00:16:57.421 --> 00:16:59.420
<v Speaker 2>he was dealing with them in the standup,</v>

707
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.600
<v Speaker 2>and then he did something real stupid and he got clipped with a haymaker.</v>

708
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.390
<v Speaker 2>That was such a crazy knockout was such a cool,</v>

709
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.440
<v Speaker 2>cause I lost you front.</v>

710
00:17:06.441 --> 00:17:07.460
<v Speaker 2>Kicked him to the gut.</v>

711
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.840
<v Speaker 2>It was a box in the mob.</v>

712
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:09.591
<v Speaker 2>He looked good.</v>

713
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Our Lawsky look good,</v>

714
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.410
<v Speaker 2>but he did something really nutty.</v>

715
00:17:12.411 --> 00:17:13.010
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden,</v>

716
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.030
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

717
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:14.550
<v Speaker 2>bom.</v>

718
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.090
<v Speaker 2>So fader Tim Silva under Lawsky,</v>

719
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia fight was amazing.</v>

720
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:19.933
<v Speaker 2>That was amazing.</v>

721
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.080
<v Speaker 2>But he looked like fate or in that forever.</v>

722
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Like that was the,</v>

723
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.020
<v Speaker 2>and then the strike force.</v>

724
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Then you got a lead XC,</v>

725
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:25.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

726
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.870
<v Speaker 2>And you got Brett Rodgers,</v>

727
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson for doom.</v>

728
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:29.991
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

729
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:30.080
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

730
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:30.580
<v Speaker 2>was it a lead?</v>

731
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.820
<v Speaker 2>XC was in a,</v>

732
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.440
<v Speaker 2>was it an aliyah?</v>

733
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.530
<v Speaker 2>I see when he fought.</v>

734
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

737
00:17:36.491 --> 00:17:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>

738
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:37.773
<v Speaker 2>Strikeforce.</v>

739
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 2>I think elite x was just Kimbo.</v>

740
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.053
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

741
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:45.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Fred Rogers was the lead Xc Miko and crazy.</v>

742
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:47.540
<v Speaker 2>You think you're going crazy because remember,</v>

743
00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:48.370
<v Speaker 2>strike force,</v>

744
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:48.541
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

745
00:17:48.541 --> 00:17:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Brett Rogers thought Overeem when Overeem was ubering,</v>

746
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.200
<v Speaker 2>maneuver him.</v>

747
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Fuck hit him.</v>

748
00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.170
<v Speaker 2>He didn't just,</v>

749
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 2>he hit him with a leg kick like 15,</v>

750
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.650
<v Speaker 2>20 seconds into the fight.</v>

751
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.970
<v Speaker 2>One of those studding Hollins style leg kicks and AC breaded Roger's face.</v>

752
00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

753
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

754
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.063
<v Speaker 2>that's not a snowflake.</v>

755
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:05.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

756
00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.500
<v Speaker 2>but Overeem hit him with some tech.</v>

757
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.540
<v Speaker 2>Nick hit him at that real technique that that's why the argument for Steve Bay</v>

758
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 2>being the best heavyweight of all time is legit argument cause he's fought</v>

759
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:17.250
<v Speaker 2>clean.</v>

760
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 2>He's never been,</v>

761
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

762
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.320
<v Speaker 2>it's my,</v>

763
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.700
<v Speaker 2>well he's defended the most,</v>

764
00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:21.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

765
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.291
<v Speaker 2>the UFC title,</v>

766
00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:25.880
<v Speaker 2>which is the hardest title to defend in terms of like historically no one's</v>

767
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.090
<v Speaker 2>defended it more than him.</v>

768
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.320
<v Speaker 2>He defended it three times.</v>

769
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Nobody else out beat too.</v>

770
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.350
<v Speaker 2>The only issue with that,</v>

771
00:18:31.351 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 2>if you want to argue against the Bin,</v>

772
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:33.421
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

773
00:18:33.421 --> 00:18:35.130
<v Speaker 2>I think he's the best of all time hemmer cane.</v>

774
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.600
<v Speaker 2>But if you want argue that you're going to say,</v>

775
00:18:36.601 --> 00:18:38.520
<v Speaker 2>well the guy's he's beat aren't in their prime.</v>

776
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.870
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

777
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:40.853
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

778
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.060
<v Speaker 2>I think that's true.</v>

779
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.340
<v Speaker 2>What does a Scientology network,</v>

780
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.110
<v Speaker 2>what curious.</v>

781
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:46.980
<v Speaker 2>I just started everything.</v>

782
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out of here and there are,</v>

783
00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.610
<v Speaker 2>they're advertising it on paramount.</v>

784
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Holy curious.</v>

785
00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a pub?</v>

786
00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Despots paramount.</v>

787
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Well they might be paid.</v>

788
00:18:55.911 --> 00:18:56.340
<v Speaker 2>They got,</v>

789
00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:56.940

790
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Whose money or drive by Scientology building.</v>

791
00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.230

792
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

793
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.680
<v Speaker 2>I got the test.</v>

794
00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I want it in there.</v>

795
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.410
<v Speaker 2>I got the test.</v>

796
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I went to one of those things that you did.</v>

797
00:19:06.001 --> 00:19:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I held the cans.</v>

798
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:07.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

799
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.440
<v Speaker 2>I was a film and a TV show for CBS and we were outside in San Diego and a while</v>

800
00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:13.860
<v Speaker 2>we had some downtime.</v>

801
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.700
<v Speaker 2>They had this thing set up like a stress test and you go and you hold onto these</v>

802
00:19:17.701 --> 00:19:19.260
<v Speaker 2>cans and ask your questions.</v>

803
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.170
<v Speaker 2>I think I want to say Brian did stand up in there,</v>

804
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.760
<v Speaker 2>so one asks me to go up there and do,</v>

805
00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.930
<v Speaker 2>I either did stand up or like a Ted talk or some shit in Scientology building</v>

806
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.361
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

807
00:19:28.361 --> 00:19:29.790
<v Speaker 2>And he did something weird to talk.</v>

808
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:30.601
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

809
00:19:30.601 --> 00:19:31.470
<v Speaker 2>he was taken,</v>

810
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:36.710
<v Speaker 2>he was taken acting lessons with a guy who was a rabid scientologist and then I</v>

811
00:19:37.681 --> 00:19:42.681
<v Speaker 2>went to see Brian's acting teachers sing songs from musicals,</v>

812
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:45.780
<v Speaker 2>not even a musical,</v>

813
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.230
<v Speaker 2>just the songs from the musical seconds.</v>

814
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

815
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.210
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing.</v>

816
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.021
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

817
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Me and Brian were high.</v>

818
00:19:53.501 --> 00:19:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Is Jesus on the space shuttle?</v>

819
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean we were gone.</v>

820
00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.800
<v Speaker 2>We were hugging each other.</v>

821
00:19:58.801 --> 00:19:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Why it was going on.</v>

822
00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:01.710
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't believe how ridiculous it was.</v>

823
00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Like oh,</v>

824
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.990
<v Speaker 2>he either did like a motivational talk or stand up there though.</v>

825
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Well he was,</v>

826
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:08.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

827
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.070
<v Speaker 2>which is a thing about acting classes.</v>

828
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.200
<v Speaker 2>A lot of my ex girlfriend,</v>

829
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:17.010
<v Speaker 2>one of her acting classes when I first moved to La and I started dating,</v>

830
00:20:17.011 --> 00:20:18.030
<v Speaker 2>this chick was an actress.</v>

831
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:22.590
<v Speaker 2>Her acting class was assigned technology based act in class and apparently it's</v>

832
00:20:22.591 --> 00:20:23.550
<v Speaker 2>really common.</v>

833
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.301
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot,</v>

834
00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Speaker 2>or at least it was at the time.</v>

835
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.770
<v Speaker 2>They get kind of up with everything coming out with that.</v>

836
00:20:28.771 --> 00:20:30.270
<v Speaker 2>Leah Ramy or whatever her name is.</v>

837
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Leah Remini.</v>

838
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:30.931

<v Speaker 2>Watch it again.</v>

952
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Play it again.</v>

953
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's no rope and he makes that this is the rope kind of</v>

954
00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:27.280
<v Speaker 2>holding back the rubs.</v>

955
00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:28.114
<v Speaker 2>Carrying them.</v>

956
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:28.361
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

957
00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:29.490
<v Speaker 2>so the rubs assisting him.</v>

958
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

959
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.040
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

960
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:30.221
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

961
00:23:30.221 --> 00:23:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Let me see.</v>

962
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:30.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

963
00:23:30.881 --> 00:23:31.714
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

964
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.430
<v Speaker 2>Look like the rope was behind him.</v>

965
00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

966
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I thought the rope was just to catch him cautionary because the rope,</v>

967
00:23:39.311 --> 00:23:41.680
<v Speaker 2>like that's a weird thing that the rope is assisting him.</v>

968
00:23:41.681 --> 00:23:41.891
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

969
00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:42.191
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

970
00:23:42.191 --> 00:23:43.540
<v Speaker 2>how do you even plan that?</v>

971
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:44.591
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of cool.</v>

972
00:23:44.591 --> 00:23:45.730
<v Speaker 2>The real kind of catapult,</v>

973
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.720
<v Speaker 2>maybe assistant system behind the rubs behind him.</v>

974
00:23:49.721 --> 00:23:50.570
<v Speaker 2>No rope is not helping.</v>

975
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

976
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.733
<v Speaker 2>and there's one above.</v>

977
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:52.873
<v Speaker 2>There's two.</v>

978
00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

979
00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

980
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.040
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

981
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

982
00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:55.751
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

983
00:23:55.751 --> 00:23:55.901
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

984
00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:56.091
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

985
00:23:56.091 --> 00:23:56.561
<v Speaker 2>That's what it catches.</v>

986
00:23:56.561 --> 00:23:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Mysteries and fall all the way down and die.</v>

987
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

988
00:23:58.550 --> 00:23:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what it's for.</v>

989
00:23:59.601 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 2>That's what my point was.</v>

990
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I still think he has a little bit of likability.</v>

991
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Achilles tendon tore off.</v>

992
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

993
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.310
<v Speaker 2>That looks like the ropes carrying him.</v>

994
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.490
<v Speaker 2>I bet he has drugs that we don't even know about fixing it.</v>

995
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:13.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

996
00:24:13.671 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Speaker 2>they get that from Mars.</v>

997
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Get that shit from they,</v>

999
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 2>they pull it out of the fake rocks that they pull out a Mars.</v>

1000
00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:19.791
<v Speaker 2>Here's another one.</v>

1001
00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:20.081
<v Speaker 2>Let me see.</v>

1002
00:24:20.081 --> 00:24:21.560
<v Speaker 2>The other ones hung on the side of the plane.</v>

1003
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:22.603
<v Speaker 2>Well that's fun.</v>

1004
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.980
<v Speaker 2>And as he attached with a rope to yeah,</v>

1005
00:24:24.981 --> 00:24:25.431
<v Speaker 2>a little bit,</v>

1006
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:28.640
<v Speaker 2>but still felt like shit.</v>

1007
00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:30.620
<v Speaker 2>He still really gets taken off.</v>

1008
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:31.850
<v Speaker 2>He's hanging there.</v>

1009
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:32.750
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>

1010

1017
00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1018
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.150
<v Speaker 2>when I hurt my shoulder and I started hanging,</v>

00:24:53.361 --> 00:24:55.370
<v Speaker 2>but I can't hold on for more than like two minutes.</v>

1026
00:24:55.371 --> 00:24:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Something you have to condition for sure.</v>

1027
00:24:57.471 --> 00:24:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Really conditioned the shit out of yourself.</v>

00:25:56.691 --> 00:25:57.524
<v Speaker 2>Is that his name</v>

1075
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.033
<v Speaker 2>to say Jane?</v>

1076
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1077
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:01.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1078
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Did you see Roy McDonald ask him about Astra to sign with Delta?</v>

1079
00:26:06.321 --> 00:26:07.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1080
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.400
<v Speaker 2>And Ben asked her wants to do it to</v>

1081
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Ben asked her and still owes fights with one fc though.</v>

1082
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.970
<v Speaker 2>So they would have to do some sort of a contract with him.</v>

1083
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:17.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1084
00:26:17.241 --> 00:26:18.410
<v Speaker 2>He owes two fights.</v>

1085
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:19.640
<v Speaker 2>He goes two fights.</v>

1086
00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:20.450
<v Speaker 2>One MFC.</v>

1087
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.820
<v Speaker 2>I know you're listing do us all a solid,</v>

1088
00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:24.140
<v Speaker 2>do all the hardcores assault,</v>

1089
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.060
<v Speaker 2>let them out.</v>

1090
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.750
<v Speaker 2>And so he had never going to let them out.</v>

1091
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.590
<v Speaker 2>What they would do is they would cope promote and it's possible you're not,</v>

1092
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.730
<v Speaker 2>if he wants to fight in the UFC,</v>

1093
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:32.510
<v Speaker 2>it's possible.</v>

1094
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.343
<v Speaker 2>Oh hell.</v>

1095
00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Co-Promote with one FC,</v>

1096
00:26:34.581 --> 00:26:35.271
<v Speaker 2>you would have to,</v>

1097
00:26:35.271 --> 00:26:39.470
<v Speaker 2>it would have to be favorable conditions with the UFC where like they just,</v>

1098
00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1099
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.680
<v Speaker 2>you can make some sort of a deal with one of seeking stream at assumption.</v>

1100
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.840
<v Speaker 2>They would have to be something or they get them a piece of the revenue,</v>

1101
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.700
<v Speaker 2>but it would have to be a very small,</v>

1102
00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:51.920
<v Speaker 2>the odds are already against them.</v>

1103
00:26:51.921 --> 00:26:52.830
<v Speaker 2>The sign with the assignment,</v>

1104
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I know you gotta make this deal with one FC and Dana is my kick rocks.</v>

1105
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.340
<v Speaker 2>He should do is he should get out of that contract.</v>

1106
00:26:59.341 --> 00:26:59.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what he did.</v>

1107
00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Just smoked two dude's real fast.</v>

00:27:52.291 --> 00:27:55.920
<v Speaker 2>there's a big gap between Ben Asker in Standup at GSP,</v>

1140
00:27:55.921 --> 00:27:58.380
<v Speaker 2>so this isn't a big gap between Ben astrons grappling.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:14.850
<v Speaker 2>GSP and aspirin.</v>

1152
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Big Gap.</v>

1153
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:16.283
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1154
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.280
<v Speaker 2>If they wrestled,</v>

1155
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.113
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

1156
00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1157
00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:20.820
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] out.</v>

1158
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.391
<v Speaker 2>Good Woodley.</v>

1159
00:28:21.391 --> 00:28:26.391
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Woodley like GSP has more takedowns in UFC history.</v>

1160
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.100
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

1161
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I never had a guide at the level of aspirin when it comes to wrestling,</v>

1162
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.210
<v Speaker 2>he's a black belt in Jiu Jitsu.</v>

1163
00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:33.660
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1164
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:34.230
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1165
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.220
<v Speaker 2>If it gets to the ground,</v>

1166
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.280
<v Speaker 2>the best,</v>

1167
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.600
<v Speaker 2>the best guy he fought as far as wrestling credentials,</v>

1168
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:41.280
<v Speaker 2>who probably Josh Koscheck my,</v>

1169
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:41.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1170
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.310
<v Speaker 2>My thought would be that GSP would never let,</v>

1171
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:46.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1172
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:47.850
<v Speaker 2>he's doubled up to,</v>

1173
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:48.250
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1174
00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.580
<v Speaker 2>this dude's in trouble.</v>

1175
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.020
<v Speaker 2>That's dudes in trouble.</v>

1176
00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:58.130
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy how leg locks are now making their way much more prominently in in</v>

1177
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.880
<v Speaker 2>MMA now you've seen much more leg lock action unless you're focused on it.</v>

1178
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:03.361
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

1179
00:29:03.361 --> 00:29:03.661
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1180
00:29:03.661 --> 00:29:04.494
<v Speaker 2>you're fighting.</v>

1181
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Dylan Dannis would have six weeks to get ready for that.</v>

1182
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.600
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to learn the lace lock games.</v>

1183
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:09.443
<v Speaker 2>That fear.</v>

1184
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.850
<v Speaker 2>There's no way to know.</v>

1185
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.370
<v Speaker 2>He got just can't get down against a high level leg locker.</v>

1186
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.910
<v Speaker 2>It's going to take you four years to catch him.</v>

1187
00:29:14.911 --> 00:29:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1188
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:16.080
<v Speaker 2>These guys,</v>

1189
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.070
<v Speaker 2>they're so far behind.</v>

1190
00:29:17.071 --> 00:29:17.281
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1191
00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:17.821
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Dylan.</v>

1192
00:29:17.821 --> 00:29:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Dance leg locked.</v>

1193
00:29:19.221 --> 00:29:19.860
<v Speaker 2>There's two ways.</v>

1194
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:20.693
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

1195
00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1196
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:23.220
<v Speaker 2>he's doing the right thing.</v>

1197
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1198
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.770
<v Speaker 2>but his both legs are tied up.</v>

1199
00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:25.921
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1200
00:29:25.921 --> 00:29:27.390
<v Speaker 2>He's so stuck.</v>

1201
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:29.730
<v Speaker 2>That's such a gross feeling.</v>

1202
00:29:29.731 --> 00:29:30.780
<v Speaker 2>You can do it in two years.</v>

1203
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:32.670
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be four years average,</v>

1204
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.013
<v Speaker 2>two years if you're with,</v>

1205
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.550
<v Speaker 2>if you're with a good coach.</v>

1206
00:29:35.551 --> 00:29:37.380
<v Speaker 2>And I try to battle someone at like,</v>

1207
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.640
<v Speaker 2>you know Henzel Gracie guy leg lock level,</v>

1208
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:46.420
<v Speaker 3>it's going to take you at least two years to to stalemate and least and he got</v>

1209
00:29:46.421 --> 00:29:47.820
<v Speaker 3>to be trained on every got out.</v>

1210
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:48.071
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1211
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:49.660
<v Speaker 3>You got to post guys guys aren't doing that.</v>

1212
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:53.350
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing with them and may is a generally in MMA leg locks were</v>

1214
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:53.981
<v Speaker 3>thought of as a,</v>

1215
00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:54.340
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

1216
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.001
<v Speaker 3>as a technique.</v>

1217
00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:58.570
<v Speaker 3>You don't really ever need to even focus on cause it just an MMA,</v>

1218
00:29:58.571 --> 00:30:02.000
<v Speaker 3>there were too many people have gotten knocked out going for leg lock.</v>

1219
00:30:02.001 --> 00:30:05.560
<v Speaker 3>So the general consensus is don't really worry about leg locks and MMA.</v>

1220
00:30:05.561 --> 00:30:06.940
<v Speaker 3>They're too dangerous anyways,</v>

1221
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.710
<v Speaker 3>but there are um,</v>

1222
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 3>there you can't get knocked out.</v>

1223
00:30:11.111 --> 00:30:11.831
<v Speaker 3>It is dangerous.</v>

1224
00:30:11.831 --> 00:30:12.281
<v Speaker 3>And in my,</v>

1225
00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:13.240
<v Speaker 3>but they still work.</v>

1226
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:18.270
<v Speaker 3>You just got to know which leg locked positions are the safest and nothing else</v>

1227
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:19.234
<v Speaker 3>is working out.</v>

1228
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.650
<v Speaker 3>If you can't take the guy down,</v>

1229
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.550
<v Speaker 3>he's beating your ass and it's the third round you lost the first two rounds is</v>

1230
00:30:24.551 --> 00:30:27.310
<v Speaker 3>the last round that you know going for a heel hook.</v>

1231
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.940
<v Speaker 3>It might be a great idea and if you practice them and if you're good at them,</v>

1232
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.160
<v Speaker 3>you have hope in that last round.</v>

1233
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:34.203
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1234
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.660
<v Speaker 3>Don't necessarily go for leg locks right away because it is risky.</v>

1235
00:30:37.661 --> 00:30:40.480
<v Speaker 3>See if you could take them down first so you can get on top and passed his</v>

1236
00:30:40.481 --> 00:30:40.740
<v Speaker 3>guard.</v>

1237
00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:41.710
<v Speaker 3>See if he can get his back.</v>

1238
00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.390
<v Speaker 3>If you can't and it's too dangerous,</v>

1239
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.960
<v Speaker 3>then at some point your coaches and you,</v>

1240
00:30:45.961 --> 00:30:46.721
<v Speaker 3>you got to decide,</v>

1241
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:47.290
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1242
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.060
<v Speaker 3>it's time to go to plan B.</v>

1243
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.820
<v Speaker 3>Plan C and leg locks should always be the last resort.</v>

1244
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:53.110
<v Speaker 3>You know to remember Marco,</v>

1245
00:30:53.111 --> 00:30:54.370
<v Speaker 3>who else against Gary Goodrich?</v>

1246
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Gary Goodrich was beaten his ass the whole fight.</v>

1247
00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.110
<v Speaker 3>Last 45 seconds.</v>

1248
00:30:59.111 --> 00:30:59.430
<v Speaker 3>Marco,</v>

1249
00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:00.610
<v Speaker 3>who was pulled out a heel hook.</v>

1250
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.410
<v Speaker 3>That's what we used to call them member.</v>

1251
00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:03.080
<v Speaker 3>I called Mary.</v>

1252
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.600
<v Speaker 3>Who else looks well?</v>

1253
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:07.300
<v Speaker 3>That's what we used to call heel hooks.</v>

1254
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Hail Mary Helix,</v>

1255
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.251
<v Speaker 3>the last resort.</v>

1256
00:31:09.251 --> 00:31:10.084
<v Speaker 3>It was last resort.</v>

1257
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:13.360
<v Speaker 3>Paul Harvey's Kinda was the one that really made it famous for a while,</v>

1258
00:31:13.361 --> 00:31:14.460
<v Speaker 3>but then he was getting fucked up.</v>

1259
00:31:14.461 --> 00:31:15.370
<v Speaker 3>When you thought Allen belts,</v>

1260
00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:16.860
<v Speaker 3>black belts,</v>

1261
00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.261
<v Speaker 3>it was just like,</v>

1262
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:19.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna sit down on this and just punch you in the food.</v>

1263
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.250
<v Speaker 3>You're really prepared for that.</v>

1264
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.061
<v Speaker 3>He's also a black,</v>

1265
00:31:22.061 --> 00:31:24.280
<v Speaker 3>when you get to the point with your leg locks where you can,</v>

1266
00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.680
<v Speaker 3>when you've been in the fire for a couple of years,</v>

1267
00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:26.870
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

1268
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:27.703
<v Speaker 3>three or four years,</v>

1269
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.580
<v Speaker 3>and you're really good at leg locks and you're going against someone else at</v>

1270
00:31:30.581 --> 00:31:31.414
<v Speaker 3>that same level,</v>

1271
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.340
<v Speaker 3>leg locks probably are,</v>

1272
00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.950
<v Speaker 3>aren't going to be the deciding factor in that fight.</v>

1273
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:37.030
<v Speaker 3>They're going to nullify so,</v>

1274
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:40.480
<v Speaker 3>and then if you're going against a guy who's really good at defending and he has</v>

1275
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:41.860
<v Speaker 3>good wrestling and good punches,</v>

1276
00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:42.610
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

1277
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:43.180
<v Speaker 3>that's your mind.</v>

1278
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:43.990
<v Speaker 3>You might stay,</v>

1279
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:45.720
<v Speaker 3>you might want to stay away from leg locks.</v>

1280
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1281
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:46.863
<v Speaker 3>it all depends.</v>

1282
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.560
<v Speaker 3>It's the Matcha who did Belcher bring in for his leg lock training because he</v>

1283
00:31:50.561 --> 00:31:53.440
<v Speaker 3>brought in someone really dobby Ramos and dean lister,</v>

1284
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.470
<v Speaker 3>Dean listers who brought him in and had a,</v>

1285
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.341
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1286
00:31:57.341 --> 00:31:59.200
<v Speaker 3>he said it was just two months,</v>

1287
00:31:59.201 --> 00:31:59.711
<v Speaker 3>one month,</v>

1288
00:31:59.711 --> 00:32:01.180
<v Speaker 3>two months of every day.</v>

1289
00:32:01.181 --> 00:32:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Them attacking his legs and that's all in,</v>

1290
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.083
<v Speaker 3>that's all I needed.</v>

1291
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.013
<v Speaker 3>You Know</v>

1292
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.070
<v Speaker 3>Dobby Ramos is fighting 55 in the UFC,</v>

1293
00:32:09.071 --> 00:32:09.610
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1294
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:10.420
<v Speaker 3>isn't he?</v>

1295
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:11.253
<v Speaker 3>I believe he's funny things.</v>

1296
00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.093
<v Speaker 3>So five,</v>

1297
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.220
<v Speaker 3>that's a bad motherfucker,</v>

1298
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1299
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.333
<v Speaker 3>That motherfucker,</v>

1300
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.020
<v Speaker 3>his Jujitsu is top of the food chain.</v>

1301
00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:17.921
<v Speaker 3>Abu Dhabi.</v>

1302
00:32:17.921 --> 00:32:22.921
<v Speaker 3>In 2015 he had a sick flying arm bar and one of his matches that were tourists</v>

1303
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:24.791
<v Speaker 3>just fell down.</v>

1304
00:32:24.791 --> 00:32:26.950
<v Speaker 3>It makes me think that his knee might be jacked</v>

1305
00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:28.721
<v Speaker 3>isn't,</v>

1306
00:32:28.721 --> 00:32:28.811
<v Speaker 3>he?</v>

1307
00:32:28.811 --> 00:32:29.740
<v Speaker 3>Might be a little shaky.</v>

1308
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.020
<v Speaker 3>He looked like wobbly.</v>

1309
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:32.921
<v Speaker 3>He fell down.</v>

1310
00:32:32.921 --> 00:32:33.551
<v Speaker 3>It looked weird.</v>

1311
00:32:33.551 --> 00:32:35.110
<v Speaker 3>Bill tour ratings have been rough.</v>

1312
00:32:35.111 --> 00:32:35.850
<v Speaker 3>Rough lately.</v>

1313
00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:36.611

<v Speaker 3>rough,</v>

1315
00:32:36.881 --> 00:32:38.110
<v Speaker 3>so hopefully this one's better.</v>

1316
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.320
<v Speaker 3>It's good for general.</v>

1317
00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:40.940
<v Speaker 2>You know when,</v>

1318
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.820
<v Speaker 2>when bell toy and then UFC is doing good for MMA in general.</v>

1319
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:44.480
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

1320
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Well for MMA in general,</v>

1321
00:32:46.611 --> 00:32:48.110
<v Speaker 2>we need big cards.</v>

1322
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:48.441
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1323
00:32:48.441 --> 00:32:53.390
<v Speaker 2>it really needs to get more people watching and these are entertaining fights</v>

1324
00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.820
<v Speaker 2>and there's no reason why more people shouldn't be watching.</v>

1325
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:59.690
<v Speaker 2>I think they got a real problem with her name and was just said this forever.</v>

1326
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.070
<v Speaker 2>The name is stupid,</v>

1327
00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.050
<v Speaker 2>but even that's a nice c,</v>

1328
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.070
<v Speaker 2>which is a great name.</v>

1329
00:33:04.071 --> 00:33:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Their rating suck too.</v>

1330
00:33:05.211 --> 00:33:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>

1331
00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the name matters.</v>

1332
00:33:08.361 --> 00:33:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it matters at all.</v>

1333
00:33:09.441 --> 00:33:11.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it matters it with bands and music.</v>

00:36:03.691 --> 00:36:04.830
<v Speaker 1>but I'm all set on what?</v>

1460
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:05.551
<v Speaker 1>He's got.</v>

1461
00:36:05.551 --> 00:36:06.210
<v Speaker 1>The clamp.</v>

1462
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:06.331
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1463
00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:07.081
<v Speaker 1>you're screwed man.</v>

1464
00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:07.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1465
00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:08.100
<v Speaker 1>that's a tight one,</v>

1466
00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:08.934
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

1467
00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.550
<v Speaker 1>You see how he manipulates those legs?</v>

1468
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:12.900
<v Speaker 1>That guy's done that too.</v>

1469
00:36:12.901 --> 00:36:14.670
<v Speaker 1>A lot of fucking people when this point.</v>

1470
00:36:14.671 --> 00:36:15.001
<v Speaker 1>He could've,</v>

1471
00:36:15.001 --> 00:36:15.510
<v Speaker 1>he could've,</v>

1472
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:19.020
<v Speaker 1>he could've defended right here if you would have just brought us a legs up and</v>

1473
00:36:19.021 --> 00:36:20.910
<v Speaker 1>hooked his own left leg and turn away.</v>

1474
00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1475
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.200
<v Speaker 1>He could've just went like this.</v>

1476
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:23.323
<v Speaker 1>Just to annoy you.</v>

1477
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.190
<v Speaker 1>When guys do that though.</v>

1478
00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:27.120
<v Speaker 1>You go to the,</v>

1479
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.073
<v Speaker 1>you have to go to the bank.</v>

1480
00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1481
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:29.150
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1482
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.200
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to do that before he grabs you.</v>

1483
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 1>But when a guy grabs his legs,</v>

1484
00:36:32.491 --> 00:36:34.050
<v Speaker 1>do you still go to the impaler?</v>

1485
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:36.563
<v Speaker 1>I've seen you.</v>

1486
00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.233
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1487
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 1>I rarely do an arm triangle.</v>

1488
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Not Mounted.</v>

1489
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Rarely I stay in them out.</v>

1490
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Why do you stay in the mountain on one side your side?</v>

1491
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Because that one defense I was just telling you,</v>

1492
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.170
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it from the mind that stops all arm triangles.</v>

1493
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.920
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1494
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you're forced to go to another submission,</v>

1495
00:36:54.601 --> 00:36:55.860
<v Speaker 1>which you're forced to take the back.</v>

1496
00:36:55.861 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of give up your back.</v>

1497
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.640
<v Speaker 1>But the guy who was about to get top wins,</v>

1498
00:36:59.641 --> 00:37:01.950
<v Speaker 1>he gets another chance guys on your back.</v>

1499
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 1>But that choke was in deep.</v>

1500
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.800
<v Speaker 1>When you um,</v>

1501
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.670
<v Speaker 1>when you tap a guy from the mount or when you go to the arm triangle from the</v>

1502
00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:08.523
<v Speaker 1>mount,</v>

1503
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.500
<v Speaker 1>what percentage of effectiveness do you think it is in comparison to go on?</v>

1504
00:37:12.501 --> 00:37:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1505
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.920
<v Speaker 1>like a clock,</v>

1506
00:37:13.921 --> 00:37:14.850
<v Speaker 1>like fully out.</v>

1507
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.710
<v Speaker 1>You May,</v>

1508
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:19.170
<v Speaker 1>there may be some added Torque and the twist,</v>

1509
00:37:19.171 --> 00:37:20.340
<v Speaker 1>but if you go butter mount,</v>

1510
00:37:20.341 --> 00:37:22.920
<v Speaker 1>which is putting your butterflies on top and you extend,</v>

1511
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.023
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

1512
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:24.931
<v Speaker 1>you don't need it,</v>

1513
00:37:24.931 --> 00:37:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to get on the side.</v>

1514
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:26.491
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

1515
00:37:26.491 --> 00:37:29.010
<v Speaker 1>is it just a new movement that you have to master?</v>

1516
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Well it all depends,</v>

1517
00:37:30.361 --> 00:37:30.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1518
00:37:30.601 --> 00:37:30.851
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

1519
00:37:30.851 --> 00:37:31.591
<v Speaker 1>on your opponent,</v>

1520
00:37:31.591 --> 00:37:32.910
<v Speaker 1>if he knows this defense,</v>

1521
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.170
<v Speaker 1>someone puts you in a arm triangle.</v>

1522
00:37:34.171 --> 00:37:35.004
<v Speaker 1>Like this is caught,</v>

1523
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I would all have to do is just bring this leg up.</v>

1524
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Like dude,</v>

1525
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:41.430
<v Speaker 1>get inverted and Gopro and there's no way you're going to tap.</v>

1526
00:37:41.431 --> 00:37:42.300
<v Speaker 1>See this is a thing.</v>

1527
00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:47.130
<v Speaker 1>I've seen you separate guy's legs when you were really into the impaler and I</v>

1528
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:49.440
<v Speaker 1>know I've done it to guys that aren't very good,</v>

1529
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:53.850
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen you when you were really into the impaler for awhile.</v>

1530
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.840
<v Speaker 1>No one did that though.</v>

1531
00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.693
<v Speaker 1>The inhaler being,</v>

1532
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.491
<v Speaker 1>do you know when dibs?</v>

1533
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:57.570
<v Speaker 1>No one did the defense?</v>

1534
00:37:57.571 --> 00:37:58.404
<v Speaker 1>The defense is,</v>

1535
00:37:58.700 --> 00:37:59.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1536
00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:00.450
<v Speaker 1>the defense of grabbing your leg.</v>

1537
00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Nobody did that and not back in the day because everybody was laying down the</v>

1538
00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:06.810
<v Speaker 1>way he did the arm triangle where he's like laying inside control flat on his</v>

1539
00:38:06.811 --> 00:38:07.290
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1540
00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.450
<v Speaker 1>You obviously works.</v>

1541
00:38:09.451 --> 00:38:10.284
<v Speaker 1>People are tapping,</v>

1542
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's easy to defend if the guy knew it.</v>

1543
00:38:13.921 --> 00:38:15.060
<v Speaker 1>If the guy sees it coming,</v>

1544
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.931
<v Speaker 1>it's like as soon as,</v>

1545
00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:17.340
<v Speaker 1>as soon as this arms in trouble,</v>

1546
00:38:17.341 --> 00:38:17.940
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

1547
00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:18.660
<v Speaker 1>You're right here.</v>

1548
00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:19.411
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting,</v>

1549
00:38:19.411 --> 00:38:22.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm confusing you with somebody else I had because I know,</v>

1550
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I know during your,</v>

1551
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.160
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1552
00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:29.970
<v Speaker 1>there was a whole run when a lot of us were into the impaler and then you also</v>

1553
00:38:29.971 --> 00:38:33.750
<v Speaker 1>started putting it down where you would put the Shin to the hip and really</v>

1554
00:38:33.751 --> 00:38:34.740
<v Speaker 1>stretch a guy out.</v>

1555
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.020
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1556
00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:36.930
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

1557
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.690
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1558
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Jesus said,</v>

1559
00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:39.083
<v Speaker 2>get that cut.</v>

1560
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.571
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

1561
00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Who's cut is that damn cage warriors earlier today?</v>

1562
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.501
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

1563
00:38:44.501 --> 00:38:45.281
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

1564
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:46.180
<v Speaker 2>That's an eyebrow.</v>

1565
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.060
<v Speaker 2>That's full iron t his skull.</v>

1566
00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:49.840
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1567
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.550
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the biggest I've ever seen.</v>

1568
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1569
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Cruz.</v>

1570
00:38:54.641 --> 00:38:58.210
<v Speaker 2>I remember arguing with somebody about it when someone was saying that,</v>

1571
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:59.103
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1572
00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.850
<v Speaker 2>you can't separate a guy's hands like that.</v>

1573
00:39:00.851 --> 00:39:01.031
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1574
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:02.830
<v Speaker 2>how long do you think you can hold your hands?</v>

1575
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.140
<v Speaker 2>We need Mattson here and now we do.</v>

1576
00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:06.330
<v Speaker 2>You can put Matt,</v>

1577
00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:06.860
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

1578
00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.571
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>

1579
00:39:07.571 --> 00:39:10.720
<v Speaker 2>I have new Matt's coming so we can do that right here.</v>

1580
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:14.890
<v Speaker 2>All you need is cameras that when he done straight the defense dot,</v>

1581
00:39:14.891 --> 00:39:16.240
<v Speaker 2>you could dive right in the middle of map.</v>

1582
00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:17.050
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1583
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.550
<v Speaker 2>because you don't know what we're talking about.</v>

1584
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.970
<v Speaker 2>We want to understand if you're going to have that,</v>

1585
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.510
<v Speaker 2>because there's new mats coming in because the mats a that I'm getting from</v>

1586
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:26.383
<v Speaker 2>Fuji,</v>

1587
00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.780
<v Speaker 2>the grappling ones are too slippery.</v>

1588
00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:29.441
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1589
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:29.910
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>

1590
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.210
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any texture to them.</v>

1591
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Zebra,</v>

1592
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:33.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting new zebras,</v>

1593
00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:34.970
<v Speaker 2>best I Z,</v>

1594
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:36.220
<v Speaker 2>but have zebra in my office</v>

1595
00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.220
<v Speaker 2>getting all new zebras.</v>

1596
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.700
<v Speaker 2>But Fuji makes a real good one with a texture for striking.</v>

1597
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.170
<v Speaker 2>So for kicking and stuff,</v>

1598
00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:45.430
<v Speaker 2>I need some texture.</v>

1599
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:46.420
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1600
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.440
<v Speaker 2>but on the ground it's fine.</v>

1601
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.830
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to take the ones from the ground and you need the texture for</v>

1602
00:39:50.831 --> 00:39:51.670
<v Speaker 2>passing too.</v>

1603
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:52.810
<v Speaker 2>If you get all sweaty,</v>

1604
00:39:52.811 --> 00:39:53.644
<v Speaker 2>you need the texture.</v>

1605
00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Because at the mats I have now no tabs,</v>

1606
00:39:56.131 --> 00:40:01.131
<v Speaker 2>nobody complains that they purchased slippers for wrestling cause the maths I</v>

1607
00:40:02.141 --> 00:40:04.810
<v Speaker 2>have met are made for wrestling shoes and wrestlers have shoes.</v>

1608
00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.813
<v Speaker 2>So it's not an issue.</v>

1609
00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:11.050
<v Speaker 2>When you're going barefoot and doing Jujitsu and it gets sweaty after like three</v>

1610
00:40:11.051 --> 00:40:11.920
<v Speaker 2>or four rounds,</v>

1611
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.450
<v Speaker 2>passing becomes impossible.</v>

1612
00:40:13.451 --> 00:40:14.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like passing on ice.</v>

1613
00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Is it hot in here?</v>

1614
00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:16.390
<v Speaker 2>So having a heart attack,</v>

1615
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.760
<v Speaker 2>cause it's harder than you guys are sweating to having a heart attack.</v>

1616
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:22.200
<v Speaker 2>But if you feel the zebras they're made,</v>

1617
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.490
<v Speaker 2>they're made for barefoot,</v>

1618
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1619
00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.050
<v Speaker 2>traction.</v>

1620
00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:28.500
<v Speaker 2>We've got a thermostat in here seeking glory.</v>

1621
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Hebrews is what they put in my,</v>

1622
00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:32.123
<v Speaker 2>my gym.</v>

1623
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.153
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1624
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.023
<v Speaker 2>my gym at home.</v>

1625
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1626
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.010
<v Speaker 2>But these out here,</v>

1627
00:40:36.011 --> 00:40:37.450
<v Speaker 2>the Fuji is the smooth ones.</v>

1628
00:40:37.451 --> 00:40:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1629
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for kicking.</v>

1630
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.571
<v Speaker 2>Like Gwen,</v>

1631
00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:41.171
<v Speaker 2>I'm kicking,</v>

1632
00:40:41.171 --> 00:40:42.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm slipping around a lot.</v>

1633
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:43.343
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't,</v>

1634
00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.910
<v Speaker 2>well for specially for spinning and I spin,</v>

1635
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:46.451
<v Speaker 2>I need,</v>

1636
00:40:46.451 --> 00:40:47.320
<v Speaker 2>I need traction.</v>

1637
00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:49.300
<v Speaker 2>I have to have something where I could push my foot off.</v>

1638
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.080
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1639
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.190
<v Speaker 2>like with round kicks,</v>

1640
00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:53.440
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of get away with it because of your foot slips.</v>

1641
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Your whole body's just kind of moving and we're kind of match.</v>

1642
00:40:55.901 --> 00:40:57.370
<v Speaker 2>You got to come in and you already got it all hooked up.</v>

1643
00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:57.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1644
00:40:57.581 --> 00:40:58.361
<v Speaker 2>It's already that they're out there.</v>

1645
00:40:58.361 --> 00:40:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I'll show him.</v>

1646
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1647
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.590
<v Speaker 2>The other Fujis full of she's,</v>

1648
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.860
<v Speaker 2>but they're tatami mats.</v>

1649
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:03.690
<v Speaker 2>So they have,</v>

1650
00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.470
<v Speaker 2>it's a pretty strong texture.</v>

1651
00:41:05.471 --> 00:41:06.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a strategy.</v>

1652
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Decide,</v>

1653
00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:06.650
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

1654
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:07.960
<v Speaker 2>Those were the over zebra.</v>

1655
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.533
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1656
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.983
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Pedro.</v>

1657
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1658
00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:11.641
<v Speaker 2>got you.</v>

1659
00:41:11.641 --> 00:41:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Me Pedro went over to there and uh,</v>

1660
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:14.620
<v Speaker 2>he did my first place.</v>

1661
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:14.911
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1662
00:41:14.911 --> 00:41:15.744
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1663
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:18.760
<v Speaker 2>Olympic judo master is a bad motherfucker.</v>

1664
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:20.800
<v Speaker 2>He did my other place and so,</v>

1665
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1666
00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:21.851
<v Speaker 2>when he moved there,</v>

1667
00:41:21.851 --> 00:41:22.810
<v Speaker 2>I just went with him there.</v>

1668
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1669
00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:24.580
<v Speaker 2>I liked him.</v>

1670
00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.460
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think they're the right thing for what I do.</v>

1671
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:32.110
<v Speaker 2>But the tatami ones with the heavy texture is perfect for kickboxing.</v>

1672
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:33.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean you really,</v>

1673
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.003
<v Speaker 2>I need,</v>

1674
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.690
<v Speaker 4>especially if I'm really sweaty and I'm throwing like spin kicks and shit like</v>

1675
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:38.841
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1676
00:41:38.841 --> 00:41:40.880
<v Speaker 4>I am not in the mood to blow my knee out.</v>

1677
00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:41.720
<v Speaker 4>A lot of wine.</v>

1678
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.730
<v Speaker 4>A lot of my students play the word blame.</v>

1679
00:41:43.731 --> 00:41:47.840
<v Speaker 4>The mats when they have a bad day and I'm sitting there and they're having a bad</v>

1680
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:47.841
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

1681
00:41:47.841 --> 00:41:49.160
<v Speaker 4>They're like these fucking maps.</v>

1682
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.063
<v Speaker 4>These maps,</v>

1683
00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:52.550
<v Speaker 4>they all get together in the corner.</v>

1684
00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:52.811
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1685
00:41:52.811 --> 00:41:53.301
<v Speaker 4>It's the maps,</v>

1686
00:41:53.301 --> 00:41:53.481
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1687
00:41:53.481 --> 00:41:54.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1688
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.030
<v Speaker 4>When are we getting new maps coach or shoes,</v>

1689
00:41:56.031 --> 00:41:56.864
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>

1690
00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.730
<v Speaker 4>Guilty too fucking mad brawls.</v>

1691
00:41:58.731 --> 00:41:59.660
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking Matt.</v>

1692
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:01.250
<v Speaker 4>They'd make fun of the HQ.</v>

1693
00:42:01.251 --> 00:42:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Matt.</v>

1694
00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.593
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

1695
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:03.973
<v Speaker 4>I used to,</v>

1696
00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:05.630
<v Speaker 4>but now no more.</v>

1697
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.020
<v Speaker 4>In two weeks I get new mats were everyone.</v>

1698
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.990
<v Speaker 4>I just had um,</v>

1699
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.860
<v Speaker 4>pads put down with a cloth strap,</v>

1700
00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.650
<v Speaker 4>a nylon top stretched across a member.</v>

1701
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:17.750
<v Speaker 4>We've got those dudes to do it.</v>

1702
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:18.291
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1703
00:42:18.291 --> 00:42:19.300
<v Speaker 4>Those atoms are switched.</v>

1704
00:42:19.301 --> 00:42:20.134
<v Speaker 4>We're done.</v>

1705
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:20.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1706
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:21.590
<v Speaker 4>Those can get slippery.</v>

1707
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:22.430
<v Speaker 4>Super slippery.</v>

1708
00:42:22.431 --> 00:42:23.450
<v Speaker 4>It was loose too.</v>

1709
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:23.991
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1710
00:42:23.991 --> 00:42:25.670
<v Speaker 4>the problem with that was it wasn't tight.</v>

1711
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
<v Speaker 4>So like remember the old headquarters for a Gracie Jujitsu in Torrance?</v>

1712
00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:32.720
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1713
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.280
<v Speaker 4>They had that massive floor.</v>

1714
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:35.583
<v Speaker 4>The green</v>

1715
00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:39.040
<v Speaker 4>tarp tighten up the top.</v>

1716
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.520
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what I had.</v>

1717
00:42:40.521 --> 00:42:41.120
<v Speaker 4>So it was like,</v>

1718
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.740
<v Speaker 4>it's never told so slippery.</v>

1719
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.633
<v Speaker 4>Never tight.</v>

1720
00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.260
<v Speaker 4>It's never really tight.</v>

1721
00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:46.581
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

1722
00:42:46.581 --> 00:42:49.910
<v Speaker 4>Am I crazy to think but baders the dark horse to win the heavyweight.</v>

1723
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.190
<v Speaker 4>He when it book Bader is still very,</v>

1724
00:42:52.191 --> 00:42:54.230
<v Speaker 4>very good and not the king.</v>

1725
00:42:54.231 --> 00:42:57.770
<v Speaker 4>Most non king mo can fucking punch and he at one point in time at least was a</v>

1726
00:42:57.771 --> 00:42:58.790
<v Speaker 4>world class wrestler.</v>

1727
00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 4>Chemo was a beast of a wrestler.</v>

1728
00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:02.310
<v Speaker 4>I still is fun.</v>

1729
00:43:02.311 --> 00:43:03.590
<v Speaker 4>One of the best I've ever seen.</v>

1730
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:04.371
<v Speaker 4>But he's,</v>

1731
00:43:04.371 --> 00:43:06.470
<v Speaker 4>he's had some injuries man and he had really,</v>

1732
00:43:06.471 --> 00:43:07.670
<v Speaker 4>really bad staff.</v>

1733
00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:08.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1734
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.760
<v Speaker 4>I think the staff got them at least twice.</v>

1735
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:11.270
<v Speaker 4>I want to,</v>

1736
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:12.350
<v Speaker 4>I know he got it once.</v>

1737
00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.570
<v Speaker 4>I want to say he got it twice real bad.</v>

1738
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.180
<v Speaker 4>He had a real bad staff like come on man.</v>

1739
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:20.630
<v Speaker 4>Baders probably at the top of his game right now is in his prime.</v>

1740
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:21.890
<v Speaker 4>When he beat Phil,</v>

1741
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.251
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1742
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:22.881
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1743
00:43:22.881 --> 00:43:25.870
<v Speaker 4>He beat Phil Davis and he took them down a bunch of times.</v>

1744
00:43:25.871 --> 00:43:26.210
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1745
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.510
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1746
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:27.860
<v Speaker 4>he's the top of his game.</v>

1747
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:29.060
<v Speaker 4>He's at the top of his game.</v>

1748
00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:30.560
<v Speaker 4>You look at the heavyweight division,</v>

1749
00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.740
<v Speaker 4>the tournament baders my dark horse man Bader is a,</v>

1750
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.800
<v Speaker 4>he is a legit world class fighter that is actually probably add is best right</v>

1751
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:39.530
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1752
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:42.320
<v Speaker 4>I would say that Ryan Bader right now is in his prime.</v>

1753
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.430
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing though,</v>

1754
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:45.260
<v Speaker 4>even in his prime,</v>

1755
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:50.920
<v Speaker 4>he's not at the level of John and that was over in the UFC and the UFC who is,</v>

1756
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:53.480
<v Speaker 4>well maybe Danielle's spin,</v>

1757
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean DC,</v>

1758
00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:56.360
<v Speaker 4>DC's,</v>

1759
00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.470
<v Speaker 4>DC's clothes,</v>

1760
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1761
00:43:57.951 --> 00:44:01.820
<v Speaker 4>DC put up a good fight the first time and the second time it was a good fight</v>

1762
00:44:01.821 --> 00:44:03.410
<v Speaker 4>until John had put up a better fight.</v>

1763
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:04.520
<v Speaker 4>He did.</v>

1764
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.820
<v Speaker 4>The speculation is a John barely trying on train for two hours,</v>

1765
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.260
<v Speaker 4>literally show at all.</v>

1766
00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:10.430
<v Speaker 4>That's how good he is.</v>

1767
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:10.850
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

1768
00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:12.740
<v Speaker 4>But when John Fought Ryan,</v>

1769
00:44:12.741 --> 00:44:13.131
<v Speaker 4>you were like,</v>

1770
00:44:13.131 --> 00:44:13.461
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1771
00:44:13.461 --> 00:44:14.540
<v Speaker 4>this is a gap.</v>

1772
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:15.890
<v Speaker 4>He was able to him like a baby,</v>

1773
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:17.450
<v Speaker 4>there's a gap that you go,</v>

1774
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:17.840
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

1775
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.280
<v Speaker 4>how are you going to cross that gap?</v>

1776
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:20.031
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1777
00:44:20.031 --> 00:44:21.050
<v Speaker 4>Even if you're a DC,</v>

1778
00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:21.891
<v Speaker 4>you gotta be thinking,</v>

1779
00:44:21.891 --> 00:44:22.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1780
00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:22.821
<v Speaker 4>I love DC.</v>

1781
00:44:22.821 --> 00:44:23.610
<v Speaker 4>Even with dcs,</v>

1782
00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:24.081
<v Speaker 4>we thinking,</v>

1783
00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:25.130
<v Speaker 4>how can I cross that gap?</v>

1784
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:26.800
<v Speaker 4>Ice 40 it's true.</v>

1785
00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:27.711
<v Speaker 4>He's going to be for,</v>

1786
00:44:27.711 --> 00:44:28.460
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>

1787
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.080
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

1788
00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:29.700
<v Speaker 4>I look,</v>

1789
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:29.940
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1790
00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:30.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1791
00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.320
<v Speaker 4>I can't disagree with you,</v>

1792
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:32.050
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1793
00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 2>DC at least was competitive in that fight before he got head kicked.</v>

1794
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.440
<v Speaker 2>It was a competitive fight.</v>

1795
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:39.240
<v Speaker 2>He was putting a lot of pressure on John.</v>

1796
00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:40.320
<v Speaker 2>It was interesting.</v>

1797
00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:41.160
<v Speaker 2>It was interesting.</v>

1798
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:41.871
<v Speaker 2>This is a good card,</v>

1799
00:44:41.871 --> 00:44:41.941
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1800
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 2>But John set them up.</v>

1801
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 2>It is a good card.</v>

1802
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1803
00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Paul daily versus John Fitch.</v>

1804
00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:47.160
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1805
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:48.570
<v Speaker 2>That's a good fight,</v>

1806
00:44:48.571 --> 00:44:49.404
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1807
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1808
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Aaron Peko juicy.</v>

1809
00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:55.440
<v Speaker 2>His last winter when that left hook to the chin,</v>

1810
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.580
<v Speaker 2>it was like a shovel hook.</v>

1811
00:44:56.581 --> 00:44:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Fucking.</v>

1812
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:58.223
<v Speaker 2>He's a beast.</v>

1813
00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:59.453
<v Speaker 2>He's a beast.</v>

1814
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.380
<v Speaker 2>He's so God damn.</v>

1815
00:45:00.381 --> 00:45:01.740
<v Speaker 2>I think losing that first fight,</v>

1816
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:03.890
<v Speaker 2>it's probably the best thing that could've ever happened to him.</v>

1817
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:06.080
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't train with you.</v>

1818
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Does he hear that first fight he did.</v>

1819
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:09.090
<v Speaker 2>He's a 10th Planet Guy,</v>

1820
00:45:09.091 --> 00:45:09.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1821
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:10.223
<v Speaker 2>Not Anymore.</v>

1822
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>

1823
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:11.530
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

1824
00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:12.900
<v Speaker 2>He then after he lost,</v>

1825
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I think they blamed it on the talent.</v>

1826
00:45:15.031 --> 00:45:15.331
<v Speaker 2>Dennis,</v>

1827
00:45:15.331 --> 00:45:15.690
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1828
00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1829
00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.850
<v Speaker 2>200 I just never came back.</v>

1830
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Dylan,</v>

1831
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:19.231
<v Speaker 2>Dennis,</v>

1832
00:45:19.231 --> 00:45:21.150
<v Speaker 2>his tattoo is fucking sweet.</v>

1833
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Like whoever did that.</v>

1834
00:45:22.711 --> 00:45:24.390
<v Speaker 2>That's like a real artist.</v>

1835
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:26.100
<v Speaker 2>They nailed that dragon.</v>

1836
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1837
00:45:26.431 --> 00:45:27.450
<v Speaker 2>it's really good,</v>

1838
00:45:27.451 --> 00:45:28.050
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1839
00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:30.630
<v Speaker 2>That's like Aaron Dellavedova style.</v>

1840
00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:32.100
<v Speaker 2>Like look how good that dragon is.</v>

1841
00:45:32.101 --> 00:45:37.050
<v Speaker 2>My like what I'm talking about too is not just the image but the way it's lined</v>

1842
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:37.650
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1843
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>

1844
00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:38.481
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1845
00:45:38.481 --> 00:45:39.960
<v Speaker 2>the use of space.</v>

1846
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Like when you see a real good tattoo artist,</v>

1847
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.120
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they do is they really,</v>

1848
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:45.690
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1849
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:49.290
<v Speaker 2>they fill up the space the right way with the right amount of darkness.</v>

1850
00:45:49.291 --> 00:45:49.501
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1851
00:45:49.501 --> 00:45:50.311
<v Speaker 2>Amount of lightness.</v>

1852
00:45:50.311 --> 00:45:51.360
<v Speaker 2>That good contrast.</v>

1853
00:45:51.361 --> 00:45:51.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1854
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:52.980
<v Speaker 2>Body they are of the body.</v>

1855
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.210
<v Speaker 2>It fits perfect.</v>

1856
00:45:54.211 --> 00:45:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I wish I could go back.</v>

1857
00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:56.274
<v Speaker 2>Cause now pet,</v>

1858
00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.620
<v Speaker 2>I feel like tattooers are so much better.</v>

1859
00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.401
<v Speaker 2>They're so good.</v>

1860
00:45:59.401 --> 00:46:00.900
<v Speaker 2>The styles are so much different.</v>

1861
00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:04.130
<v Speaker 2>It just hit like the Prius of tattoos instead of,</v>

1862
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:04.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1863
00:46:04.681 --> 00:46:06.930
<v Speaker 2>it's way better than laser that shit off.</v>

1864
00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:07.401
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1865
00:46:07.401 --> 00:46:07.761
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

1866
00:46:07.761 --> 00:46:08.594
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1867
00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:09.450
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go.</v>

1868
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:10.290
<v Speaker 2>I'd go with none.</v>

1869
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.100
<v Speaker 2>I'd go with none.</v>

1870
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:11.630
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>

1871
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:12.120
<v Speaker 2>None.</v>

1872
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.290
<v Speaker 2>I love tattoos man.</v>

00:46:14.611 --> 00:46:15.690
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I have to cover him.</v>

1876
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I believe you.</v>

1877
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.041
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>

1878
00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:17.874
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>

1879
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I love that Dylan Dannis style of Tattoo.</v>

1880
00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.540
<v Speaker 2>That's a dope tattoo.</v>

1881
00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.140
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite style of those big ass modern Japanese looking.</v>

1882
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.370
<v Speaker 2>I always cover my man.</v>

00:47:52.601 --> 00:47:53.680
<v Speaker 2>it's a business.</v>

1950
00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.433

<v Speaker 2>a lot of people bought into it.</v>

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:09.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1956
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't ask questions,</v>

1957
00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:11.440
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>

1958
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.840
<v Speaker 2>I really don't ask a lot of quick.</v>

1959

<v Speaker 2>I also make chair.</v>

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.000
<v Speaker 2>I've been working there forever.</v>

1961
00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:18.130
<v Speaker 2>I ask almost no questions.</v>

1962
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.930
<v Speaker 2>This is what I asked.</v>

1963
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:21.010
<v Speaker 2>What are you gonna do with this guy?</v>

1964
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:21.931
<v Speaker 2>What are you gonna do with it?</v>

1965
00:48:21.931 --> 00:48:23.410
<v Speaker 2>And he wanted to latch up and he'll be like,</v>

1966
00:48:23.411 --> 00:48:24.550
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell anybody this.</v>

1967
00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:25.091
<v Speaker 2>This is where ward.</v>

1968
00:48:25.091 --> 00:48:25.451
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1969
00:48:25.451 --> 00:48:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>

1970
00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:27.483
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

1971
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 2>That's the questions I asked for data.</v>

1972
00:48:29.081 --> 00:48:32.470
<v Speaker 2>I never asked questions about business or who bought this.</v>

1973
00:48:32.471 --> 00:48:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Or I don't have enough room in my brain to give a fuck about other people's</v>

1974
00:48:36.851 --> 00:48:37.330
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

1975
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:41.170
<v Speaker 2>I have zero interest in the people's business.</v>

1976
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally zero,</v>

1977
00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.750
<v Speaker 2>especially with the UFC.</v>

1978
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:45.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>

1979
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.660
<v Speaker 2>I just want to know who's fighting,</v>

1980
00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:47.470
<v Speaker 2>who was fighting knew,</v>

1981
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:48.303
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

1982
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like,</v>

1983
00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.140
<v Speaker 2>how much is this Guy gonna make?</v>

1984
00:48:50.141 --> 00:48:51.730
<v Speaker 2>What percentage is he owned and who is he,</v>

1985
00:48:51.731 --> 00:48:52.361
<v Speaker 2>what's he doing?</v>

1986
00:48:52.361 --> 00:48:53.890
<v Speaker 2>And how's he gonna make us money back?</v>

1987
00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:55.190
<v Speaker 2>And what kind of financial returns,</v>

1988
00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:56.170
<v Speaker 2>investments you're going to go,</v>

1989
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:58.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck about you.</v>

1990
00:48:58.611 --> 00:49:00.250
<v Speaker 2>But when they see those celebrities or owners,</v>

1991
00:49:00.251 --> 00:49:01.180
<v Speaker 2>it's just like a business.</v>

1992
00:49:01.181 --> 00:49:01.630
<v Speaker 2>But if they don't,</v>

1993
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:02.890
<v Speaker 2>they might even not be into the UFC.</v>

1994
00:49:02.891 --> 00:49:04.090
<v Speaker 2>It's just as far as money,</v>

1995
00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:09.100
<v Speaker 2>like estimate people are into getting famous people to invest in shit too.</v>

1996
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:10.570

<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

2013
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.911
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2014
00:49:36.911 --> 00:49:39.040
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of people bought into it</v>

2015
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:43.810
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck is she doing in the fight game?</v>

2016
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:45.070
<v Speaker 2>So what they do is they,</v>

2017
00:49:45.071 --> 00:49:45.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2018
00:49:45.461 --> 00:49:46.061
<v Speaker 2>they probably,</v>

2019
00:49:46.061 --> 00:49:47.560
<v Speaker 2>everybody chips in a little bit.</v>

2020
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:51.070
<v Speaker 2>So strengths give them stock.</v>

2021
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:52.000
<v Speaker 2>They just give them stock.</v>

2022
00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.373
<v Speaker 2>Michael Bay,</v>

2023
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:55.120
<v Speaker 2>pretty sure he showed that didn't chip in.</v>

2024
00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:57.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they chip it up and get his dog,</v>

2025
00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:00.220
<v Speaker 2>nor will they give them stock for cause they own the business,</v>

2026
00:50:00.221 --> 00:50:00.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2027
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:01.300
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

2028
00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:02.710

2029
00:50:02.711 --> 00:50:03.544

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:03.821
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2031

<v Speaker 2>what then?</v>

2032
00:50:04.361 --> 00:50:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Why would they do that?</v>

2033
00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Why would they give him a piece of the business for no reason?</v>

2034
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:10.420
<v Speaker 2>They'd have to give them money.</v>

2035
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.111
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2036
00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:11.261
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2037
00:50:11.261 --> 00:50:12.470
<v Speaker 2>this is why I don't want them to do this.</v>

2038
00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:13.643
<v Speaker 2>This is why I don't do,</v>

2039
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:15.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't like doing it.</v>

2040
00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:16.883
<v Speaker 2>We're doing</v>

2041
00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:19.190
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2042
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:22.510
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is I don't like wondering who's paying what or how they're</v>

2043
00:50:22.511 --> 00:50:24.430
<v Speaker 2>doing and wanting to hear about it.</v>

2044
00:50:24.431 --> 00:50:24.811
<v Speaker 2>Now we,</v>

2045
00:50:24.811 --> 00:50:25.644
<v Speaker 2>we'd like it.</v>

2046
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.550
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

2047
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:31.000
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things I've found as I've gotten older.</v>

2048
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Specialty is to concentrate on less things like God bless you.</v>

2049
00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.121
<v Speaker 2>Other things,</v>

2050
00:50:38.121 --> 00:50:38.954
<v Speaker 2>just put them aside,</v>

2051
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.710
<v Speaker 2>put it aside.</v>

2052
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Concentrate on less things.</v>

2053
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.100
<v Speaker 2>You can get better at the things that you really enjoyed.</v>

2054
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:44.870
<v Speaker 2>There's only so many things you could think of.</v>

2055
00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:46.160
<v Speaker 2>There's only so many things.</v>

2056
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.400
<v Speaker 2>If you spend your time worrying about other people's nonsense,</v>

2057
00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:51.260
<v Speaker 2>you're robbing yourself.</v>

2058
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:52.370
<v Speaker 2>You think it's fun,</v>

2059
00:50:52.371 --> 00:50:54.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's really a big fat distraction.</v>

2060
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.980
<v Speaker 2>You know what it is.</v>

2061
00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:56.000
<v Speaker 2>It's not even to your life,</v>

2062
00:50:56.001 --> 00:50:56.211
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2063
00:50:56.211 --> 00:50:58.460
<v Speaker 2>So you're thinking about things that are going on in other people's lives and</v>

2064
00:50:58.461 --> 00:51:03.290
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it because you're not giving 100% to your life,</v>

2065
00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.120
<v Speaker 2>and there's some stress involved in that.</v>

2066
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.160
<v Speaker 2>And so distract yourself from that stress.</v>

2067
00:51:07.161 --> 00:51:08.480
<v Speaker 2>You concentrate on other people's lives.</v>

2068
00:51:08.481 --> 00:51:09.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a very common thing.</v>

2069
00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you like you can have arguments.</v>

2070
00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:12.980
<v Speaker 2>You have a fake arguments with myself.</v>

2071
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.161
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2072
00:51:13.161 --> 00:51:14.030
<v Speaker 2>he used to do that all the time.</v>

2073
00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I used to pretend someone would say this back to me.</v>

2074
00:51:15.801 --> 00:51:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I was to be,</v>

2075
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:16.221
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2076
00:51:16.221 --> 00:51:16.551
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

2077
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:17.384
<v Speaker 2>I fuck you.</v>

2078
00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say this back to you.</v>

2079
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:24.430
<v Speaker 2>And then sometimes it would be with a dude and then I would run into him to talk</v>

2080
00:51:24.561 --> 00:51:24.771
<v Speaker 2>to him,</v>

2081
00:51:24.771 --> 00:51:25.900
<v Speaker 2>thinking we're going to have this big audience.</v>

2082
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:26.270
<v Speaker 2>I'll say,</v>

2083
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.451
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2084
00:51:26.451 --> 00:51:29.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry I fucked up all this shit.</v>

2085
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:32.210
<v Speaker 2>And then I abandoned it immediately.</v>

2086
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I think there's so much of how people interact with each other.</v>

2087
00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:39.680
<v Speaker 2>It could be just way different with just a little shift in how we talk to each</v>

2088
00:51:39.681 --> 00:51:41.140
<v Speaker 2>other and how we think about it.</v>

2089
00:51:41.141 --> 00:51:43.410
<v Speaker 2>You did that last night I was doing to set the laugh factory in,</v>

2090
00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:43.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2091
00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:46.520
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about Santiago and Theo Vaughn.</v>

2092
00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:47.601
<v Speaker 2>I was going,</v>

2093
00:51:47.601 --> 00:51:48.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2094
00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.840
<v Speaker 2>in between them I had this whole dialogue in my head cause they were like,</v>

2095
00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:51.990
<v Speaker 2>oh we got to stay on what you said,</v>

2096
00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:53.270
<v Speaker 2>that'd be cool.</v>

2097
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.590
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as I got done I was like,</v>

2098
00:51:54.591 --> 00:51:54.910

<v Speaker 2>He was a nice guy ever.</v>

2102
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:02.420
<v Speaker 2>Santina was a very nice guy.</v>

2103
00:52:02.421 --> 00:52:04.040
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking destroyed last night.</v>

2108
00:52:11.631 --> 00:52:12.200
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2109
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.880
<v Speaker 2>you motherfuckers are monsters.</v>

2110
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:14.531
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen his bid?</v>

2111
00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:15.470
<v Speaker 2>He does about the rock.</v>

2112
00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.510
<v Speaker 2>You've got to ask him to Contino yes.</v>

2113
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Cause he doesn't,</v>

2114
00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:19.180
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2115
00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:21.260
<v Speaker 2>he's has so much material that he stopped doing it.</v>

2116
00:52:21.261 --> 00:52:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I guess he'll do it,</v>

2117
00:52:22.161 --> 00:52:22.994
<v Speaker 2>but if you bring it up,</v>

2118
00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:23.903
<v Speaker 2>he'll do it.</v>

2119
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I asked him to do it one night.</v>

2120
00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:26.720
<v Speaker 2>He did it for us in the or.</v>

2273
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:06.540
<v Speaker 2>cause I think Bryant told me,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he was killed.</v>

2277
00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.431
<v Speaker 2>He was a killer.</v>

2278
00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:09.870
<v Speaker 2>And I think you told me that too.</v>

2279
00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:10.980
<v Speaker 2>So I've never seen a stamp.</v>

2280
00:56:10.981 --> 00:56:11.121
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2281
00:56:11.121 --> 00:56:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I've watched it on youtube but then his special,</v>

2282
00:56:13.651 --> 00:56:14.610
<v Speaker 2>it's good with,</v>

2283
00:56:14.611 --> 00:56:15.121
<v Speaker 2>you know what it is,</v>

2284
00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:15.331
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2285
00:56:15.331 --> 00:56:17.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like at this point he's just so busy.</v>

2286
00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:18.121
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2287
00:56:18.121 --> 00:56:22.440
<v Speaker 2>he's got his TV show and he's always doing before Kevin can wait.</v>

2288
00:56:22.441 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 2>He was always his other TV</v>

2289
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.360
<v Speaker 4>show that went on forever,</v>

2290
00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:25.961
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2291
00:56:25.961 --> 00:56:26.400
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2292
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.200
<v Speaker 4>and he was like a main guy on that show.</v>

2293
00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:30.580
<v Speaker 4>So no,</v>

2294
00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:30.790
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2295
00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:31.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean as an actor,</v>

2296
00:56:31.811 --> 00:56:32.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean as a writer.</v>

2297
00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:33.381
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

2298
00:56:33.381 --> 00:56:34.680
<v Speaker 4>So it wasn't just,</v>

2299
00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:35.501
<v Speaker 4>Oh dude.</v>

2300
00:56:35.501 --> 00:56:38.770
<v Speaker 4>He wrote everything with those guys and he's super wrote a lot.</v>

2301
00:56:38.771 --> 00:56:39.760
<v Speaker 4>He rewrote a lot.</v>

2302
00:56:39.761 --> 00:56:40.840
<v Speaker 4>He went over all the scripts.</v>

2303
00:56:40.841 --> 00:56:42.670
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why the show was so good,</v>

2304
00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:44.710
<v Speaker 4>it's because it was a talent that staff are writers,</v>

2305
00:56:44.711 --> 00:56:45.640
<v Speaker 4>talented actress,</v>

2306
00:56:45.641 --> 00:56:46.101
<v Speaker 4>Leah Remini.</v>

2307
00:56:46.101 --> 00:56:46.760
<v Speaker 4>He was very funny.</v>

2308
00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:48.460
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of funny people on the Shell.</v>

2309
00:56:48.461 --> 00:56:49.840
<v Speaker 4>Patton Oswald was really going on the show.</v>

2310
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:50.450
<v Speaker 4>He's great.</v>

2311
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:54.820
<v Speaker 4>But more than anything it was like Kevin is like a driven dude.</v>

2312
00:56:54.821 --> 00:56:55.240
<v Speaker 4>Like he,</v>

2313
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.190
<v Speaker 4>he gets super obsessed about doing the right.</v>

2314
00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.041
<v Speaker 4>Like he would,</v>

2315
00:56:59.041 --> 00:57:01.360
<v Speaker 4>he would go over lines but he eats it like this.</v>

2316
00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:01.831
<v Speaker 4>Like he's,</v>

2317
00:57:01.831 --> 00:57:02.830
<v Speaker 4>he's a craftsman.</v>

2318
00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:04.360
<v Speaker 4>Like he's trying to break it down.</v>

2319
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.901
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2320
00:57:04.901 --> 00:57:08.290
<v Speaker 4>he's trying to figure it out but he just doesn't do the amount of standup now</v>

2321
00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:10.270
<v Speaker 4>that he used to when he was a start.</v>

2322
00:57:10.271 --> 00:57:11.650
<v Speaker 4>Now how could you can't,</v>

2323
00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 4>there's no way we could,</v>

2324
00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.690
<v Speaker 4>that's why you didn't think that he was doing it anymore because there's no way</v>

2325
00:57:16.691 --> 00:57:19.630
<v Speaker 4>he could do the kind of standup where you'd be everywhere all the time.</v>

2326
00:57:19.631 --> 00:57:20.620
<v Speaker 4>He just didn't have that time.</v>

2327
00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:20.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2328
00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:21.730
<v Speaker 4>you're doing a sitcom.</v>

2329
00:57:21.731 --> 00:57:22.940
<v Speaker 4>It's your sitcoms switched.</v>

2330
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:23.780
<v Speaker 4>We were writing.</v>

2331
00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:24.491
<v Speaker 4>Fuck Dude,</v>

2332
00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:25.450
<v Speaker 4>that's so much work.</v>

2333
00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:27.670
<v Speaker 4>Hey Shannon talked about that too cause he would write everything,</v>

2334
00:57:27.671 --> 00:57:28.830
<v Speaker 4>overlook every episode.</v>

2335
00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:30.730
<v Speaker 4>Then she can't do both.</v>

2336
00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:31.240
<v Speaker 4>Think,</v>

2337
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.370
<v Speaker 4>think about some of the shit that we've done.</v>

2338
00:57:33.371 --> 00:57:37.460
<v Speaker 4>Like that cartoon about you getting kidnapped by the Mexicans and then we'll</v>

2339
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:39.640
<v Speaker 4>fill you up with drugs and turn it into a sex slave.</v>

2340
00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:43.510
<v Speaker 4>But Dick's pump that we didn't write a goddamn thing.</v>

2341
00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:43.960
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2342
00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.880
<v Speaker 4>we were just two friends refund,</v>

2343
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:46.510
<v Speaker 4>giggling,</v>

2344
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:47.500
<v Speaker 4>being ridiculous.</v>

2345
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:50.700
<v Speaker 4>And it turns into a cartoon and it's fucking hilarious.</v>

2346
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:51.790
<v Speaker 4>Like you watched that cartoon.</v>

2347
00:57:51.791 --> 00:57:52.624
<v Speaker 4>It's hilarious.</v>

2348
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:54.280
<v Speaker 4>We have it so much easier.</v>

2349
00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:55.660
<v Speaker 4>If they were doing a sitcom,</v>

2350
00:57:55.850 --> 00:57:57.010
<v Speaker 4>we'd had meetings,</v>

2351
00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.960
<v Speaker 4>we'd have to do a run through for the network.</v>

2352
00:57:58.961 --> 00:58:00.700
<v Speaker 4>The network would give a stupid notes.</v>

2353
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:02.263
<v Speaker 4>We did a,</v>

2354
00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:03.250
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

2355
00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:03.860
<v Speaker 4>and it was insane.</v>

2356
00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:04.540
<v Speaker 4>It was a nightmare.</v>

2357
00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:05.950
<v Speaker 4>Fucking nightmare from day one.</v>

2358
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:07.030
<v Speaker 4>It's not a nightmare.</v>

2359
00:58:07.031 --> 00:58:11.200
<v Speaker 4>I have to deal with a little bit of a little bit now because my showtime show</v>

2360
00:58:11.201 --> 00:58:11.850
<v Speaker 4>and below the belt,</v>

2361
00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:13.630
<v Speaker 4>you're shouts at least not scripted.</v>

2362
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.680
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2363
00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.550
<v Speaker 4>See that's the thing.</v>

2364
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:16.390
<v Speaker 4>So with the animal,</v>

2365
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:17.590
<v Speaker 4>when things are scripted,</v>

2366
00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:18.610
<v Speaker 4>it's shit gets weird.</v>

2367
00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:18.971
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2368
00:58:18.971 --> 00:58:22.030
<v Speaker 4>because what they're doing with you is very talent dependent.</v>

2369
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:23.710
<v Speaker 4>They're dependent upon your personality.</v>

2370
00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:24.731
<v Speaker 4>That's what people want to see.</v>

2371
00:58:24.731 --> 00:58:25.930
<v Speaker 4>The more they let you go,</v>

2372
00:58:25.931 --> 00:58:26.920
<v Speaker 4>the better the show is going to be.</v>

2373
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:27.701
<v Speaker 4>They realize that.</v>

2374
00:58:27.701 --> 00:58:28.720
<v Speaker 4>And you see it in the show now,</v>

2375
00:58:28.721 --> 00:58:28.911
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2376
00:58:28.911 --> 00:58:29.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2377
00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:29.860
<v Speaker 4>But if you're,</v>

2378
00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:33.310
<v Speaker 4>if you're on us a show where they're creating the dialogue,</v>

2379
00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:37.210
<v Speaker 4>everybody's got to say it was in there and everybody's got their own little</v>

2380
00:58:37.211 --> 00:58:39.970
<v Speaker 4>fucking opinion about how this should go and that should go and you don't want</v>

2381
00:58:39.971 --> 00:58:43.600
<v Speaker 4>to hear their shit and they think you suck and everybody's going back and forth</v>

2382
00:58:43.601 --> 00:58:46.330
<v Speaker 4>and then the network comes in and they don't want to get their greasy pause on</v>

2383
00:58:46.331 --> 00:58:46.630
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2384
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:48.760
<v Speaker 4>Everybody wants to get their fucking just in the soup.</v>

2385
00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:51.580
<v Speaker 4>They all want to get their flavor flavor,</v>

2386
00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:53.620
<v Speaker 4>a little bit of flavor.</v>

2387
00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.860
<v Speaker 4>Everybody literally wants to add their DNA to the script.</v>

2388
00:58:56.861 --> 00:58:57.011
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

2389
00:58:57.011 --> 00:59:01.090
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people try to change things just to justify their job.</v>

2390
00:59:01.091 --> 00:59:02.290
<v Speaker 4>They have to have an opinion.</v>

2391
00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:03.670
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has to have an opinion.</v>

2392
00:59:03.671 --> 00:59:05.680
<v Speaker 4>Like I just think she's not dressed hot enough.</v>

2393
00:59:05.681 --> 00:59:06.910
<v Speaker 4>They have these conversations.</v>

2394
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.540
<v Speaker 4>We need to,</v>

2395
00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:08.410
<v Speaker 4>we need a black guy,</v>

2396
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:09.810
<v Speaker 4>we need a black guy and noise.</v>

2397
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:13.330
<v Speaker 4>And then you listening to some executive that doesn't know shit about writing.</v>

2398
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:14.590
<v Speaker 4>They're not writers.</v>

2399
00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:19.510
<v Speaker 4>They just decide they want to have some sort of say and they think they know the</v>

2400
00:59:19.511 --> 00:59:22.310
<v Speaker 4>business because they'd been working as an executive</v>

2401
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:23.930
<v Speaker 2>fucking up shows for about five,</v>

2402
00:59:23.931 --> 00:59:24.710
<v Speaker 2>six years,</v>

2403
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:27.620
<v Speaker 2>so they've got to experience fucking up shows so they think they can fuck up</v>

2404
00:59:27.621 --> 00:59:28.640
<v Speaker 2>your show and fix it.</v>

2405
00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:31.580
<v Speaker 2>It'd be a nightmare to do all that and do stand up.</v>

2406
00:59:31.581 --> 00:59:32.870
<v Speaker 2>We need a gay neighbor.</v>

2407
00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:35.980
<v Speaker 2>We have to advocate and kind of get a gauge for to me to stay neighbor.</v>

2408
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:36.471
<v Speaker 2>Big,</v>

2409
00:59:36.471 --> 00:59:37.071
<v Speaker 2>silly,</v>

2410
00:59:37.071 --> 00:59:37.904
<v Speaker 2>bold.</v>

2411
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Well now it's going to transgender.</v>

2412
00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Transgender.</v>

2413
00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard of transracial?</v>

2414
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:43.670
<v Speaker 2>All do.</v>

2415
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Thank God you guys remind me of this.</v>

2416
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:47.270
<v Speaker 2>There's a new podcast,</v>

2417
00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:52.460
<v Speaker 2>there's a new documentary on Netflix about that lady who was white.</v>

2418
00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Black?</v>

2419
00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2420
00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:54.770
<v Speaker 2>And it is at,</v>

2421
00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:55.663
<v Speaker 2>what's it called?</v>

2422
00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:56.810
<v Speaker 2>What's it called?</v>

2423
00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:57.650
<v Speaker 2>I forget,</v>

2424
00:59:57.651 --> 00:59:58.540
<v Speaker 2>but you watch it.</v>

2425
00:59:58.550 --> 00:59:59.190
<v Speaker 2>Poor Lady.</v>

2426
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2427
00:59:59.300 --> 00:59:59.961
<v Speaker 2>you feel bad.</v>

2428
00:59:59.961 --> 01:00:02.510
<v Speaker 2>The Rachel Rachel Dozer,</v>

2429
01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:04.220
<v Speaker 2>right to call it the racial divide.</v>

2430
01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.230
<v Speaker 2>The Rachel Dolezal is her name.</v>

2431
01:00:06.231 --> 01:00:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Dozzle Doughlas though her name now.</v>

2432
01:00:08.661 --> 01:00:11.570
<v Speaker 2>She changed her name to like some soup and she still want to be black.</v>

2433
01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Super African sounding names.</v>

2434
01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.190
<v Speaker 2>No spoiler alerts.</v>

2435
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:15.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2436
01:00:15.381 --> 01:00:16.280
<v Speaker 2>you can look this shit up,</v>

2437
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.660
<v Speaker 2>but they basically like,</v>

2438
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:18.201
<v Speaker 2>she goes on,</v>

2439
01:00:18.201 --> 01:00:19.910
<v Speaker 2>she writes a book sales 500 of them.</v>

2440
01:00:19.911 --> 01:00:22.940
<v Speaker 2>It goes terrible stress to make money because the black community doesn't accept</v>

2441
01:00:22.941 --> 01:00:23.050
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

2442
01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:24.230
<v Speaker 2>The white community doesn't Septa.</v>

2443
01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:28.130
<v Speaker 2>So she writes this book and then at the end you see her taking her braids out</v>

2444
01:00:28.131 --> 01:00:28.400
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

2445
01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:28.851
<v Speaker 2>oh damn,</v>

2446
01:00:28.851 --> 01:00:30.020
<v Speaker 2>she's going back to white.</v>

2447
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:32.720
<v Speaker 2>But she doubles down with Conda style.</v>

2448
01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Comes out with like an Afro Change.</v>

2449
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.820
<v Speaker 2>A name like fucking what's</v>

2450
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:40.550
<v Speaker 2>the racial divide?</v>

2451
01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.590
<v Speaker 2>What is her a new name?</v>

2452
01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:44.790
<v Speaker 2>It's something crazy.</v>

2453
01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Like from the motherland.</v>

2454
01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.233
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2455
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Cherice Gerald Harris was always super jacked.</v>

2456
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:51.911
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2457
01:00:51.911 --> 01:00:52.744
<v Speaker 2>it looks good.</v>

2458
01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.730
<v Speaker 2>It looks like he's a good choice.</v>

2459
01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:54.021
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

2460

<v Speaker 2>There's going to be a great fight,</v>

2461
01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:55.330
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's the chain.</v>

2469
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:01.961
<v Speaker 2>That's syrup soup.</v>

2470
01:01:01.961 --> 01:01:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Campbell.</v>

2471

<v Speaker 2>That's super normal.</v>

2473
01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.520
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense for a white girl.</v>

2474
01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2475

2477
01:01:07.701 --> 01:01:08.240
<v Speaker 2>It's really fun.</v>

2478
01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2479
01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2480
01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:09.951
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen,</v>

2481
01:01:09.951 --> 01:01:13.640
<v Speaker 2>I saw like a very short clip of him when he was first starting out.</v>

2482
01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.533
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2483
01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:15.620
<v Speaker 2>he's a funny guy.</v>

2484
01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Did something that could be like an eminent comedy tour.</v>

2485
01:01:17.661 --> 01:01:19.400
<v Speaker 2>You Gerald Harris.</v>

2486
01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:20.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

2488
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.093
<v Speaker 2>Who else is,</v>

2489
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.900
<v Speaker 2>what else is doing it?</v>

2490
01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:24.793
<v Speaker 2>Adam Hunter.</v>

2491
01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Adam Hunter.</v>

2492
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:26.743
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2493
01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:27.560
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2494
01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.393
<v Speaker 2>he's a cowboy.</v>

2495
01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:30.070
<v Speaker 2>He was a really good restaurants,</v>

2496
01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.430
<v Speaker 2>but he's still in the MMA community.</v>

2497
01:01:31.431 --> 01:01:31.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2498
01:01:31.571 --> 01:01:32.390
<v Speaker 2>he's in the community.</v>

2499
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.720
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

2500
01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.490
<v Speaker 2>his show was fucking good man.</v>

2501
01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.560
<v Speaker 2>And he's a hilarious comic.</v>

2502
01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.000
<v Speaker 2>He's a really good joke writer.</v>

2503
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:39.560
<v Speaker 2>Like a one liner type dude.</v>

2504
01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Very good at that.</v>

2505
01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:43.010
<v Speaker 2>He's a good dude too.</v>

2506
01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:45.260
<v Speaker 2>So that would be him.</v>

2507
01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:46.880
<v Speaker 2>And he wrestled.</v>

2508
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:48.310
<v Speaker 2>I think he coaches wrestling too.</v>

2509
01:01:48.311 --> 01:01:49.760
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't need to do some shit with Einstein.</v>

2510
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Einstein,</v>

2511
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I think they to do a podcast together and then they don't even want to workout</v>

2512
01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.510
<v Speaker 2>and then hand out.</v>

2513
01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.373
<v Speaker 2>They'll started doing it</v>

2514
01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:00.680
<v Speaker 2>and that's what caused the trouble.</v>

2515
01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Always caused the trouble.</v>

2516
01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:04.183
<v Speaker 2>I've never met him.</v>

2517
01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.760
<v Speaker 2>And that's the is for you,</v>

2518
01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure know.</v>

2519
01:02:10.731 --> 01:02:11.564
<v Speaker 2>Ran into him.</v>

2520
01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:13.293
<v Speaker 2>He</v>

2521
01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:15.380
<v Speaker 2>brings you up though.</v>

2522
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:17.480
<v Speaker 2>He calls you Brendan Schwabie.</v>

2523
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:18.583
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

2524
01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Your big</v>

2525
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.113
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2526
01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:21.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2527
01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:22.733
<v Speaker 1>I've never met him.</v>

2528
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>One of the funniest guys to ever live.</v>

2529
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny,</v>

2530
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:26.870
<v Speaker 1>still fuzzy.</v>

2531
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2532
01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:28.373
<v Speaker 1>have you seen this?</v>

2533
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>That hand up on the Rhonda Show when he does the sketches,</v>

2534
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.153
<v Speaker 1>Robert Deniro,</v>

2535
01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>he does the heat scatch.</v>

2536
01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:34.990
<v Speaker 1>He's got the rocky three sketch.</v>

2537
01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:36.270
<v Speaker 1>He's got an incredible hulk.</v>

2538
01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Sketch the statutes off the chart.</v>

2539
01:02:38.351 --> 01:02:39.184
<v Speaker 1>This is brilliant.</v>

2540
01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:42.040
<v Speaker 1>This the one is to take on snow.</v>

2541
01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Michael Bisping,</v>

2542
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Michael Bisping and him in a,</v>

2543
01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.140
<v Speaker 1>in a fucking parody of snatched</v>

2544
01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>it is hilarious.</v>

2545
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:52.463
<v Speaker 1>Don't channel.</v>

2546
01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>He had his own show and eat.</v>

2547
01:02:54.301 --> 01:02:55.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a talk show where he brought,</v>

2548
01:02:55.341 --> 01:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>he's brought it and he's had a Henner Henner Gracie,</v>

2549
01:02:58.170 --> 01:02:59.003
<v Speaker 1>frank shamrock.</v>

2550
01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:00.120
<v Speaker 1>He's the time.</v>

2551
01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:00.900
<v Speaker 1>He's the host,</v>

2552
01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:01.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a race.</v>

2553
01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:02.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like a podcast,</v>

2554
01:03:02.431 --> 01:03:03.264
<v Speaker 1>but at the show.</v>

2555
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.670
<v Speaker 1>And he rushes his guests.</v>

2556
01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:07.710
<v Speaker 1>He's the premise of the show.</v>

2557
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.850
<v Speaker 1>If he's better than the guests and he's going to crush it and he smashes you.</v>

2558
01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:15.630
<v Speaker 1>He had frank shamrock on and I asked him,</v>

2559
01:03:15.631 --> 01:03:15.841
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2560
01:03:15.841 --> 01:03:16.230
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>

2561
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:18.230
<v Speaker 1>did you bring up his snaggletooth not,</v>

2562
01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:19.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2563
01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:19.913
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2564
01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.090
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>

2565
01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:22.650
<v Speaker 1>he brought it up for 30 minutes.</v>

2566
01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I love Frank Shamrock,</v>

2567
01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:31.771
<v Speaker 1>but he fixed it though.</v>

2568
01:03:31.771 --> 01:03:32.371
<v Speaker 1>He's got braces.</v>

2569
01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:32.971
<v Speaker 1>I got braces,</v>

2570
01:03:32.971 --> 01:03:33.804
<v Speaker 1>my teeth look like</v>

2571
01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:36.323
<v Speaker 1>freights braces.</v>

2572
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:39.000
<v Speaker 1>My teeth were just as bad as frank,</v>

2573
01:03:39.001 --> 01:03:42.540
<v Speaker 1>so I had to get braces as an old man to Invisalign.</v>

2574
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Brian's doing Invisalign.</v>

2575
01:03:43.771 --> 01:03:44.760
<v Speaker 1>They're not getting better.</v>

2576
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Brian's had Invisalign for like four months now.</v>

2577
01:03:47.281 --> 01:03:47.701
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

2578
01:03:47.701 --> 01:03:48.121
<v Speaker 1>Took him out.</v>

2579
01:03:48.121 --> 01:03:49.020
<v Speaker 1>His teeth are fucked up.</v>

2580
01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Tell him snatching,</v>

2581
01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.813
<v Speaker 1>tell him a letter.</v>

2582
01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Let it go.</v>

2583
01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:51.791

<v Speaker 1>they're like a dog fight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's good,</v>

2604
01:04:31.711 --> 01:04:31.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2605
01:04:31.981 --> 01:04:32.880
<v Speaker 1>You need McElfresh.</v>

2606
01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:33.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2607
01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:35.460
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck did you lose him too?</v>

2608
01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:39.300
<v Speaker 1>And I as if he's a fucking pair of Khakis and I asked him if he's not his fights</v>

2609
01:04:39.301 --> 01:04:40.134
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

2610
01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.890
<v Speaker 1>We'll come back to this long sketch.</v>

2611
01:04:43.891 --> 01:04:44.581
<v Speaker 1>That's a long sketch.</v>

2612
01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:45.414
<v Speaker 1>We'll come back to it.</v>

2613
01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's watch like it's 40 minutes long.</v>

2614
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:49.620
<v Speaker 1>This fight on the show is 40 minutes.</v>

2615
01:04:49.621 --> 01:04:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Lavato and Gerald Harris here,</v>

2616
01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.770
<v Speaker 1>this shit's going down.</v>

2617
01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.050
<v Speaker 1>This is an interesting fight to me.</v>

2618
01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Lavato was one of the best Jujitsu guys right now in MMA.</v>

2619
01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>I love Oklahoma money can fuck dudes upstanding and speaks Portuguese,</v>

2620
01:05:03.721 --> 01:05:04.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2621
01:05:04.110 --> 01:05:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2622
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:05.191
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

2623
01:05:05.191 --> 01:05:06.024
<v Speaker 1>Flying knee.</v>

2624
01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you go to the ground with them?</v>

2625
01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.940
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not a good idea.</v>

2626
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what happens here.</v>

2627
01:05:11.310 --> 01:05:12.450
<v Speaker 1>You might get tied it up.</v>

2628
01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I thought Joe Retired.</v>

2629
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.440
<v Speaker 1>He did for a bit and I,</v>

2630
01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:16.741
<v Speaker 1>but he's back.</v>

2631
01:05:16.741 --> 01:05:20.240
<v Speaker 1>This is is coming from the EOC and then Simon Belt Tours.</v>

2632
01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I do not remember.</v>

2633
01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.320
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] has got a really good guard too,</v>

2634
01:05:23.321 --> 01:05:24.000
<v Speaker 1>so he's in here.</v>

2635
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:24.741
<v Speaker 1>He's in danger,</v>

2636
01:05:24.741 --> 01:05:24.841
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2637
01:05:24.841 --> 01:05:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2638
01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's got his legs closed.</v>

2639
01:05:26.261 --> 01:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Don't cheer was playing this game.</v>

2640
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>This is not a wise move maneuver.</v>

2641
01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:31.360
<v Speaker 1>It's probably going to end right here.</v>

2642
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2643
01:05:31.811 --> 01:05:33.640
<v Speaker 1>You don't realize what is left.</v>

2644
01:05:33.641 --> 01:05:34.091
<v Speaker 1>Elbows out.</v>

2645
01:05:34.091 --> 01:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>He's good.</v>

2646
01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:35.283
<v Speaker 1>He's safe right here.</v>

2647
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:39.960
<v Speaker 1>His legs are tied around the triangle,</v>

2648
01:05:40.310 --> 01:05:40.631
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2649
01:05:40.631 --> 01:05:41.464
<v Speaker 1>If he puts in that,</v>

2650
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:42.730
<v Speaker 1>if he triangles his legs,</v>

2651
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:43.900
<v Speaker 1>even with both arms and,</v>

2652
01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:44.111
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2653
01:05:44.111 --> 01:05:44.944
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

2654
01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:45.700
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

2655
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:46.320
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>

2656
01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.153
<v Speaker 1>That's done.</v>

2657
01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:48.123
<v Speaker 1>Tapped.</v>

2658
01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:48.951
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was,</v>

2659
01:05:48.951 --> 01:05:49.784
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2660
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>But they don't know.</v>

2661
01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

2662
01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.080
<v Speaker 1>They'll know this guy's level of Jujitsu.</v>

2663
01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.120
<v Speaker 1>They have an idea.</v>

2664
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>They think they can survive.</v>

2665
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:58.023
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

2666
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:59.470
<v Speaker 1>He has knockouts too though.</v>

2667
01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Does she was upset.</v>

2668
01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:04.240
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of bummed out that he didn't get the choke him,</v>

2669
01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.980
<v Speaker 1>but he could show that he does.</v>

2670
01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.120
<v Speaker 1>He can do that too.</v>

2671
01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:10.000
<v Speaker 1>But the level on the ground is so high.</v>

2672
01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.310
<v Speaker 1>When's the last time you saw this many high level Jujitsu Guy?</v>

2673
01:06:12.311 --> 01:06:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Just submit first round,</v>

2674
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:14.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2675
01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

2676
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:15.400
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

2677
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:15.760
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

2678
01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.300
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

2679
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Crazy good on beltway.</v>

2680
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Now frank just kept the nine off.</v>

2681
01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.201
<v Speaker 1>Jumped to half guard,</v>

2682
01:06:20.201 --> 01:06:20.381
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

2683
01:06:20.381 --> 01:06:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Like a pageant.</v>

2684
01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:23.650
<v Speaker 1>If he snapped faders arm too.</v>

2685
01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2686
01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Think about that friend Sylvia Nogueira.</v>

2687
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:32.050
<v Speaker 1>What if he breaks faders arm and we'd go get the fuck Outta here.</v>

2688
01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:36.400
<v Speaker 1>He has arguably one of the best cars in the history of the heavyweight division.</v>

2689
01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Got Night Guards,</v>

2690
01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:38.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2691
01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2692
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Frank.</v>

2693
01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2694
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:41.023
<v Speaker 1>Frank journals.</v>

2695
01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Guard it is.</v>

2696
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:43.263
<v Speaker 1>It is better.</v>

2697
01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:46.630
<v Speaker 1>But Frank's got a wicked fucking guard man at that beautiful swing.</v>

2698
01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Ooh Bam.</v>

2699
01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:48.701
<v Speaker 1>He just let him know.</v>

2700
01:06:48.701 --> 01:06:50.260
<v Speaker 1>He wraps it up to God.</v>

2701
01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:50.651
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

2702
01:06:50.651 --> 01:06:51.311
<v Speaker 1>That was tight.</v>

2703
01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:52.144
<v Speaker 1>Can Filthy.</v>

2704
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

2705
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you like the smell and look at the swim right here.</v>

2706
01:06:54.491 --> 01:06:55.324
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

2707
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

2708
01:06:56.550 --> 01:06:57.383
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

2709
01:06:57.730 --> 01:06:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2710
01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.080
<v Speaker 1>do you like this way?</v>

2711
01:06:59.150 --> 01:07:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I think that all the time,</v>

2712
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:01.390
<v Speaker 1>that's often arm crush.</v>

2713
01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.310
<v Speaker 1>That's how your legs will be often failed.</v>

2714
01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:04.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm crushed to the arm bar.</v>

2715
01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2716
01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:05.883
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

2717
01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you prefer it like that or do you know for the legs,</v>

2718
01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:13.820
<v Speaker 1>that's when the legs are,</v>

2719
01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.100
<v Speaker 1>the legs aren't perfect,</v>

2720
01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:20.310
<v Speaker 1>meaning ankles are crossed over the far elbow or shoulder.</v>

2721
01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2722
01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.540
<v Speaker 1>that's perfect.</v>

2723
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2724
01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

2725
01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you just can't have it perfect.</v>

2726
01:07:24.851 --> 01:07:29.150
<v Speaker 1>So that is if Gerald Harris would have had a good corkscrew,</v>

2727
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:30.010
<v Speaker 1>a good hitchhiker,</v>

2728
01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.120
<v Speaker 1>he could've got out.</v>

2729
01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:31.940
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2730
01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:36.730
<v Speaker 1>you gotta have that and then chamber ready to go and you got to rep it a couple</v>

2731
01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:37.151
<v Speaker 1>thousand times.</v>

2732
01:07:37.151 --> 01:07:39.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a very technical move.</v>

2733
01:07:39.251 --> 01:07:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Rembert remember when Carl prissy and fought Matt Serra?</v>

2734
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.713
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

2735
01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And Carl prison,</v>

2736
01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:47.410
<v Speaker 1>one of them almost had an armbar.</v>

2737
01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Carl almost had Matt.</v>

2738
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:52.720
<v Speaker 1>And then Matt hit a perfect corkscrew hitchhiker out of it.</v>

2739
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:55.480
<v Speaker 1>So if you have those in the chamber ready to go,</v>

2740
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:56.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2741
01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:57.910
<v Speaker 1>the legs need to be perfect.</v>

2742
01:07:57.930 --> 01:07:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2743
01:07:58.690 --> 01:07:59.570
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was thinking,</v>

2744
01:07:59.571 --> 01:08:04.110
<v Speaker 1>that the left shoulder had more mobility than it would if you had a cut over.</v>

2745
01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:05.590
<v Speaker 1>But it was so tight.</v>

2746
01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:06.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2747
01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2748
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:09.700
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting how some guys like chew,</v>

2749
01:08:09.701 --> 01:08:14.701
<v Speaker 1>they get a certain way of doing it like that and then they choose that over the</v>

2750
01:08:14.801 --> 01:08:15.380
<v Speaker 1>other way.</v>

2751
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.660
<v Speaker 1>They'll just sign it.</v>

2752
01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2753
01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:18.141
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

2754
01:08:18.141 --> 01:08:18.780
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>

2755
01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:21.110
<v Speaker 1>if he want to try to get it perfect first,</v>

2756
01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.130
<v Speaker 1>he would have lost it.</v>

2757
01:08:22.190 --> 01:08:23.750
<v Speaker 1>But you know how some guys do that though.</v>

2758
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Some guys will choose like a specific way to lock up an arm bar or an arm</v>

2759
01:08:28.131 --> 01:08:31.100
<v Speaker 1>triangle and it might not even be like the most effective,</v>

2760
01:08:31.101 --> 01:08:32.720
<v Speaker 1>but they do it that way so much.</v>

2761
01:08:32.721 --> 01:08:34.070
<v Speaker 1>They get it locked down.</v>

2762
01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.220
<v Speaker 1>There's so many variations that you can hit that armbar.</v>

2763
01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:38.083
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2764
01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:40.700
<v Speaker 1>you could hit it belly down on your side,</v>

2765
01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:41.600
<v Speaker 1>on your back.</v>

2766
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:42.463
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2767
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:45.110
<v Speaker 1>ideally if you're controlling the action,</v>

2768
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.990
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get that arm bar and you're going to be on your back and he's</v>

2769
01:08:47.991 --> 01:08:49.550
<v Speaker 1>going to be on his back and spider web.</v>

2770
01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.620
<v Speaker 1>If you're controlling everything but shit,</v>

2771
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:53.750
<v Speaker 1>the guy's a beast and starts moving.</v>

2772
01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:58.100
<v Speaker 1>You got to move with them and you gotta you gotta make sure that you have the</v>

2773
01:08:58.101 --> 01:09:03.101
<v Speaker 1>skills to get that arm bar in any of the positions in the scramble.</v>

2774
01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when people were almost always doing the rear naked choke with</v>

2775
01:09:07.761 --> 01:09:08.900
<v Speaker 1>the palm on the back of the head?</v>

2776
01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:11.840
<v Speaker 1>It was almost always of hiding it.</v>

2777
01:09:11.841 --> 01:09:13.480
<v Speaker 1>You're saying instead of doing the chronic away,</v>

2778
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.510
<v Speaker 1>it was always palm to the back of the head and then it switched and everybody</v>

2779
01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:17.810
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

2780
01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2781
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:23.240
<v Speaker 1>that's way better if you can get it in the gloves and sometimes it's hard to get</v>

2782
01:09:23.241 --> 01:09:28.241
<v Speaker 1>the gloves fate or Nick Emelianenko tracked down by FBI agents at Bella</v>

2786
01:09:38.011 --> 01:09:40.610
<v Speaker 1>And there might be some Russian collusion.</v>

2787
01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.250
<v Speaker 1>They're going to find pictures of him and Trump has this real,</v>

2789
01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:46.670
<v Speaker 1>we reported it from here.</v>

2790
01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:46.911
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2791
01:09:46.911 --> 01:09:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm not digging it.</v>

2792
01:09:47.730 --> 01:09:51.230
<v Speaker 1>So your other places had it too.</v>

2797
01:10:00.221 --> 01:10:02.420
<v Speaker 1>You were saying before about Invisalign.</v>

2798
01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Invisalign does work.</v>

2799
01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.600
<v Speaker 1>The thing is no,</v>

2800
01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:06.320
<v Speaker 1>he probably,</v>

2801
01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.460
<v Speaker 1>he probably takes him out.</v>

2802
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:10.610
<v Speaker 1>You got to keep him in and once you take them out for life,</v>

2803
01:10:10.611 --> 01:10:11.421
<v Speaker 1>you got at night,</v>

2804
01:10:11.421 --> 01:10:12.730
<v Speaker 1>you got to sleep with the routine.</v>

2805
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2806
01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:14.990

01:10:15.651 --> 01:10:16.251
<v Speaker 1>I get lazy.</v>

2809
01:10:16.251 --> 01:10:17.960
<v Speaker 1>So you're supposed to do it every night.</v>

2810
01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2811
01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:21.470
<v Speaker 1>if you go three or four nights without using the retainer,</v>

2812
01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.300
<v Speaker 1>your teeth go back to the eye.</v>

2813
01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.100
<v Speaker 1>They used to be shit.</v>

2814
01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Just go with the metal for like three months.</v>

2815
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Even with when you're done with the metal ones,</v>

2816
01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:29.210
<v Speaker 1>you still need to wear retainers,</v>

2817
01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:29.991
<v Speaker 1>your teeth,</v>

2818
01:10:29.991 --> 01:10:30.501
<v Speaker 1>we'll go back.</v>

2819
01:10:30.501 --> 01:10:31.251
<v Speaker 1>It's like muscle memory,</v>

2820
01:10:31.251 --> 01:10:31.671
<v Speaker 1>your teeth.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's already a dead person there.</v>

3129
01:18:26.491 --> 01:18:28.830
<v Speaker 4>you can only cover so much of it in a 90 minute movie.</v>

3130
01:18:28.831 --> 01:18:29.664
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:41.610
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

3139
01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:43.650
<v Speaker 4>They have her on the phone with Bill Clinton.</v>

3140
01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:44.401
<v Speaker 4>Bill Clinton,</v>

3141
01:18:44.401 --> 01:18:45.020
<v Speaker 4>who like,</v>

3142
01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.250
<v Speaker 4>he's telling her I'm going to walk.</v>

3143
01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:48.150
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not he said that,</v>

3144
01:18:48.151 --> 01:18:49.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't know cause he's dead.</v>

3145
01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:49.741
<v Speaker 4>No one knows.</v>

3146
01:18:49.741 --> 01:18:50.490
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3147
01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:51.840
<v Speaker 4>And he's telling her it was,</v>

3148
01:18:51.841 --> 01:18:52.321
<v Speaker 4>trust me,</v>

3149
01:18:52.321 --> 01:18:53.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to walk right out of here.</v>

3150
01:18:53.341 --> 01:18:54.540
<v Speaker 4>And they're all laughing and she's like,</v>

3151
01:18:54.541 --> 01:18:55.440
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to walk anyway.</v>

3152
01:18:55.650 --> 01:18:56.483
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

3153
01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:57.810
<v Speaker 4>Mrs Prosecutor,</v>

3154
01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.360
<v Speaker 4>Bill Clinton's on the phone and it's governor Clinton.</v>

3155
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:01.050
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3156
01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:01.231
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3157
01:19:01.231 --> 01:19:02.064
<v Speaker 4>And you see her go,</v>

3158
01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:02.970
<v Speaker 4>you see her,</v>

3159
01:19:02.970 --> 01:19:03.930
<v Speaker 4>just get pissed off.</v>

3160
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.501
<v Speaker 4>The next thing you know,</v>

3161
01:19:04.501 --> 01:19:06.270
<v Speaker 4>they're uncuffing him and he's leaving.</v>

3162
01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:09.630
<v Speaker 4>So they're letting you know that Bill Clinton.</v>

3163
01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:10.740
<v Speaker 4>And if they,</v>

3164
01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:14.650
<v Speaker 4>if the only way you could put that in a movie is there has to be truth,</v>

3165
01:19:14.651 --> 01:19:14.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3166
01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:16.710
<v Speaker 4>Some truth to him,</v>

3167
01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:17.011
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

3168
01:19:17.011 --> 01:19:20.160
<v Speaker 4>there's gotta be some sort of a documented record of him making that call.</v>

3169
01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.820
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3170
01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:21.960
<v Speaker 4>He made that call.</v>

3171
01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.730
<v Speaker 4>He had to have made that call.</v>

3172
01:19:23.731 --> 01:19:25.200
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't switch defamation,</v>

3173
01:19:25.210 --> 01:19:28.530
<v Speaker 4>which of course Clinton and he is the governor.</v>

3174
01:19:28.531 --> 01:19:31.140
<v Speaker 4>So there's probably a record of him saying,</v>

3175
01:19:31.290 --> 01:19:32.340
<v Speaker 4>let that guy go.</v>

3176
01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:37.050
<v Speaker 4>And so the reason they think is because in the film,</v>

3177
01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:40.320
<v Speaker 4>this is what they're saying is that he was tied in with the CIA and somehow or</v>

3178
01:19:40.321 --> 01:19:44.430
<v Speaker 4>another through the CIA using him for reconnaissance photos and stuff like that.</v>

3179
01:19:44.431 --> 01:19:47.370
<v Speaker 4>And they eventually got hooked up these drug dealers and started selling drugs.</v>

3180
01:19:47.371 --> 01:19:51.270
<v Speaker 4>The CIA was in on it and they were allowing him to do it and he was getting them</v>

3181
01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:55.620
<v Speaker 4>photographs and Intel from all these different drug places.</v>

3182
01:19:55.621 --> 01:19:59.040
<v Speaker 4>And in return they were letting him do whatever he did and taking a piece of it</v>

3183
01:19:59.041 --> 01:19:59.430
<v Speaker 4>problems,</v>

3184
01:19:59.430 --> 01:20:00.870
<v Speaker 4>which you mentioned Mena Arkansas.</v>

3185
01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:01.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3186
01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:01.681
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3187
01:20:01.681 --> 01:20:02.341
<v Speaker 4>They mentioned all the,</v>

3188
01:20:02.341 --> 01:20:02.641
<v Speaker 4>all the,</v>

3189
01:20:02.641 --> 01:20:04.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's where Bill Clinton was the governor of nature.</v>

3190
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.780
<v Speaker 4>The only found out about all this stuff cause two kids were,</v>

3191
01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:12.690
<v Speaker 4>they were murdered and they told the parents that the kids had gotten high and</v>

3192
01:20:12.691 --> 01:20:14.370
<v Speaker 4>fell asleep on the train tracks.</v>

3193
01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:18.220
<v Speaker 4>But the parents did an independent autopsy and found stab wounds in the kids.</v>

3194
01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:19.141
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

3195
01:20:19.141 --> 01:20:19.831
<v Speaker 4>oh Jesus,</v>

3196
01:20:19.831 --> 01:20:20.940
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck happened here?</v>

3197
01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:23.790
<v Speaker 4>And then slowly but surely the whole thing unravels.</v>

3198
01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.920
<v Speaker 4>They witnessed a drug drop.</v>

3199
01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:26.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3200
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.330
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3201
01:20:27.331 --> 01:20:29.400
<v Speaker 4>well they couldn't have any witnesses,</v>

3202
01:20:29.401 --> 01:20:30.234
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

3203
01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.450
<v Speaker 4>They made me like it was lit case who killed,</v>

3204
01:20:33.451 --> 01:20:36.240
<v Speaker 4>go to youtube and just punch in a CIA,</v>

3205
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:36.870
<v Speaker 4>Mena,</v>

3206
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:37.560
<v Speaker 4>Arkansas,</v>

3207
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.900
<v Speaker 4>cocaine blow and you get the host.</v>

3208
01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:40.734
<v Speaker 4>It's a sitter.</v>

3209
01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:41.933
<v Speaker 4>So he kills those.</v>

3210
01:20:42.010 --> 01:20:43.140
<v Speaker 4>It could be a two kids.</v>

3211
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:44.580
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

3212
01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:46.290
<v Speaker 4>We don't know somebody who was in our,</v>

3213
01:20:46.291 --> 01:20:47.420
<v Speaker 4>assume the cin.</v>

3214
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:51.420
<v Speaker 4>The kids must have seen the drugs be dropped and whoever was selling the drugs,</v>

3215
01:20:51.421 --> 01:20:52.081
<v Speaker 4>moving the drugs,</v>

3216
01:20:52.081 --> 01:20:54.750
<v Speaker 4>they just decided to kill these kids cause they couldn't take a chance.</v>

3217
01:20:54.751 --> 01:20:55.890
<v Speaker 4>The kids keeping their mouth shut.</v>

3218
01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:57.083
<v Speaker 4>So they killed them.</v>

3219
01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.770
<v Speaker 4>And apparently that was just one thing.</v>

3220
01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:00.870
<v Speaker 4>Now in the movie,</v>

3221
01:21:00.871 --> 01:21:02.760
<v Speaker 4>the way they haven't made up is like that.</v>

3222
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:05.880
<v Speaker 4>That was just one thing that's sort of straw that broke the camel's back.</v>

3223
01:21:05.881 --> 01:21:06.601
<v Speaker 4>They don't even have that.</v>

3224
01:21:06.601 --> 01:21:08.520
<v Speaker 4>And I don't even remember if they had that in the movie.</v>

3225
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:09.301
<v Speaker 4>The kids,</v>

3226
01:21:09.301 --> 01:21:10.140
<v Speaker 4>did they have that in the movie?</v>

3227
01:21:10.141 --> 01:21:10.471
<v Speaker 4>The murder?</v>

3228
01:21:10.471 --> 01:21:11.460
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have the murder of the kids.</v>

3229
01:21:11.461 --> 01:21:12.294
<v Speaker 4>No they didn't.</v>

3230
01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:14.580
<v Speaker 4>But what they did have is these people were,</v>

3231
01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:16.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean everybody was rich.</v>

3232
01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:19.560
<v Speaker 4>There were all coming in and buying things and everyone's like,</v>

3233
01:21:19.561 --> 01:21:21.300
<v Speaker 4>where the fuck is all this money coming from?</v>

3234
01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.193
<v Speaker 4>Who was rich?</v>

3235
01:21:22.230 --> 01:21:23.490
<v Speaker 4>The people that we're working with,</v>

3236
01:21:23.491 --> 01:21:25.780
<v Speaker 4>Barry seal's like his brother-in-law,</v>

3237
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:27.820
<v Speaker 4>like his wife's brother apparently.</v>

3238
01:21:27.821 --> 01:21:28.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that was a real person,</v>

3239
01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:29.461
<v Speaker 4>but in the,</v>

3240
01:21:29.461 --> 01:21:30.450
<v Speaker 4>in the movie he's,</v>

3241
01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:32.820
<v Speaker 4>he's balling out of control and he's a,</v>

3242
01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:36.420
<v Speaker 4>he's got some fucking ridiculous souped up car and he's got money coming out of</v>

3243
01:21:36.421 --> 01:21:39.180
<v Speaker 4>his pockets and he stuffed in his pocket and he gets caught by a cop.</v>

3244
01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:40.201
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3245
01:21:40.201 --> 01:21:42.150
<v Speaker 4>and I dunno if that happened in real life,</v>

3246
01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:45.180
<v Speaker 4>but in the movie they made it seem like everybody was just,</v>

3247
01:21:45.181 --> 01:21:46.710
<v Speaker 4>there was so much money flowing around,</v>

3248
01:21:46.711 --> 01:21:47.670
<v Speaker 4>it didn't make any sense.</v>

3249
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.680
<v Speaker 4>They were burying it in his backyard.</v>

3250
01:21:49.681 --> 01:21:49.800
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

3251
01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.760
<v Speaker 4>when they busted him,</v>

3252
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.470
<v Speaker 4>it was like in the movie.</v>

3253
01:21:52.650 --> 01:21:53.311
<v Speaker 4>Now again,</v>

3254
01:21:53.311 --> 01:21:56.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if this was real because you know what fucked me up man.</v>

3255
01:21:56.821 --> 01:22:00.420
<v Speaker 4>That Mark Schultz movie [inaudible] yes,</v>

3256
01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:05.600
<v Speaker 4>because I know Mark Schultz fought one time in the UFC because I watched it.</v>

3257
01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.370
<v Speaker 4>He fought big daddy Goodrich.</v>

3258
01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:11.690
<v Speaker 4>He took big daddy Goodrich down and beat the shit out and they didn't use good.</v>

3259
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.511
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3260
01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:12.851

3266
01:22:24.130 --> 01:22:24.781
<v Speaker 4>That's the other one.</v>

3267
01:22:24.781 --> 01:22:25.250

01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3274
01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:36.830

3275
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:40.830
<v Speaker 4>it's a super set of a shit because he doesn't fight Gary Goodrich at the end.</v>

3276
01:22:41.010 --> 01:22:42.750
<v Speaker 4>Why would you change history?</v>

3277
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:46.050
<v Speaker 4>Like this is what we're talking about in the soup.</v>

3278
01:22:46.230 --> 01:22:47.490
<v Speaker 4>No fucking way.</v>

3279
01:22:47.670 --> 01:22:48.780

<v Speaker 4>Check cause I can't trust anything.</v>

3281
01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:55.110
<v Speaker 4>I can't trust anything in a movie like Hollywood doesn't know.</v>

3282
01:22:55.111 --> 01:22:55.944
<v Speaker 4>Find me.</v>

3283
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:56.850
<v Speaker 4>The movie was great.</v>

3284
01:22:56.851 --> 01:22:59.280
<v Speaker 4>Steve Carell's could ask [inaudible] amazing as a nose on.</v>

3285
01:22:59.410 --> 01:23:00.300
<v Speaker 4>He's amazing.</v>

3286
01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:03.390
<v Speaker 4>But I know what really happened.</v>

3287
01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:05.500
<v Speaker 4>I know that he fought big daddy Goodrich.</v>

3288
01:23:05.530 --> 01:23:07.880
<v Speaker 4>Why isn't he fighting big Daddy Gorge in your fucking movie?</v>

3289
01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:08.870
<v Speaker 4>We'll over the next it.</v>

3290
01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:12.310
<v Speaker 4>You can't overlook that she fought once.</v>

3291
01:23:12.311 --> 01:23:13.270
<v Speaker 4>It's a part of the move.</v>

3292
01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:14.030
<v Speaker 4>I hear you man.</v>

3293
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.150
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3294
01:23:14.150 --> 01:23:14.983
<v Speaker 4>it's a very,</v>

3295
01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:16.990
<v Speaker 4>it's really easy.</v>

3296
01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:17.980
<v Speaker 4>Just get a black guy.</v>

3297
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:18.843
<v Speaker 4>So what?</v>

3298
01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:22.000
<v Speaker 4>Sign off on his likeness or it doesn't have to,</v>

3299
01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:23.590
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't have to its history.</v>

3300
01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:24.790
<v Speaker 4>There's a reality to it.</v>

3301
01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:26.440
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to have him say his name.</v>

3302
01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:28.720
<v Speaker 4>You show big daddy Goodrich across from them.</v>

3303
01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:29.740
<v Speaker 4>You show him,</v>

3304
01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:31.890
<v Speaker 4>you know you have mark Scholz,</v>

3305
01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:35.350
<v Speaker 4>you'd just cut into it right when they're introducing and have a black and then</v>

3306
01:23:35.351 --> 01:23:37.280
<v Speaker 4>have the guy and you know have them where the Geeky,</v>

3307
01:23:37.281 --> 01:23:39.000
<v Speaker 4>just like big daddy Goodrich had a key on.</v>

3308
01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:40.370
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of navigate through.</v>

3309
01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:41.411
<v Speaker 4>This is stupid.</v>

3310
01:23:41.411 --> 01:23:42.610
<v Speaker 4>You can't change history.</v>

3311
01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:44.800
<v Speaker 4>This is a real historical moment.</v>

3312
01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:49.750
<v Speaker 4>It was a moment when one of the best wrestlers on the fucking planet earth,</v>

3313
01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:50.681
<v Speaker 4>a legit,</v>

3314
01:23:50.681 --> 01:23:55.510
<v Speaker 4>super high level Olympian fought in the UFC and he only fought once and you got</v>

3315
01:23:55.511 --> 01:23:59.410
<v Speaker 4>to see how easy he took an elite MMA fighter down and just dominated him.</v>

3316
01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:02.170
<v Speaker 4>That was an important historical moment in MMA.</v>

3317
01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:02.570
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

3318
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.891
<v Speaker 4>Range.</v>

3319
01:24:02.891 --> 01:24:05.860
<v Speaker 4>They miss the changing who breaks Jackie Robinson's record,</v>

3320
01:24:05.861 --> 01:24:07.990
<v Speaker 4>a Babe Ruth's record or or Mickey Mantle.</v>

3321
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:09.820
<v Speaker 4>You changing his,</v>

3322
01:24:09.821 --> 01:24:11.980
<v Speaker 4>you could never do that with baseball and nobody would let you.</v>

3323
01:24:11.981 --> 01:24:15.250
<v Speaker 4>You don't think that because those are major sports in a lot of people would</v>

3324
01:24:15.251 --> 01:24:16.540
<v Speaker 4>know that with MMA there's like,</v>

3325
01:24:16.541 --> 01:24:16.731
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3326
01:24:16.731 --> 01:24:17.564
<v Speaker 4>whatever man.</v>

3327
01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:19.360
<v Speaker 4>They might have done that,</v>

3328
01:24:19.361 --> 01:24:22.330
<v Speaker 4>but that makes me not trust everything else in the movie.</v>

3329
01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.030
<v Speaker 4>Because if you did that with a very important point,</v>

3330
01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:26.410
<v Speaker 4>let's a very important point,</v>

3331
01:24:26.411 --> 01:24:27.190
<v Speaker 4>because people to go,</v>

3332
01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:31.630
<v Speaker 4>which is a legend that the Paul Herrera knockout and Paul Herrera had him like a</v>

3333
01:24:31.631 --> 01:24:35.650
<v Speaker 4>fireman's carry and he hit him with all those LDLs and that's probably the most</v>

3334
01:24:35.651 --> 01:24:40.130
<v Speaker 4>brutal Kale and so history kind of them.</v>

3335
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:41.111
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly,</v>

3336
01:24:41.111 --> 01:24:42.250
<v Speaker 4>certainly one of them.</v>

3337
01:24:42.251 --> 01:24:43.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was a terrifying,</v>

3338
01:24:43.601 --> 01:24:44.660
<v Speaker 4>terrifying Kao.</v>

3339
01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.660
<v Speaker 4>How easy is that for them to fix too?</v>

3340
01:24:46.661 --> 01:24:50.710
<v Speaker 4>If you just put some sort of reference to Gary Goodrich to big daddy Goodrich,</v>

3341
01:24:50.770 --> 01:24:52.900
<v Speaker 4>he had kicked on fry,</v>

3342
01:24:52.901 --> 01:24:54.370
<v Speaker 4>remember that he's a monster.</v>

3343
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:55.710
<v Speaker 4>Kicked him and Kayo them.</v>

3344
01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:56.591
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3345
01:24:56.591 --> 01:25:00.520
<v Speaker 4>big daddy Goodrich's an important historical figure in MMA.</v>

3346
01:25:00.521 --> 01:25:03.280
<v Speaker 4>You can't just change the name of the guy.</v>

3347
01:25:03.281 --> 01:25:05.440
<v Speaker 4>Mark Schultz fights can movie though.</v>

3348
01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:06.513
<v Speaker 4>I lost,</v>

3349
01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:07.820
<v Speaker 4>I lost faith in a,</v>

3350
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:11.230
<v Speaker 4>based on a true story movies when the Dragon came out,</v>

3351
01:25:11.231 --> 01:25:12.370
<v Speaker 4>the Bruce Bruce Lee movie,</v>

3352
01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:13.470
<v Speaker 4>but Jason Scotland,</v>

3353
01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:13.990
<v Speaker 4>he did a,</v>

3354
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.380
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

3355
01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:18.850
<v Speaker 4>he played Bruce Lee and I love so much bullshit in there.</v>

3356
01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

3357
01:25:20.081 --> 01:25:24.670
<v Speaker 4>I love filled with bullshit it in the movie,</v>

3358
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.721
<v Speaker 4>in the movie,</v>

3359
01:25:25.721 --> 01:25:29.470
<v Speaker 4>he had a real fight at the long beach arena.</v>

3360
01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:30.490
<v Speaker 4>He was just,</v>

3361
01:25:30.490 --> 01:25:31.031
<v Speaker 4>in reality,</v>

3362
01:25:31.031 --> 01:25:32.320
<v Speaker 4>he was just doing demonstrations,</v>

3363
01:25:32.321 --> 01:25:33.220
<v Speaker 4>but in the movie they had him.</v>

3364
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:34.660
<v Speaker 4>He didn't have a real fight though.</v>

3365
01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:36.080
<v Speaker 4>He didn't have a real fight there.</v>

3366
01:25:36.970 --> 01:25:39.250
<v Speaker 4>And then a movie it during the fight,</v>

3367
01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:40.270
<v Speaker 4>his opponent,</v>

3368
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:40.660
<v Speaker 4>bro,</v>

3369
01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:44.980
<v Speaker 4>like broke his back with a sidekick in the movie he was in.</v>

3370
01:25:44.981 --> 01:25:47.080
<v Speaker 4>The hospital's heartbreaking in reality.</v>

3371
01:25:47.081 --> 01:25:47.861
<v Speaker 4>Fucked his backup.</v>

3372
01:25:47.861 --> 01:25:48.310
<v Speaker 4>Lifting,</v>

3373
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:49.143
<v Speaker 4>lifting weights.</v>

3374
01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:52.390
<v Speaker 4>He was lifting weights is back in that fight.</v>

3375
01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:53.000
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3376
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.600
<v Speaker 4>he never had to redeem himself mostly to death.</v>

3377
01:25:55.810 --> 01:25:57.490
<v Speaker 4>But he never had a professional fight.</v>

3378
01:25:57.491 --> 01:25:58.060
<v Speaker 4>Ever,</v>

3379
01:25:58.060 --> 01:25:58.391
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

3380
01:25:58.391 --> 01:25:58.620
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3381
01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:58.841
<v Speaker 4>Never.</v>

3382
01:25:58.841 --> 01:25:59.650
<v Speaker 4>Not One fight.</v>

3383
01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:00.483
<v Speaker 4>Never.</v>

3384
01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:00.941
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3385
01:26:00.941 --> 01:26:02.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he ever competed.</v>

3386
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he had an amateur</v>

3387
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:04.560
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

3388
01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.590
<v Speaker 1>He fought like he had on the streets,</v>

3389
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:08.451
<v Speaker 1>on the streets,</v>

3390
01:26:08.451 --> 01:26:13.451
<v Speaker 1>and he fought in the YMC Aa for the right to teach Non-asians Kung Fu in San</v>

3391
01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:14.811
<v Speaker 1>Francisco.</v>

3392
01:26:14.811 --> 01:26:15.840
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a flower was a thing.</v>

3393
01:26:15.930 --> 01:26:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3394
01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:16.980
<v Speaker 1>That he had real fights,</v>

3395
01:26:16.981 --> 01:26:17.721
<v Speaker 1>that he was a real fighter,</v>

3396
01:26:17.721 --> 01:26:19.670
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't have a real professional fight.</v>

3397
01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:21.200
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have anything like that.</v>

3398
01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.210
<v Speaker 1>He broke his back lifting weights.</v>

3399
01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Not in a professional fights.</v>

3400
01:26:25.011 --> 01:26:25.844
<v Speaker 1>Was He lifted?</v>

3401
01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:27.651
<v Speaker 1>When I saw that,</v>

3402
01:26:27.651 --> 01:26:28.221
<v Speaker 1>I thought okay,</v>

3403
01:26:28.221 --> 01:26:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I can't trust any Hollywood movies now based on a true story and gains because</v>

3404
01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:32.394
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit,</v>

3405
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:33.291
<v Speaker 1>they got,</v>

3406
01:26:33.291 --> 01:26:35.390
<v Speaker 1>they got a paint a narrative a little bit.</v>

3407
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:36.403
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3408
01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:37.190
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3409
01:26:37.190 --> 01:26:38.023
<v Speaker 1>Well no you can't.</v>

3410
01:26:38.890 --> 01:26:39.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3411
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:39.201
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3412
01:26:39.201 --> 01:26:39.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3413
01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:39.541
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3414
01:26:39.541 --> 01:26:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Now it's,</v>

3415
01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.350
<v Speaker 1>now it's inspired by true events.</v>

3416
01:26:42.351 --> 01:26:42.791
<v Speaker 1>Files.</v>

3417

01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.980
<v Speaker 1>You can't add stuff.</v>

3421
01:26:45.981 --> 01:26:47.430
<v Speaker 1>You can't add a gay relationship.</v>

3422
01:26:47.431 --> 01:26:49.280
<v Speaker 1>You can't add a karate kick to the back.</v>

3423
01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:50.250
<v Speaker 1>That fucks you up.</v>

3424
01:26:50.250 --> 01:26:50.961
<v Speaker 1>Puts in the hospital.</v>

3425
01:26:50.961 --> 01:26:51.740

01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:53.030
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

3429
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:55.070
<v Speaker 1>in reality he had to fight,</v>

3430
01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:55.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3431
01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:56.031
<v Speaker 1>if he,</v>

3432
01:26:56.031 --> 01:26:58.010
<v Speaker 1>if he beat this guy out of y Ymca,</v>

3433
01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:01.700
<v Speaker 1>he had the right to teach non agents cause that was an issue back then.</v>

3434
01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:02.653
<v Speaker 1>It was the 60s.</v>

3435
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3436
01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:06.380
<v Speaker 1>They're like why are you teaching in Americans are shit.</v>

3437
01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:07.191
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

3438
01:27:07.191 --> 01:27:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll teach anybody who the fuck I want.</v>

3439
01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:12.050
<v Speaker 1>So he had to fight and went to wine at a YMCAs in the movie.</v>

3440
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:13.011
<v Speaker 1>In the movie.</v>

3441
01:27:13.011 --> 01:27:17.840
<v Speaker 1>It was in an underground cavern with like elders and these little spots and the</v>

3442
01:27:17.850 --> 01:27:19.250
<v Speaker 1>scratchy did these,</v>

3444
01:27:23.511 --> 01:27:23.780
<v Speaker 1>him?</v>

3445
01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:24.141
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3446
01:27:24.141 --> 01:27:27.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's like it was in a weird like Illuminati.</v>

3447
01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I love that part though.</v>

3448
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:29.990
<v Speaker 1>I hate when they do that.</v>

3449
01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:30.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3450
01:27:30.201 --> 01:27:31.034
<v Speaker 1>it was all bullshit.</v>

3451
01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:33.053
<v Speaker 1>It was a great room.</v>

3452
01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Can't do that about a real watch of documentary.</v>

3453
01:27:36.021 --> 01:27:36.760
<v Speaker 1>You fuck.</v>

3454
01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.680
<v Speaker 1>That's like when Abraham Lincoln fought the vampires.</v>

3455
01:27:39.681 --> 01:27:41.990
<v Speaker 1>It was obvious it wasn't really that good ass movie.</v>

3456
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:46.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a good movie though.</v>

3457
01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:49.190
<v Speaker 1>What if that was real?</v>

01:31:37.681 --> 01:31:37.831
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3604
01:31:37.831 --> 01:31:37.981
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3605
01:31:37.981 --> 01:31:38.910
<v Speaker 2>They didn't cancel the mission.</v>

3606
01:31:38.911 --> 01:31:40.170
<v Speaker 2>They canceled the Moon Rover.</v>

3607
01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:41.460
<v Speaker 2>You canceled it.</v>

3608
01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:43.350
<v Speaker 2>They canceled the,</v>

3609
01:31:43.351 --> 01:31:45.630
<v Speaker 2>the construction of the moon and everybody's confused.</v>

3610
01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:48.690
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how they did that because this is like the last moon rover that</v>

3611
01:31:48.691 --> 01:31:48.800
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3612
01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:52.110
<v Speaker 2>unless they have some new top secret moon rover that they don't want to let</v>

3613
01:31:52.111 --> 01:31:52.861
<v Speaker 2>anybody know about it.</v>

3614
01:31:52.861 --> 01:31:54.510
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they found some new cool shit.</v>

3615
01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

3616
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:56.183
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

3617
01:31:57.660 --> 01:31:58.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3618
01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they can't go.</v>

3619
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:00.821
<v Speaker 3>Well actually,</v>

3620
01:32:00.821 --> 01:32:03.400
<v Speaker 3>if we really did go in and like,</v>

3621
01:32:03.401 --> 01:32:03.730
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3622
01:32:03.730 --> 01:32:04.563
<v Speaker 3>give us the money.</v>

3623
01:32:04.570 --> 01:32:05.403
<v Speaker 3>Let's figure it out.</v>

3624
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:05.771
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3625
01:32:05.771 --> 01:32:06.461
<v Speaker 3>we'll figure it out.</v>

3626
01:32:06.461 --> 01:32:07.450
<v Speaker 3>We got 19 billion.</v>

3627
01:32:07.790 --> 01:32:09.490
<v Speaker 3>If we really didn't find out,</v>

3628
01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:11.080
<v Speaker 3>nobody else is working on it.</v>

3629
01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Putting a the rover on the moon,</v>

3630
01:32:13.001 --> 01:32:13.660
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3631
01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:13.950
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

3632
01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:16.570
<v Speaker 3>and the NASA wasn't either until Trump said,</v>

3633
01:32:16.571 --> 01:32:17.404
<v Speaker 3>here's the money,</v>

3634
01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:18.490
<v Speaker 3>let's go to the fucking moon.</v>

3635
01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:19.480
<v Speaker 3>And then we're going to Mars.</v>

3636
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:20.211
<v Speaker 3>She matched.</v>

3637
01:32:20.211 --> 01:32:23.590
<v Speaker 3>If Trump goes on TV and says there's a lot of things talk about,</v>

3638
01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.670
<v Speaker 3>one of them is,</v>

3639
01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:25.840
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible tragedy.</v>

3640
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:26.950
<v Speaker 3>We've never been to the moon.</v>

3641
01:32:26.951 --> 01:32:27.784
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

3642
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.930
<v Speaker 3>That's some shit he would do.</v>

3643
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:30.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3644
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3645
01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:31.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3646
01:32:31.290 --> 01:32:32.123
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know.</v>

3647
01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:33.070
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know.</v>

3648
01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:37.140
<v Speaker 3>How do you know he doesn't let him know he's too busy with us friends with Alex</v>

3649
01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:37.320
<v Speaker 3>Jones.</v>

3650
01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:40.600
<v Speaker 3>He's a really talked that much cause you can't,</v>

3651
01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:41.081
<v Speaker 3>they can't.</v>

3652
01:32:41.081 --> 01:32:41.681
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere they go,</v>

3653
01:32:41.681 --> 01:32:42.431
<v Speaker 3>the wearing wires,</v>

3654
01:32:42.431 --> 01:32:43.270
<v Speaker 3>everyone's wearing a wire.</v>

3655
01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:44.390
<v Speaker 3>Their phones are being tapped.</v>

3656
01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:47.470
<v Speaker 3>Q a nine is Qa and I've heard about that.</v>

3657
01:32:47.670 --> 01:32:48.520
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy shit.</v>

3658
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:49.603
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

3659
01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:53.800
<v Speaker 3>Qa non is someone in the Trump administration,</v>

3660
01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:58.630
<v Speaker 3>but people think it's someone in intelligence in the military who's dropping all</v>

3661
01:32:58.631 --> 01:33:00.850
<v Speaker 3>these clues on four Chan and eight Chan.</v>

3662
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.781
<v Speaker 3>So the whole thing is,</v>

3663
01:33:01.781 --> 01:33:02.441
<v Speaker 3>is it real?</v>

3664
01:33:02.441 --> 01:33:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Is it disinformation?</v>

3665
01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:04.600
<v Speaker 3>If someone playing a trick,</v>

3666
01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:05.790
<v Speaker 3>but it's he,</v>

3667
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:09.280
<v Speaker 3>he legally can't say what's going on behind the scenes.</v>

3668
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:10.210
<v Speaker 3>Nothing leg lock.</v>

3669
01:33:10.210 --> 01:33:11.043
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

3670
01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:14.950
<v Speaker 3>He legally can't say he's getting it because it's against the law.</v>

3671
01:33:14.951 --> 01:33:15.340
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>

3672
01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:17.320
<v Speaker 3>he's dropping all these clues and it's a,</v>

3673
01:33:17.321 --> 01:33:21.160
<v Speaker 3>it's someone named Q Anan and it's been going on for about three months and</v>

3674
01:33:21.161 --> 01:33:22.960
<v Speaker 3>there's all these people in the underground.</v>

3675
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.800
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3676
01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:28.180
<v Speaker 3>basically he's saying trust the president.</v>

3677
01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:32.890
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take a while to take down all these corrupt people at the top of</v>

3678
01:33:32.891 --> 01:33:34.990
<v Speaker 3>the FBI and the Department of Justice and all the shit.</v>

3679
01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:36.490
<v Speaker 3>We're going to take them down one by one.</v>

3680
01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:39.160
<v Speaker 3>So He's been dropping all these clues on how they're going to do it.</v>

3681
01:33:39.490 --> 01:33:40.450
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty interesting.</v>

3682
01:33:40.451 --> 01:33:42.520
<v Speaker 3>You listen to it every day has drops every day and it's,</v>

3683
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:43.331
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3684
01:33:43.331 --> 01:33:44.164
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3685
01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:45.070
<v Speaker 3>it gets addicting,</v>

3686
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:46.900
<v Speaker 3>but you don't know if it's real or not.</v>

3687
01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:47.441
<v Speaker 3>Like is it,</v>

3688
01:33:47.441 --> 01:33:48.700
<v Speaker 3>is it disinformation?</v>

3689
01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:50.500
<v Speaker 3>It's called Q Anan and Pete,</v>

3690
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:53.800
<v Speaker 3>he makes drops every day and leaves all these clues of what's going on behind</v>

3691
01:33:53.801 --> 01:33:54.190
<v Speaker 3>the scenes.</v>

3692
01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:56.560
<v Speaker 3>No one can trace back to find out who he is or anything like that.</v>

3693
01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:57.070
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3694
01:33:57.070 --> 01:33:59.380
<v Speaker 3>I think on four Chan or eight Chan,</v>

3695
01:33:59.410 --> 01:33:59.771
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

3696
01:33:59.771 --> 01:33:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3697
01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:00.730
<v Speaker 3>if you can,</v>

3698
01:34:00.730 --> 01:34:02.920
<v Speaker 3>you can hackers know how to drop information,</v>

3699
01:34:02.921 --> 01:34:04.360
<v Speaker 3>information without being tracked,</v>

3700
01:34:04.361 --> 01:34:04.561
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3701
01:34:04.561 --> 01:34:05.140
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

3702
01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:05.560
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3703
01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:06.130
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

3704
01:34:06.130 --> 01:34:07.680
<v Speaker 3>that's what's going on and on.</v>

3705
01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:08.171
<v Speaker 3>I know you have,</v>

3706
01:34:08.171 --> 01:34:08.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3707
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:08.601
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3708
01:34:08.601 --> 01:34:09.670
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of posts about it,</v>

3709
01:34:09.671 --> 01:34:10.504
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

3710
01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:11.860
<v Speaker 3>who knows if it's real or not,</v>

3711
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:13.660
<v Speaker 3>but the people that,</v>

3712
01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:13.931
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3713
01:34:13.931 --> 01:34:14.860
<v Speaker 3>there's people who who,</v>

3714
01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:15.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3715
01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:18.430
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy named Jerome Corsi who works for Alex Jones,</v>

3716
01:34:18.431 --> 01:34:22.510
<v Speaker 3>who that's his job is to analyze what's all of these clues of what's going on,</v>

3717
01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:24.190
<v Speaker 3>what Trump is doing behind the scenes,</v>

3718
01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:25.940
<v Speaker 3>because he's got the media all the time,</v>

3719
01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.470
<v Speaker 3>media,</v>

3720
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:27.303
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood,</v>

3721
01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:28.150
<v Speaker 3>FBI,</v>

3722
01:34:28.150 --> 01:34:32.920
<v Speaker 3>and what they're finding out is they're finding text messages and emails going</v>

3723
01:34:32.921 --> 01:34:33.970
<v Speaker 3>back and forth,</v>

3724
01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:35.183
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3725
01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:38.170

01:34:38.610 --> 01:34:39.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3727
01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:43.180
<v Speaker 3>running the government colluding to destroy Trump.</v>

3728
01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:44.651
<v Speaker 3>That's what's going on.</v>

3729
01:34:44.651 --> 01:34:46.840
<v Speaker 3>So for sure it's a crazy shun him around.</v>

3730
01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:47.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3731
01:34:47.650 --> 01:34:51.490
<v Speaker 3>none of those people that have been in politics but politics forever.</v>

3732
01:34:51.730 --> 01:34:53.110
<v Speaker 3>They didn't think he was going to win.</v>

3733
01:34:53.111 --> 01:34:55.540
<v Speaker 3>So they did all this shit thinking Hillary was gonna win,</v>

3734
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:56.980
<v Speaker 3>but now that he won,</v>

3735
01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.830
<v Speaker 3>they're going back and looking at all the text messages from all of these super</v>

3736
01:35:00.831 --> 01:35:01.880
<v Speaker 3>powerful people.</v>

3739
01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like game of Thrones for real.</v>

3740
01:35:08.271 --> 01:35:12.740
<v Speaker 3>You're not game of Thrones has like 50 characters and it would take you about a</v>

3741

<v Speaker 3>month to to to catch up on what's going on and it's just so much going on.</v>

3742
01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:17.750
<v Speaker 3>That's what's going on.</v>

3743
01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:22.910
<v Speaker 3>There's a game of Thrones going on right now but the media is only going to tell</v>

3745
01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:28.460

<v Speaker 3>Arm Triangle here.</v>

3747
01:35:30.370 --> 01:35:31.650
<v Speaker 3>There's another seminar.</v>

3750
01:35:39.931 --> 01:35:40.670
<v Speaker 3>He's talking to it.</v>

3751
01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:42.800
<v Speaker 3>You should jump to full guard and she jumped the full guard.</v>

3752
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:44.300
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think this is definitely done?</v>

3753
01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.141
<v Speaker 3>It's so deep in,</v>

3754
01:35:45.141 --> 01:35:46.640
<v Speaker 3>the guy's not doing anything with his left hand.</v>

3755
01:35:46.641 --> 01:35:47.474
<v Speaker 3>While he wasn't,</v>

3756
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:49.240
<v Speaker 3>if he just jumps down,</v>

3757
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:50.390
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

3758
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.601
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3759
01:35:50.601 --> 01:35:51.434
<v Speaker 3>it's over now.</v>

3760
01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:53.233
<v Speaker 3>It's no way.</v>

3761
01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:53.631
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

3762
01:35:53.631 --> 01:35:54.464
<v Speaker 3>He's going to</v>

3763
01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.610
<v Speaker 3>four five for submission,</v>

3764
01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:59.120
<v Speaker 3>arm triangle in full guard.</v>

3765
01:35:59.121 --> 01:35:59.780
<v Speaker 3>His bet.</v>

3766
01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:03.830
<v Speaker 3>And how about the arm triangle from standing position drags him to the ground</v>

3767
01:36:03.831 --> 01:36:04.191
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>

3768
01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:04.540
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>

3769
01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:04.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3770
01:36:04.710 --> 01:36:05.310
<v Speaker 3>that was sick.</v>

3771
01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:06.350
<v Speaker 3>That happens every now and then.</v>

3772
01:36:06.351 --> 01:36:09.570
<v Speaker 3>You see it every now and then when you gotta you gotta you gotta,</v>

3773
01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.900
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be tapping people so much with your arm triangle.</v>

3774
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:15.320
<v Speaker 3>You have so much faith in it and it's gotta be a Goto to take a chance like</v>

3775
01:36:15.321 --> 01:36:15.740
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3776
01:36:15.740 --> 01:36:16.910
<v Speaker 3>If it's not your go to.</v>

3777
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:19.700
<v Speaker 3>That's why you don't really see it because there's not that many fighters</v>

3778
01:36:19.701 --> 01:36:22.790
<v Speaker 3>overall in MMA that are known for amazing harm triangles.</v>

3779
01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:24.050
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of popular.</v>

3780
01:36:24.051 --> 01:36:24.884
<v Speaker 3>It is probably,</v>

3781
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3782
01:36:25.490 --> 01:36:30.490
<v Speaker 3>I would say 25% of MMA fighters have high level arm triangles.</v>

3783
01:36:31.521 --> 01:36:33.170
<v Speaker 3>I would say maybe that's a little high,</v>

3784
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:36.560
<v Speaker 3>but you know about 2020 5% well,</v>

3785
01:36:36.561 --> 01:36:39.980
<v Speaker 3>what he did there that was special was get sideways.</v>

3786
01:36:40.010 --> 01:36:42.260
<v Speaker 3>He was doing like a rear naked choke from the side.</v>

3787
01:36:42.261 --> 01:36:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Is that a Brazilian or a Mexican?</v>

3788
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.901
<v Speaker 3>What is his name?</v>

3789
01:36:44.901 --> 01:36:45.734
<v Speaker 3>Jamie</v>

3790
01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:47.693
<v Speaker 3>fought Samsung.</v>

3791
01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:50.420
<v Speaker 3>The Brazil flag on the short.</v>

3792
01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:51.283
<v Speaker 3>This is dope.</v>

01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:58.250
<v Speaker 3>He gets it super tight.</v>

3798
01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.350
<v Speaker 3>Will Sanchez Manual Sanchez</v>

3799
01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:03.493
<v Speaker 3>Mexicans.</v>

3800
01:37:03.650 --> 01:37:04.483

01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:07.040
<v Speaker 3>Do you know who needs to make it?</v>

3804
01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Come back to full guard.</v>

3805
01:37:09.201 --> 01:37:09.740
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

3806
01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:11.030
<v Speaker 3>See what he's doing with his left hand.</v>

3807
01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.010
<v Speaker 3>He's not really protecting anything.</v>

3808
01:37:13.011 --> 01:37:14.980
<v Speaker 3>So that shows me that uh,</v>

3809
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:17.390
<v Speaker 3>he kind of doesn't know how to get out of it.</v>

3810

01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:41.420
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to see him versus IB.</v>

3825
01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:41.810

<v Speaker 3>Don't want someone to lose the only amazing fight.</v>

3829
01:37:47.691 --> 01:37:47.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3830
01:37:47.841 --> 01:37:49.420
<v Speaker 3>you're just fought Frankie Edgar.</v>

3831
01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Well his last fight with frank get lost.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Got dismantled.</v>

3834
01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:55.830
<v Speaker 3>So you got to toss him fucking beat.</v>

3835
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Who could probably beat the top five right now.</v>

3836
01:37:58.530 --> 01:37:59.450
<v Speaker 2>So for a kid,</v>

3837
01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:00.613
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

3838
01:38:00.930 --> 01:38:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Who wouldn't want to see that?</v>

3839
01:38:02.010 --> 01:38:02.850
<v Speaker 2>The heart we do.</v>

3840
01:38:02.851 --> 01:38:03.481

3845
01:38:07.741 --> 01:38:09.690
<v Speaker 2>So for a year it's a huge risk.</v>

3846
01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:10.960
<v Speaker 2>So you can stop,</v>

3847

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough fucking fight for a man.</v>

3850
01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I have to Frankie Edgar,</v>

3867
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:52.890

<v Speaker 2>They're all from Dagestan place.</v>

3887
01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they trained,</v>

3888
01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:21.540
<v Speaker 2>maybe they came up together in the same club because I see this pretty big</v>

3889
01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:22.021
<v Speaker 2>Khabib.</v>

3890
01:39:22.021 --> 01:39:23.250

3895
01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.970
<v Speaker 2>But zombied is a very different game.</v>

3896
01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:31.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's not a wrestler per se.</v>

3897
01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:32.211
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3900
01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:35.560
<v Speaker 2>he's good at everything.</v>

3929
01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:15.040
<v Speaker 2>there's no way they take that fight.</v>

3930
01:40:15.330 --> 01:40:15.940
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

3931
01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:19.770
<v Speaker 2>You think they made a conscious decision now's not the right time to find them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3934
01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:25.500
<v Speaker 2>In my opinion and my opinion.</v>

3935
01:40:25.501 --> 01:40:25.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3936
01:40:25.751 --> 01:40:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I watched him against Bochniac and again,</v>

3937
01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:29.730
<v Speaker 2>you know Boq Nats,</v>

3938
01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:30.720
<v Speaker 2>super tough guy.</v>

3939
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:36.750
<v Speaker 2>Kyle Bachman Magomed Sharapov fla.</v>

3940
01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:38.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not even happening for me.</v>

3941
01:40:38.130 --> 01:40:38.963
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

3942
01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:41.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm a been three years ago.</v>

3943
01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I stumbled through ruined a couple of times at the weigh ins.</v>

3944
01:40:44.611 --> 01:40:45.444
<v Speaker 2>I stumbled through it.</v>

3945
01:40:45.550 --> 01:40:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Did you have to track this?</v>

3946
01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Will you read it?</v>

3947
01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:48.990
<v Speaker 2>Like if I read it like I,</v>

3948
01:40:49.050 --> 01:40:49.310
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

3949
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:52.380
<v Speaker 2>I've watched him fight but when I watched him fight it says this is a beat,</v>

3950
01:40:52.381 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck his last name is [inaudible] and then,</v>

3951
01:40:55.210 --> 01:40:57.010
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't until I have to call it,</v>

3952
01:40:57.390 --> 01:41:01.450
<v Speaker 2>I got to remember here it like if I hear you say it like multiple times,</v>

3953
01:41:01.451 --> 01:41:02.284
<v Speaker 2>then I pick it up</v>

3954
01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:04.630
<v Speaker 2>mega med.</v>

3955
01:41:04.630 --> 01:41:04.961
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3956
01:41:04.961 --> 01:41:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Paul Magomed Chicago Edge.</v>

3957
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:08.343
<v Speaker 2>That's not that hard.</v>

3958
01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:09.760
<v Speaker 2>But they want you to just,</v>

3959
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:14.080
<v Speaker 2>is that beat because like for American fans like that's a hard sell when Norma</v>

3960
01:41:14.081 --> 01:41:17.050
<v Speaker 2>got Madoff is hard but everybody calls him could be in for the most part.</v>

3961
01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3962
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Does that beat is super high level man.</v>

3963
01:41:19.391 --> 01:41:22.900
<v Speaker 2>I was so impressed with his striking the way many of the broken arm or broken</v>

3964
01:41:22.901 --> 01:41:27.901
<v Speaker 2>fist into the fight entered the fight with her hitting the pads I got mucked up</v>

3965
01:41:27.971 --> 01:41:31.190
<v Speaker 2>is Mark Henry told me he's the most talented guy he's ever seen come through as</v>

3966
01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Jim Rez Barboza.</v>

3967
01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.300
<v Speaker 2>Frankie Edgar says the beat by far the most talented guy.</v>

3968
01:41:36.370 --> 01:41:37.290
<v Speaker 2>That's how bad is it?</v>

3969
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Credible fight with Barboza.</v>

3970
01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Oo dammit.</v>

3971
01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:41.260
<v Speaker 2>He's a beast.</v>

3972
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:43.263
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Leila.</v>

3973
01:41:44.110 --> 01:41:44.471
<v Speaker 2>Kevin.</v>

3974
01:41:44.471 --> 01:41:46.930
<v Speaker 2>See I think Kevin Lee Kobi was a great fight.</v>

3975
01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Great Fun.</v>

3976
01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Because I think at two down,</v>

3977
01:41:49.170 --> 01:41:49.401
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

3978
01:41:49.401 --> 01:41:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I think Kevin Lee does things better.</v>

3979
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Some things better than Khabib does and could be,</v>

3980
01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:56.200
<v Speaker 2>does some things better than Kevin,</v>

3981
01:41:56.201 --> 01:41:57.270
<v Speaker 2>but I think Kevin's better.</v>

3982
01:41:57.730 --> 01:41:58.690
<v Speaker 2>The more important things.</v>

3983
01:41:58.750 --> 01:42:00.580
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell who does what better.</v>

3984
01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:02.920
<v Speaker 2>It really is because they're both so good at everything.</v>

3985
01:42:02.921 --> 01:42:05.790
<v Speaker 2>Not only comes to quick strike showing him no,</v>

3986
01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:06.540
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3987
01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Kevin.</v>

3988
01:42:07.090 --> 01:42:07.411
<v Speaker 2>Kevin,</v>

3989
01:42:07.411 --> 01:42:08.420
<v Speaker 2>we have by a long shot.</v>

3990
01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:09.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3991
01:42:09.610 --> 01:42:10.270
<v Speaker 2>he's good.</v>

3992
01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3993
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:11.383
<v Speaker 2>Can bebes good.</v>

3994
01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Kevin.</v>

3995
01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:12.880
<v Speaker 2>Kevin to stretch.</v>

3996
01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:14.360
<v Speaker 2>It'd be better standing up there.</v>

3997
01:42:14.361 --> 01:42:18.100
<v Speaker 2>The real question is going to be in the wrestling because Khabib's it's number</v>

3998
01:42:18.101 --> 01:42:18.251
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

3999
01:42:18.251 --> 01:42:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Goal's not stand up and have a kickboxing match with you.</v>

4000
01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:24.110
<v Speaker 2>It's no one goes to mall year and whoever gets the take down,</v>

4001
01:42:24.111 --> 01:42:26.800
<v Speaker 2>it all comes down to how good the guy on the bottom is.</v>

4002
01:42:26.801 --> 01:42:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Office cat.</v>

4003
01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Kevin's a better cop.</v>

4004
01:42:28.930 --> 01:42:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Kevin's a better grappler.</v>

4005
01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:31.780
<v Speaker 2>He's better at finishing from the back.</v>

4006
01:42:31.810 --> 01:42:32.201
<v Speaker 2>Correct?</v>

4007
01:42:32.201 --> 01:42:33.034
<v Speaker 2>I can't say.</v>

4008
01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:37.090
<v Speaker 2>And I get his mouth and his past and his finished his passing in that fight,</v>

4009
01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:38.230
<v Speaker 2>the passing and the first row.</v>

4010
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.561
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

4011
01:42:38.561 --> 01:42:41.070
<v Speaker 2>I took Barboza down quicker than could be did it could beep,</v>

4012
01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:41.740
<v Speaker 2>struggled.</v>

4013
01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Barboza shook him off a couple of times,</v>

4014
01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:46.630
<v Speaker 2>but cubby breaks everybody.</v>

4015
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:48.220
<v Speaker 2>Everybody that grapples with them,</v>

4016
01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:49.330
<v Speaker 2>you find out,</v>

4017
01:42:49.331 --> 01:42:49.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4018
01:42:49.541 --> 01:42:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Kevin has a higher takedown success.</v>

4019
01:42:51.850 --> 01:42:52.151
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4020
01:42:52.151 --> 01:42:53.530
<v Speaker 2>But Khabib,</v>

4021
01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.630
<v Speaker 2>even against guys that are really good,</v>

4022
01:42:55.631 --> 01:42:56.500
<v Speaker 2>like dos Anjos,</v>

4023
01:42:56.501 --> 01:42:58.060
<v Speaker 2>he mauls those fuckers.</v>

4024
01:42:58.061 --> 01:42:58.930
<v Speaker 2>He knows people.</v>

4025
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:59.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4026
01:42:59.060 --> 01:42:59.920
<v Speaker 2>it's a great fighter.</v>

01:42:59.950 --> 01:43:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

4029
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:03.250
<v Speaker 2>he's getting,</v>

4030
01:43:03.250 --> 01:43:05.320
<v Speaker 2>he's new to the 25 years old.</v>

4031
01:43:05.610 --> 01:43:08.320
<v Speaker 2>So in 25 he's smart.</v>

4032
01:43:08.321 --> 01:43:08.480
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4033
01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:10.810
<v Speaker 2>who knows who can take Kevin Lee as smart as fuck.</v>

4034
01:43:10.811 --> 01:43:11.471
<v Speaker 2>John and Kevin.</v>

4035
01:43:11.471 --> 01:43:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Lee could beep to me is the most interesting fight beside as soon as he</v>

4036
01:43:15.161 --> 01:43:15.994
<v Speaker 2>gets out.</v>

4037
01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Tony itself get about dre.</v>

4038
01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:23.400
<v Speaker 2>He's out for a little bit and that's why Tony Tony could be about,</v>

4039
01:43:23.410 --> 01:43:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to see that but I go see Tony,</v>

4040
01:43:25.241 --> 01:43:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Nate Diaz.</v>

4041
01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:29.530
<v Speaker 2>But however with Tony being hurt so I don't put them in the discussion right</v>

4042
01:43:29.531 --> 01:43:30.364
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

4043
01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Lee Khabib's the fights fair,</v>

4044
01:43:31.930 --> 01:43:34.660
<v Speaker 2>that surgery that that stitches the side,</v>

4045
01:43:34.661 --> 01:43:38.320
<v Speaker 2>the size of the fucking wound ever seen anything like that in my life was like a</v>

4046
01:43:38.321 --> 01:43:41.650
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle accident was whole LCL came off that poor dude.</v>

4047
01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anybody with horrible or horrific like surgical wound on their</v>

4048
01:43:46.781 --> 01:43:47.250
<v Speaker 2>knee.</v>

4049
01:43:47.250 --> 01:43:47.741
<v Speaker 2>That's hard.</v>

4050
01:43:47.741 --> 01:43:49.600
<v Speaker 2>That's like some 1980 shit.</v>

4051
01:43:49.630 --> 01:43:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Like when they used to have to open you up and like a suitcase and check around</v>

4052
01:43:53.901 --> 01:43:56.300
<v Speaker 2>and replace Shit and he's not a guy I'm worried about.</v>

4053
01:43:56.301 --> 01:43:58.750
<v Speaker 2>You know some guys when they get an injury I'm like Oh fuck the,</v>

4054
01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about Tony for some reason.</v>

4055
01:44:00.321 --> 01:44:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Look at that though dude.</v>

4056
01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how big that is?</v>

4057
01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:06.110
<v Speaker 2>That's a giant ass wound that looks like a 12 inch wound,</v>

4058
01:44:06.150 --> 01:44:07.640
<v Speaker 2>had to reattach the whole thing.</v>

4059
01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:10.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a rare knee operation right there.</v>

4060
01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:14.990
<v Speaker 2>The fact that that happened while he was just walking and tripped is so fucking</v>

4061
01:44:14.991 --> 01:44:18.140
<v Speaker 2>crazy that a guy with his kind of balance,</v>

4062
01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.180
<v Speaker 2>he must've been exhausted.</v>

4063
01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.470
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing that makes sense.</v>

4064
01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:25.520
<v Speaker 2>He must've been just run ragged doing all these interviews and then like peaking</v>

4065
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:26.390
<v Speaker 2>during training.</v>

4066
01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Just a freak accident way.</v>

4067
01:44:27.481 --> 01:44:27.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4068
01:44:27.651 --> 01:44:28.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm just making things up.</v>

4069
01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:29.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck happened.</v>

4070
01:44:29.901 --> 01:44:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

4071
01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's such a bummer.</v>

4072
01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:32.001
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4073
01:44:32.001 --> 01:44:34.280
<v Speaker 2>we should [inaudible] I've talked about this before.</v>

4074
01:44:34.281 --> 01:44:35.270
<v Speaker 2>We should talk about it again.</v>

4075
01:44:35.271 --> 01:44:36.770
<v Speaker 2>He was not wearing sunglasses.</v>

4076
01:44:37.190 --> 01:44:39.620
<v Speaker 2>That was something he misspoke.</v>

4077
01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:43.340
<v Speaker 2>He said he was wearing prescription sunglasses to Ariel Helwani.</v>

4078
01:44:43.341 --> 01:44:44.174
<v Speaker 2>Is that what he said?</v>

4079
01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:45.260
<v Speaker 2>It was a mistake.</v>

4080
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:46.790
<v Speaker 2>So everybody's repeating this,</v>

4081
01:44:46.791 --> 01:44:48.680
<v Speaker 2>including me and Dana and all these other people.</v>

4082
01:44:48.681 --> 01:44:51.920
<v Speaker 2>We thought he was wearing sunglasses inside like he does when he does so stare</v>

4083
01:44:51.921 --> 01:44:52.550
<v Speaker 2>downs.</v>

4084
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:53.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not what was going on.</v>

4085
01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Even if he was,</v>

4086
01:44:54.561 --> 01:44:57.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't think regular glasses and sunglasses.</v>

4087
01:44:57.811 --> 01:44:58.641
<v Speaker 2>It had nothing to do with it.</v>

4088
01:44:58.641 --> 01:44:59.330
<v Speaker 2>He just tripped.</v>

4089
01:44:59.330 --> 01:45:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what some people were mocking him.</v>

4090
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.863
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

4091
01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:04.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4092
01:45:04.071 --> 01:45:07.810
<v Speaker 2>especially when the guy's like half the door and most important part of his</v>

4093
01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:09.360
<v Speaker 2>career thought anyway.</v>

4094
01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I know he was going to fight anyway.</v>

4095
01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

4096
01:45:12.110 --> 01:45:12.840
<v Speaker 2>In a good way.</v>

4097
01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:13.081
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>

4098
01:45:13.081 --> 01:45:13.491
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

4099
01:45:13.491 --> 01:45:14.150
<v Speaker 2>he didn't care.</v>

4100
01:45:14.150 --> 01:45:18.080
<v Speaker 2>You guys remember pride when Sakuraba would literally wrap his legs up like a</v>

4101
01:45:18.081 --> 01:45:18.470
<v Speaker 2>mummy.</v>

4102
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:19.550
<v Speaker 2>That's what Tony was going to get.</v>

4103
01:45:19.630 --> 01:45:21.110
<v Speaker 2>The doctors wouldn't let him.</v>

4104
01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.330
<v Speaker 2>So he went to two different documents can be,</v>

4105
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:25.340
<v Speaker 2>it's not fine for a while because of Ramadan.</v>

4106
01:45:25.341 --> 01:45:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4107
01:45:26.150 --> 01:45:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4108
01:45:26.850 --> 01:45:28.850
<v Speaker 2>He can't fight to Ramadan.</v>

4109
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:32.330
<v Speaker 2>He's out for a few months because of his religion.</v>

4110
01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:34.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4111
01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:34.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4112
01:45:34.911 --> 01:45:35.990
<v Speaker 2>So then you do what?</v>

4113
01:45:35.991 --> 01:45:36.824
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Alvarez,</v>

4114
01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:38.810
<v Speaker 2>who fought through Ramadan,</v>

4115
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:40.850
<v Speaker 2>went through his train clamp through Ramadan,</v>

4116
01:45:40.851 --> 01:45:42.080
<v Speaker 2>is a below Muhammad.</v>

4117
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:47.780
<v Speaker 2>He figured out a way to do it and the way to do it is to train it til nighttime.</v>

4118
01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Make sure he eats first and then trains at nighttime.</v>

4119
01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:51.710
<v Speaker 2>But he did it.</v>

4120
01:45:51.710 --> 01:45:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

4121
01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:52.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4122
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.461
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4123
01:45:52.461 --> 01:45:53.150
<v Speaker 2>he did it.</v>

4124
01:45:53.150 --> 01:45:53.481
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

4125
01:45:53.481 --> 01:45:53.931
<v Speaker 2>And he fought.</v>

4126
01:45:53.931 --> 01:45:54.111
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4127
01:45:54.111 --> 01:45:55.040
<v Speaker 2>he just adjusted his,</v>

4128
01:45:55.050 --> 01:45:56.030
<v Speaker 2>did he try to camp?</v>

4129
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:57.470
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>

4130
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who we follow.</v>

4131
01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:01.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying at a championship level,</v>

4132
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:03.230
<v Speaker 2>I would hold off too if I'm could be right.</v>

4133
01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:04.100
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

4134
01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:04.670
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

4135
01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:05.330
<v Speaker 2>But you can do it.</v>

4136
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:06.740
<v Speaker 2>But I remember he fought a good guy.</v>

4137
01:46:06.741 --> 01:46:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who it was was interesting.</v>

4138
01:46:09.081 --> 01:46:09.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4139
01:46:09.261 --> 01:46:11.360
<v Speaker 2>He figured out his schedule where he could pull it off.</v>

4140
01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:13.290
<v Speaker 2>He can't be the best way to go about it.</v>

4141
01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:14.130
<v Speaker 2>The best way to go.</v>

4142
01:46:14.130 --> 01:46:15.380
<v Speaker 2>It was a bad ass do it.</v>

4143
01:46:15.381 --> 01:46:16.460
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't for your religion,</v>

4144
01:46:16.461 --> 01:46:17.510
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I'd do it.</v>

4145
01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Just be for performance.</v>

4146
01:46:18.861 --> 01:46:19.880
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you would do it,</v>

4147
01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:21.440
<v Speaker 2>but you could do it.</v>

4148
01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:23.960
<v Speaker 2>It could be done because you just got to wait until dark.</v>

4149
01:46:23.961 --> 01:46:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4150
01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:25.130
<v Speaker 2>If I'm compete though,</v>

4151
01:46:25.131 --> 01:46:26.870
<v Speaker 2>I just saw on down,</v>

4152
01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:27.650
<v Speaker 2>it's not that hard.</v>

4153
01:46:27.650 --> 01:46:28.483
<v Speaker 2>It's not ideal.</v>

4154
01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:29.533
<v Speaker 2>It's not ideal.</v>

4155
01:46:29.630 --> 01:46:29.961
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4156
01:46:29.961 --> 01:46:31.150
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating and it's ideal.</v>

4157
01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Apparently these days it's the best thing.</v>

4158
01:46:32.901 --> 01:46:33.111
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4159
01:46:33.111 --> 01:46:33.411
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

4160
01:46:33.411 --> 01:46:34.550
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the way,</v>

4161
01:46:34.610 --> 01:46:35.420
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

4162
01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:36.620
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to do it,</v>

4163
01:46:36.621 --> 01:46:38.180
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't do it like that.</v>

4164
01:46:38.181 --> 01:46:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Like he wouldn't do it during the dude like that and you you wouldn't,</v>

4165
01:46:41.630 --> 01:46:45.320
<v Speaker 2>you would do it where you stop eating and like five in the afternoon and then</v>

4166
01:46:45.321 --> 01:46:47.870
<v Speaker 2>you would go off if you want to have like a long,</v>

4167
01:46:47.871 --> 01:46:49.620
<v Speaker 2>some people argue that's good.</v>

4168
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Who argues that sound good?</v>

4169
01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Well just from your,</v>

4170
01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:57.030
<v Speaker 2>from our human genetics that you can be hungry at night.</v>

4171
01:46:57.150 --> 01:46:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4172
01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:58.710
<v Speaker 2>so you don't get as good a sleep.</v>

4173
01:46:58.740 --> 01:46:58.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4174
01:46:58.981 --> 01:47:01.290
<v Speaker 2>but it depends on what kind of foods are reading.</v>

4175
01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:03.030
<v Speaker 2>That's a big part of what it is.</v>

4176
01:47:03.031 --> 01:47:04.980
<v Speaker 2>If you're eating a lot of refined carbohydrates,</v>

4177
01:47:04.981 --> 01:47:06.780
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get really hungry at night for sure.</v>

4178
01:47:06.781 --> 01:47:08.010
<v Speaker 2>And you're going to want to eat again.</v>

4179
01:47:08.430 --> 01:47:11.400
<v Speaker 2>But if you're on more of a fat based Diet,</v>

4180
01:47:11.401 --> 01:47:12.750
<v Speaker 2>you could pull that off for sure.</v>

4181
01:47:12.810 --> 01:47:14.580
<v Speaker 2>100% a hundred non stop man.</v>

4182
01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4183
01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:16.020
<v Speaker 2>you could pull it off for sure.</v>

4184
01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:17.340
<v Speaker 2>The real question is,</v>

4185
01:47:17.610 --> 01:47:21.600
<v Speaker 2>is that the best thing to do for physical performance and it's most likely not</v>

4186
01:47:21.601 --> 01:47:22.410
<v Speaker 2>say no.</v>

4187
01:47:22.410 --> 01:47:23.243
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

4188
01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:25.350
<v Speaker 2>We had Zack bitter in here the other day.</v>

4189
01:47:25.351 --> 01:47:26.200
<v Speaker 2>He's a he,</v>

4190
01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:27.840
<v Speaker 2>he all ready for this record.</v>

4191
01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:33.080
<v Speaker 2>This motherfucker ran a hundred miles in 11 hours and 40 minutes.</v>

4192
01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:38.300
<v Speaker 2>He was averaging a seven minute mile shit for almost 12 hours.</v>

4193
01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:40.320
<v Speaker 2>He weighs four pounds.</v>

4194
01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:41.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4195
01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Ebay's a buck 40.</v>

4196
01:47:43.890 --> 01:47:44.041
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

4197
01:47:44.041 --> 01:47:45.240
<v Speaker 2>but he's a very thin guy.</v>

4198
01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:48.150
<v Speaker 2>He's on a fat based Diet.</v>

4199
01:47:48.151 --> 01:47:49.740
<v Speaker 2>He's on a Keto Diet essentially.</v>

4200
01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:52.910
<v Speaker 2>But when he goes to race he takes a lot of carbohydrates,</v>

4201
01:47:53.370 --> 01:47:54.210
<v Speaker 2>sugars and everything.</v>

4202
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:55.103
<v Speaker 2>No white guy.</v>

4203

01:47:58.830 --> 01:48:02.250
<v Speaker 2>but imagine that shit happened strong.</v>

4210
01:48:02.251 --> 01:48:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Your fucking mind has to be strong.</v>

4211
01:48:04.711 --> 01:48:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Your mind has to be to run 11 hours and 40 minutes.</v>

4212
01:48:07.711 --> 01:48:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Is that a word?</v>

4213
01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:08.670

<v Speaker 2>Mexicans can run marathons.</v>

4219

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Those guys who ran like basically barefoot.</v>

4226
01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:48:36.811 --> 01:48:38.420
<v Speaker 2>They're like the number one cross country team.</v>

4233
01:48:44.071 --> 01:48:44.910
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting.</v>

4234
01:48:44.970 --> 01:48:45.803
<v Speaker 2>Heart,</v>

4235

4236
01:48:47.810 --> 01:48:48.750
<v Speaker 2>Look at the boxers.</v>

4237
01:48:48.751 --> 01:48:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Look at the MMA fighters.</v>

4243
01:48:53.311 --> 01:48:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Cesar Chavez.</v>

4244
01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

4245
01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:55.531
<v Speaker 2>fucker.</v>

4246
01:48:55.531 --> 01:48:57.450

01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:59.580
<v Speaker 2>He never stopped coming at you.</v>

4248
01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:00.450
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

4249
01:49:00.450 --> 01:49:03.090
<v Speaker 2>he was so beautiful when he was in his prime.</v>

4250
01:49:03.450 --> 01:49:05.670
<v Speaker 2>When he would throw combinations like to the body,</v>

4251
01:49:05.671 --> 01:49:06.300
<v Speaker 2>to the head,</v>

4252
01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:07.650
<v Speaker 2>upper cuts stepped to the side,</v>

4253
01:49:07.651 --> 01:49:08.161
<v Speaker 2>right hand,</v>

01:49:08.581 --> 01:49:09.600
<v Speaker 2>right hand to the body.</v>

01:49:09.690 --> 01:49:11.520
<v Speaker 2>He was just nonstop.</v>

4257
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:16.290
<v Speaker 2>His volume was so impressive in his placement just to fucking amazing.</v>

4258
01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:16.471
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4259
01:49:16.471 --> 01:49:17.304
<v Speaker 2>what's going on here?</v>

4260
01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:19.940
<v Speaker 2>It's so fast to just toss.</v>

4261
01:49:20.630 --> 01:49:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Fatal is not ready.</v>

4262
01:49:21.690 --> 01:49:25.440
<v Speaker 2>The record is held by a 25 year old Russian ship.</v>

4263
01:49:25.730 --> 01:49:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Powerful EPO.</v>

4264
01:49:28.370 --> 01:49:33.370
<v Speaker 2>11 1128 I can't trust anything after ICARUS.</v>

4265
01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:34.441
<v Speaker 2>You like,</v>

4266
01:49:34.441 --> 01:49:34.920
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

4267
01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:35.400
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

4268
01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:37.830
<v Speaker 2>I hit rush and I assume you can't trust them.</v>

4269
01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:38.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4270
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:41.430
<v Speaker 2>isn't all countries different show shirt for sure.</v>

4271
01:49:41.431 --> 01:49:44.730
<v Speaker 2>A hundred percent hundred percent they just got busted once.</v>

4272
01:49:44.731 --> 01:49:45.630
<v Speaker 2>You watched ICARUS though.</v>

4273
01:49:45.631 --> 01:49:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4274
01:49:46.170 --> 01:49:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I saw it.</v>

4275
01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:47.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4276
01:49:47.050 --> 01:49:49.210
<v Speaker 2>even when Zach was talking about the testing,</v>

4277
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:52.210
<v Speaker 2>when Zach was talking to me about testing for these things,</v>

4278
01:49:52.211 --> 01:49:52.541
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

4279
01:49:52.541 --> 01:49:53.830
<v Speaker 2>he was kind of led on that.</v>

4280
01:49:54.010 --> 01:49:58.120
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that's different is the culture of the guys that run a hundred</v>

4281
01:49:58.120 --> 01:49:58.420
<v Speaker 2>miles.</v>

4282
01:49:58.420 --> 01:49:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not in the culture,</v>

4283
01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:01.540
<v Speaker 2>whereas like in the cycling culture,</v>

4284
01:50:01.541 --> 01:50:02.980
<v Speaker 2>it's a big part of the culture.</v>

4285
01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody does it.</v>

4286
01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:04.981
<v Speaker 2>But in the,</v>

4287
01:50:04.981 --> 01:50:05.290
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4288
01:50:05.290 --> 01:50:08.170
<v Speaker 2>that ultra marathon world is a brain world.</v>

4289
01:50:08.380 --> 01:50:10.630
<v Speaker 2>That's a world of like how much can you take?</v>

4290
01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Like you can physically do it.</v>

4291
01:50:12.490 --> 01:50:14.020
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing anything crazy physically,</v>

4292
01:50:14.021 --> 01:50:17.790
<v Speaker 2>like Usain bolt or someone who would not get the genetic right.</v>

4293
01:50:17.890 --> 01:50:18.580
<v Speaker 2>But they're there.</v>

4294
01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:19.600
<v Speaker 2>They're all small though.</v>

4295
01:50:19.601 --> 01:50:19.841
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4296
01:50:19.841 --> 01:50:20.674
<v Speaker 2>I would love to do them.</v>

4297
01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Another sound,</v>

4298
01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:22.750
<v Speaker 2>another fucking sob.</v>

4315
01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:37.621
<v Speaker 2>Genetically.</v>

4316
01:50:37.621 --> 01:50:38.740
<v Speaker 2>They're not like freaks.</v>

4317
01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could do it,</v>

4318
01:50:39.941 --> 01:50:41.170

4320
01:50:41.621 --> 01:50:42.454
<v Speaker 2>it's a shame.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4322
01:50:42.821 --> 01:50:45.160
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to lose weight for sure.</v>

4323
01:50:45.161 --> 01:50:46.510
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to dry yourself out.</v>

4324
01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:47.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4325
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:47.740
<v Speaker 2>it's to honor.</v>

4326
01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:48.573
<v Speaker 2>Love it that much.</v>

4327
01:50:48.610 --> 01:50:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Even when Cam,</v>

4328
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:51.700
<v Speaker 2>when he does like the big ones,</v>

4329
01:50:51.701 --> 01:50:56.701
<v Speaker 2>like when he did the Moab to 40 he got down to sick to one 60 rather once 65 I</v>

4330
01:50:57.641 --> 01:50:58.810
<v Speaker 2>think he's a big dude.</v>

4331
01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Usually weighs about one 85 be mighty.</v>

4332
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:05.650
<v Speaker 2>Got To one 60 you might actually got right below one 60 but he sowed so</v>

4333
01:51:05.651 --> 01:51:06.010
<v Speaker 2>hardcore.</v>

4334
01:51:06.010 --> 01:51:06.843
<v Speaker 2>You know how he did it?</v>

4335
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:09.970
<v Speaker 2>He just worked out burn 4,000 calories,</v>

4336
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:10.271
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

4337
01:51:10.271 --> 01:51:11.950
<v Speaker 2>3000 skus doing that.</v>

4338
01:51:12.250 --> 01:51:12.950
<v Speaker 2>He did that.</v>

4339
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:15.520
<v Speaker 2>Something hard to piece your mind.</v>

4340
01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:17.440
<v Speaker 2>I wish they would show that again,</v>

4341
01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:19.200
<v Speaker 2>but the way he set that arm bar up,</v>

4342
01:51:19.201 --> 01:51:24.201
<v Speaker 2>it was he a remember the teepee crossing your ankles and you extend your legs</v>

4343
01:51:24.911 --> 01:51:25.744
<v Speaker 2>instead of leg curl.</v>

4344
01:51:25.930 --> 01:51:27.520
<v Speaker 2>When the extended him,</v>

4345
01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:30.880
<v Speaker 2>it put everything in a in a right angle and then he upped it over.</v>

4346
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Then he hit or guest tattoo too.</v>

4347
01:51:33.791 --> 01:51:34.960
<v Speaker 2>That's in game of Thrones shit.</v>

4364
01:51:57.671 --> 01:51:59.590
<v Speaker 2>They kind of give you a good background of it.</v>

4365
01:51:59.650 --> 01:52:00.483
<v Speaker 2>I never got into</v>

4366

<v Speaker 2>I'm just waiting for game of Thrones star alert.</v>

4372
01:52:10.981 --> 01:52:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Where are you confused?</v>

4373
01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Don't get confusing.</v>

4374
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:15.250
<v Speaker 2>And kind of the first season was very confusing.</v>

4375
01:52:15.251 --> 01:52:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>

4376
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:16.623
<v Speaker 2>It took a while to fit.</v>

4377
01:52:16.650 --> 01:52:17.470
<v Speaker 2>They're saying that what?</v>

4378
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Caesar,</v>

4379
01:52:17.770 --> 01:52:19.450
<v Speaker 2>they and now three second,</v>

4380
01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:20.600
<v Speaker 2>they're saying it's so confusing.</v>

4381
01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:22.240
<v Speaker 2>They're losing subscribers.</v>

4382
01:52:22.241 --> 01:52:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Like ratings are just fucking,</v>

4383
01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:27.670
<v Speaker 2>but how do they know it's one episode that I just read that Bro,</v>

4384
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:29.383
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

4385
01:52:29.730 --> 01:52:33.910
<v Speaker 2>We'll just write shit like that just to be assholes I think today.</v>

4386
01:52:33.930 --> 01:52:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4387
01:52:34.210 --> 01:52:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I think there's maybe the writers confused.</v>

4388
01:52:35.921 --> 01:52:37.210
<v Speaker 2>So like everyone's confused.</v>

4389
01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:38.590
<v Speaker 2>You talked about it,</v>

4390
01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:39.360
<v Speaker 2>so you already talked,</v>

4391
01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:40.060
<v Speaker 2>not validated.</v>

4392
01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:43.030
<v Speaker 2>You talked about it because it's a thing that you want to hear and go,</v>

4393
01:52:43.031 --> 01:52:43.481
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

4394
01:52:43.481 --> 01:52:44.500
<v Speaker 2>look what's going on over there.</v>

4395
01:52:44.530 --> 01:52:44.680
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4396
01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:45.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

4397
01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:45.751
<v Speaker 2>Too complicated.</v>

4398
01:52:45.751 --> 01:52:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I like West Hall.</v>

4399
01:52:46.701 --> 01:52:48.110
<v Speaker 2>I heard the loosened subscribers.</v>

4400
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:49.183
<v Speaker 2>Maybe</v>

4401
01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:54.860
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to sell magazines or an article and you want to appeal to that</v>

4402
01:52:54.861 --> 01:52:56.600
<v Speaker 2>mindset that we're just talking about earlier,</v>

4403
01:52:56.780 --> 01:52:57.351
<v Speaker 2>that's what you would,</v>

4404
01:52:57.351 --> 01:52:57.980
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4405
01:52:57.980 --> 01:52:58.813
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>

4406
01:52:59.170 --> 01:53:02.530
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying is that last thing I read was that on Westworld.</v>

4407
01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:03.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch Westworld.</v>

4408
01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if people dig it.</v>

4409
01:53:05.601 --> 01:53:06.260
<v Speaker 2>He never watched it.</v>

4410
01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:06.920
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4411
01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:08.240
<v Speaker 2>You've got to start from scratch.</v>

4412
01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:09.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you it's a good show.</v>

4413
01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:10.640
<v Speaker 2>I know people love it,</v>

4414

01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:11.683
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it.</v>

4416
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:12.351
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4417
01:53:12.351 --> 01:53:13.480
<v Speaker 2>You seem like you're never going to do it.</v>

4418
01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:14.390
<v Speaker 2>I talking to you right now.</v>

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Just same way with game of Thrones,</v>

4424
01:53:17.181 --> 01:53:18.390
<v Speaker 2>but then you guys talked me into it.</v>

4425
01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:19.610
<v Speaker 2>This is my favorite show of all time.</v>

4426
01:53:19.670 --> 01:53:20.300
<v Speaker 2>There you go,</v>

4427

01:53:20.721 --> 01:53:21.380

<v Speaker 2>Could,</v>

4435
01:53:27.921 --> 01:53:32.921
<v Speaker 2>I think it's basically a historical reenactment of the Viking days based on a</v>

4436
01:53:33.951 --> 01:53:34.401
<v Speaker 2>true story.</v>

4437
01:53:34.401 --> 01:53:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4438
01:53:35.170 --> 01:53:36.650

01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:39.230
<v Speaker 2>who was a real viking like real shit.</v>

4440
01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:41.790
<v Speaker 2>If they know that they wrote down every word,</v>

4441
01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:42.621
<v Speaker 2>they listen to me,</v>

4442
01:53:42.621 --> 01:53:42.980
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4443
01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:45.890
<v Speaker 2>They wrote down every word they said all throughout the day,</v>

4444
01:53:45.891 --> 01:53:46.790
<v Speaker 2>his whole life.</v>

4445
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:47.900
<v Speaker 2>So they got it.</v>

4446
01:53:47.901 --> 01:53:51.090
<v Speaker 2>They got there by fuck.</v>

01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:53.150
<v Speaker 2>You even get the can read Viking.</v>

4448
01:53:53.690 --> 01:53:55.460
<v Speaker 2>You know who knows what the guy said and did,</v>

4449
01:53:55.461 --> 01:53:57.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's a really well made show.</v>

4450
01:53:57.380 --> 01:53:59.540
<v Speaker 2>It's the acting is fucking amazing.</v>

4451
01:54:00.710 --> 01:54:02.180
<v Speaker 2>I think they have five seasons.</v>

4452
01:54:02.181 --> 01:54:02.931
<v Speaker 2>What are they trying to do?</v>

4453
01:54:02.931 --> 01:54:04.490
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to go from town to town.</v>

4454
01:54:04.730 --> 01:54:05.031

01:56:03.310 --> 01:56:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Make sure built.</v>

4547
01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:09.990
<v Speaker 1>so he has all these rich followers and they built a city in Oregon,</v>

4548
01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:12.270
<v Speaker 1>that coalition in the middle of nowhere.</v>

4549
01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:15.330
<v Speaker 1>They built this gigantic city in Oregon in the 80s.</v>

4550
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:19.290
<v Speaker 1>And all these people from all over the world ended up moving there.</v>

4551
01:56:19.291 --> 01:56:22.890
<v Speaker 1>And the surrounding towns are just like old white people.</v>

4552
01:56:23.190 --> 01:56:23.551
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

4553
01:56:23.551 --> 01:56:23.701

01:56:31.890 --> 01:56:32.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not about that.</v>

4560
01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:37.590
<v Speaker 1>It's about him starting a new city with that got tens of thousands of people in</v>

4561
01:56:37.591 --> 01:56:40.800
<v Speaker 1>the middle of Oregon and they got all these old white people out there going,</v>

4562
01:56:40.801 --> 01:56:42.240
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

4563
01:56:42.450 --> 01:56:44.040
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't about a sex cult.</v>

4567
01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:48.940
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't,</v>

01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:52.690
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it's the cold leads just focusing on that,</v>

4569
01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:53.940

4570
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:57.860
<v Speaker 1>they had to find out a culture.</v>

4571
01:56:57.990 --> 01:57:01.950
<v Speaker 1>They had the finances to literally build a high level city in the middle of</v>

02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:01.000
<v Speaker 2>If you run into a bunch of girls,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4723
02:01:13.631 --> 02:01:14.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4724
02:01:14.110 --> 02:01:18.700
<v Speaker 2>and now who's to say if she goes and talks to a bunch of other girls and talks</v>

4725
02:01:18.701 --> 02:01:21.550
<v Speaker 2>them into having sex with this guy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>why is that bad?</v>

4727
02:01:23.470 --> 02:01:24.460
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

4728
02:01:24.490 --> 02:01:27.040
<v Speaker 2>We should get what you want your daughter to do.</v>

4729
02:01:27.070 --> 02:01:28.930
<v Speaker 2>It's not what you want your sister to do.</v>

4730
02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:34.200
<v Speaker 2>But we all know people that like getting tied up 100% we know people that like,</v>

4731
02:01:34.930 --> 02:01:38.170
<v Speaker 2>like smacking each other and like being sent shit and like being,</v>

4736
02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:43.041
<v Speaker 4>Let's just say that,</v>

4737
02:01:43.041 --> 02:01:43.281

4740
02:01:47.630 --> 02:01:50.660
<v Speaker 4>Because is she bringing those girls there and then they're keeping them right?</v>

4741
02:01:50.661 --> 02:01:51.321
<v Speaker 4>That's the question.</v>

4742
02:01:51.321 --> 02:01:51.951
<v Speaker 4>If that's the case,</v>

4743
02:01:51.951 --> 02:01:54.880
<v Speaker 4>of course it says forced labor labor,</v>

4744
02:01:54.890 --> 02:01:55.221
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4745
02:01:55.221 --> 02:01:56.011
<v Speaker 4>If you scroll right,</v>

4746
02:01:56.011 --> 02:01:58.880
<v Speaker 4>but if you turn someone into your slave and you said slave,</v>

4747
02:01:58.881 --> 02:02:00.140
<v Speaker 4>you're going to clean my kitchen.</v>

4748
02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:01.071
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

4749
02:02:01.071 --> 02:02:01.341
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

4750
02:02:01.341 --> 02:02:01.761
<v Speaker 4>master.</v>

4751
02:02:01.761 --> 02:02:03.830
<v Speaker 4>And it's like part of some weird kinky shit you do.</v>

4752
02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:07.340
<v Speaker 4>And then after they cleaned your kitchen then then you mouth fuck them.</v>

4753
02:02:07.450 --> 02:02:07.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4754
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:09.800
<v Speaker 4>Like if you just decided like you have some words,</v>

4755
02:02:09.970 --> 02:02:14.970
<v Speaker 4>she have some weird weird like that and some people like it,</v>

4756
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:16.760
<v Speaker 4>some people like weird shit.</v>

4757
02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:21.320
<v Speaker 4>And then there's some people that get talked into joining a cult and they get</v>

4758
02:02:21.321 --> 02:02:23.180
<v Speaker 4>talked into these horrible situations.</v>

4759
02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:24.650
<v Speaker 4>They actually do become sex slaves.</v>

4760
02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:26.270
<v Speaker 4>So how do you know which is which?</v>

4761
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:31.390
<v Speaker 4>How do you know like which is a consenting of age adult who really loves being a</v>

4762
02:02:31.941 --> 02:02:33.650
<v Speaker 4>part of some super kinky shit.</v>

4763
02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:34.190
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

4764
02:02:34.190 --> 02:02:39.190
<v Speaker 4>Versus someone who's coerced into joining a sex cult and who is like held</v>

4765
02:02:39.801 --> 02:02:40.700
<v Speaker 4>against their will.</v>

4766
02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:41.750
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a line there,</v>

4767
02:02:41.751 --> 02:02:42.230
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4768
02:02:42.230 --> 02:02:45.890
<v Speaker 4>Like they seem kind of similar from the outside but there is a line,</v>

4769
02:02:45.891 --> 02:02:46.041
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4770
02:02:46.041 --> 02:02:48.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck happened in this situation.</v>

4771
02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:49.280
<v Speaker 4>I literally don't know anything.</v>

4772
02:02:49.281 --> 02:02:50.114
<v Speaker 4>I do know,</v>

4773
02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:51.560
<v Speaker 4>I know what happens.</v>

4774
02:02:51.561 --> 02:02:55.220
<v Speaker 4>So she would get these girls and then the shoot dude get them naked and she</v>

4775
02:02:55.221 --> 02:02:57.390
<v Speaker 4>would take pictures and hold it as a brand somewhere.</v>

4776
02:02:57.410 --> 02:02:59.930
<v Speaker 4>Like if they didn't fuck the leader.</v>

4777
02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:00.940
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4778
02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:01.220
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

4779
02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:02.180
<v Speaker 4>Well that got dark.</v>

4780
02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:02.330
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4781
02:03:02.330 --> 02:03:02.871
<v Speaker 4>just hit me.</v>

4782
02:03:02.871 --> 02:03:03.591
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

4783
02:03:03.591 --> 02:03:04.520
<v Speaker 4>That's why she's fucked.</v>

4784
02:03:04.530 --> 02:03:05.211
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

4785
02:03:05.211 --> 02:03:05.600
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

4786
02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:06.050
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4787
02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:06.883
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

4788
02:03:07.010 --> 02:03:10.130
<v Speaker 4>but it would be interesting we're talking about that other guy with all the</v>

4789
02:03:10.131 --> 02:03:11.180
<v Speaker 4>money in the Oregon.</v>

4790
02:03:11.210 --> 02:03:12.830
<v Speaker 4>Like if someone did that today,</v>

4791
02:03:12.831 --> 02:03:14.360
<v Speaker 4>like some are Kelly type guy.</v>

4792
02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:16.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying our Kelly's a good guy.</v>

4793
02:03:16.641 --> 02:03:18.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying what he's doing is legal.</v>

4794
02:03:18.141 --> 02:03:21.140
<v Speaker 4>But what I am saying is it is possible.</v>

4795
02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:23.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't think this is the case in this situation,</v>

4796
02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:28.480
<v Speaker 4>but just as a what if it is possible that you get together with a bunch of</v>

4797
02:03:29.961 --> 02:03:34.961
<v Speaker 4>people who are really ended that slave dominatrix type deal.</v>

4798
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:39.710
<v Speaker 4>Like some people are really into being dominatrices.</v>

4799
02:03:39.770 --> 02:03:43.980
<v Speaker 4>Some people are really into being submissive and they get together like with it,</v>

4800
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:44.960
<v Speaker 4>as long as it's men and women,</v>

4801
02:03:44.961 --> 02:03:45.800
<v Speaker 4>we don't have a problem with it.</v>

4802
02:03:45.801 --> 02:03:46.350
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4803
02:03:46.350 --> 02:03:50.960
<v Speaker 4>Like if as long as it's some guys like a CEO that hire some mistress to kick him</v>

4804
02:03:50.961 --> 02:03:53.540
<v Speaker 4>in the balls and stomp on them and do it happens.</v>

4805
02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:54.710
<v Speaker 4>If we were totally cool with that,</v>

4806
02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:55.730
<v Speaker 4>people survive that.</v>

4807
02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:57.081
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

4808
02:03:57.081 --> 02:03:57.914
<v Speaker 4>Just take the pain.</v>

4809
02:03:57.980 --> 02:04:02.060
<v Speaker 4>Some people like getting kicked in the balls and need in a bones like repeatedly</v>

4810
02:04:02.070 --> 02:04:03.350
<v Speaker 4>and it's hard as you can.</v>

4811
02:04:03.410 --> 02:04:06.860
<v Speaker 4>I know they used to come into the club and I used to work at and girls used to</v>

4812
02:04:06.861 --> 02:04:09.510
<v Speaker 4>get paid to knees in the lap dance.</v>

4813
02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:11.720
<v Speaker 4>They would just need the shit out of their bubble.</v>

4814
02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:14.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it.</v>

4815
02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:15.500
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that pain,</v>

4816
02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:17.390
<v Speaker 4>that feels like death to most people.</v>

4817
02:04:17.391 --> 02:04:19.340
<v Speaker 4>It feels different to other people that,</v>

4818
02:04:19.341 --> 02:04:19.750
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

4819
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:23.180
<v Speaker 4>that that's like a rush can imagine if that when you get hit in the balls into</v>

4820
02:04:23.181 --> 02:04:24.470
<v Speaker 4>that intense pain.</v>

4821
02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:25.790
<v Speaker 4>It's like a saying,</v>

4822
02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:27.950
<v Speaker 4>it's not like nothing else like stomach.</v>

4823
02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:28.221
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4824
02:04:28.221 --> 02:04:29.150
<v Speaker 4>It's a unique pain.</v>

4825
02:04:29.330 --> 02:04:33.030
<v Speaker 4>But there might be people that take that unique pain and turn it into like just</v>

4826
02:04:33.031 --> 02:04:34.130
<v Speaker 4>this high for you.</v>

4827
02:04:34.230 --> 02:04:34.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4828
02:04:34.670 --> 02:04:35.503
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

4829
02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a real why psychos people</v>

4830
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:41.040
<v Speaker 2>that are into it Pumpkin to watch that shit on Youtube.</v>

4831
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:43.920
<v Speaker 2>Frank had a good point.</v>

4832
02:04:43.921 --> 02:04:47.340
<v Speaker 2>We came to fade or the time that is his losses and we come to the states saying</v>

4833
02:04:47.370 --> 02:04:48.750
<v Speaker 2>how he never trains in a cage.</v>

4834
02:04:49.230 --> 02:04:50.063
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

4835
02:04:50.210 --> 02:04:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4836
02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:54.850
<v Speaker 2>It was the cage a factor in any of his losses because two of them relative to</v>

4837
02:04:55.450 --> 02:04:55.770
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

4838
02:04:55.770 --> 02:04:58.860
<v Speaker 2>what happened the do with fight Henderson,</v>

4839
02:04:58.861 --> 02:04:59.760
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't get out of the way.</v>

4840
02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:01.171
<v Speaker 2>The Henderson fight.</v>

4841
02:05:01.171 --> 02:05:04.050
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't get out of the way in the Purdue fights maybe,</v>

4842
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:09.470
<v Speaker 2>but Henderson fight Reese control the ring ring is more fluid thing.</v>

4843
02:05:10.110 --> 02:05:10.591
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

4844
02:05:10.591 --> 02:05:11.161
<v Speaker 2>The Henderson fight,</v>

4845
02:05:11.161 --> 02:05:13.330
<v Speaker 2>he hadn't been so I control and Henderson and uh,</v>

4846
02:05:13.331 --> 02:05:15.570
<v Speaker 2>under them popped out with the under hook.</v>

4847
02:05:15.571 --> 02:05:16.770
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't careful with that.</v>

4848
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:17.551
<v Speaker 2>With the under hook,</v>

4849
02:05:17.551 --> 02:05:18.690
<v Speaker 2>he had them side control.</v>

4850
02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:21.390
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have that under hook and the guy on the bottom shoots the under can</v>

4851
02:05:21.391 --> 02:05:22.150
<v Speaker 2>get the dog fight.</v>

4852
02:05:22.150 --> 02:05:23.550
<v Speaker 2>It's true from side control.</v>

4853
02:05:23.551 --> 02:05:25.200
<v Speaker 2>You don't even need quarter Gardner half car.</v>

4854
02:05:25.260 --> 02:05:27.810
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm fade or that's like a tennis player only playing on grass.</v>

4855
02:05:27.811 --> 02:05:29.910
<v Speaker 2>So he's going to play on clay with the fuck you dude.</v>

4856
02:05:29.911 --> 02:05:30.770
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is going on?</v>

4857
02:05:30.771 --> 02:05:34.620
<v Speaker 2>18 can you not find the goddamn kitchen rush was times where he didn't want to</v>

4858
02:05:34.621 --> 02:05:35.454
<v Speaker 2>fight anymore.</v>

4859
02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:36.510
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>

4860
02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:38.310
<v Speaker 2>is he fighting now because of money?</v>

4861
02:05:38.610 --> 02:05:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Is he fighting now because he doesn't know what else to do or is he fighting now</v>

4862
02:05:41.821 --> 02:05:46.821
<v Speaker 2>because he's got to reignited feeling about competition and he likes it again to</v>

4863
02:05:47.071 --> 02:05:48.720
<v Speaker 2>go work security for Putin.</v>

4864
02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:49.770
<v Speaker 2>Get paid bro.</v>

4865
02:05:49.950 --> 02:05:51.050
<v Speaker 2>They're bull shit.</v>

4866
02:05:51.630 --> 02:05:52.610
<v Speaker 2>That's a good call.</v>

4867
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:53.623
<v Speaker 2>Good call.</v>

4868
02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:54.960
<v Speaker 2>He's your right hand man.</v>

4869
02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:57.450
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna fuck with freight or rush doors there.</v>

4870
02:05:57.451 --> 02:05:58.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4871
02:05:58.200 --> 02:05:59.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean that would be,</v>

4872
02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:00.421
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4873
02:06:00.421 --> 02:06:02.280
<v Speaker 2>he's got to be a hero and rock dude.</v>

4874
02:06:03.630 --> 02:06:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Did you think of it going on or in war with Russia?</v>

4875
02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Syria strikes.</v>

4876
02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:10.430
<v Speaker 2>No thoughts for a second.</v>

4877
02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:13.850
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think were going to war with everybody thought I'm scared.</v>

4878
02:06:13.870 --> 02:06:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Anytime bombs dropped though.</v>

4879
02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:16.553
<v Speaker 2>Anytime bombs,</v>

4880
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:19.740
<v Speaker 2>you're opening up the possibility of bombs dropping back.</v>

4881
02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:20.843
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

4882
02:06:21.090 --> 02:06:21.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4883
02:06:21.421 --> 02:06:21.721
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4884
02:06:21.721 --> 02:06:23.370
<v Speaker 2>even if what happened,</v>

4885
02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:26.370
<v Speaker 2>what did the people on the other side of the dropping the bombs on deserve it?</v>

4886
02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:27.061
<v Speaker 2>It's still like,</v>

4887
02:06:27.061 --> 02:06:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

4888
02:06:27.961 --> 02:06:28.794
<v Speaker 2>we're in a fight.</v>

4889
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:30.540
<v Speaker 2>You know anytime that happens,</v>

4890
02:06:30.541 --> 02:06:34.080
<v Speaker 2>if you're not legitimately concerned that horrible things come out of it,</v>

4891
02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:36.720
<v Speaker 2>but the idea of us going to war with Russia,</v>

4892
02:06:36.721 --> 02:06:37.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

4893
02:06:37.260 --> 02:06:38.160
<v Speaker 2>probably not.</v>

4894
02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:39.653
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man,</v>

4895
02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:40.530
<v Speaker 2>I just crazy.</v>

4896
02:06:40.590 --> 02:06:41.760
<v Speaker 2>I was in New York for that.</v>

4897
02:06:41.761 --> 02:06:42.090
<v Speaker 2>I got to,</v>

4898
02:06:42.090 --> 02:06:42.923
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

4899
02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what is going on when it comes to foreign policy.</v>

4900
02:06:45.601 --> 02:06:48.180
<v Speaker 2>I would be a joke if I pretended,</v>

4901
02:06:48.181 --> 02:06:49.530
<v Speaker 2>which I have many times in my life.</v>

4902
02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:51.841
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>

4903
02:06:51.841 --> 02:06:52.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4904
02:06:52.021 --> 02:06:55.050
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows what's happening with Russia or with China?</v>

4905
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking about this a while,</v>

4906
02:06:56.921 --> 02:06:57.840
<v Speaker 2>way thing.</v>

4907
02:06:58.370 --> 02:06:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4908
02:06:59.140 --> 02:07:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Huawei is a big time cell phone or electronics company in Japan or in China</v>

4909
02:07:04.351 --> 02:07:05.130
<v Speaker 2>rather.</v>

4910
02:07:05.130 --> 02:07:05.760
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

4911
02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:10.470
<v Speaker 2>the State Department has recently recommended you don't buy Walway products and</v>

4912
02:07:10.471 --> 02:07:13.800
<v Speaker 2>that they might be a bad actors and you know,</v>

4913
02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.180
<v Speaker 2>spying on the people that own their phone.</v>

4914
02:07:16.181 --> 02:07:16.600
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

4915
02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:21.600
<v Speaker 2>they canceled deal with Huawei to be an 18 t and Verizon and all these other</v>

4916
02:07:21.930 --> 02:07:22.763
<v Speaker 2>cell phones,</v>

4917
02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:24.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4918
02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:26.400
<v Speaker 2>providers here in the United States and they,</v>

4919
02:07:26.401 --> 02:07:26.551
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

4920
02:07:26.551 --> 02:07:28.140
<v Speaker 2>they literally issued a warning.</v>

4921
02:07:28.770 --> 02:07:29.131
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4922
02:07:29.131 --> 02:07:30.480
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of that before.</v>

4923
02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:32.340
<v Speaker 2>And then there was something about,</v>

4924
02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:33.233
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4925
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:34.980
<v Speaker 2>some sort of hacking that they,</v>

4926
02:07:35.290 --> 02:07:35.771
<v Speaker 2>they did,</v>

4927
02:07:35.771 --> 02:07:38.560
<v Speaker 2>they're going to take them to court prosecuting for something.</v>

4928
02:07:38.561 --> 02:07:39.520
<v Speaker 2>They deal with Iran.</v>

4929
02:07:39.730 --> 02:07:40.660
<v Speaker 2>This is another thing about it,</v>

4930
02:07:40.661 --> 02:07:44.110
<v Speaker 2>but then I've heard people online say that they're suspicious that what this is,</v>

4931
02:07:44.111 --> 02:07:49.111
<v Speaker 2>is trying to squash China from entering into the electronics market is like the</v>

4932
02:07:49.151 --> 02:07:51.700
<v Speaker 2>top three people in cell phones are apple,</v>

4933
02:07:51.701 --> 02:07:52.534
<v Speaker 2>Samsung,</v>

4934
02:07:52.630 --> 02:07:54.820
<v Speaker 2>and Huawei is number three worldwide.</v>

4935
02:07:54.910 --> 02:07:56.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a thing to stop.</v>

4936
02:07:56.300 --> 02:08:00.310
<v Speaker 2>Wowway in America would be like an economic thing because they're worried about</v>

4937
02:08:00.311 --> 02:08:02.650
<v Speaker 2>China increasing the amount of money they have.</v>

4938
02:08:03.070 --> 02:08:03.903
<v Speaker 2>Who can they believe?</v>

4939
02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:08.740
<v Speaker 2>But you know it's hard if you're interested in following Q a on a lot of people</v>

4940
02:08:08.741 --> 02:08:09.640
<v Speaker 2>analyzes drops,</v>

4941
02:08:09.641 --> 02:08:12.340
<v Speaker 2>but there's a youtube channel called just informed,</v>

4942
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.863
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4943
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:15.061
<v Speaker 2>Justin form.</v>

4944
02:08:15.061 --> 02:08:15.970
<v Speaker 2>Something just informed,</v>

4945
02:08:15.971 --> 02:08:17.320
<v Speaker 2>but he breaks it down every day.</v>

4946
02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:18.610
<v Speaker 2>He talks about all that stuff.</v>

4947
02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:22.990
<v Speaker 2>So it's all interesting because you got to know that if Justin for coming to me</v>

4948
02:08:22.991 --> 02:08:23.920
<v Speaker 2>is that big.</v>

4949
02:08:23.921 --> 02:08:25.030
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing that the,</v>

4950
02:08:25.031 --> 02:08:28.630
<v Speaker 2>the super dorks like Jamie and I've been going back and forth about this because</v>

4951
02:08:28.631 --> 02:08:29.920
<v Speaker 2>the super dorks online,</v>

4952
02:08:29.921 --> 02:08:33.100
<v Speaker 2>I say that with all due respect to dudes are really understand cell phones.</v>

4953
02:08:33.250 --> 02:08:35.290
<v Speaker 2>They're calling bullshit because they're like,</v>

4954
02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:36.610
<v Speaker 2>if they were spying on you,</v>

4955
02:08:36.611 --> 02:08:39.310
<v Speaker 2>these guys who develop apps and understand phones,</v>

4956
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.701
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

4957

<v Speaker 2>these like super type dudes,</v>

4958
02:08:42.170 --> 02:08:43.390
<v Speaker 2>they'd be able to find the code.</v>

4959
02:08:43.690 --> 02:08:44.111
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>

4960
02:08:44.111 --> 02:08:44.231
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

4965
02:08:46.990 --> 02:08:47.741
<v Speaker 2>here's what the code,</v>

4966
02:08:47.741 --> 02:08:48.574
<v Speaker 2>this is what it's doing.</v>

4967
02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Microphones set to one set of design is as good as the Russian hackers are.</v>

4968
02:08:53.621 --> 02:08:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Wherever in the world the best aren't America.</v>

4969
02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:56.711

4971
02:08:58.430 --> 02:08:58.581
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

02:08:58.581 --> 02:09:00.760
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I was or what the fuck it is.</v>

4973
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:02.650
<v Speaker 2>We're best at suck America.</v>

4974
02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Drop a bomb eaten steak,</v>

4975
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:08.210
<v Speaker 2>American drag and bear frag mayor.</v>

4977
02:09:10.630 --> 02:09:15.630
<v Speaker 2>get in the book but just informed talk is the youtube channel than breaks down</v>

4978
02:09:17.231 --> 02:09:18.520
<v Speaker 2>Killeen on if you are interested.</v>

4979
02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:19.301
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>

4980
02:09:19.301 --> 02:09:21.220
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting predictions whether this fight,</v>

4981
02:09:21.290 --> 02:09:22.210
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>

4982
02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4983
02:09:22.990 --> 02:09:23.823
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4984
02:09:24.810 --> 02:09:25.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4985
02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I think they're both at very similar places in their career,</v>

4986
02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:30.130
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reasons why this fight is interesting,</v>

4987
02:09:30.210 --> 02:09:30.390
<v Speaker 2>frank.</v>

4988
02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:31.450
<v Speaker 2>It's been up for a hot minute.</v>

4989
02:09:31.570 --> 02:09:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when you get in there and you fed lung left,</v>

4990
02:09:34.071 --> 02:09:35.770
<v Speaker 2>just say fucking throw caution to the wind.</v>

4991
02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:37.240
<v Speaker 2>So it could be super quick.</v>

4992
02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:39.250
<v Speaker 2>Why did frank get released from UFC?</v>

4993
02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:40.840
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

4994
02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:41.673
<v Speaker 2>Do we know?</v>

4995
02:09:42.190 --> 02:09:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Didn't he do some tests positive?</v>

4996
02:09:44.530 --> 02:09:45.191
<v Speaker 2>He tests positive.</v>

4997
02:09:45.191 --> 02:09:46.024
<v Speaker 2>His last one,</v>

4998
02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:47.200
<v Speaker 2>how long ago was that?</v>

4999
02:09:47.290 --> 02:09:48.101
<v Speaker 2>That was a while ago.</v>

5000
02:09:48.101 --> 02:09:49.640
<v Speaker 2>He's been off for.</v>

5001
02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:53.110
<v Speaker 2>He got compensated as a common state.</v>

5002
02:09:53.130 --> 02:09:54.400
<v Speaker 2>Wanted to kill Brock Lesnar.</v>

5003
02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:55.473
<v Speaker 2>Literally Kill Them.</v>

5004
02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5005
02:09:56.290 --> 02:09:57.123
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>

5006
02:09:57.640 --> 02:09:58.850
<v Speaker 2>He was a really good commentary,</v>

5007
02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:00.220
<v Speaker 2>great commentator who was really good.</v>

5008
02:10:00.221 --> 02:10:01.600
<v Speaker 2>It's compensating now for ACB.</v>

5009
02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:03.970

5010
02:10:04.010 --> 02:10:04.990

02:10:06.071 --> 02:10:06.461
<v Speaker 2>He's the head.</v>

5015
02:10:06.461 --> 02:10:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Come to NBC.</v>

5016
02:10:07.150 --> 02:10:07.983
<v Speaker 2>Be Interesting.</v>

5017
02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

5018
02:10:09.130 --> 02:10:10.520
<v Speaker 2>But we went to Frank's last fight.</v>

5019
02:10:10.521 --> 02:10:13.180
<v Speaker 2>He got knocked up by Mark Hunt and then he,</v>

5020
02:10:13.181 --> 02:10:14.050
<v Speaker 2>they let him go.</v>

5021
02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:16.960
<v Speaker 2>I remember when he knocked out Todd Duffy though.</v>

5022
02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh whoa.</v>

5023
02:10:18.670 --> 02:10:19.480
<v Speaker 2>That was crazy.</v>

5024
02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:19.781
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

5025
02:10:19.781 --> 02:10:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Great near still showed in that fight that against a dangerous guy like Duffy</v>

5026
02:10:24.370 --> 02:10:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Frank's fall in love with his box and man,</v>

5027
02:10:25.911 --> 02:10:26.860
<v Speaker 2>I hate hearing that.</v>

5028
02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:27.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5029
02:10:27.941 --> 02:10:28.271
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5030
02:10:28.271 --> 02:10:29.560
<v Speaker 2>he's a smart dude.</v>

5031
02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:30.490
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

5032
02:10:30.490 --> 02:10:33.590
<v Speaker 2>if you got to think his Jujitsu is on point.</v>

5033
02:10:33.591 --> 02:10:34.610
<v Speaker 2>He's so smart.</v>

5034
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:36.020
<v Speaker 2>He's very smart.</v>

5035
02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:36.891
<v Speaker 2>Very well read.</v>

5036
02:10:36.891 --> 02:10:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Him and Josh Barnett,</v>

5037
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:40.190
<v Speaker 2>I think are the two smartest heavyweights that I've ever met.</v>

5038
02:10:40.370 --> 02:10:41.270
<v Speaker 2>It's a good call.</v>

5039
02:10:41.690 --> 02:10:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett.</v>

5040
02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:43.041
<v Speaker 2>Very smart.</v>

5041
02:10:43.041 --> 02:10:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Very cerebral.</v>

5042
02:10:43.820 --> 02:10:44.121
<v Speaker 2>How's it?</v>

5043
02:10:44.121 --> 02:10:44.954
<v Speaker 2>Good fight.</v>

5044
02:10:45.110 --> 02:10:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

5045
02:10:45.890 --> 02:10:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett Mirror.</v>

5046
02:10:47.110 --> 02:10:47.943
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5047
02:10:48.150 --> 02:10:49.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Josh Barnett.</v>

5048
02:10:49.241 --> 02:10:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Had it,</v>

5049
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:50.330
<v Speaker 2>had him against the fence.</v>

5050
02:10:50.331 --> 02:10:53.210
<v Speaker 2>He was had great head position and forum.</v>

5051
02:10:53.230 --> 02:10:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Josh Schwab is out.</v>

5052
02:10:54.161 --> 02:10:55.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

5053
02:10:55.490 --> 02:10:56.270
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

5054
02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:57.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a great fight for you Josh.</v>

5055
02:10:57.441 --> 02:10:58.370
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

5056
02:10:58.371 --> 02:10:59.204
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

5057
02:11:01.170 --> 02:11:02.570
<v Speaker 2>Just overall it was a five rounder,</v>

5058
02:11:02.571 --> 02:11:03.290
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>

5059
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:04.190
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was fine.</v>

5060
02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:05.293
<v Speaker 2>Ended pretty quick.</v>

5061
02:11:05.670 --> 02:11:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Josh whooped.</v>

5062
02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

5063
02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:06.891
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

5064
02:11:06.891 --> 02:11:07.041
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5065
02:11:07.041 --> 02:11:07.221
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5066
02:11:07.221 --> 02:11:10.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of another top speed is Josh beat his ass and knocked him out with</v>

5067
02:11:10.191 --> 02:11:10.551
<v Speaker 2>a neat,</v>

5068
02:11:10.551 --> 02:11:10.920
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5069
02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Josh fucked him up and fucked him up.</v>

5070
02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:17.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of another fight where Josh went five hard rounds.</v>

5071
02:11:17.420 --> 02:11:19.670
<v Speaker 2>Was it against DC when unbroken ahead?</v>

5072
02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:19.981
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5073
02:11:19.981 --> 02:11:20.091
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5074
02:11:20.091 --> 02:11:20.271
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5075
02:11:20.271 --> 02:11:22.850
<v Speaker 2>He beat somebody in a very impressive fight.</v>

5076
02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:23.713
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5077
02:11:24.380 --> 02:11:25.940
<v Speaker 2>it was Roy was big country.</v>

5078
02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:26.811
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

5079
02:11:26.811 --> 02:11:27.644
<v Speaker 2>He took him down.</v>

5080
02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:28.401
<v Speaker 2>But he kept,</v>

5081
02:11:28.401 --> 02:11:29.270
<v Speaker 2>he kept taking down.</v>

5082
02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5083
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:30.410
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>

5084
02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:31.690
<v Speaker 2>That was a long shit out of Roy.</v>

5085
02:11:31.900 --> 02:11:33.800
<v Speaker 2>He beat the shit out of Roy and it was a long fight,</v>

5086
02:11:33.801 --> 02:11:34.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5087
02:11:34.130 --> 02:11:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't it like a five rounds?</v>

5088
02:11:35.460 --> 02:11:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5089
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:36.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's five rounds.</v>

5090
02:11:36.710 --> 02:11:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Three rounds of an ass whooping though.</v>

5091
02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:38.181
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

5092
02:11:38.181 --> 02:11:39.770
<v Speaker 2>if you find that jam is a month,</v>

5093
02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:40.880
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

5094
02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:42.020
<v Speaker 2>He's bad mouthing him.</v>

5095
02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Him and frankly the most cerebral I think to ever.</v>

5096
02:11:44.290 --> 02:11:49.290
<v Speaker 2>That's why Travis Brown's elbows are so fucking impressive that he put him out.</v>

5097
02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:50.930
<v Speaker 2>He gets Josh out.</v>

5098
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:52.030
<v Speaker 2>It's weird when Josh Russia,</v>

5099
02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:54.380
<v Speaker 2>because Salt Gonzaga to get stopped like that.</v>

5100
02:11:54.381 --> 02:11:55.340
<v Speaker 2>Then he did the same thing.</v>

5101
02:11:55.370 --> 02:11:57.650
<v Speaker 2>I think he got clipped with a punch before he rushed.</v>

5102
02:11:58.910 --> 02:12:00.560
<v Speaker 2>I think if I remember correctly,</v>

5103
02:12:00.590 --> 02:12:01.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember correctly,</v>

5104
02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:03.920
<v Speaker 2>but I remember those fucking elbows.</v>

5105
02:12:04.130 --> 02:12:06.580
<v Speaker 2>We to this day we call that position the Travis Browne.</v>

5106
02:12:06.581 --> 02:12:07.414
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5107
02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Is he done Josh?</v>

5108
02:12:09.170 --> 02:12:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

5109
02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:10.190
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

5110
02:12:10.190 --> 02:12:11.023
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5111
02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:12.320
<v Speaker 2>Josh Barnett and Roy Nelson.</v>

5112
02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:13.340
<v Speaker 2>He has a five round fight.</v>

5113
02:12:13.550 --> 02:12:14.383
<v Speaker 2>Five rounds.</v>

5114
02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:15.710
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5115
02:12:15.710 --> 02:12:16.041
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5116
02:12:16.041 --> 02:12:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that kind of fight made a main event.</v>

5117
02:12:17.661 --> 02:12:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5118
02:12:17.850 --> 02:12:18.410
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

5119
02:12:18.410 --> 02:12:18.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5120
02:12:18.531 --> 02:12:19.370
<v Speaker 2>I was amazed at van.</v>

5121
02:12:19.670 --> 02:12:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5122
02:12:19.990 --> 02:12:20.381
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

5123
02:12:20.381 --> 02:12:21.214
<v Speaker 2>It was overseas.</v>

5124
02:12:21.530 --> 02:12:21.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5125
02:12:21.741 --> 02:12:22.670
<v Speaker 2>It was a beating man.</v>

5126
02:12:22.730 --> 02:12:23.290
<v Speaker 2>It was eating.</v>

5127
02:12:23.290 --> 02:12:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I was very impressed as cardio and you'd pass forwards gun like,</v>

5128
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:27.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5129
02:12:27.410 --> 02:12:28.940
<v Speaker 2>to frank does not look fat.</v>

5130
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5131
02:12:29.590 --> 02:12:30.423
<v Speaker 2>Just jacked man.</v>

5132
02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:31.011
<v Speaker 2>Why did I see,</v>

5133
02:12:31.011 --> 02:12:33.920
<v Speaker 2>I saw a photo of must have been from in the past where he was heavy,</v>

5134
02:12:34.070 --> 02:12:38.990
<v Speaker 2>like maybe while they were setting this fight up because like looking at him now</v>

5135
02:12:39.010 --> 02:12:40.340
<v Speaker 2>and he looks very fixed.</v>

5136
02:12:40.341 --> 02:12:40.760
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

5137
02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:41.541
<v Speaker 2>It looks very fit.</v>

5138
02:12:41.541 --> 02:12:42.300
<v Speaker 2>He's in studio with me.</v>

5139
02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:42.621
<v Speaker 2>I told him,</v>

5140
02:12:42.621 --> 02:12:42.801
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

5141
02:12:42.801 --> 02:12:42.951
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5142
02:12:42.951 --> 02:12:44.210
<v Speaker 2>you look shredded.</v>

5143
02:12:44.211 --> 02:12:44.571
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

5144
02:12:44.571 --> 02:12:45.404
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to go.</v>

5145
02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:46.393
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5146
02:12:46.580 --> 02:12:47.413
<v Speaker 2>I'm impressed.</v>

5147
02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:49.100
<v Speaker 2>He does look very fit,</v>

5148
02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:51.560
<v Speaker 2>so he must have been heavy when he started at camp.</v>

5149
02:12:52.510 --> 02:12:53.343
<v Speaker 2>It's really heavy.</v>

5150
02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:53.830
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

5151
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:56.400
<v Speaker 2>He didn't fight for a little bit so you know he's been commentating and flying a</v>

5152
02:12:56.410 --> 02:12:57.201
<v Speaker 2>Russia shit.</v>

5153
02:12:57.201 --> 02:12:57.741
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

5154
02:12:57.741 --> 02:12:58.041
<v Speaker 2>Here.</v>

5155
02:12:58.041 --> 02:12:58.874
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

5156
02:12:59.860 --> 02:13:00.950
<v Speaker 2>This is the only three rounds.</v>

5157
02:13:00.951 --> 02:13:03.770
<v Speaker 2>They don't do five round main event only title fights.</v>

5158
02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:04.633
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

5159
02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:06.320
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about that?</v>

5160
02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:07.820
<v Speaker 2>I kind of agree with that.</v>

5161
02:13:07.850 --> 02:13:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5162
02:13:08.050 --> 02:13:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mad at it.</v>

5163
02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:09.920
<v Speaker 2>I like firing rounds.</v>

5164
02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:10.810
<v Speaker 2>Three rounds.</v>

5165
02:13:10.810 --> 02:13:11.660
<v Speaker 2>That goes too quick.</v>

5166
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:12.571
<v Speaker 2>I liked five round,</v>

5167
02:13:12.571 --> 02:13:13.970

<v Speaker 2>anything or failures record there?</v>

5317
02:16:32.081 --> 02:16:33.190
<v Speaker 2>So he went on that fight,</v>

5318
02:16:33.191 --> 02:16:34.024
<v Speaker 2>fight winning streak.</v>

5319
02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:38.920
<v Speaker 2>It's none of it in the states before that three in states states loses.</v>

5320
02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Is this,</v>

5321
02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:40.870
<v Speaker 2>this first one in the states?</v>

5322
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:44.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Brett Rogers was his first.</v>

5323
02:16:44.381 --> 02:16:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5324
02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Was this was look at this.</v>

5325
02:16:46.390 --> 02:16:47.200
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

5326
02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:47.800
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

5327
02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:49.270
<v Speaker 2>He threw a leg kick.</v>

5328
02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:50.950
<v Speaker 2>And before that did you,</v>

5329
02:16:50.951 --> 02:16:53.600
<v Speaker 2>was this the whole fight or just a highlight real quick.</v>

5330
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.810
<v Speaker 2>They edited it.</v>

5331
02:16:54.810 --> 02:16:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5332
02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:55.773
<v Speaker 2>The video,</v>

5333
02:16:56.500 --> 02:16:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Jesus is still explosive.</v>

5334
02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:01.780
<v Speaker 2>He hit him with a leg kick first and then he faked the leg kick and came in with</v>

5335
02:17:01.781 --> 02:17:02.520
<v Speaker 2>that punch.</v>

5336
02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:03.850
<v Speaker 2>If you came at that right hand and left,</v>

5337
02:17:03.851 --> 02:17:04.760
<v Speaker 2>took behind it and he's,</v>

5338
02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:07.330
<v Speaker 2>he's still explosive man.</v>

5339
02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:07.901
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah man.</v>

5340
02:17:07.901 --> 02:17:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Tonight he was explosive.</v>

5341
02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:09.701
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

5342
02:17:09.701 --> 02:17:10.534
<v Speaker 2>he's still,</v>

5343
02:17:10.660 --> 02:17:13.230
<v Speaker 2>he's still fucking fade or I mean you still,</v>

5344
02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:16.090
<v Speaker 2>he's a legend for sure,</v>

5345
02:17:16.510 --> 02:17:20.260
<v Speaker 2>but you're tapping him in the jaw and he'll go down like a regular guy.</v>

5346
02:17:20.350 --> 02:17:22.660
<v Speaker 2>He is a regular guy in that regard.</v>

5347
02:17:22.661 --> 02:17:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Now all the fights that he's had,</v>

5348
02:17:24.850 --> 02:17:25.631
<v Speaker 2>all the wars,</v>

5349
02:17:25.631 --> 02:17:27.670
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he's in his late thirties right?</v>

5350
02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:29.680
<v Speaker 2>41 he's 41 wow.</v>

5351
02:17:29.681 --> 02:17:30.660
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was flood.</v>

5352
02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:32.200
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to see that some never happening.</v>

5353
02:17:32.201 --> 02:17:36.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's stupid for me to say it Francis and gone and or oh my God.</v>

5354
02:17:36.161 --> 02:17:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want to see that?</v>

5355
02:17:37.390 --> 02:17:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Cause they both just slamming them things,</v>

5356
02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:42.040
<v Speaker 2>but how do you think that fight would go?</v>

5357
02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

5358
02:17:42.730 --> 02:17:46.480
<v Speaker 2>I think Francis knocked his head into Russia or Brock Lesnar fate.</v>

5359
02:17:46.481 --> 02:17:47.314
<v Speaker 2>Or</v>

5360
02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:49.240
<v Speaker 2>if I was,</v>

5361
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.670
<v Speaker 2>if I could,</v>

5362
02:17:50.670 --> 02:17:51.730
<v Speaker 2>if I had,</v>

5363
02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:54.400
<v Speaker 2>if I had like a willy Wonka golden ticket,</v>

5364
02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:56.680
<v Speaker 2>like just gave it to you and I gave it to you,</v>

5365
02:17:56.740 --> 02:17:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I would say Brock Lesnar versus who,</v>

5366
02:17:59.700 --> 02:18:01.810
<v Speaker 2>who finances in Ghana</v>

5367
02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:04.901
<v Speaker 2>and the posters.</v>

5368
02:18:04.901 --> 02:18:05.734
<v Speaker 2>Just old school.</v>

5369
02:18:06.700 --> 02:18:07.750
<v Speaker 2>It'd be so sick.</v>

5370
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:09.063
<v Speaker 2>I liked that.</v>

5371
02:18:09.430 --> 02:18:09.971
<v Speaker 2>I liked that.</v>

5372
02:18:09.971 --> 02:18:12.280
<v Speaker 2>A thing about Brock can win if he lands a take down,</v>

5373
02:18:12.281 --> 02:18:16.030
<v Speaker 2>but good luck not getting clipped coming in such a dynamic fight.</v>

5374
02:18:16.570 --> 02:18:17.920
<v Speaker 2>It's nice scene fade or wind man.</v>

5375
02:18:17.921 --> 02:18:18.754
<v Speaker 2>I gotta say,</v>

5376
02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:19.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5377
02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:19.960
<v Speaker 2>I love Frank Mir.</v>

5378
02:18:19.961 --> 02:18:22.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Frank Mir fan and somebody had a,</v>

5379
02:18:22.211 --> 02:18:24.290
<v Speaker 2>when she was kind of Nice hail him,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

5382
02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:26.500
<v Speaker 2>I liked that a lot.</v>

5383
02:18:26.530 --> 02:18:28.420
<v Speaker 2>The biggest fight Beltour history.</v>

5384
02:18:28.660 --> 02:18:29.680
<v Speaker 2>It's a very good fight,</v>

5385
02:18:29.681 --> 02:18:30.250

5386
02:18:30.250 --> 02:18:33.960

5388
02:18:34.930 --> 02:18:35.980
<v Speaker 2>He's just off his name.</v>

5389
02:18:35.981 --> 02:18:36.791
<v Speaker 2>That's what frank was saying.</v>

5390
02:18:36.791 --> 02:18:37.001
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

5391
02:18:37.001 --> 02:18:37.450

5395
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.831
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't do interviews.</v>

5396
02:18:41.831 --> 02:18:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5397
02:18:42.490 --> 02:18:43.330
<v Speaker 2>well I get it.</v>

5398
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:44.950
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't speak English,</v>

5399
02:18:44.951 --> 02:18:45.784
<v Speaker 2>they call it.</v>

5400
02:18:46.650 --> 02:18:46.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5401
02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:47.570
<v Speaker 2>I figured it out.</v>

5402
02:18:47.570 --> 02:18:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker.</v>

5403
02:18:47.950 --> 02:18:49.030
<v Speaker 2>The new fans like who,</v>

5404
02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:51.010
<v Speaker 2>who while they know him now.</v>

5405
02:18:51.430 --> 02:18:51.851
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

5406
02:18:51.851 --> 02:18:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I think even amongst the,</v>

5407
02:18:54.250 --> 02:18:55.480
<v Speaker 2>the new fans,</v>

5408
02:18:55.510 --> 02:18:56.290
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>

5409
02:18:56.290 --> 02:18:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's essentially like a Reggie Jackson type character.</v>

5410
02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:01.210
<v Speaker 2>If you know baseball,</v>

5411
02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:02.350
<v Speaker 2>you know who Reggie Jackson,</v>

5412
02:19:02.351 --> 02:19:03.910
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't know a lot about them,</v>

5413
02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:05.950
<v Speaker 2>you know who Reggie Jackson and if you're new to the sport,</v>

5414
02:19:05.951 --> 02:19:06.220

02:19:06.220 --> 02:19:08.680
<v Speaker 2>this guy's the best of all time seeing this stuff,</v>

5416
02:19:08.681 --> 02:19:10.450
<v Speaker 2>but they don't realize it's days.</v>

5417
02:19:10.510 --> 02:19:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5436
02:19:45.050 --> 02:19:46.400
<v Speaker 2>If I was a manager,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's a tough fight.</v>

5460
02:20:26.690 --> 02:20:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Tough fight.</v>

5461
02:20:27.200 --> 02:20:27.891
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough fight.</v>

5462
02:20:27.891 --> 02:20:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Fight for Matt.</v>

5463
02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

5464
02:20:28.970 --> 02:20:31.820
<v Speaker 2>you know if he's got an issue at all,</v>

5465
02:20:32.030 --> 02:20:34.760
<v Speaker 2>it's not in his foot work or as knockout power is movement.</v>

5466
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:36.980
<v Speaker 2>It's if the fight goes the ground like it was resting.</v>

5467
02:20:36.981 --> 02:20:37.311
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

5468
02:20:37.311 --> 02:20:38.390
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear what channels to say.</v>

5469
02:20:38.391 --> 02:20:39.141
<v Speaker 2>Crank that shit up,</v>

5470
02:20:39.141 --> 02:20:39.974
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

5471
02:20:40.180 --> 02:20:41.090
<v Speaker 2>This can be great.</v>

5472
02:20:41.450 --> 02:20:42.283
<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>

5473
02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Say someone who'd be in Russian,</v>

5474
02:20:50.600 --> 02:20:52.230
<v Speaker 7>it will not be bored.</v>

5475
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:54.103
<v Speaker 2>His trash talking.</v>

5476
02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:55.190
<v Speaker 2>So old school,</v>

5477
02:20:55.700 --> 02:20:56.990
<v Speaker 2>it's very pro wrestling.</v>

5478
02:20:57.470 --> 02:20:58.610
<v Speaker 2>It's just not very good.</v>

5479
02:20:58.850 --> 02:21:01.250
<v Speaker 2>How do the Russian thing in is for this</v>

5480
02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.680
<v Speaker 2>damn Chilson is pretty fucking big.</v>

5481
02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:06.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5482
02:21:06.021 --> 02:21:07.220
<v Speaker 2>failure is a small dude.</v>

5483
02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:08.360
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

5484
02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:09.041
<v Speaker 2>That's why was a heavyweight.</v>

5485
02:21:09.041 --> 02:21:09.620
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

5486
02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:10.453
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5487
02:21:10.730 --> 02:21:11.780
<v Speaker 2>very interesting.</v>

5488
02:21:12.810 --> 02:21:13.100
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

5489
02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:13.580
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

5490
02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:13.861
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

5491
02:21:13.861 --> 02:21:14.900
<v Speaker 2>I expect more chill.</v>

5492
02:21:15.050 --> 02:21:15.690
<v Speaker 2>I thought he'd be like,</v>

5493
02:21:15.690 --> 02:21:17.590
<v Speaker 2>just one thing I hate more than being this gauge.</v>

5494
02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Do it's all Russian in this gauge.</v>

5495
02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:22.040
<v Speaker 2>The Trump,</v>

5496
02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:23.540
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

5497
02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:24.450
<v Speaker 2>It pulls out a Mac.</v>

5498
02:21:24.451 --> 02:21:25.284
<v Speaker 2>Got Married.</v>

5499
02:21:26.860 --> 02:21:27.693
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

5500
02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:30.070
<v Speaker 2>when is a fighter going to come out with a,</v>

5501
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.471
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5502
02:21:30.471 --> 02:21:33.230
<v Speaker 2>has there ever been a time where you get more shit for liking the president?</v>

5503
02:21:33.290 --> 02:21:35.360
<v Speaker 2>Never even close.</v>

5504
02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Not even close.</v>

5505
02:21:36.980 --> 02:21:38.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean at the very least,</v>

5506
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:40.520
<v Speaker 2>even if you didn't want him to win,</v>

5507
02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:42.110
<v Speaker 2>now that he's the president,</v>

5508
02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:44.210
<v Speaker 2>would you not want him to succeed?</v>

5509
02:21:44.530 --> 02:21:45.171
<v Speaker 2>What do you want?</v>

5510
02:21:45.171 --> 02:21:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Why do if he succeeds,</v>

5511
02:21:46.401 --> 02:21:47.240
<v Speaker 2>it means we succeed.</v>

5512
02:21:47.450 --> 02:21:50.570
<v Speaker 2>You want everything to be a catastrophic failure because your guy didn't win,</v>

5513
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:55.370
<v Speaker 2>or do you want him to get better at the job and be really good at what he does</v>

5514
02:21:55.490 --> 02:21:58.770
<v Speaker 2>and be the best president that he can be and pull a bunch of shit on what he did</v>

5515
02:21:58.790 --> 02:21:59.600
<v Speaker 2>with North Korea?</v>

5516
02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:00.433
<v Speaker 2>What's up with that?</v>

5517
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:01.543
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he did.</v>

5518
02:22:01.780 --> 02:22:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe it was a part of it.</v>

5519
02:22:03.200 --> 02:22:07.700
<v Speaker 2>We're both North Korea and South Korea giving Donald Trump all the credit.</v>

5520
02:22:07.740 --> 02:22:08.370
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

5521
02:22:08.370 --> 02:22:08.901
<v Speaker 2>If that's true,</v>

5522
02:22:08.901 --> 02:22:10.490
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing on CNN.</v>

5523
02:22:10.491 --> 02:22:10.541
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

5524
02:22:10.541 --> 02:22:15.541
<v Speaker 2>that alone shows you that his unorthodox style that you might be terrible if</v>

5525
02:22:15.621 --> 02:22:18.980
<v Speaker 2>you're married to them or terrible if you're doing business with them are</v>

5526
02:22:18.981 --> 02:22:20.960
<v Speaker 2>terrible if you're his lawyer or terrible whatever,</v>

5527
02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:24.800
<v Speaker 2>but that unorthodox style might have value to it,</v>

5528
02:22:24.801 --> 02:22:26.250
<v Speaker 2>but no one wants that value</v>

5529
02:22:26.250 --> 02:22:29.900
<v Speaker 4>because you don't want him to win because it's a fucking weird time.</v>

5530
02:22:29.901 --> 02:22:30.734
<v Speaker 4>It's like routine.</v>

5531
02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:34.950
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like you're rooting against America because you feel so strongly</v>

5532
02:22:34.951 --> 02:22:35.784
<v Speaker 4>about the press.</v>

5533
02:22:36.090 --> 02:22:36.681
<v Speaker 4>Like to your point,</v>

5534
02:22:36.681 --> 02:22:37.710
<v Speaker 4>would you rather have him out?</v>

5535
02:22:37.711 --> 02:22:38.620
<v Speaker 4>You want the economy,</v>

5536
02:22:38.621 --> 02:22:39.454
<v Speaker 4>you better.</v>

5537
02:22:39.650 --> 02:22:40.560
<v Speaker 4>Here's he's the other thing.</v>

5538
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:42.000
<v Speaker 4>You want Mike Pence to be president.</v>

5539
02:22:42.030 --> 02:22:43.440
<v Speaker 4>Are you sure you don't know what you just said?</v>

5540
02:22:43.490 --> 02:22:46.650
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what you're saying like that is not a smart choice.</v>

5541
02:22:46.651 --> 02:22:48.030
<v Speaker 4>That's not what you voted for.</v>

5542
02:22:48.090 --> 02:22:48.930
<v Speaker 4>It's now what you want.</v>

5543
02:22:49.230 --> 02:22:52.440
<v Speaker 4>What you should want is even if you don't like Donald Trump,</v>

5544
02:22:52.441 --> 02:22:56.040
<v Speaker 4>what you should want is that he does a great fucking job.</v>

5545
02:22:56.160 --> 02:22:57.900
<v Speaker 4>He turns the economy around,</v>

5546
02:22:58.020 --> 02:23:00.060
<v Speaker 4>he goes after child pedophiles,</v>

5547
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:02.130
<v Speaker 4>he goes after like whatever,</v>

5548
02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:02.611
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

5549
02:23:02.611 --> 02:23:03.630
<v Speaker 4>fill in the blanks,</v>

5550
02:23:03.631 --> 02:23:05.220
<v Speaker 4>whatever thing you would like them to do.</v>

5551
02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:10.140
<v Speaker 4>Even if he talks crazy shit about and it gets on Fox and friends and says a</v>

5552
02:23:10.141 --> 02:23:11.010
<v Speaker 4>bunch of nutty shit,</v>

5553
02:23:11.430 --> 02:23:15.660
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't you still want that guy to do the best job running the country?</v>

5554
02:23:15.810 --> 02:23:18.390
<v Speaker 4>This is where things get weird cause I think most people say no.</v>

5555
02:23:18.570 --> 02:23:20.280
<v Speaker 4>I think if they say yes,</v>

5556
02:23:20.281 --> 02:23:22.710
<v Speaker 4>they're lion what they want and they want them to fail,</v>

5557
02:23:22.770 --> 02:23:24.890
<v Speaker 4>they want them to be the worst ever because they watched.</v>

5558
02:23:24.930 --> 02:23:25.763
<v Speaker 4>That's what they want.</v>

5559
02:23:26.190 --> 02:23:27.390
<v Speaker 4>That's what they want to flaw.</v>

5560
02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:29.070
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy way of thinking.</v>

5561
02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:31.170
<v Speaker 4>But I didn't vote for Donald Trump,</v>

5562
02:23:31.410 --> 02:23:35.670
<v Speaker 4>but I want him to do great because he's the fucking president.</v>

5563
02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:40.500
<v Speaker 4>Like either someone else comes along that's better and wins and takes over,</v>

5564
02:23:40.501 --> 02:23:41.334
<v Speaker 4>or why would I,</v>

5565
02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:45.510
<v Speaker 4>why would I want everything to go bad even if I didn't vote for so retarded?</v>

5566
02:23:45.540 --> 02:23:46.090
<v Speaker 4>Everybody,</v>

5567
02:23:46.090 --> 02:23:47.730
<v Speaker 4>if you had a doctor,</v>

5568
02:23:47.731 --> 02:23:49.020
<v Speaker 4>this is a good example.</v>

5569
02:23:49.050 --> 02:23:49.291
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

5570
02:23:49.291 --> 02:23:49.480
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

5571
02:23:49.480 --> 02:23:49.710
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

5572
02:23:49.710 --> 02:23:50.543
<v Speaker 4>maybe it sucks,</v>

5573
02:23:50.670 --> 02:23:53.250
<v Speaker 4>but if you had a doctor and the doctor was a Dickhead,</v>

5574
02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:54.480
<v Speaker 4>the doctor's fucking annoying,</v>

5575
02:23:54.481 --> 02:23:55.440
<v Speaker 4>but he had to fix your knee.</v>

5576
02:23:57.090 --> 02:23:58.710
<v Speaker 4>But you know he's the best at fixing knees.</v>

5577
02:23:59.170 --> 02:24:00.090
<v Speaker 4>Like this guy's a Dick dickhead.</v>

5578
02:24:00.091 --> 02:24:01.260
<v Speaker 4>I hope he fucked my knee up.</v>

5579
02:24:02.990 --> 02:24:04.370
<v Speaker 4>And people are,</v>

5580
02:24:05.350 --> 02:24:08.550
<v Speaker 4>you can never say that it's only hurting you is the only guy can do this</v>

5581
02:24:08.551 --> 02:24:09.580
<v Speaker 4>operation for any of you.</v>

5582
02:24:09.581 --> 02:24:10.410
<v Speaker 4>Got to listen to me.</v>

5583
02:24:10.410 --> 02:24:11.640
<v Speaker 4>I know the guy's an asshole.</v>

5584
02:24:11.700 --> 02:24:12.760
<v Speaker 4>Let him operate on your knees,</v>

5585
02:24:12.770 --> 02:24:13.800
<v Speaker 4>going to do a great job.</v>

5586
02:24:13.950 --> 02:24:15.000
<v Speaker 4>He's going to talk shit.</v>

5587
02:24:15.090 --> 02:24:16.260
<v Speaker 4>He's going to try to fuck your mom,</v>

5588
02:24:16.380 --> 02:24:17.630
<v Speaker 4>but he's going to do,</v>

5589
02:24:19.390 --> 02:24:20.610
<v Speaker 4>here's a video.</v>

5590
02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:23.100
<v Speaker 4>Get it to people that hate Trump,</v>

5591
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:28.190
<v Speaker 4>accused them of being racist and there's a video of ice Q 50 said Shaquille</v>

5592
02:24:29.220 --> 02:24:29.370
<v Speaker 4>O'Neal,</v>

5593
02:24:29.370 --> 02:24:32.820
<v Speaker 4>like five or six celebrities and now Kanye West that a,</v>

5594
02:24:32.821 --> 02:24:33.780
<v Speaker 4>they don't think he's racist.</v>

5595
02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:35.580
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump is bad ass.</v>

5596
02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:36.530
<v Speaker 4>He's well,</v>

5597
02:24:36.540 --> 02:24:37.590
<v Speaker 4>he tells it like it is.</v>

5598
02:24:37.630 --> 02:24:39.180
<v Speaker 4>The question is like,</v>

5599
02:24:39.181 --> 02:24:40.080
<v Speaker 4>was he,</v>

5600
02:24:40.110 --> 02:24:42.600
<v Speaker 4>when he talked about Mexicans on the campaign trail,</v>

5601
02:24:42.601 --> 02:24:47.010
<v Speaker 4>was he playing to people that are white supremacists and what does he understand</v>

5602
02:24:47.011 --> 02:24:50.250
<v Speaker 4>that he has a base in those people and does he defend that base?</v>

5603
02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:53.520
<v Speaker 4>That was about Charlottesville to correct because he was saying that on both</v>

5604
02:24:53.521 --> 02:24:54.390
<v Speaker 4>sides there's,</v>

5605
02:24:54.391 --> 02:24:56.070
<v Speaker 4>there's problems on both sides.</v>

5606
02:24:56.071 --> 02:24:58.140
<v Speaker 4>Both the protesters and the KKK,</v>

5607
02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:00.180
<v Speaker 4>you gotta just and sometimes,</v>

5608
02:25:00.181 --> 02:25:02.550
<v Speaker 4>and he was right there on was problems on,</v>

5609
02:25:02.580 --> 02:25:03.570
<v Speaker 4>on both sides,</v>

5610
02:25:03.571 --> 02:25:06.660
<v Speaker 4>but they were there because of a white supremacy rally.</v>

5611
02:25:06.661 --> 02:25:10.770
<v Speaker 4>And the most important point is that that alone is a ridiculous way to think.</v>

5612
02:25:10.771 --> 02:25:11.700
<v Speaker 4>And that as Americans,</v>

5613
02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:16.050
<v Speaker 4>we can't tolerate someone who only likes people that come from the same part of</v>

5614
02:25:16.051 --> 02:25:19.530
<v Speaker 4>the world is dam or people that only have the same color skin is then where the</v>

5615
02:25:19.531 --> 02:25:20.850
<v Speaker 4>white race or the pure race,</v>

5616
02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:21.870
<v Speaker 4>because that's stupid.</v>

5617
02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:24.790
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't even fit up with what we know about Iq standards.</v>

5618
02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:28.510
<v Speaker 4>If we really wanted the master race we would be all trying to be Asian.</v>

5619
02:25:28.810 --> 02:25:29.111
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5620
02:25:29.111 --> 02:25:31.960
<v Speaker 4>Cause they dominate in Iq to the point where they're suing Harvard.</v>

5621
02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:33.610
<v Speaker 4>Right now there's Asian,</v>

5622
02:25:33.840 --> 02:25:36.910
<v Speaker 4>there's an Asian American group that's suing Harvard because the standards for</v>

5623
02:25:36.911 --> 02:25:40.750
<v Speaker 4>Asians to enter Harvard are more stringent than even white people.</v>

5624
02:25:41.140 --> 02:25:42.850
<v Speaker 4>They're harder because they're better because they get,</v>

5625
02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:45.760
<v Speaker 4>they get in more because their brains work better than yours.</v>

5626
02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:48.640
<v Speaker 4>But see this is not,</v>

5627
02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:50.050
<v Speaker 4>this is not a popular narrative.</v>

5628
02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:50.321
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5629
02:25:50.321 --> 02:25:51.950
<v Speaker 4>like people don't talk about this but,</v>

5630
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:52.360
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

5631
02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:53.620
<v Speaker 4>but no one,</v>

5632
02:25:53.890 --> 02:25:54.910
<v Speaker 4>no one's saying that.</v>

5633
02:25:55.090 --> 02:25:55.540
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

5634
02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:55.991
<v Speaker 4>So if you're,</v>

5635
02:25:55.991 --> 02:25:58.570
<v Speaker 4>if you're out there saying that the white race is superior,</v>

5636
02:25:58.660 --> 02:26:00.700
<v Speaker 4>you're not even paying attention to the facts this term.</v>

5637
02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:02.073
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5638
02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:02.771
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

5639
02:26:02.771 --> 02:26:04.720
<v Speaker 4>But you got Lysol for sure not.</v>

5640
02:26:04.750 --> 02:26:05.583
<v Speaker 4>But the whites premise is,</v>

5641
02:26:05.950 --> 02:26:10.810
<v Speaker 4>and they want general population think that Trump thinks like that too.</v>

5642
02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:11.320
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

5643
02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:12.041
<v Speaker 4>that's not true.</v>

5644
02:26:12.041 --> 02:26:12.970
<v Speaker 4>There's no evidence of that.</v>

5645
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:14.291
<v Speaker 4>That's what they thought.</v>

5646
02:26:14.291 --> 02:26:18.640
<v Speaker 4>There is evidence that he understands that he has a base and that his base is</v>

5647
02:26:18.850 --> 02:26:19.690
<v Speaker 4>white people.</v>

5648
02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:23.020
<v Speaker 4>There's a big part of it is white people that are fed up about political</v>

5649
02:26:23.021 --> 02:26:23.800
<v Speaker 4>correctness.</v>

5650
02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:27.160
<v Speaker 4>Why people that are fed up about being said they're racist just because they're</v>

5651
02:26:27.161 --> 02:26:29.370
<v Speaker 4>white and he knows black people that want to hand out.</v>

5652
02:26:29.371 --> 02:26:33.220
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a lot of racists that have a welfare prob problems that people that</v>

5653
02:26:33.221 --> 02:26:34.090
<v Speaker 4>are on welfare,</v>

5654
02:26:34.091 --> 02:26:34.960
<v Speaker 4>they're taken our money,</v>

5655
02:26:34.961 --> 02:26:35.794
<v Speaker 4>they've taken our jobs.</v>

5656
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:38.140
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of that going on and he knows that those people,</v>

5657
02:26:38.141 --> 02:26:40.630
<v Speaker 4>there's a percentage of those people that I'm sure support him.</v>

5658
02:26:40.810 --> 02:26:42.070
<v Speaker 4>So you gotta be real careful in the sand.</v>

5659
02:26:42.071 --> 02:26:43.060
<v Speaker 4>He plays to that side.</v>

5660
02:26:43.061 --> 02:26:43.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5661
02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:45.100
<v Speaker 4>But no one's saying he's got,</v>

5662
02:26:45.130 --> 02:26:46.780
<v Speaker 4>there's any evidence that he's like that.</v>

5663
02:26:46.781 --> 02:26:49.180
<v Speaker 4>But he did say racist shit about Mexicans.</v>

5664
02:26:49.630 --> 02:26:49.991
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5665
02:26:49.991 --> 02:26:52.460
<v Speaker 4>When he was talking about how the rape and murder and the like the,</v>

5666
02:26:52.470 --> 02:26:55.600
<v Speaker 4>you know like someone's doing the raping and murdering the crime,</v>

5667
02:26:56.320 --> 02:26:57.880
<v Speaker 4>the crime of course out of control.</v>

5668
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:59.200
<v Speaker 4>But he's not being honest about that.</v>

5669
02:26:59.290 --> 02:26:59.651
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

5670
02:26:59.651 --> 02:27:02.560
<v Speaker 4>so if one that's obvious that he's trying to win,</v>

5671
02:27:02.561 --> 02:27:02.741
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5672
02:27:02.741 --> 02:27:03.970
<v Speaker 4>Cause if it's being honest about that,</v>

5673
02:27:03.971 --> 02:27:07.690
<v Speaker 4>what he would say is the reason why there's so much crime is because drugs are</v>

5674
02:27:07.691 --> 02:27:08.524
<v Speaker 4>illegal.</v>

5675
02:27:08.530 --> 02:27:09.790
<v Speaker 4>If we may drugs legal,</v>

5676
02:27:09.791 --> 02:27:13.510
<v Speaker 4>we could sell these drugs to these people in America would be run by businesses</v>

5677
02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:15.380
<v Speaker 4>instead of being run by the mob that did.</v>

5678
02:27:15.420 --> 02:27:17.140
<v Speaker 4>The demand is undeniable.</v>

5679
02:27:17.170 --> 02:27:17.831
<v Speaker 4>It's undeniable.</v>

5680
02:27:17.831 --> 02:27:19.210
<v Speaker 4>There's a demand for cocaine,</v>

5681
02:27:19.390 --> 02:27:20.170
<v Speaker 4>heroin.</v>

5682
02:27:20.170 --> 02:27:23.200
<v Speaker 4>There's also a demand for alcohol is also a demand for plenty.</v>

5683
02:27:23.260 --> 02:27:25.180
<v Speaker 4>Plenty of things that are bad for you in America.</v>

5684
02:27:25.690 --> 02:27:30.690
<v Speaker 4>Zr once you go about go buy 770 horsepower corvette zero one that goes zero to</v>

5685
02:27:30.851 --> 02:27:35.020
<v Speaker 4>60 in 2.9 seconds and just drink all the fucking red bulls you want.</v>

5686
02:27:35.050 --> 02:27:38.290
<v Speaker 4>Get on the highway and stomp the gas and you're in a space ship.</v>

5687
02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:39.310
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy too.</v>

5688
02:27:39.820 --> 02:27:40.631
<v Speaker 4>That's all crazy.</v>

5689
02:27:40.631 --> 02:27:45.010
<v Speaker 4>So is doing heroin or you probably might die more driving a zr one like an</v>

5690
02:27:45.011 --> 02:27:45.551
<v Speaker 4>asshole.</v>

5691
02:27:45.551 --> 02:27:46.990
<v Speaker 4>Then you would be doing coke,</v>

5692
02:27:47.050 --> 02:27:48.430
<v Speaker 4>but just going to kill more people in.</v>

5693
02:27:48.431 --> 02:27:49.030
<v Speaker 4>That's the other one.</v>

5694
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:49.841
<v Speaker 4>You might look,</v>

5695
02:27:49.841 --> 02:27:51.040
<v Speaker 4>you might look,</v>

5696
02:27:51.070 --> 02:27:54.310
<v Speaker 4>there's still a lot of ways people can fuck up their life and other lives around</v>

5697
02:27:54.311 --> 02:27:55.690
<v Speaker 4>them that are absolutely illegal,</v>

5698
02:27:56.040 --> 02:27:59.440
<v Speaker 4>but we just make this decision that once something is illegal,</v>

5699
02:27:59.441 --> 02:28:01.210
<v Speaker 4>like drugs and I don't think you should do coke.</v>

5700
02:28:01.450 --> 02:28:02.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you should do heroin,</v>

5701
02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:03.840
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think you should.</v>

5702
02:28:04.210 --> 02:28:06.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you should fucking drink til you're dead either.</v>

5703
02:28:06.491 --> 02:28:07.780
<v Speaker 4>And people are doing that every day.</v>

5704
02:28:07.781 --> 02:28:07.991
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

5705
02:28:07.991 --> 02:28:09.460
<v Speaker 4>we're hypocrites in that regard.</v>

5706
02:28:09.730 --> 02:28:13.780
<v Speaker 4>And this idea that the only reason why these people were over there raping and</v>

5707
02:28:13.781 --> 02:28:15.430
<v Speaker 4>murdering is because they're Mexican.</v>

5708
02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:17.260
<v Speaker 4>That's racist.</v>

5709
02:28:17.710 --> 02:28:18.430
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're saying.</v>

5710
02:28:18.430 --> 02:28:19.630
<v Speaker 4>It's a 20 Mexico.</v>

5711
02:28:19.690 --> 02:28:20.980
<v Speaker 4>Someone over there is doing it,</v>

5712
02:28:20.990 --> 02:28:22.280
<v Speaker 4>but why are they doing it?</v>

5713
02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:23.151
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you why.</v>

5714
02:28:23.151 --> 02:28:25.130
<v Speaker 4>And you know why they're doing it.</v>

5715
02:28:25.131 --> 02:28:26.840
<v Speaker 4>Because drugs are illegal.</v>

5716
02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:28.820
<v Speaker 4>That's how the cartel makes their money.</v>

5717
02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:31.250
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about building a wall?</v>

5718
02:28:31.251 --> 02:28:31.850
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

5719
02:28:31.850 --> 02:28:32.690
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't build a wall.</v>

5720
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:33.860
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't have secure borders.</v>

5721
02:28:34.010 --> 02:28:36.320
<v Speaker 4>We should do is help Mexico.</v>

5722
02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:37.070
<v Speaker 4>We should.</v>

5723
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:39.890
<v Speaker 4>We should figure out some way and one of the best ways to help them would be</v>

5724
02:28:39.891 --> 02:28:40.491
<v Speaker 4>make drugs.</v>

5725
02:28:40.491 --> 02:28:42.000
<v Speaker 4>Legal could be one of the best ways to talk.</v>

5726
02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:43.680
<v Speaker 4>Not the one would recognize that.</v>

5727
02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:45.660
<v Speaker 4>What Mexico is just like,</v>

5728
02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:50.360
<v Speaker 4>like how is Mexico in terms of like the amount of distance,</v>

5729
02:28:50.420 --> 02:28:51.470
<v Speaker 4>how were they?</v>

5730
02:28:51.650 --> 02:28:53.210
<v Speaker 4>It's close as they are to us.</v>

5731
02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:54.560
<v Speaker 4>Not Us,</v>

5732
02:28:54.890 --> 02:28:56.810
<v Speaker 4>but New York is us.</v>

5733
02:28:57.410 --> 02:28:59.510
<v Speaker 4>You can get to it in Mexico in two hours.</v>

5734
02:28:59.511 --> 02:29:00.320
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

5735
02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:04.310
<v Speaker 4>you could drive to Mexico from La in two hours,</v>

5736
02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:06.830
<v Speaker 4>but that's the eyes are not a country.</v>

5737
02:29:06.830 --> 02:29:07.663
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even us,</v>

5738
02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:10.730
<v Speaker 4>but we decided that Maine is us.</v>

5739
02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:12.950
<v Speaker 4>That shit is way the fuck over there.</v>

5740
02:29:13.070 --> 02:29:14.600
<v Speaker 4>These people are tagged to us.</v>

5741
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:15.980
<v Speaker 4>They're right there.</v>

5742
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:17.150
<v Speaker 4>They're connected.</v>

5743
02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:18.650
<v Speaker 4>You could walk there.</v>

5744
02:29:18.860 --> 02:29:21.910
<v Speaker 4>It's not outrageous to match up more mess sources.</v>

5745
02:29:22.050 --> 02:29:22.883
<v Speaker 4>The right</v>

5746
02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:25.513
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

5747
02:29:26.090 --> 02:29:27.740
<v Speaker 4>Nations are ridiculous.</v>

5748
02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:29.070
<v Speaker 4>Nations are ridiculous.</v>

5749
02:29:29.250 --> 02:29:30.590
<v Speaker 4>One one world government.</v>

5750
02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:31.131
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5751
02:29:31.131 --> 02:29:32.480
<v Speaker 4>not even a government man.</v>

5752
02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:35.390
<v Speaker 4>We should have rules that we all agree on.</v>

5753
02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:38.870
<v Speaker 4>Our problems are as the boys teams go against other teams.</v>

5754
02:29:39.020 --> 02:29:41.060
<v Speaker 4>But if we're all on the same team,</v>

5755
02:29:41.180 --> 02:29:44.390
<v Speaker 4>then we compete against each other economically the way we do in cities.</v>

5756
02:29:44.391 --> 02:29:46.100
<v Speaker 4>That's why we don't have wars in cities.</v>

5757
02:29:46.310 --> 02:29:47.540
<v Speaker 4>We don't have city wars.</v>

5758
02:29:47.630 --> 02:29:47.931
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5759
02:29:47.931 --> 02:29:50.030
<v Speaker 4>The reason why we have wars with other countries,</v>

5760
02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:52.550
<v Speaker 4>because we think of each other as being on another team.</v>

5761
02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:54.350
<v Speaker 4>There's crime in cities,</v>

5762
02:29:54.440 --> 02:29:55.790
<v Speaker 4>but there's crime and countries.</v>

5763
02:29:56.060 --> 02:29:59.720
<v Speaker 4>But we really need is to abandon this idea that we're all in these fucking</v>

5764
02:29:59.721 --> 02:30:00.440
<v Speaker 4>tribes.</v>

5765
02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:02.270
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying I support one side or the other,</v>

5766
02:30:02.271 --> 02:30:02.900
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

5767
02:30:02.900 --> 02:30:03.890
<v Speaker 4>when Trump was saying that,</v>

5768
02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:05.810
<v Speaker 4>isn't the law,</v>

5769
02:30:05.820 --> 02:30:09.620
<v Speaker 4>the violences from the Mexican cartels and stuff in America and the some of it,</v>

5770
02:30:09.650 --> 02:30:10.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5771
02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:10.380
<v Speaker 4>a lot.</v>

5772
02:30:10.380 --> 02:30:11.180
<v Speaker 4>Salvadorians no,</v>

5773
02:30:11.180 --> 02:30:12.200
<v Speaker 4>it's 100% real,</v>

5774
02:30:12.350 --> 02:30:17.150
<v Speaker 4>but it's propped up by trucks and until you address the root of what gives them</v>

5775
02:30:17.151 --> 02:30:17.780
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>

5776
02:30:17.780 --> 02:30:18.710
<v Speaker 4>causes the violence,</v>

5777
02:30:18.711 --> 02:30:20.360
<v Speaker 4>and I'm just talking nonsense.</v>

5778
02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:25.250
<v Speaker 4>So the primitive way to approach it is to say this team is going to go against</v>

5779
02:30:25.251 --> 02:30:25.821
<v Speaker 4>that team.</v>

5780
02:30:25.821 --> 02:30:26.960
<v Speaker 4>So we're going to put up a wall of heat.</v>

5781
02:30:26.961 --> 02:30:28.280
<v Speaker 4>That team from coming over here.</v>

5782
02:30:28.310 --> 02:30:29.143
<v Speaker 4>That's not going to help.</v>

5783
02:30:29.180 --> 02:30:29.990
<v Speaker 4>They're still going to drink.</v>

5784
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:33.740
<v Speaker 4>If you want to look at the entire future of people the entire future,</v>

5785
02:30:33.770 --> 02:30:37.100
<v Speaker 4>it's eventually going to come to a point where there's going to be an easy way.</v>

5786
02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:38.121
<v Speaker 4>You know there's,</v>

5787
02:30:38.121 --> 02:30:38.460
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

5788
02:30:38.460 --> 02:30:41.000
<v Speaker 4>they have these pixel and the Google Pixel phone.</v>

5789
02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:45.280
<v Speaker 4>They have these ear buds that allow you to translate someone's language in real</v>

5790
02:30:45.281 --> 02:30:45.710
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

5791
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:47.330
<v Speaker 4>So if you were talking to me in Spanish,</v>

5792
02:30:47.331 --> 02:30:50.240
<v Speaker 4>I could hear it through these ear buds for the Google Pixel phone,</v>

5793
02:30:50.241 --> 02:30:54.110
<v Speaker 4>the Pixel two and it would translate so I could go to Mexico,</v>

5794
02:30:54.111 --> 02:30:56.510
<v Speaker 4>I could talk to some cat who knows Spanish.</v>

5795
02:30:56.600 --> 02:30:58.370
<v Speaker 4>He and I could talk and he could,</v>

5796
02:30:58.460 --> 02:30:59.960
<v Speaker 4>I could understand what he's saying.</v>

5797
02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:04.000
<v Speaker 4>It's going to come a point in time where that is way simpler language.</v>

5798
02:31:04.530 --> 02:31:05.750
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be all the same language.</v>

5799
02:31:05.751 --> 02:31:06.380
<v Speaker 4>And then it's like,</v>

5800
02:31:06.380 --> 02:31:07.280
<v Speaker 4>why is,</v>

5801
02:31:07.281 --> 02:31:11.540
<v Speaker 4>why is there a war with Mexico and not a war with North Dakota?</v>

5802
02:31:11.780 --> 02:31:12.231
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

5803
02:31:12.231 --> 02:31:17.150
<v Speaker 4>Why am I not on the same team as someone in fucking Tiawana,</v>

5804
02:31:17.151 --> 02:31:18.200
<v Speaker 4>which is right there.</v>

5805
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.990
<v Speaker 4>Why am I not,</v>

5806
02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:20.790
<v Speaker 4>not just like those people?</v>

5807
02:31:20.791 --> 02:31:24.330
<v Speaker 4>Why are we on different teams says who says why?</v>

5808
02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:25.170
<v Speaker 4>What benefit is that?</v>

5809
02:31:25.170 --> 02:31:27.290
<v Speaker 4>This is some old school shit that we only needed,</v>

5810
02:31:27.300 --> 02:31:29.760
<v Speaker 4>cause he didn't know what the fuck people are doing because it was like vikings.</v>

5811
02:31:29.880 --> 02:31:32.280
<v Speaker 4>They would show up in both start raping and murdering two,</v>

5812
02:31:32.420 --> 02:31:35.130
<v Speaker 4>but they're not doing that to the people that are in their village.</v>

5813
02:31:35.131 --> 02:31:35.371
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5814
02:31:35.371 --> 02:31:36.540
<v Speaker 4>They're not doing that to each other.</v>

5815
02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:36.911
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5816
02:31:36.911 --> 02:31:38.910
<v Speaker 4>they do it because they think people or the other.</v>

5817
02:31:39.090 --> 02:31:41.190
<v Speaker 4>So this idea of the other and the idea that tribe,</v>

5818
02:31:41.191 --> 02:31:42.300
<v Speaker 4>it's an outdated idea.</v>

5819
02:31:42.570 --> 02:31:44.310
<v Speaker 4>It's an outdated idea that it may be.</v>

5820
02:31:44.311 --> 02:31:45.031
<v Speaker 4>It's not time.</v>

5821
02:31:45.031 --> 02:31:46.230
<v Speaker 4>It's times not done now,</v>

5822
02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:48.990
<v Speaker 4>but its time has done in a hundred years or a thousand years.</v>

5823
02:31:49.350 --> 02:31:50.970
<v Speaker 4>The future is people,</v>

5824
02:31:50.971 --> 02:31:51.840
<v Speaker 4>just people.</v>

5825
02:31:51.930 --> 02:31:55.950
<v Speaker 4>It's not Germans versus the French versus the Russians versus the Italians.</v>

5826
02:31:56.160 --> 02:31:57.450
<v Speaker 4>That shit is retro.</v>

5827
02:31:57.540 --> 02:31:58.373
<v Speaker 4>It's stupid.</v>

5828
02:31:58.620 --> 02:31:59.453
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

5829
02:31:59.570 --> 02:32:03.690
<v Speaker 4>it's just like tribes of fucking ancient hominids just sneak it in when they</v>

5830
02:32:03.691 --> 02:32:06.360
<v Speaker 4>didn't even speak languages and club at each other and raping each other and</v>

5831
02:32:06.361 --> 02:32:07.920
<v Speaker 4>doing all the shit that people have done forever.</v>

5832
02:32:07.980 --> 02:32:09.180
<v Speaker 4>Plus California,</v>

5833
02:32:09.181 --> 02:32:09.691
<v Speaker 4>Arizona,</v>

5834
02:32:09.691 --> 02:32:11.460
<v Speaker 4>and Texas were Mexico.</v>

5835
02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:13.740
<v Speaker 4>How about California's trying to separate into three spots.</v>

5836
02:32:13.890 --> 02:32:14.723
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

5837
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.780
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

5838
02:32:15.780 --> 02:32:16.860
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be on the ballot.</v>

5839
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:17.820
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be on the ballot in what?</v>

5840
02:32:17.821 --> 02:32:19.230
<v Speaker 4>2020 is that what it is?</v>

5841
02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:21.470
<v Speaker 4>They can cause wins.</v>

5842
02:32:21.660 --> 02:32:22.171
<v Speaker 4>What happens?</v>

5843
02:32:22.171 --> 02:32:22.561
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be,</v>

5844
02:32:22.561 --> 02:32:24.830
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be fucking California south.</v>

5845
02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:25.200
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

5846
02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:26.150
<v Speaker 4>This is going to be la.</v>

5847
02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:29.220
<v Speaker 4>He was going to be one that's going to be like California and then there's going</v>

5848
02:32:29.221 --> 02:32:30.900
<v Speaker 4>to be like southern California,</v>

5849
02:32:30.901 --> 02:32:32.820
<v Speaker 4>like San Diego way up to like,</v>

5850
02:32:32.821 --> 02:32:34.320
<v Speaker 4>you know like Bakersfield or some shit.</v>

5851
02:32:34.321 --> 02:32:36.390
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense though if you're,</v>

5852
02:32:36.391 --> 02:32:36.960
<v Speaker 4>if you're gonna do,</v>

5853
02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:38.910
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to go off the old game plan,</v>

5854
02:32:39.060 --> 02:32:39.870
<v Speaker 4>the old map,</v>

5855
02:32:39.870 --> 02:32:42.330
<v Speaker 4>it makes it so big.</v>

5856
02:32:42.360 --> 02:32:43.560
<v Speaker 4>This is why it makes taxes.</v>

5857
02:32:43.620 --> 02:32:46.170
<v Speaker 4>If you drive from La to San Francisco,</v>

5858
02:32:46.171 --> 02:32:47.400
<v Speaker 4>you drive through Kentucky.</v>

5859
02:32:47.401 --> 02:32:48.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how it happens,</v>

5860
02:32:49.050 --> 02:32:49.501
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

5861
02:32:49.501 --> 02:32:49.931
<v Speaker 4>the you,</v>

5862
02:32:49.931 --> 02:32:53.400
<v Speaker 4>you drive by God is great signs and don't have abortions.</v>

5863
02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:56.220
<v Speaker 4>Here's a doctor or this is Jesus loves you.</v>

5864
02:32:56.370 --> 02:32:57.690
<v Speaker 4>It's farm land.</v>

5865
02:32:57.840 --> 02:33:00.750
<v Speaker 4>It's not what you think it is and it's nothing wrong with Kentucky.</v>

5866
02:33:00.751 --> 02:33:01.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about it's,</v>

5867
02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:02.383
<v Speaker 4>it's rural.</v>

5868
02:33:02.610 --> 02:33:03.241
<v Speaker 4>It's rural.</v>

5869
02:33:03.241 --> 02:33:03.691
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>

5870
02:33:03.691 --> 02:33:03.991
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5871
02:33:03.991 --> 02:33:04.170
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5872
02:33:04.170 --> 02:33:05.070
<v Speaker 4>but it's rural.</v>

5873
02:33:05.071 --> 02:33:06.270
<v Speaker 4>It's farm land.</v>

5874
02:33:06.390 --> 02:33:09.450
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a big part of California that's farms.</v>

5875
02:33:09.451 --> 02:33:09.601
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5876
02:33:09.601 --> 02:33:10.410
<v Speaker 4>But isn't it,</v>

5877
02:33:10.410 --> 02:33:11.230
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

5878

02:33:17.881 --> 02:33:18.150
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

5883
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:19.710
<v Speaker 4>But it's not that anybody's killing it.</v>

5885
02:33:20.281 --> 02:33:21.810
<v Speaker 4>the con they don't feel represented.</v>

5886
02:33:21.811 --> 02:33:22.230
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

5887
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:27.230
<v Speaker 4>there's more people in San Francisco and in Los Angeles by far than the rest of</v>

5888
02:33:27.331 --> 02:33:27.811
<v Speaker 4>the state.</v>

5889
02:33:27.811 --> 02:33:29.670
<v Speaker 4>But the state is huge.</v>

5890
02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:30.240
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

5891
02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:30.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5892
02:33:30.541 --> 02:33:31.260
<v Speaker 4>it takes,</v>

5893
02:33:31.260 --> 02:33:32.190
<v Speaker 4>you drive from,</v>

5894
02:33:32.260 --> 02:33:35.760
<v Speaker 4>everybody thinks it's San Francisco is northern California the fuck it is.</v>

5895
02:33:36.030 --> 02:33:36.570
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

5896
02:33:36.570 --> 02:33:39.780
<v Speaker 4>there's hours of driving until you hit more northern.</v>

5897
02:33:39.781 --> 02:33:43.650
<v Speaker 4>How many hours did it take to drive from San Francisco to Oregon?</v>

5898
02:33:43.770 --> 02:33:45.190
<v Speaker 4>I want to say four.</v>

5899
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:45.840
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

5900
02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:46.950
<v Speaker 4>I'll say three somewhere.</v>

5901
02:33:46.951 --> 02:33:47.910
<v Speaker 4>I'll say a little bit more.</v>

5902
02:33:47.911 --> 02:33:49.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say to four and a half.</v>

5903
02:33:49.530 --> 02:33:51.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna say two and a half hours.</v>

5904
02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:53.233
<v Speaker 4>Was it Saint James?</v>

5905
02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:56.033
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5906
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.903
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5907
02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:57.291
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

5908
02:33:57.291 --> 02:33:59.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying for sticking to for you might be right.</v>

5909
02:33:59.910 --> 02:34:00.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm just guessing,</v>

5910
02:34:00.690 --> 02:34:01.680
<v Speaker 4>but it's fucking,</v>

5911
02:34:01.980 --> 02:34:03.300
<v Speaker 4>it's a grip of space.</v>

5912
02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:04.740
<v Speaker 4>Five hours.</v>

5913
02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:05.401
<v Speaker 4>Five hours.</v>

5914
02:34:05.401 --> 02:34:10.080
<v Speaker 4>See there's a lot of fucking space up there and those people are all rural.</v>

5915
02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:14.290
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's where like the Green Emerald Triangle is and Humboldt and a</v>

5916
02:34:14.291 --> 02:34:15.700
<v Speaker 4>grown all the fucking weed.</v>

5917
02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:17.170
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful as beautiful up there.</v>

5918
02:34:17.171 --> 02:34:18.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like a rain forest</v>

5919
02:34:18.750 --> 02:34:18.940
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

5920
02:34:18.940 --> 02:34:19.661
<v Speaker 2>I've been to many,</v>

5921
02:34:19.661 --> 02:34:21.220
<v Speaker 2>many parts of northern California.</v>

5922
02:34:21.221 --> 02:34:23.480
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even remotely resemble Southern Cal.</v>

5923
02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:24.011
<v Speaker 2>Hell No.</v>

5924
02:34:24.011 --> 02:34:25.960
<v Speaker 2>So these people didn't feel represented.</v>

5925
02:34:26.230 --> 02:34:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Alleys all goofy.</v>

5926
02:34:27.551 --> 02:34:28.001
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

5927
02:34:28.001 --> 02:34:28.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5928
02:34:28.350 --> 02:34:32.740
<v Speaker 2>they feel like this is just some liberal delusional hotbed and they also don't</v>

5929
02:34:32.741 --> 02:34:34.030
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of the laws,</v>

5930
02:34:34.270 --> 02:34:39.270
<v Speaker 2>the laws in regards to wildlife management mosques is like if he live in</v>

5931
02:34:39.341 --> 02:34:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Sacramento wiping the same tax as someone that lives in Malibu.</v>

5932
02:34:42.250 --> 02:34:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

5933
02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:44.500
<v Speaker 2>the taxes are off the charts here.</v>

5934
02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:47.350
<v Speaker 2>They were saying that 500,000 people this year going gonna move out of</v>

5935
02:34:47.351 --> 02:34:50.890
<v Speaker 2>California in New York because of taxes just because of tax.</v>

5936
02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:54.250
<v Speaker 2>But say he was a bit more than if you live in Oxnard should be paying the same</v>

5937
02:34:54.251 --> 02:34:55.084
<v Speaker 2>tax zone,</v>

5938
02:34:55.140 --> 02:34:56.140
<v Speaker 2>beach front property.</v>

5939
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:57.700
<v Speaker 2>How fucked up is that?</v>

5940
02:34:57.701 --> 02:34:57.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5941
02:34:57.960 --> 02:34:58.793
<v Speaker 2>it makes no sense.</v>

5942
02:34:58.840 --> 02:34:59.673
<v Speaker 2>But you aren't.</v>

5943
02:34:59.860 --> 02:35:02.170
<v Speaker 2>You paying more if you live in Malibu because you're paying more,</v>

5944
02:35:02.171 --> 02:35:03.010
<v Speaker 2>you make more money.</v>

5945
02:35:03.090 --> 02:35:03.461
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

5946
02:35:03.461 --> 02:35:05.290
<v Speaker 2>you're a higher percentage of your property.</v>

5947
02:35:05.291 --> 02:35:05.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5948
02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:05.820
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

5949
02:35:05.820 --> 02:35:07.030
<v Speaker 2>your property's worth more.</v>

5950
02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:07.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5951
02:35:07.191 --> 02:35:07.460
<v Speaker 2>But still,</v>

5952
02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:09.210
<v Speaker 2>you're still a high fucking ready to feed,</v>

5953
02:35:09.230 --> 02:35:10.710
<v Speaker 2>not to live in California.</v>

5954
02:35:10.711 --> 02:35:11.560
<v Speaker 2>The rates ridiculous.</v>

5955
02:35:11.561 --> 02:35:12.100
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

5956
02:35:12.100 --> 02:35:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5957
02:35:12.370 --> 02:35:12.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5958
02:35:12.701 --> 02:35:13.061
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>

5959
02:35:13.061 --> 02:35:15.580
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous when you realize you don't have to pay that rate.</v>

5960
02:35:15.581 --> 02:35:16.600
<v Speaker 2>If you go other places,</v>

5961
02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:18.820
<v Speaker 2>like I know guys who've moved,</v>

5962
02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:19.793
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>

5963
02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Florida is pretty good.</v>

5964
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:21.761
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>

5965
02:35:21.761 --> 02:35:22.361
<v Speaker 2>Florida is good.</v>

5966
02:35:22.361 --> 02:35:23.230
<v Speaker 2>If you have a business,</v>

5967
02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:23.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5968
02:35:23.501 --> 02:35:27.100
<v Speaker 2>like I know guys that have businesses that move to Florida because if they sell</v>

5969
02:35:27.101 --> 02:35:27.611
<v Speaker 2>their business,</v>

5970
02:35:27.611 --> 02:35:31.510
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to pay 13% to the government in California and they can't text.</v>

5971
02:35:31.511 --> 02:35:32.690
<v Speaker 2>This is good thing happens.</v>

5972
02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:33.623
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5973
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:35.380
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of places we don't pay state tax,</v>

5974
02:35:35.381 --> 02:35:36.041
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>

5975
02:35:36.041 --> 02:35:36.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5976
02:35:36.221 --> 02:35:37.054
<v Speaker 2>pay state tax,</v>

5977
02:35:37.070 --> 02:35:37.661
<v Speaker 2>Nevada,</v>

5978
02:35:37.661 --> 02:35:37.991
<v Speaker 2>you don't pay.</v>

5979
02:35:37.991 --> 02:35:38.980
<v Speaker 2>State tax might be,</v>

5980
02:35:40.180 --> 02:35:43.780
<v Speaker 2>I think when I'm reading right now says this is not just the plan to split the</v>

5981
02:35:43.781 --> 02:35:44.140
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

5982
02:35:44.140 --> 02:35:48.160
<v Speaker 2>It's the split away from the United States to make it so much of that plan.</v>

5983
02:35:49.420 --> 02:35:50.253
<v Speaker 2>Some wacky dude.</v>

5984
02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:53.170
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

5985
02:35:55.340 --> 02:35:57.100
<v Speaker 2>definitely luxury.</v>

5986
02:35:57.101 --> 02:35:57.850
<v Speaker 2>I can have,</v>

5987
02:35:57.850 --> 02:35:59.020
<v Speaker 2>I believe in luxury.</v>

5988
02:35:59.100 --> 02:35:59.900
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>

5989
02:35:59.900 --> 02:36:00.611
<v Speaker 2>that's not happening.</v>

5990
02:36:00.611 --> 02:36:02.320
<v Speaker 2>So that's how the Lord of the texts,</v>

5991
02:36:02.321 --> 02:36:04.930
<v Speaker 2>the big one where the business people or people that want to save the money,</v>

5992
02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:09.460
<v Speaker 2>but the United States is fascinating in a way that you could find out where the</v>

5993
02:36:09.461 --> 02:36:10.360
<v Speaker 2>laws are best for you.</v>

5994
02:36:10.361 --> 02:36:10.661
<v Speaker 2>And you go,</v>

5995
02:36:10.661 --> 02:36:10.871
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

5996
02:36:10.871 --> 02:36:12.910
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to fucking take a chance and moved to Montana.</v>

5997
02:36:13.390 --> 02:36:13.601
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5998
02:36:13.601 --> 02:36:13.841
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

5999
02:36:13.841 --> 02:36:14.710
<v Speaker 2>you live in Montana,</v>

6000
02:36:14.711 --> 02:36:17.830
<v Speaker 2>you're living in a place where like 3 million people instead of 30 million</v>

6001
02:36:17.831 --> 02:36:18.400
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

6002
02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:19.780
<v Speaker 2>You live in a place where you're like,</v>

6003
02:36:19.830 --> 02:36:19.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6004
02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:23.230
<v Speaker 2>butted up against the fucking Yellowstone park and looking at mountains and</v>

6005
02:36:23.231 --> 02:36:23.511
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

6006
02:36:23.511 --> 02:36:24.610
<v Speaker 2>And yet we're just at night.</v>

6007
02:36:24.730 --> 02:36:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Is it true that you could take the world's population and fit them all in Texas,</v>

6008
02:36:28.661 --> 02:36:29.710
<v Speaker 2>all in their own house?</v>

6009
02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

6010
02:36:29.950 --> 02:36:30.401
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

6011
02:36:30.401 --> 02:36:31.210
<v Speaker 2>That's really true.</v>

6012
02:36:31.210 --> 02:36:31.750
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

6013
02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6014
02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:33.760
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is the Texas is gigantic.</v>

6015
02:36:33.850 --> 02:36:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6016
02:36:34.150 --> 02:36:38.800
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking about all of China and all of Africa in Texas with everyone</v>

6017
02:36:38.801 --> 02:36:39.131
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

6018
02:36:39.131 --> 02:36:42.100
<v Speaker 2>There's some things about and saying there's something about Texas where,</v>

6019
02:36:42.101 --> 02:36:42.930
<v Speaker 2>is that true?</v>

6020
02:36:42.930 --> 02:36:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6021
02:36:43.330 --> 02:36:43.761
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

6022
02:36:43.761 --> 02:36:45.490
<v Speaker 2>I amount of European countries,</v>

6023
02:36:45.491 --> 02:36:46.570
<v Speaker 2>you fit in Texas.</v>

6024
02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:47.590
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of crazy.</v>

6025
02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:48.290
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

6026
02:36:48.290 --> 02:36:51.400
<v Speaker 2>The whole world can fit in Texas with their own house.</v>

6027
02:36:51.670 --> 02:36:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Everybody with their own house.</v>

6028
02:36:53.190 --> 02:36:54.550
<v Speaker 2>That seems unbelievable.</v>

6029
02:36:54.551 --> 02:36:56.200
<v Speaker 2>8 billion a billion people.</v>

6030
02:36:57.220 --> 02:36:58.600
<v Speaker 2>People in Texas and their own house,</v>

6031
02:36:58.630 --> 02:37:00.370
<v Speaker 2>a billion houses in Texas.</v>

6032
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:01.031
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6033
02:37:01.031 --> 02:37:02.880
<v Speaker 2>Texas is a different state man.</v>

6034
02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:04.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not like any other state.</v>

6035
02:37:04.650 --> 02:37:08.320
<v Speaker 2>They were Alaska Kulik you could do the same thing in Alaska if everyone lived</v>

6036
02:37:08.321 --> 02:37:09.550
<v Speaker 2>in a 10 by 10 room.</v>

6037
02:37:09.551 --> 02:37:09.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6038
02:37:09.850 --> 02:37:10.091
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6039
02:37:10.091 --> 02:37:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Alaska is the biggest,</v>

6040
02:37:11.291 --> 02:37:13.030
<v Speaker 2>and Texas is the second pig is right,</v>

6041
02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:13.930
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

6042
02:37:13.930 --> 02:37:14.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6043
02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:15.713
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't it seem,</v>

6044
02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:17.240
<v Speaker 2>if that's the case,</v>

6045
02:37:18.380 --> 02:37:21.380
<v Speaker 2>then the overpopulation is a myth.</v>

6046
02:37:21.390 --> 02:37:22.430
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be no,</v>

6047
02:37:22.431 --> 02:37:24.920
<v Speaker 2>it's not a myth because it's about the resources in space.</v>

6048
02:37:24.921 --> 02:37:26.270
<v Speaker 2>You could jam everybody in Texas,</v>

6049
02:37:26.271 --> 02:37:27.620
<v Speaker 2>but it would be like Mad Max.</v>

6050
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:29.510
<v Speaker 2>There'll be funnel Carolyn still,</v>

6051
02:37:29.511 --> 02:37:31.410
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like there's no,</v>

6052
02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:33.360
<v Speaker 2>and the rest of the world is,</v>

6053
02:37:33.370 --> 02:37:36.350
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to grow food in the rest of the world and people would be socking it</v>

6054
02:37:36.351 --> 02:37:39.060
<v Speaker 2>out and truck loads each other.</v>

6055
02:37:39.061 --> 02:37:40.370
<v Speaker 2>That'd be on top of each other.</v>

6056
02:37:40.430 --> 02:37:41.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6057
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.241
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

6058
02:37:41.241 --> 02:37:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Overpopulation is not a myth.</v>

6059
02:37:42.621 --> 02:37:44.500
<v Speaker 2>Eddie overpopulation is right.</v>

6060
02:37:44.540 --> 02:37:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Everybody in Texas,</v>

6061
02:37:45.531 --> 02:37:46.060
<v Speaker 2>it's a math.</v>

6062
02:37:46.060 --> 02:37:46.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6063
02:37:46.370 --> 02:37:46.640
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6064
02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:46.860
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6065
02:37:46.860 --> 02:37:46.991
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6066
02:37:46.991 --> 02:37:47.151
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

6067
02:37:47.151 --> 02:37:47.870
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>

6068
02:37:47.870 --> 02:37:48.351
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

6069
02:37:48.351 --> 02:37:49.370
<v Speaker 2>it's not sustainable.</v>

6070
02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:51.440
<v Speaker 2>This is the problem with overpopulation right now.</v>

6071
02:37:51.500 --> 02:37:53.600
<v Speaker 2>We're okay if we just kept this number.</v>

6072
02:37:53.810 --> 02:37:55.040
<v Speaker 2>The human race could survive.</v>

6073
02:37:55.370 --> 02:37:58.040
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is we're not keeping this number sign.</v>

6074
02:37:58.040 --> 02:37:58.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6075
02:37:58.460 --> 02:37:59.570
<v Speaker 2>this number's going to grow.</v>

6076
02:37:59.571 --> 02:38:01.070
<v Speaker 2>This number was 2 billion.</v>

6077
02:38:01.071 --> 02:38:04.490
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck it was in 1950 and it's 7 billion now.</v>

6078
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:05.000
<v Speaker 2>The voice,</v>

6079
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.070
<v Speaker 2>it's the resource having less kids though.</v>

6080
02:38:07.071 --> 02:38:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Now I have so many friends in the forties and have no kids.</v>

6081
02:38:10.010 --> 02:38:13.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it wasn't the fifth shiner swirled swirling countries.</v>

6082
02:38:13.251 --> 02:38:14.810
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things about the rest of the world.</v>

6083
02:38:14.811 --> 02:38:17.630
<v Speaker 2>They're outbreeding US radically will not.</v>

6084
02:38:17.631 --> 02:38:18.540
<v Speaker 2>In Japan there's,</v>

6085
02:38:18.570 --> 02:38:19.430
<v Speaker 2>there's been studies.</v>

6086
02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Every time I'm on a plane,</v>

6087
02:38:20.451 --> 02:38:22.730
<v Speaker 2>I see emptiness in barren wasteland.</v>

6088
02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:23.451
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere I go,</v>

6089
02:38:23.451 --> 02:38:24.261
<v Speaker 2>I don't see like over,</v>

6090
02:38:24.261 --> 02:38:25.070
<v Speaker 2>it's true relation.</v>

6091
02:38:25.070 --> 02:38:26.940
<v Speaker 2>I see emptiness everywhere had that.</v>

6092
02:38:26.941 --> 02:38:27.840
<v Speaker 2>He has a point here,</v>

6093
02:38:28.530 --> 02:38:30.140
<v Speaker 2>people and you fly over the country,</v>

6094
02:38:30.141 --> 02:38:32.060
<v Speaker 2>but there's places where you can't grow shit.</v>

6095
02:38:32.061 --> 02:38:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>

6096
02:38:32.660 --> 02:38:34.580
<v Speaker 2>like you're flying over Nevada and you're looking down</v>

6097
02:38:36.460 --> 02:38:37.251
<v Speaker 2>and you got to look.</v>

6098
02:38:37.251 --> 02:38:39.920
<v Speaker 2>What they did with Vegas is they tricked everybody to thank you.</v>

6099
02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:40.910
<v Speaker 2>You could live in Nevada,</v>

6100
02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:43.340
<v Speaker 2>don't pay fucking fucking made that.</v>

6101
02:38:43.370 --> 02:38:44.630
<v Speaker 2>They made Henderson,</v>

6102
02:38:44.660 --> 02:38:45.500
<v Speaker 2>they made Vegas.</v>

6103
02:38:45.501 --> 02:38:48.920
<v Speaker 2>They basically built these places in a place they shouldn't have built places.</v>

6104
02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:50.900
<v Speaker 2>They found they had a crazy rule.</v>

6105
02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:52.530
<v Speaker 2>They could do whatever the fuck they want there.</v>

6106
02:38:52.650 --> 02:38:53.490
<v Speaker 2>There's the loss.</v>

6107
02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:56.330
<v Speaker 2>What's weird about Nevada is Nevada has two weird things.</v>

6108
02:38:56.450 --> 02:38:57.770
<v Speaker 2>One nuclear testing.</v>

6109
02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:01.430
<v Speaker 2>They did a fuck load of nuclear testing.</v>

6110
02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:02.510
<v Speaker 2>You see the fucking,</v>

6111
02:39:02.511 --> 02:39:05.990
<v Speaker 2>there's a map or a video rather that shows you the map of the earth and it shows</v>

6112
02:39:05.991 --> 02:39:10.991
<v Speaker 2>you all the nuclear bombs they set off in Nevada and you're just like Macaulay</v>

6113
02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Culkin from alone by the end of the video.</v>

6114
02:39:12.651 --> 02:39:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you remember those old uh,</v>

6115
02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:15.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6116
02:39:15.770 --> 02:39:18.830
<v Speaker 2>nuclear test videos where they show like a building and then like,</v>

6117
02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:22.850
<v Speaker 2>I like this hurricane of nuclear energy going through it.</v>

6118
02:39:22.940 --> 02:39:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Like what everybody remembers now,</v>

6119
02:39:25.250 --> 02:39:25.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6120
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Like how did they film that?</v>

6121
02:39:28.100 --> 02:39:29.240
<v Speaker 2>They set cameras up.</v>

6122
02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:31.020
<v Speaker 2>How does the camera's dialed?</v>

6123
02:39:31.021 --> 02:39:33.560
<v Speaker 2>They had to be seen as they've set kind of cameras are those,</v>

6124
02:39:33.561 --> 02:39:34.010
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

6125
02:39:34.010 --> 02:39:37.760
<v Speaker 2>they're very far away when all the shit is going down and here's the,</v>

6126
02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:38.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

6127
02:39:38.070 --> 02:39:41.930
<v Speaker 2>the scariest thing is not those buildings blowing and parts they do because they</v>

6128
02:39:41.931 --> 02:39:42.920
<v Speaker 2>got hit so hard.</v>

6129
02:39:43.220 --> 02:39:46.430
<v Speaker 2>The scariest thing is the ones when you see the bombs and the distance that</v>

6130
02:39:46.431 --> 02:39:48.180
<v Speaker 2>miles away and these guys jump on,</v>

6131
02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:51.080
<v Speaker 2>they jump up at the shit goes over their head,</v>

6132
02:39:51.081 --> 02:39:54.410
<v Speaker 2>they're in these ditches and they jump up and run towards it because they didn't</v>

6133
02:39:54.411 --> 02:39:56.690
<v Speaker 2>know shit about radiation back then.</v>

6134
02:39:56.810 --> 02:39:59.420
<v Speaker 2>So they had these soldiers practice with.</v>

6135
02:39:59.421 --> 02:40:02.630
<v Speaker 2>The idea was that you would drop the nuclear bomb on people and then they would</v>

6136
02:40:02.631 --> 02:40:06.830
<v Speaker 2>run towards the bomb because the people would be so fucked up and disoriented</v>

6137
02:40:06.831 --> 02:40:07.970
<v Speaker 2>that you just take over the city,</v>

6138
02:40:07.971 --> 02:40:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

6139
02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:09.350
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile,</v>

6140
02:40:09.350 --> 02:40:13.260
<v Speaker 2>these people were running right into radiation grown like three eyeballs walk</v>

6141
02:40:13.270 --> 02:40:14.103
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

6142
02:40:14.230 --> 02:40:16.710
<v Speaker 2>People in Vegas aren't born with three heads.</v>

6143
02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:17.581
<v Speaker 2>What's not vague?</v>

6144
02:40:17.581 --> 02:40:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Some are,</v>

6145
02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:18.761
<v Speaker 2>it's still,</v>

6146
02:40:18.761 --> 02:40:20.070
<v Speaker 2>it's not as big.</v>

6147
02:40:20.310 --> 02:40:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Nevada's big.</v>

6148
02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6149
02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:25.520
<v Speaker 2>But those nuclear test sites are not that far from Vegas where it,</v>

6150
02:40:25.521 --> 02:40:28.080
<v Speaker 2>they're blowing up these nuclear bombs all the time.</v>

6151
02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:32.930
<v Speaker 2>People in Vegas should be growing fucking three dicks for the next thousand</v>

6152
02:40:32.930 --> 02:40:32.931
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

6153
02:40:32.931 --> 02:40:33.740
<v Speaker 2>You know there,</v>

6154
02:40:33.740 --> 02:40:38.730
<v Speaker 2>there is a story about John Wayne that John Wayne was filming a movie.</v>

6155
02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Now when you're going to need you on this one,</v>

6156
02:40:40.561 --> 02:40:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

6157
02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:45.780
<v Speaker 2>the John Wayne was filming a movie in like the 1950 [inaudible] whatever the</v>

6158
02:40:45.781 --> 02:40:46.291
<v Speaker 2>fuck it was.</v>

6159
02:40:46.291 --> 02:40:50.430
<v Speaker 2>He was doing those westerns and that during that time they were in an area where</v>

6160
02:40:50.431 --> 02:40:51.900
<v Speaker 2>they were doing tests,</v>

6161
02:40:51.930 --> 02:40:52.763
<v Speaker 2>nuclear tests,</v>

6162
02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:55.290
<v Speaker 2>and everybody on that movie set got cancer.</v>

6163
02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Everybody say that again.</v>

6164
02:40:57.810 --> 02:40:58.230
<v Speaker 2>What does it,</v>

6165
02:40:58.230 --> 02:40:59.063
<v Speaker 2>what does it say there?</v>

6166
02:40:59.070 --> 02:41:00.180
<v Speaker 2>The movies so toxic.</v>

6167
02:41:00.181 --> 02:41:01.140
<v Speaker 2>It killed John Wayne.</v>

6168
02:41:01.141 --> 02:41:02.520
<v Speaker 2>The tragedy of the conqueror.</v>

6169
02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6170
02:41:03.270 --> 02:41:04.103
<v Speaker 2>that was about him.</v>

6171
02:41:04.130 --> 02:41:06.630
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that king is how to know that movie killed them.</v>

6172
02:41:06.631 --> 02:41:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean like how would they know when people are getting cancer all the time?</v>

6173
02:41:09.630 --> 02:41:09.841
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6174
02:41:09.841 --> 02:41:11.870
<v Speaker 2>but I think a bunch of people got cancer.</v>

6175
02:41:11.871 --> 02:41:14.100
<v Speaker 2>We're getting cancer from the polio vaccine,</v>

6176
02:41:14.101 --> 02:41:14.940
<v Speaker 2>like all of them.</v>

6177
02:41:14.941 --> 02:41:15.774
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

6178
02:41:15.790 --> 02:41:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that that like a million people for the vaccine from the polio,</v>

6179
02:41:20.411 --> 02:41:21.320
<v Speaker 2>let's to say Jamie.</v>

6180
02:41:22.230 --> 02:41:23.063
<v Speaker 2>I'll find the more,</v>

6181
02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if this is a truth.</v>

6182
02:41:25.230 --> 02:41:26.730
<v Speaker 2>You know that you know that and you've heard that?</v>

6183
02:41:26.750 --> 02:41:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6184
02:41:27.210 --> 02:41:28.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is a true story.</v>

6185
02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:29.200
<v Speaker 2>I need to,</v>

6186
02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:32.580
<v Speaker 2>I need to drop some knowledge to not drop the no knowledge.</v>

6187
02:41:33.290 --> 02:41:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm keeping it fun today.</v>

6188
02:41:35.460 --> 02:41:35.761
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

6189
02:41:35.761 --> 02:41:37.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's good points when you're flying.</v>

6190
02:41:37.891 --> 02:41:42.090
<v Speaker 2>I fly nonstop flat population.</v>

6191
02:41:42.150 --> 02:41:42.911
<v Speaker 2>No Lou Shit.</v>

6192
02:41:42.911 --> 02:41:43.744
<v Speaker 2>It's the price.</v>

6193
02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:47.970
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to turn all that shit into farmland to females as people don't know</v>

6194
02:41:47.971 --> 02:41:48.600
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

6195
02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:49.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6196
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.943
<v Speaker 2>Just dirt.</v>

6197
02:41:50.730 --> 02:41:51.563
<v Speaker 2>It's just dirt.</v>

6198
02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:54.360
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely room.</v>

6199
02:41:54.570 --> 02:41:56.730
<v Speaker 2>The question is for how long and how much,</v>

6200
02:41:56.760 --> 02:41:59.190
<v Speaker 2>how many people can you feed off that dirt?</v>

6201
02:41:59.580 --> 02:42:00.630
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're in Nevada,</v>

6202
02:42:00.631 --> 02:42:01.890
<v Speaker 2>how many farms are in Nevada?</v>

6203
02:42:01.950 --> 02:42:02.551
<v Speaker 2>Was the cocker,</v>

6204

<v Speaker 2>Scroll up.</v>

6206
02:42:04.230 --> 02:42:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Conquer.</v>

6207
02:42:04.620 --> 02:42:06.210
<v Speaker 2>Filmed on a nuclear test site.</v>

6208
02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:08.033
<v Speaker 2>Good move.</v>

6209
02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:09.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6210
02:42:09.570 --> 02:42:10.110
<v Speaker 8>Howard Hughes,</v>

6211
02:42:10.110 --> 02:42:14.430
<v Speaker 8>the Director and Bill Powell knew of the dangers and had written assurances from</v>

6212
02:42:14.431 --> 02:42:16.410
<v Speaker 8>the Atomic Energy Commission that it was safe.</v>

6213
02:42:16.770 --> 02:42:19.730
<v Speaker 8>But apparently that's even John Wayne supposedly brought a Geiger,</v>

6214
02:42:20.190 --> 02:42:20.650
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

6215
02:42:20.650 --> 02:42:22.110
<v Speaker 8>This might have been too long ago to get accurate.</v>

02:42:22.490 --> 02:42:25.700
<v Speaker 2>John would con yellow face terrible.</v>

02:42:55.850 --> 02:42:57.380
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people got cancer on the set.</v>

6234
02:42:57.790 --> 02:42:58.251
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

6240
02:43:05.121 --> 02:43:08.720
<v Speaker 8>all the main actors apparently all died of cancer within 25 years of the movie</v>

6241
02:43:08.721 --> 02:43:09.554
<v Speaker 8>coming out.</v>

6242

<v Speaker 2>so many people die of cancer.</v>

6246
02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Isn't cancer the number one killer?</v>

6272
02:44:02.501 --> 02:44:03.191
<v Speaker 2>So what does that mean?</v>

6273
02:44:03.191 --> 02:44:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Downloads a day.</v>

6274
02:44:07.240 --> 02:44:08.200
<v Speaker 2>What does this mean?</v>

6275
02:44:08.330 --> 02:44:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Like what does mainstream mean?</v>

6276
02:44:09.611 --> 02:44:10.810
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean it's not real.</v>

6277
02:44:10.950 --> 02:44:11.783
<v Speaker 2>Just because,</v>

6278
02:44:12.300 --> 02:44:15.540
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying is you said it was a conspiracy theory and I'm like,</v>

6279
02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:15.701
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6280
02:44:15.701 --> 02:44:15.851
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6281
02:44:15.851 --> 02:44:16.684
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6282
02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:17.753
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I said.</v>

6283
02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:18.640
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

6284
02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:21.010
<v Speaker 2>the conspiracy to keep this quiet,</v>

6285
02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:25.660
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the government's nuclear tests most likely killed John Wayne and a</v>

6286
02:44:25.661 --> 02:44:30.070
<v Speaker 2>shit load of actors from fucking cancer in the desert.</v>

6287
02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:31.660
<v Speaker 2>They were dropping bombs,</v>

6288
02:44:31.661 --> 02:44:33.130
<v Speaker 2>not knowing what the fuck they were doing.</v>

6289
02:44:33.220 --> 02:44:35.020
<v Speaker 2>And there's plenty of evidence that they didn't know what the fuck they were</v>

6290
02:44:35.021 --> 02:44:35.590
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

6291
02:44:35.590 --> 02:44:38.320
<v Speaker 2>If you've watched the videos of old nuclear test site,</v>

6292
02:44:38.321 --> 02:44:42.670
<v Speaker 2>which soldiers running towards the blast and have you seen those fucking insane</v>

6293
02:44:42.671 --> 02:44:44.170
<v Speaker 2>thing that looks like it looks like,</v>

6294
02:44:44.410 --> 02:44:45.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6295
02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:48.430
<v Speaker 2>It just like all that old footage looks like it doesn't look authentic.</v>

6296
02:44:48.431 --> 02:44:50.230
<v Speaker 2>It looks like they faked all that shit.</v>

6297
02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:51.093
<v Speaker 2>What about</v>

6298
02:44:54.160 --> 02:44:55.150
<v Speaker 2>nuclear bombs or fake?</v>

6299
02:44:55.180 --> 02:44:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying to me?</v>

6300
02:44:56.350 --> 02:44:56.711
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6301
02:44:56.711 --> 02:44:57.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6302
02:44:57.041 --> 02:44:59.890
<v Speaker 2>there's a conspiracy theory that uh,</v>

6303
02:44:59.950 --> 02:45:00.783
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6304
02:45:01.900 --> 02:45:04.120
<v Speaker 2>nuclear bombs actually don't exist.</v>

6305
02:45:04.500 --> 02:45:06.850
<v Speaker 2>That they never actually figured it out,</v>

6306
02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:11.140
<v Speaker 2>but they realized that the threat of nuclear bombs as good enough,</v>

6307
02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:11.661
<v Speaker 2>the Eddie,</v>

6308
02:45:11.661 --> 02:45:12.780
<v Speaker 2>you can see the bottom,</v>

6309
02:45:13.100 --> 02:45:18.100
<v Speaker 2>but how do you ever see the one where they dropped the bomb in the ocean and</v>

6310
02:45:19.001 --> 02:45:22.270
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know how much of a blast it would create?</v>

6311
02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:26.260
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is this fake this when they did it,</v>

6312
02:45:26.290 --> 02:45:29.380
<v Speaker 2>but all I'm saying is how do you know it wasn't just a regular powerful bomb?</v>

6313
02:45:29.381 --> 02:45:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you know?</v>

6314
02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:32.200
<v Speaker 2>How do you know by watching a bomb go off?</v>

6315
02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:37.390
<v Speaker 2>How do you know what's nuclear nuclear nuclear bomb looks like when it blows up?</v>

6316
02:45:37.420 --> 02:45:38.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6317
02:45:38.100 --> 02:45:40.480
<v Speaker 2>There's irregular but don't know how we listen to him.</v>

6318
02:45:41.830 --> 02:45:42.300
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>

6319
02:45:42.300 --> 02:45:43.120
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>

6320
02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:43.630
<v Speaker 2>listen to him.</v>

6321
02:45:43.630 --> 02:45:45.250
<v Speaker 2>We have things that can test nuclear,</v>

6322
02:45:45.530 --> 02:45:46.600
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying how do you,</v>

6323
02:45:46.601 --> 02:45:47.710
<v Speaker 2>how can you tell?</v>

6324
02:45:47.740 --> 02:45:48.580
<v Speaker 2>I know that you can do,</v>

6325
02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:50.500
<v Speaker 2>you can do tests with those.</v>

6326
02:45:50.501 --> 02:45:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Insurance has never done.</v>

6327
02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:53.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6328
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Your studied in.</v>

6329
02:45:57.790 --> 02:45:58.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying I don't know.</v>

6330
02:45:58.961 --> 02:45:59.261
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

6331
02:45:59.261 --> 02:46:00.310
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying I don't know.</v>

6332
02:46:00.540 --> 02:46:03.400
<v Speaker 2>Telling you how can people look at a bomb?</v>

6333
02:46:03.460 --> 02:46:05.410
<v Speaker 2>You're saying someone else figured it out.</v>

6334
02:46:05.530 --> 02:46:08.680
<v Speaker 2>How can you look at a bomb and thinking about shit the wrong way?</v>

6335
02:46:08.860 --> 02:46:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Really do.</v>

6336
02:46:09.410 --> 02:46:09.531
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6337
02:46:09.531 --> 02:46:12.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying if there was videos of 20 bombs going off,</v>

6338
02:46:12.171 --> 02:46:14.030
<v Speaker 2>would you be able to pick out the nuclear bombs?</v>

6339
02:46:14.090 --> 02:46:14.401
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>

6340
02:46:14.401 --> 02:46:16.550
<v Speaker 2>they make these giant mushroom clouds.</v>

6341
02:46:16.551 --> 02:46:17.660
<v Speaker 2>They're very unusual.</v>

6342
02:46:17.661 --> 02:46:19.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a regular bomb.</v>

6343
02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:22.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying pull that video at the bottom of the ocean.</v>

6344
02:46:22.431 --> 02:46:25.400
<v Speaker 2>How can anybody tell like a regular piece of that question?</v>

6345
02:46:25.401 --> 02:46:28.490
<v Speaker 2>I think you should probably talk to a nuclear physicist.</v>

6346
02:46:28.700 --> 02:46:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Does asking questions.</v>

6347
02:46:29.810 --> 02:46:30.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

6348
02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:32.390
<v Speaker 2>but to question it like it's not real.</v>

6349
02:46:32.391 --> 02:46:33.141
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

6350
02:46:33.141 --> 02:46:37.190
<v Speaker 2>They killed how many fucking people in Nagasaki and Hiroshima?</v>

6351
02:46:37.390 --> 02:46:38.760
<v Speaker 2>How do you know what kind of bomb that,</v>

6352
02:46:38.761 --> 02:46:39.594
<v Speaker 2>watch this,</v>

6353
02:46:39.650 --> 02:46:41.360
<v Speaker 2>watch this bomb aren't they're still app.</v>

6354
02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:42.193
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

6355
02:46:43.250 --> 02:46:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6356
02:46:43.820 --> 02:46:47.750
<v Speaker 2>How do you know if that's kind of bomb that that is the craziest amount of power</v>

6357
02:46:47.751 --> 02:46:48.980
<v Speaker 2>you could ever imagine.</v>

6358
02:46:49.250 --> 02:46:54.250
<v Speaker 2>I could never imagine something that can blow the ocean a mile into the sky and</v>

6359
02:46:54.981 --> 02:46:56.330
<v Speaker 2>that's just one video of it.</v>

6360
02:46:56.331 --> 02:46:58.630
<v Speaker 2>There's another one of those videos where they do it from a distance.</v>

6361
02:46:58.690 --> 02:47:00.650
<v Speaker 2>You look at the water where it's falling from.</v>

6362
02:47:00.740 --> 02:47:01.251
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

6363
02:47:01.251 --> 02:47:02.031
<v Speaker 2>see if he could find,</v>

6364
02:47:02.031 --> 02:47:02.990
<v Speaker 2>what do you understand?</v>

6365
02:47:02.991 --> 02:47:04.010
<v Speaker 2>It could be a nuclear bomb.</v>

6366
02:47:04.011 --> 02:47:05.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying all I'm saying.</v>

6367
02:47:05.300 --> 02:47:07.220
<v Speaker 2>How can you know for sure?</v>

6368
02:47:07.610 --> 02:47:08.120
<v Speaker 2>How can you,</v>

6369
02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:09.860
<v Speaker 2>how many whales died in this?</v>

6370
02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:10.071
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6371
02:47:10.071 --> 02:47:10.820
<v Speaker 2>everything died.</v>

6372
02:47:10.820 --> 02:47:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Everyone.</v>

6373
02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:12.411
<v Speaker 2>They all the fish.</v>

6374
02:47:12.411 --> 02:47:14.370
<v Speaker 2>They made some tuna salad out of that motherfucker.</v>

6375
02:47:14.420 --> 02:47:15.140
<v Speaker 2>All the fish.</v>

6376
02:47:15.140 --> 02:47:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

6377
02:47:15.470 --> 02:47:16.161
<v Speaker 2>Look at the water.</v>

6378
02:47:16.161 --> 02:47:16.641
<v Speaker 2>Come down.</v>

6379
02:47:16.641 --> 02:47:17.660
<v Speaker 2>How crazy that is.</v>

6380
02:47:17.710 --> 02:47:19.250
<v Speaker 2>What the that boat's fuck though.</v>

6381
02:47:19.251 --> 02:47:20.084
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

6382
02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:20.953
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

6383
02:47:21.230 --> 02:47:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

6384
02:47:21.980 --> 02:47:22.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6385
02:47:22.251 --> 02:47:22.651
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6386
02:47:22.651 --> 02:47:24.050
<v Speaker 2>If they don't know,</v>

6387
02:47:24.650 --> 02:47:25.483
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

6388
02:47:25.660 --> 02:47:25.851
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

6389
02:47:25.851 --> 02:47:26.684
<v Speaker 2>that's high.</v>

6390
02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:27.921
<v Speaker 2>That's high.</v>

6391
02:47:27.921 --> 02:47:28.341
<v Speaker 2>That's big.</v>

6392
02:47:28.341 --> 02:47:30.710
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know why quest inventional bombs.</v>

6393
02:47:30.740 --> 02:47:30.921
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

6394
02:47:30.921 --> 02:47:31.101
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

6395
02:47:31.101 --> 02:47:31.341
<v Speaker 2>what it,</v>

6396
02:47:31.341 --> 02:47:32.174
<v Speaker 2>what differences?</v>

6397
02:47:32.290 --> 02:47:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Because Eddie's Eddie's sand.</v>

6398
02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:36.470
<v Speaker 2>The reason why they threaten nuclear bombs keep everyone kind of chill,</v>

6399
02:47:36.471 --> 02:47:37.760
<v Speaker 2>but we might not have the,</v>

6400
02:47:38.420 --> 02:47:38.790
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>

6401
02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:40.100
<v Speaker 2>They've got you don't to do that dude.</v>

6402
02:47:40.101 --> 02:47:41.360
<v Speaker 2>That would wipe out a fucking city.</v>

6403
02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:44.480
<v Speaker 2>But maybe you could do that with just regular conventional bombs.</v>

6404
02:47:44.481 --> 02:47:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he just,</v>

6405
02:47:45.290 --> 02:47:46.550
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's like 10.</v>

6406
02:47:47.350 --> 02:47:47.991
<v Speaker 2>What you're saying is,</v>

6407
02:47:47.991 --> 02:47:48.824
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

6408
02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6409
02:47:49.190 --> 02:47:49.971
<v Speaker 2>you should find out.</v>

6410
02:47:49.971 --> 02:47:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know by this is,</v>

6411
02:47:51.881 --> 02:47:52.970
<v Speaker 2>this is a nuclear bomb.</v>

6412
02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6413
02:47:53.350 --> 02:47:57.170
<v Speaker 2>And the scientists all agree there's no conspiracy conspiracy's amongst idiots</v>

6414
02:47:57.410 --> 02:47:58.940
<v Speaker 2>because people that are talking about it online,</v>

6415
02:47:58.941 --> 02:48:01.910
<v Speaker 2>they literally have no idea what they're talking about and they're spreading</v>

6416
02:48:01.930 --> 02:48:02.650
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

6417
02:48:02.650 --> 02:48:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Don't know.</v>

6418
02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:03.651
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

6419
02:48:03.651 --> 02:48:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

6420
02:48:04.430 --> 02:48:04.761
<v Speaker 2>You don't know,</v>

6421
02:48:04.761 --> 02:48:05.390
<v Speaker 2>but don't even bother.</v>

6422
02:48:05.390 --> 02:48:05.721
<v Speaker 2>Question.</v>

6423
02:48:05.721 --> 02:48:06.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a waste of time.</v>

6424
02:48:06.770 --> 02:48:07.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

6425
02:48:07.150 --> 02:48:07.430
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

6426
02:48:07.430 --> 02:48:09.470
<v Speaker 2>you're going down a rabbit hole for no reason.</v>

6427
02:48:09.700 --> 02:48:10.491
<v Speaker 2>It wastes all his time.</v>

6428
02:48:10.491 --> 02:48:11.001
<v Speaker 2>How do you know?</v>

6429
02:48:11.001 --> 02:48:11.451
<v Speaker 2>How do you know?</v>

6430
02:48:11.451 --> 02:48:12.050
<v Speaker 2>How do you know?</v>

6431
02:48:12.050 --> 02:48:13.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to know.</v>

6432
02:48:13.190 --> 02:48:13.981
<v Speaker 2>What do you care about me?</v>

6433
02:48:13.981 --> 02:48:14.814
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

6434
02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:15.690
<v Speaker 2>I go away.</v>

6435
02:48:15.690 --> 02:48:17.210
<v Speaker 2>I could waste my time on whatever.</v>

6436
02:48:17.211 --> 02:48:17.431
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

6437
02:48:17.431 --> 02:48:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm concerned.</v>

6438
02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Why are you so concerned about me and wasting money?</v>

6439
02:48:20.071 --> 02:48:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Because you waste our time to why?</v>

6440
02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:24.720
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting conversation whether or not nuclear bombs,</v>

6441
02:48:25.790 --> 02:48:26.650
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to talk about.</v>

6442
02:48:26.710 --> 02:48:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you want to find the answer to it?</v>

6443
02:48:28.190 --> 02:48:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Why did you just want to question it?</v>

6444
02:48:29.390 --> 02:48:30.223
<v Speaker 2>You could look up,</v>

6445
02:48:31.180 --> 02:48:32.000
<v Speaker 2>you could look up.</v>

6446
02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:32.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6447
02:48:32.211 --> 02:48:33.160
<v Speaker 2>you could look up anything.</v>

6448
02:48:33.161 --> 02:48:33.994
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to look up.</v>

6449
02:48:34.250 --> 02:48:36.800
<v Speaker 2>If you will really want to know the answer to this particular question.</v>

6450
02:48:36.890 --> 02:48:37.960
<v Speaker 2>You could look it up and I'm going,</v>

6451
02:48:37.980 --> 02:48:38.220
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

6452
02:48:38.220 --> 02:48:39.500
<v Speaker 2>no library.</v>

6453
02:48:40.180 --> 02:48:40.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6454
02:48:40.310 --> 02:48:40.820
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

6455
02:48:40.820 --> 02:48:41.900
<v Speaker 2>You could go to college.</v>

6456
02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:43.580
<v Speaker 2>You could get a professor.</v>

6457
02:48:43.730 --> 02:48:46.490
<v Speaker 2>You could find any number of people that have the answers,</v>

6458
02:48:46.820 --> 02:48:48.100
<v Speaker 2>could show you how to study them.</v>

6459
02:48:48.500 --> 02:48:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Could prove the test too.</v>

6460
02:48:49.431 --> 02:48:50.780
<v Speaker 2>You could lay it out.</v>

6461
02:48:51.050 --> 02:48:53.930
<v Speaker 2>It could give you all of these instructions so you could go do it on your own</v>

6462
02:48:53.931 --> 02:48:55.940
<v Speaker 2>without anybody else care about it that much.</v>

6463
02:48:56.390 --> 02:48:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Then why?</v>

6464
02:48:56.870 --> 02:48:57.231
<v Speaker 2>Then why?</v>

6465
02:48:57.231 --> 02:48:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Again and Joe's Joe's point.</v>

6466
02:48:58.301 --> 02:48:58.880
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

6467
02:48:58.880 --> 02:48:59.713
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

6468
02:49:00.020 --> 02:49:02.600
<v Speaker 2>I just don't trust anything I can verify for myself.</v>

6469
02:49:02.950 --> 02:49:04.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to get mad at you because of that.</v>

6470
02:49:04.610 --> 02:49:05.151
<v Speaker 2>Why you mad?</v>

6471
02:49:05.151 --> 02:49:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Because you're getting mad right now.</v>

6472
02:49:07.170 --> 02:49:08.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust shit from the government.</v>

6473
02:49:10.200 --> 02:49:11.310
<v Speaker 2>You can verify this.</v>

6474
02:49:11.311 --> 02:49:12.031
<v Speaker 2>You just said you can't,</v>

6475
02:49:12.031 --> 02:49:12.864
<v Speaker 2>but you can.</v>

6476
02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:13.590
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

6477
02:49:13.590 --> 02:49:15.630
<v Speaker 2>that's the issue on some of these things with science.</v>

6478
02:49:16.020 --> 02:49:16.860
<v Speaker 2>They are fair.</v>

6479
02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:18.073
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6480
02:49:18.570 --> 02:49:21.390
<v Speaker 2>I went to fucking physics class at college.</v>

6481
02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:22.253
<v Speaker 2>I got an a,</v>

6482
02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:25.600
<v Speaker 2>so that proves the nuclear bombs.</v>

6483
02:49:26.940 --> 02:49:28.110
<v Speaker 2>I didn't make it to that fireworks.</v>

6484
02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:29.071
<v Speaker 2>I quit college.</v>

6485
02:49:29.071 --> 02:49:30.690
<v Speaker 2>I didn't keep going down the nuclear club.</v>

6486
02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:33.570
<v Speaker 2>That's farther in than physics one 11 and one 12 at Ohio state.</v>

6487
02:49:33.571 --> 02:49:36.560
<v Speaker 2>They don't give it to the freshmen high lows.</v>

6488
02:49:38.610 --> 02:49:39.120
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

6489
02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:39.451
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6490
02:49:39.451 --> 02:49:40.320
<v Speaker 2>if you want the answers,</v>

6491
02:49:40.321 --> 02:49:41.101
<v Speaker 2>you can go get them.</v>

6492
02:49:41.101 --> 02:49:42.390
<v Speaker 2>It's not just question the world.</v>

6493
02:49:42.391 --> 02:49:42.661
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

6494
02:49:42.661 --> 02:49:45.070
<v Speaker 2>It's frustrating because you don't want the answers.</v>

6495
02:49:45.090 --> 02:49:49.290
<v Speaker 2>You just want to question everything that in air quotes government says</v>

6496
02:49:52.590 --> 02:49:53.550
<v Speaker 2>it's frustrating.</v>

6497
02:49:53.640 --> 02:49:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

6498
02:49:54.150 --> 02:49:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Because the world being flat because nuclear bombs being fake because dinosaurs</v>

6499
02:49:59.101 --> 02:49:59.934
<v Speaker 2>not being real.</v>

6500
02:50:00.050 --> 02:50:01.320
<v Speaker 2>All those things are crazy.</v>

6501
02:50:02.220 --> 02:50:04.440
<v Speaker 2>They're a giant waste of time for who?</v>

6502
02:50:04.500 --> 02:50:05.333
<v Speaker 2>For us.</v>

6503
02:50:05.700 --> 02:50:06.970
<v Speaker 2>When we're talking to talking about something,</v>

6504
02:50:06.971 --> 02:50:07.620
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

6505
02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:07.891
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

6506
02:50:07.891 --> 02:50:09.840
<v Speaker 2>but you will bite talking about those things.</v>

6507
02:50:09.900 --> 02:50:10.051
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

6508
02:50:10.051 --> 02:50:11.130
<v Speaker 2>I didn't bring up nuclear bombs.</v>

6509
02:50:11.131 --> 02:50:11.964
<v Speaker 2>You guys did.</v>

6510

<v Speaker 2>but you really argued it for a while.</v>

6512
02:50:15.930 --> 02:50:18.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm just bringing up questions and you're getting angry.</v>

6513
02:50:18.181 --> 02:50:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Not Angry at e.</v>

6514

<v Speaker 2>You said you were frustrated.</v>

6519
02:50:24.151 --> 02:50:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Frustration usually is,</v>

<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

6525
02:50:32.100 --> 02:50:34.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know nuclear science or anything like that,</v>

6526
02:50:34.951 --> 02:50:37.050
<v Speaker 2>so how do you know those that I'm bumps a real computer,</v>

6527
02:50:37.051 --> 02:50:37.884
<v Speaker 2>regular bomb.</v>

6528

6533
02:50:48.420 --> 02:50:51.060
<v Speaker 2>You can look into a lot of this stuff and you can't find the answers.</v>

6534
02:50:51.330 --> 02:50:51.761
<v Speaker 2>That's all I,</v>

6535
02:50:51.761 --> 02:50:53.850
<v Speaker 2>that's my only point and when you're talking over me,</v>

6536
02:50:53.851 --> 02:50:55.110
<v Speaker 2>that's where the frustration comes from.</v>

6537
02:50:55.111 --> 02:50:55.530
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

02:51:00.631 --> 02:51:04.230
<v Speaker 2>You using that as a defensive tactic because he's making a good point because</v>

6542
02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:05.850
<v Speaker 2>saying people are angry.</v>

6543

6550
02:51:13.231 --> 02:51:14.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust the government.</v>

6551
02:51:14.550 --> 02:51:15.360
<v Speaker 2>You could say that.</v>

6552
02:51:15.360 --> 02:51:15.661
<v Speaker 2>We can say,</v>

6553
02:51:15.661 --> 02:51:16.494
<v Speaker 2>why are you angry?</v>

6554

02:51:21.781 --> 02:51:23.190
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't get anybody anywhere.</v>

6558
02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:26.430
<v Speaker 2>We're just talking about the reality of these facts.</v>

6559
02:51:26.880 --> 02:51:28.410
<v Speaker 2>You guys can believe whatever you want.</v>

6560
02:51:30.240 --> 02:51:31.073
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

6561
02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:32.220
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

6562
02:51:32.220 --> 02:51:32.970
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think that doesn't frustrate me.</v>

6567
02:51:39.960 --> 02:51:40.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what you think,</v>

6568

<v Speaker 2>but am I wrong then?</v>

6569

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6570

6571
02:51:45.221 --> 02:51:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Why would you continue to question that?</v>

6572
02:51:47.010 --> 02:51:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Hey Brennan,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like Hawaii's track.</v>

6579
02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:56.890
<v Speaker 2>If you go to Hawaii,</v>

6580
02:51:56.890 --> 02:51:58.500
<v Speaker 2>make sure you wear a nice Hawaiian print.</v>

02:51:58.560 --> 02:51:59.301
<v Speaker 2>It's in floral.</v>

6582
02:51:59.301 --> 02:52:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Joe and I ended up wearing a Hawaiian shirt,</v>

6583
02:52:02.671 --> 02:52:05.680
<v Speaker 2>like with the buttons because it was the only time you should wear soldiers.</v>

6584
02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:06.910
<v Speaker 1>They're in right now.</v>

6585
02:52:07.050 --> 02:52:07.883
<v Speaker 1>They're in right now.</v>

6586
02:52:08.050 --> 02:52:10.000
<v Speaker 1>I used to wear those on stage like an asshole.</v>

6587
02:52:10.030 --> 02:52:11.440

<v Speaker 1>That shit out of this stuff is hard.</v>

7098
03:04:14.910 --> 03:04:16.010
<v Speaker 1>We still look at it for a while.</v>

7099
03:04:16.011 --> 03:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>We'll keep going.</v>

7100
03:04:16.780 --> 03:04:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Look at this motherfucker on Ninja Warrior man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm super impressed with the way this dude is traversing this.</v>

7102
03:04:22.660 --> 03:04:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I think there are people that called cultural preparation on this to Kashi sex</v>

<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

7108
03:04:31.900 --> 03:04:33.250
<v Speaker 8>I don't know who's behind him either.</v>

7109
03:04:33.310 --> 03:04:35.770
<v Speaker 8>Like the managers at behind him and it's a couple of other guys that are making</v>

7110
03:04:35.771 --> 03:04:37.080
<v Speaker 8>a shit load of money like them.</v>

7112
03:04:38.161 --> 03:04:39.630
<v Speaker 1>is it a producer project?</v>

7113
03:04:39.660 --> 03:04:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Is My planned,</v>

7114
03:04:41.040 --> 03:04:42.130

7116
03:04:42.331 --> 03:04:43.440
<v Speaker 1>this is perfect for our,</v>

7117
03:04:43.650 --> 03:04:45.660
<v Speaker 1>like he'd have to really get a God.</v>

7118
03:04:45.661 --> 03:04:47.160
<v Speaker 1>It's willing to tattoo his face.</v>

7119
03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:48.061
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

7120
03:04:48.061 --> 03:04:49.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a metal fucking deck.</v>

7121
03:04:49.590 --> 03:04:50.423
<v Speaker 8>Crazy right now.</v>

7122
03:04:51.180 --> 03:04:52.740
<v Speaker 8>So many people have tattooed faces.</v>

7123
03:04:53.810 --> 03:04:56.330
<v Speaker 1>That's some serious commitment tattoo on your mug.</v>

7124
03:04:57.380 --> 03:04:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Millions of dollars.</v>

7125
03:04:58.910 --> 03:04:59.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7126
03:04:59.091 --> 03:05:02.840
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it might not work and you're stuck with 69 I think tastes like an</v>

7127
03:05:02.841 --> 03:05:03.340
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>

7128
03:05:03.340 --> 03:05:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I think they probably might wait until they get that first big check and they</v>

7129
03:05:06.261 --> 03:05:07.160
<v Speaker 1>may be getting in.</v>

7130
03:05:07.230 --> 03:05:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Did he wait?</v>

7131
03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about him particularly if there's a controversy between uh,</v>

7132
03:05:12.260 --> 03:05:15.860
<v Speaker 1>is he a blood or is he a crip and he's claiming he's both.</v>

7133
03:05:15.861 --> 03:05:16.250
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

7134
03:05:16.250 --> 03:05:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm friends with both of them or something like that.</v>

7135
03:05:18.680 --> 03:05:23.330
<v Speaker 1>But he wears an awful lot of red so people think that he's a blood.</v>

7136
03:05:24.260 --> 03:05:25.490
<v Speaker 1>What a weird weird were.</v>

03:06:12.380 --> 03:06:14.210
<v Speaker 1>he'd go back to like Linda Carter and wonder woman.</v>

7165
03:06:14.211 --> 03:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>You never saw her ass ever asked was not a thing,</v>

7166
03:06:17.661 --> 03:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>man ass Farrah Fawcett.</v>

7167
03:06:19.490 --> 03:06:21.200
<v Speaker 1>You never saw Farrah Fawcetts ass.</v>

7168
03:06:21.620 --> 03:06:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7169
03:06:22.450 --> 03:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>But now if a girl's going to be a hot chick,</v>

7170
03:06:25.250 --> 03:06:27.290
<v Speaker 1>she's got to have a banging ass.</v>

7171
03:06:27.620 --> 03:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>If a girl's like in a movie as a hot chick,</v>

7172
03:06:30.010 --> 03:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a point in the movie where you see her in a pair of tight</v>

7173
03:06:33.411 --> 03:06:33.771
<v Speaker 1>jeans.</v>

7174
03:06:33.771 --> 03:06:34.220
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>

7175
03:06:34.220 --> 03:06:34.930
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

7176
03:06:34.930 --> 03:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7177
03:06:35.450 --> 03:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

7178
03:06:35.870 --> 03:06:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7179
03:06:36.410 --> 03:06:39.080
<v Speaker 8>That's an excellent set that like when you did,</v>

7180
03:06:39.610 --> 03:06:40.361
<v Speaker 1>I like the,</v>

7181
03:06:40.361 --> 03:06:42.040
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably below big buts.</v>

7182
03:06:42.130 --> 03:06:43.060
<v Speaker 1>That's like all right here.</v>

7183
03:06:43.070 --> 03:06:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7184
03:06:43.270 --> 03:06:44.410
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely dumped in.</v>

7185
03:06:44.411 --> 03:06:45.290
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely it up.</v>

7186
03:06:45.300 --> 03:06:46.210
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a moment,</v>

7187
03:06:46.240 --> 03:06:49.840
<v Speaker 1>but always in the Mexican community and the black community,</v>

7188
03:06:49.930 --> 03:06:51.360
<v Speaker 1>we were always into big butts.</v>

7189
03:06:51.670 --> 03:06:52.330
<v Speaker 1>We didn't need,</v>

7190
03:06:52.330 --> 03:06:53.830
<v Speaker 1>we didn't need society to tell us that.</v>

7191
03:06:53.831 --> 03:06:55.000
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know what the hell it was,</v>

7192
03:06:55.050 --> 03:06:56.160
<v Speaker 1>were just like big.</v>

7193
03:06:56.170 --> 03:07:00.300
<v Speaker 1>If scientific ground bots in the future and they're studying the size of asses,</v>

7194
03:07:01.050 --> 03:07:01.621
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>

7195
03:07:01.621 --> 03:07:05.850
<v Speaker 1>well this is a noticeable jump in women's asses at a certain point in time.</v>

7196
03:07:05.851 --> 03:07:06.690
<v Speaker 1>The 20th century.</v>

7197
03:07:06.691 --> 03:07:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that?</v>

7198
03:07:07.620 --> 03:07:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I saw this documentary once called the history of sex.</v>

7199
03:07:10.530 --> 03:07:15.530
<v Speaker 1>It was on the science channel or something was a five part documentary and they</v>

7200
03:07:15.991 --> 03:07:17.640
<v Speaker 1>were getting into why we,</v>

7201
03:07:17.820 --> 03:07:22.820
<v Speaker 1>we like certain things from the opposite sex and the but apparently uh,</v>

7202
03:07:23.400 --> 03:07:24.000
<v Speaker 1>the reason,</v>

7203
03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:25.500
<v Speaker 1>well obviously like tits,</v>

7204
03:07:25.530 --> 03:07:26.280
<v Speaker 1>we like tits.</v>

7205
03:07:26.280 --> 03:07:27.113
<v Speaker 1>If they're big,</v>

7206
03:07:27.160 --> 03:07:31.380
<v Speaker 1>like we'd like them because we know they're going to be able to feed the baby.</v>

7207
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:35.760
<v Speaker 1>So we get a little endorphin rush big because a woman can have birth give birth</v>

7208
03:07:35.761 --> 03:07:36.181
<v Speaker 1>easier.</v>

7209
03:07:36.181 --> 03:07:36.460
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

7210
03:07:36.460 --> 03:07:39.750
<v Speaker 1>you're attracted to that symmetry according to this documentary,</v>

7211
03:07:39.780 --> 03:07:40.710
<v Speaker 1>the fat and the,</v>

7212
03:07:40.711 --> 03:07:44.340
<v Speaker 1>but it during the third trimester of pregnancy,</v>

7213
03:07:44.520 --> 03:07:45.900
<v Speaker 1>that's when the brain develops.</v>

7214
03:07:46.050 --> 03:07:46.700
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

7215
03:07:46.700 --> 03:07:47.070
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

7216
03:07:47.070 --> 03:07:47.221
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7217
03:07:47.221 --> 03:07:48.690
<v Speaker 1>the brain is developed from,</v>

7218
03:07:49.080 --> 03:07:49.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7219
03:07:49.900 --> 03:07:50.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7220
03:07:50.670 --> 03:07:50.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7221
03:07:50.850 --> 03:07:53.280
<v Speaker 1>fat from the ass according to this documentary.</v>

7222
03:07:53.760 --> 03:07:58.760
<v Speaker 1>So I guess we're looking at big round asses for a smarter babies married.</v>

7223
03:07:59.820 --> 03:08:01.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what the documentary said.</v>

7224
03:08:01.201 --> 03:08:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

7225
03:08:01.500 --> 03:08:01.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7226
03:08:01.801 --> 03:08:02.320
<v Speaker 1>who knows.</v>

7227
03:08:02.320 --> 03:08:02.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7228
03:08:02.431 --> 03:08:05.820
<v Speaker 1>they definitely know the shape of a woman that's attractive to us because that's</v>

7229
03:08:05.821 --> 03:08:06.900
<v Speaker 1>the most fertile women,</v>

7230
03:08:07.080 --> 03:08:11.250
<v Speaker 1>the women that's going to be most likely to hold a baby to term and raise the</v>

7231
03:08:11.251 --> 03:08:12.084
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

7232
03:08:12.390 --> 03:08:14.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's why all those qualities that you like.</v>

7233
03:08:14.580 --> 03:08:15.031
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

7234
03:08:15.031 --> 03:08:19.050
<v Speaker 1>what a lot of men are really attracted to nurturing women and he really</v>

7235
03:08:19.051 --> 03:08:21.270
<v Speaker 1>attracted to a woman who wants to cook you dinner.</v>

7236
03:08:21.480 --> 03:08:21.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7237
03:08:21.721 --> 03:08:24.030
<v Speaker 1>a woman who wants to like give you a massage.</v>

7238
03:08:24.031 --> 03:08:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Like to a lot of guys,</v>

7239
03:08:25.051 --> 03:08:29.670
<v Speaker 1>that's a big deal because that's like a nurturing type woman that would be not</v>

7240
03:08:29.671 --> 03:08:30.630
<v Speaker 1>just that way to you,</v>

7241
03:08:30.631 --> 03:08:32.070
<v Speaker 1>but that way to your children too.</v>

7242
03:08:32.100 --> 03:08:37.100
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about why scientifically are men into big disease shapes or we're</v>

7243
03:08:37.531 --> 03:08:39.450
<v Speaker 1>also talking about how back in the day,</v>

7244
03:08:39.600 --> 03:08:41.730
<v Speaker 1>asses weren't a big deal with Farrah Fawcett.</v>

7245
03:08:41.940 --> 03:08:43.270
<v Speaker 1>He never saw Farrah Fawcett task,</v>

03:10:25.900 --> 03:10:27.770
<v Speaker 2>She was in low rider talk.</v>

7307

<v Speaker 2>That low rider with that APP for sure.</v>

7308
03:10:30.071 --> 03:10:30.600
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

7309
03:10:30.600 --> 03:10:32.350
<v Speaker 2>she had a push from the Internet.</v>

7310
03:10:32.470 --> 03:10:35.790
<v Speaker 2>There was dudes passing her picture around and showed been way bigger if she was</v>

7316
03:10:40.841 --> 03:10:44.560
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is like then she was one of the few girls that people would pass</v>

7317
03:10:44.561 --> 03:10:46.750
<v Speaker 2>or photos around pre social media.</v>
