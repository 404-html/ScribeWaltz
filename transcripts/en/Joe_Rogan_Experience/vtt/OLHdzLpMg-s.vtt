<v Speaker 2>I appreciate you being here.</v>

00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm thrilled to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

15
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.810
<v Speaker 2>You're a motivational motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

16
00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:31.160
<v Speaker 2>You got a lot of people up and Adam,</v>

17
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm super grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

18
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you know it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

19
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.234
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent the three years for the last </v>

20
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.901
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been okay with it,</v>

21
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:40.734
<v Speaker 1>but the three years prior to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I specifically didn't want to be a </v>

22
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:44.544
<v Speaker 1>motivational speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come I was selfish in deciding like </v>

23
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.260
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't want to be that,</v>

24
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:52.094
<v Speaker 1>that I was more proud in my own mind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being an entrepreneur or business </v>

25
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>builder who happened to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial tendencies.</v>

26
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like the motivational speaker</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

27
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by percentages can get a little ugly,</v>

28
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>gets a little kind of hollow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little spammy.</v>

29
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>And for my own mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I had it,</v>

30
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.960
<v Speaker 1>my brand was I suppressed and stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting out the content like that.</v>

31
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I would tell my boys and my internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>employees,</v>

32
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>but for the last year I embraced it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little more.</v>

33
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>it's got a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

36
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 1>I know you feel this because as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you announced it too,</v>

37
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten so many emails and tweets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ems of the same thing,</v>

38
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.233
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky enough that some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you communicate brings value to </v>

39
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:38.724
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

40
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>You need to be smart about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm trying to figure it out.</v>

41
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I definitely think you need to be</v>

43
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>smart about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely don't.</v>

44
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to get greedy with it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid with it or there's a fine line.</v>

45
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>But the population and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing the right thing for sure.</v>

46
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I go onstage,</v>

47
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>that is my zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

48
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my arena,</v>

49
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.363
<v Speaker 1>that's my court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think anybody does it </v>

50
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:08.214
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you give a motivational </v>

51
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:11.770
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually business talks,</v>

52
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like Rah,</v>

53
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Rah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that takes,</v>

54
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.293
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm a defensive coordinator </v>

55
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>that's giving you the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to give it to you,</v>

56
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>like we can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's rip their next,</v>

57
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like out of their body.</v>

58
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:24.654
<v Speaker 1>And so when I'm up there that and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube videos and things of that </v>

59
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:29.634
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the majority of what people see </v>

60
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:31.854
<v Speaker 1>of me.</v>

61
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only one version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

62
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.271
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

63
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:37.104
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very conscious of the motivational </v>

64
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:40.854
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people use motivation </v>

65
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>for their own selfishness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm trying.</v>

66
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I know it all plays out in 30 or 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

67
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>but along the way for my own appetite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to balance it the right way.</v>

68
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are doing </v>

69
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:54.690
<v Speaker 1>it that haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't really,</v>

70
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.083
<v Speaker 1>they don't really do anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know a guy who does motivational </v>

71
00:02:58.321 --> 00:02:59.154
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be a shitty comedian and now </v>

72
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>he's just doing these weird motivational</v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches and they're like,</v>

73
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of hobbled and cobbled </v>
<v Speaker 1>together from other people's Shit.</v>

74
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>And it's like it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

75
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't judge anybody very honest.</v>

76
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't really.</v>

77
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But about what other people are doing.</v>

78
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>escapism.</v>

79
00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:21.761
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>people can say reality stars of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People say watching football,</v>

81
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>like my beloved jets for three hours of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

82
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Like people can judge escapism in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>way they want.</v>

83
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Here's my big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a businessman,</v>

84
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:35.000
<v Speaker 1>so I talk about business content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just finding your inner peace,</v>

85
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.993
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scares the shit out of me is everybody </v>

86
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:38.794
<v Speaker 1>who fucking says that they're a business</v>
<v Speaker 1>coach and they've never made a fucking </v>

87
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>dollar outside of selling other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to make a dollar.</v>

88
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 1>The scheme is basically sell other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on how to make a dollar.</v>

89
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.903
<v Speaker 1>So I just don't want to go down that </v>
<v Speaker 1>path and I think I can look the part </v>

90
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>very quickly and that's why suppressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>it for a little while,</v>

91
00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>but then in the last three or four years</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've built a very large agency,</v>

92
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.943
<v Speaker 1>a media agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I think I felt good that I went </v>

93
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:05.794
<v Speaker 1>and executed again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like I did when I built the wine </v>

94
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

95
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>So I filled that bucket of building </v>
<v Speaker 1>another big business,</v>

96
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.033
<v Speaker 1>which makes me feel more comfortable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go out and do the content and being out </v>

97
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:17.314
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's definitely value in giving </v>

98
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>people motivation is definitely value </v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people get from it.</v>

99
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a real positive thing and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ripples that come off of that.</v>

100
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.210
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like I gained a lot from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people that are motivational.</v>

101
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it when they're real.</v>

102
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 1>When the real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

103
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to find,</v>

104
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to separate find out who's a </v>

105
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:38.930
<v Speaker 1>boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.930
<v Speaker 1>who's a real health expert and who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit artist that is sort of compiled</v>

107
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:45.934
<v Speaker 1>and remembered a bunch of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>other health experts have actually </v>

108
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:53.371
<v Speaker 1>studied and done headline research on </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus practitioners should imagine what</v>

109
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 1>you guys are dealing with.</v>

110
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Being at the top of the sphere of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>important medium,</v>

111
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 1>you must get bombarded and it takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

112
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.313
<v Speaker 1>Like I've been able to navigate who I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to fuck with and have drinks with </v>

113
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>and who I stay away from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of time.</v>

114
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does because it can look the part and </v>

115
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>you got to like dig and then you gotta </v>
<v Speaker 1>like take and you know,</v>

116
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people that you actually respect</v>

117
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.200
<v Speaker 1>who haven't done the work and are lazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>about putting somebody else on and our,</v>

118
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good guy,</v>

119
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

120
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

121
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is really interesting.</v>

122
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>And then there's hosers mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of hoses out there.</v>

123
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 1>There's just no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no getting away from that though</v>

124
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>and kind of all walks of life and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're right though,</v>

125
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:33.604
<v Speaker 1>did not concentrate on the negative ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's really just a waste of </v>

126
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

127
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.863
<v Speaker 1>It's a waste of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is an amazing time though to </v>

128
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 1>get a message out there and to motivate </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and to show people that,</v>

129
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:46.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

130
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 1>there's something positive not just in </v>
<v Speaker 1>being inspired buttons.</v>

131
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Inspiring others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:52.264
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

133
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.493
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the communication infrastructure of </v>

134
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>society is incredibly interesting right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

135
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.530
<v Speaker 1>but you and I are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know,</v>

136
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean like if you map what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

137
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>like it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

138
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:07.094
<v Speaker 1>you basically had to give up all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economics to the biggest radio station </v>

139
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:11.121
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

140
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:11.954
<v Speaker 1>like everybody can reach so many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course everybody's gonna head's </v>

141
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>going to go to what's going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics and what's going on.</v>

142
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:18.134
<v Speaker 1>And it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that dictator when they're </v>

143
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:21.194
<v Speaker 1>creating a coup d'etat wants to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of the media is because people </v>

144
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 1>go with what the media is telling them.</v>

145
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.123
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it's imperatively </v>

146
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 1>important to try to navigate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguish yourselves.</v>

147
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying this quite a bit lately,</v>

148
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>which is if you're feeling good right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

149
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.371
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

150
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel enormously optimistic.</v>

151
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.413
<v Speaker 1>You have a massive sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to communicate that </v>

152
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.640
<v Speaker 1>because the wave of negativity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>

153
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:50.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

154
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's super beneficial.</v>

155
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.610
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>what you were saying about the media </v>
<v Speaker 1>being powerful.</v>

157
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean the most powerful thing about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is everyone has access to it now.</v>

158
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.233
<v Speaker 1>It was nothing keeping anyone from </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting an instagram page and just </v>

159
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 1>putting up little videos everyday of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel and how they think.</v>

160
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>And it might only affect one person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might affect a thousand people,</v>

161
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>it might get to a million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it builds.</v>

162
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 1>And what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

163
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 1>is I think people look at this in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical way.</v>

164
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media is bad.</v>

165
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.380
<v Speaker 1>That person has no talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they successful?</v>

166
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:26.420
<v Speaker 1>This political thing is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bad,</v>

167
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:27.254
<v Speaker 1>this is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they don't realize is these </v>

168
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 1>social networks haven't changed us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've exposed us.</v>

169
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.190
<v Speaker 1>You know what people like twitter didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>change your opinions.</v>

170
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Twitter allowed you to express them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day when something was on tv</v>

171
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:47.690
<v Speaker 1>or the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were yelling when I used to listen to</v>

172
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:48.524
<v Speaker 1>sports radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike and the mad dog in the nineties in </v>

173
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was yelling back at mad dog,</v>

174
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you idiot,</v>

175
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jets should do this.</v>

176
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.950
<v Speaker 1>But now that voice is in play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

177
00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:58.803
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One famous person away from retweeting </v>

178
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 1>it to getting the foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

179
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the match.</v>

180
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 1>That can start your infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only is it in play,</v>

181
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:07.124
<v Speaker 1>but if you have opinions on sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could start your own podcast and it </v>

182
00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:11.420
<v Speaker 1>just builds.</v>

183
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.343
<v Speaker 1>And it could be massive in bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything on the radio because it's such </v>

184
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:16.394
<v Speaker 1>a superior medium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People forget that blogging was a </v>

185
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.400
<v Speaker 1>precursor to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

186
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 1>where do you think Bill Simmons came </v>
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>

187
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>People were confused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people forget real quick.</v>

188
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my story.</v>

189
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I owned a wine store in Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube came out.</v>

190
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.143
<v Speaker 1>It was five months old and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing is going to be big and it's </v>

191
00:08:31.441 --> 00:08:32.274
<v Speaker 1>sad to sit in front of a table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink four bottles of wine for 20 </v>

192
00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:35.354
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was good enough that a lot of </v>

193
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:38.360
<v Speaker 1>people want to watch what you started </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

194
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.860
<v Speaker 1>That's what you started doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Mike.</v>

195
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.780
<v Speaker 1>So My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to take it all the way back.</v>

196
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I was born in Belarus in the former </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union,</v>

197
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.330
<v Speaker 1>so I have a very immigrant story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Came to the states in [inaudible] 78.</v>

198
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:48.283
<v Speaker 1>Lived in a studio apartment half the </v>
<v Speaker 1>size of this studio with eight family </v>

199
00:08:52.071 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 1>members.</v>

200
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Real immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

201
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.063
<v Speaker 1>My Dad got a as a stock boy in a liquor </v>
<v Speaker 1>store for two bucks an hour in New </v>

202
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.303
<v Speaker 1>Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

203
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Became the manager of that store </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually.</v>

204
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:02.454
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that immigrant thing just work every </v>

205
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.040
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

206
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Dad Did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know my dad until I was 14</v>

207
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 1>even though he slept in my home every </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

208
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we moved to Jersey.</v>

209
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 1>I was straight entrepreneurial DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lemonade stands,</v>

210
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.713
<v Speaker 1>like shoveling snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to rip people's flowers out of </v>

211
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 1>their yard and ring the doorbell and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell it back to them.</v>

212
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:25.251
<v Speaker 1>It was real raw entrepreneurship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm 41 baseball cards were like the</v>

213
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>thing in 87,</v>
<v Speaker 1>88,</v>

214
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:30.390
<v Speaker 1>89 90.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was culture and I became a baseball</v>

215
00:09:30.391 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 1>card dealer and I was making two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$300 a weekend selling baseball cards in</v>

216
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 1>the malls of New Jersey that my dad </v>
<v Speaker 1>owned a small liquor store.</v>

217
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Eventually in Springfield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey dragged my ass in.</v>

218
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.213
<v Speaker 1>I hated it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but around 16 I realized people </v>

219
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:45.660
<v Speaker 1>collected wine that was connected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I liked,</v>

220
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>which was collecting baseball cards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>football cards and I at 16 years old,</v>

221
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.240
<v Speaker 1>spent every minute of my life trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become the foremost expert in wine.</v>

222
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.243
<v Speaker 1>I would go into like science class </v>
<v Speaker 1>junior year and not give a fuck about </v>

223
00:09:57.871 --> 00:09:58.704
<v Speaker 1>Saturn and we'll just sit there and read</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wine spectator and decided I was </v>

224
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:03.540
<v Speaker 1>going to be the greatest wine retailer </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>

225
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.913
<v Speaker 1>Heard the Internet in [inaudible] 94 in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a dorm room playing madden [inaudible] </v>

226
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 1>94.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend came and he's like,</v>

227
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 1>you got to see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to a room,</v>

228
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.463
<v Speaker 1>heard cooch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing and 15 minutes in was </v>

229
00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:18.284
<v Speaker 1>on a Bolton board and a PSA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing that people are selling wine and </v>

230
00:10:22.191 --> 00:10:23.024
<v Speaker 1>decided that I would launch a wine </v>
<v Speaker 1>website and in 1996 I launched one of </v>

231
00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:28.430
<v Speaker 1>the first ecommerce wine businesses in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

232
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.413
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then in 98 I came home full time </v>

233
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:32.714
<v Speaker 1>and from 90 to 2003 in that five year </v>
<v Speaker 1>window I built my dad's business from a </v>

234
00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:39.380
<v Speaker 1>three to a $60,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>business on the back of email marketing,</v>

235
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.753
<v Speaker 1>google ad words and just having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>website and that became my first foray </v>

236
00:10:44.901 --> 00:10:48.260
<v Speaker 1>into using technology to grow very </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

237
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Sell wine through that website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat.</v>

238
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:51.683
<v Speaker 1>So buy and sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Jack Shit about one I go </v>

239
00:10:54.401 --> 00:10:55.510
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just asked the guy,</v>

240
00:10:55.511 --> 00:10:57.130
<v Speaker 1>what's good dude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you like it?</v>

241
00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you need to know.</v>

242
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.870
<v Speaker 1>The number one reason I broke out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine.</v>

243
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who's listening right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real quick,</v>

244
00:11:03.641 --> 00:11:06.580
<v Speaker 1>take a step back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know anybody that's into wine?</v>

245
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Everybody probably knows one or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

246
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:09.843
<v Speaker 1>they know what I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every one of those people are street </v>

247
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.513
<v Speaker 1>douchebag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that's really into wine thinks </v>

248
00:11:14.491 --> 00:11:15.324
<v Speaker 1>like it's some magical information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they impose on others and they become a </v>

249
00:11:18.551 --> 00:11:19.384
<v Speaker 1>straight dick.</v>

250
00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Since I knew so much about wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

251
00:11:22.421 --> 00:11:23.254
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take this away from all </v>

252
00:11:23.981 --> 00:11:24.814
<v Speaker 1>those assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started the youtube show and I </v>

253
00:11:26.501 --> 00:11:29.300
<v Speaker 1>started comparing the wines to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillbilly Jim's like,</v>

254
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like boot and like,</v>

255
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like racquetballs and like the gum out </v>

256
00:11:34.001 --> 00:11:34.834
<v Speaker 1>of a tops pack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff that actually tastes like </v>

257
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.773
<v Speaker 1>and democratized wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a good thing because wine </v>

258
00:11:41.151 --> 00:11:42.970
<v Speaker 1>should not be on a pedestal if you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

259
00:11:42.971 --> 00:11:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

260
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.760
<v Speaker 1>There's no cheeseburger expert running </v>
<v Speaker 1>around going,</v>

261
00:11:45.761 --> 00:11:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're using the wrong cheese.</v>

262
00:11:47.711 --> 00:11:48.750
<v Speaker 1>It's from the wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

263
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.890
<v Speaker 1>It's so douchey that nobody wants to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>

264
00:11:50.891 --> 00:11:51.581
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

265
00:11:51.581 --> 00:11:52.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to help wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it did.</v>

266
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>It got a lot of young people</v>

267
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.820
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

268
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.760
<v Speaker 2>There's a weird pretentiousness to wine </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't sort of.</v>

269
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really exist with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other liquors,</v>

270
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:01.550
<v Speaker 2>like it doesn't exist with Tequila.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

271
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.400
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing it right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like craft beer,</v>

272
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.463
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing it with Breadski,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a craft beers more down home and it's </v>

273
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:07.683
<v Speaker 2>Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what Brooklyn heads that </v>

274
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 2>are trying to be Douchey as to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Brooklyn's a rough spot.</v>

275
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.093
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So confused and thinks it's like North </v>

276
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 2>Carolina thinks it's Asheville,</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina,</v>

277
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:19.480
<v Speaker 2>like planted in the middle of New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>City.</v>

278
00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:22.660
<v Speaker 2>It's for what a weird place Brooklyn is </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

279
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.360
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't like that when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in New York at all.</v>

280
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Now when I lived in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn was kind of like rough.</v>

281
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.890
<v Speaker 2>It was like Guido's and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

282
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 2>urban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

283
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:36.640
<v Speaker 2>it was a different spot and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just all these weird hipsters,</v>

284
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 2>skinny jeans and fucking vests on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>half.</v>

285
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.570
<v Speaker 2>It's probably you listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love your genes.</v>

286
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 2>See what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monday while they're doing it,</v>

287
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:45.934
<v Speaker 2>they can even run on those things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to get away with something </v>

288
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:50.770
<v Speaker 2>chasing you guys are getting away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and not getting away.</v>

289
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:52.750
<v Speaker 2>They just accept their fate and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>stealing their role,</v>

290
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 2>their pants up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it tight.</v>

291
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

292
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:55.563
<v Speaker 2>they're paying six x the price of </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever in North Carolina for the same </v>

293
00:12:57.941 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 2>item.</v>

297
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:08.620
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like that's a retro that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>

298
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.240
<v Speaker 2>I live in Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked it.</v>

299
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.880

<v Speaker 2>I definitely could.</v>

<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know what I'm about.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Here's what I like.</v>

318
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.350

<v Speaker 2>So let me give you a good example.</v>

321
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.153
<v Speaker 2>I have to sleep with a sound machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I need the chaos when I walk in </v>

322
00:14:01.691 --> 00:14:04.960
<v Speaker 2>my office floor and everybody's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>headphones on and there's no sound.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to be on a mountain.</v>

326
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:15.693
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear birds Chirp and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes me happier than hearing like </v>

327
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.550
<v Speaker 2>sirens and people yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really puts me to sleep.</v>

328
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.410

<v Speaker 2>one of those hips out sound.</v>

333
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.990

00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 2>like 25 year fantasy baseball player and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

348
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:24.494
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only time I've ever really made </v>

349
00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:26.504
<v Speaker 2>money gambling was when I new up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming pitchers were coming up and </v>

350
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.200
<v Speaker 2>that's how they really run it and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I've made my biggest arbitrage.</v>

351
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.220
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to make money on fighting too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to be able to,</v>

352
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.163
<v Speaker 2>when I used to gamble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first started working for the </v>

353
00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:39.284
<v Speaker 2>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd still bet on fights and then I </v>

354
00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 2>thought about it for a while and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

355
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably not supposed to do this.</v>

356
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.050
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

357
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.033
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't affect anything and no one ever </v>

358
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:52.290
<v Speaker 2>told me I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I'm a manager.</v>

359
00:15:52.291 --> 00:15:54.700
<v Speaker 2>And that your commentary with slate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

360
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.060
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

361
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said that it has been me.</v>

362
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.930
<v Speaker 2>They said I was biased for people I bet </v>
<v Speaker 2>against,</v>

363
00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:06.080
<v Speaker 2>which is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had that happen,</v>

364
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.680
<v Speaker 2>but I stopped doing that like more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago.</v>

365
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.553
<v Speaker 2>It was probably like 2002 or three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right after I first started doing </v>

366
00:16:13.551 --> 00:16:14.980
<v Speaker 2>commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I quit doing that,</v>

367
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.823
<v Speaker 2>but used to be able to make a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money because there were some killers </v>

368
00:16:18.381 --> 00:16:20.220
<v Speaker 2>and there were and people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>undereducated and that's,</v>

369
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.510
<v Speaker 2>well there were some killers that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>come in from other countries and I would</v>

370
00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:24.120
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

371
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.090
<v Speaker 2>like they didn't know about this guy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

372
00:16:26.091 --> 00:16:27.050
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this like Atlanta.</v>

373
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm a golf guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was coming in from,</v>

374
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.560
<v Speaker 2>I forget where he's from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

375
00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the,</v>

376
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:33.590
<v Speaker 2>what's the line?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking bet the house,</v>

377
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:36.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was some guys from parts unknown.</v>

378
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.950
<v Speaker 2>There's a few guys from parts did that </v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

379
00:16:38.951 --> 00:16:39.784
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was fascinated when they were like </v>

380
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.760
<v Speaker 2>from parts unknown shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's he from?</v>

381
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.743
<v Speaker 2>Well that's no good for global </v>
<v Speaker 2>enterprise at the UFC because you want </v>

382
00:16:47.801 --> 00:16:49.760
<v Speaker 2>to engage those people in the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

383
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's this guy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Who's the number one contender in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lightweight division?</v>

386
00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:57.260
<v Speaker 2>He says fucking murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such a bad ass.</v>

387
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.730
<v Speaker 2>And he's undefeated and like the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing about this guy's a,</v>

388
00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.390
<v Speaker 2>he's from Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's from Dagestan.</v>

389
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.261
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a,</v>

390
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:06.380
<v Speaker 2>it's a really weird place because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a large place,</v>

391
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.640
<v Speaker 2>but there's a bunch of killers that come</v>
<v Speaker 2>out as one spot and this guy is like the</v>

392
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:11.450
<v Speaker 2>main killer.</v>

393
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:12.283
<v Speaker 2>And so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're planning on doing a big UFC in </v>

394
00:17:13.701 --> 00:17:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy's fighting in Russia.</v>

395
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.110

<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

396
00:17:18.111 --> 00:17:18.944
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

399
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.900
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent digital thing has </v>
<v Speaker 2>always worked,</v>

<v Speaker 2>anybody could rip off.</v>

417
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.600
<v Speaker 2>You'll be super careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your checkbook.</v>

418
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Luckily I don't have any checks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I don't even know what a check</v>

419
00:18:03.961 --> 00:18:04.980
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a buddy of mine,</v>

420
00:18:04.981 --> 00:18:07.710
<v Speaker 2>his name is Guido Orlando.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a good guy and he,</v>

421
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:09.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his signature is this,</v>

422
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

423
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.173
<v Speaker 2>Which was great until he got divorced </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then his ex wife just fucking went </v>

424
00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.960
<v Speaker 2>off with the to trench.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just drain the poor guy.</v>

425
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.440
<v Speaker 2>Or do I still fucking stuck to his guns </v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

426
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.890
<v Speaker 2>After she drained them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept that fucking seconds.</v>

427
00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.280
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take the money,</v>

428
00:18:26.281 --> 00:18:27.750
<v Speaker 2>but you hadn't taken this signature </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken.</v>

429
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:32.770
<v Speaker 2>My big old bitch gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody could tell you how you write your</v>

430
00:18:33.271 --> 00:18:33.931
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

431
00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:35.640
<v Speaker 2>you could write your name a any way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

432
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.380
<v Speaker 2>So he just decided that's how I write </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

433
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.010
<v Speaker 2>That's it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

434
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 2>He's a pool cue maker.</v>

435
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.700
<v Speaker 2>He makes custom made pool cues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

436
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:51.140
<v Speaker 2>And last time I heard he was somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the midwest where pool is still got a</v>

437
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.343
<v Speaker 2>pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is always connected to gambling and </v>

438
00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:54.843
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does better in places where there's </v>

439
00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:57.900
<v Speaker 2>not as much to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

440
00:18:57.901 --> 00:18:58.734
<v Speaker 2>Not as many options for gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although Manhattan is like a good spot </v>

441
00:19:01.621 --> 00:19:02.454
<v Speaker 2>for pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

442
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.380
<v Speaker 2>oddly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a date thing,</v>

443
00:19:04.381 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 2>like you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pool pool pool.</v>

444
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Like real pool gamblers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high level players.</v>

445
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:11.004
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could play,</v>

446
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.560
<v Speaker 2>I could play decent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about darts?</v>

447
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dartboard over there.</v>

448
00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Somebody gave it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never even opened it up over there.</v>

449
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Are you good at darts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

450
00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Better than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People love darts.</v>

451
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Just have good hand eye coordination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fun.</v>

452
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:24.670
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

453
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.800
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like you're looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing over and over again.</v>

454
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.050
<v Speaker 2>That's my problem with bowling and </v>
<v Speaker 2>darts.</v>

455
00:19:31.051 --> 00:19:32.580
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at the same goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

456
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:33.900
<v Speaker 2>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pattern recognition.</v>

457
00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:35.470
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of how I think about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

458
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:39.630
<v Speaker 2>content and business and those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like pattern recognition.</v>

459
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Why do you like pattern recognition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes to me but you like chaos.</v>

460
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:45.960
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

461
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:46.950
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I.</v>

462
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:47.783
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

463
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.630
<v Speaker 2>I definitely am a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big fan of,</v>

464
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.570
<v Speaker 2>of pattern recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to me,</v>

465
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.240
<v Speaker 2>everything just happens over and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and over again.</v>

466
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.870
<v Speaker 2>You just have to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>historics.</v>

467
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.753
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my great thesis right now where I think </v>

468
00:19:58.801 --> 00:19:59.634
<v Speaker 2>all the money's going to be made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the television and that is the </v>

469
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:05.320
<v Speaker 2>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're pointing to your phone.</v>

470
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.610
<v Speaker 2>It was the television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the TV,</v>

471
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:07.830
<v Speaker 2>the radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's 19,</v>

472
00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:11.820
<v Speaker 2>48 to 1957,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning we are going from a primary as a</v>

473
00:20:11.821 --> 00:20:13.200
<v Speaker 2>society in the US.</v>

474
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.333
<v Speaker 2>The primary device in our lives is </v>
<v Speaker 2>switching from the television to the </v>

475
00:20:17.671 --> 00:20:20.130
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same thing that happened in the late</v>

476
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:20.963
<v Speaker 2>forties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early fifties from the radio to </v>

477
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.373
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go back and understand the </v>

478
00:20:24.031 --> 00:20:25.770
<v Speaker 2>brands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the media companies,</v>

479
00:20:25.771 --> 00:20:28.710
<v Speaker 2>the personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened in that decade,</v>

480
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.440
<v Speaker 2>then you can start making bets on </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding,</v>

481
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the phones,</v>

482
00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:37.800
<v Speaker 2>the television than facebook and twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and instagram are ABC,</v>

483
00:20:37.801 --> 00:20:38.634
<v Speaker 2>NBC and CBS.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't I become bob hope and seal </v>

484
00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.550
<v Speaker 2>ball?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you go back and read a lot of</v>

485
00:20:44.551 --> 00:20:49.540
<v Speaker 2>the radio stars didn't go to television </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they disrespected the medium.</v>

486
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would tell you,</v>

487
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.283
<v Speaker 2>I asked you this before we went on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was fascinating because I know you've </v>

488
00:20:55.271 --> 00:20:57.280
<v Speaker 2>been really a pioneer in this in early </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

489
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Like you went to podcasting and I'm sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>now everybody's like,</v>

490
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.130
<v Speaker 2>oh my God and can I be on your show?</v>

491
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 2>But when you first started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't have the,</v>

492
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brand as a platform.</v>

493
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:12.670
<v Speaker 2>It has now short plenty people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>snickering at it or what does it mean?</v>

494
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:13.743
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were doing it reasonably like </v>

495
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:17.523
<v Speaker 2>people are still doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Howard stern was making fun of podcast </v>

496
00:21:19.541 --> 00:21:21.760
<v Speaker 2>just a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even a year ago.</v>

497
00:21:21.761 --> 00:21:25.420
<v Speaker 2>He was mocking people doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we get $95,</v>

498
00:21:25.421 --> 00:21:26.254
<v Speaker 2>million downloads a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course he's mocking it because </v>

499
00:21:28.301 --> 00:21:30.700
<v Speaker 2>everybody mocks the competitive thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's rise.</v>

500
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 2>There's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that.</v>

501
00:21:31.841 --> 00:21:33.540
<v Speaker 2>But it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

502
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.150
<v Speaker 2>it is that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just save ourselves in that way.</v>

503
00:21:37.151 --> 00:21:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

504
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.060
<v Speaker 2>radios fucked because it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to tune in at a certain time.</v>

505
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.820
<v Speaker 2>You have to listen to their commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>

506
00:21:45.821 --> 00:21:46.654
<v Speaker 2>I mean the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The medium of podcasting is so superior </v>

507
00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:52.450
<v Speaker 2>that it's instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pause it when you want.</v>

508
00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 2>You get back into your car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bluetooth to your car.</v>

509
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.700
<v Speaker 2>It plays anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go from your car to headphones.</v>

510
00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.950
<v Speaker 2>It can play in your car or complain your</v>
<v Speaker 2>headphones.</v>

511
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.230
<v Speaker 2>You could pick it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could put it on your laptop,</v>

512
00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:03.064
<v Speaker 2>you could have it stream in your house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do whatever the fuck you want with </v>

513
00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:05.980
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You delete them,</v>

514
00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:07.930
<v Speaker 2>you download their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're instantaneous.</v>

515
00:22:07.931 --> 00:22:10.150
<v Speaker 2>You can get them whenever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go to the archives.</v>

516
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.080
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

517
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.960
<v Speaker 2>and it's also a hundred percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncensored,</v>

518
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:17.440
<v Speaker 2>100 percent unproduced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no one in like with this,</v>

519
00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:18.483
<v Speaker 2>it's me and Jamie and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no one else involved in </v>

520
00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:21.940
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

521
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.740
<v Speaker 2>And look at Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just chilling,</v>

522
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.680
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's really amazing in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>respect.</v>

523
00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:27.563
<v Speaker 2>There's no corporate end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you get to these kinds of </v>

524
00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:30.264
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually you'd be in some giant building </v>

525
00:22:32.111 --> 00:22:34.610
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and there'd be a gang of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people involved.</v>

526
00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.320
<v Speaker 2>They'd have meetings and after the show </v>
<v Speaker 2>meetings and a tutorial post and we had.</v>

527
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.070
<v Speaker 2>We never had a fucking meeting ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys smoke a little weed.</v>

528
00:22:42.071 --> 00:22:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Even talked to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

529
00:22:43.411 --> 00:22:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell him we're friends,</v>

530
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.860
<v Speaker 2>but a little weed will knock some pool </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls around.</v>

531
00:22:47.861 --> 00:22:48.990
<v Speaker 2>Jamie has a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going,</v>

532
00:22:48.991 --> 00:22:49.541
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do that.</v>

533
00:22:49.541 --> 00:22:50.374
<v Speaker 2>And we fucking wind up doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so informal and it's like </v>

534
00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:57.880
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing going on like corporate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's amazing is that allows the talent</v>

535
00:22:57.881 --> 00:22:59.460
<v Speaker 2>to rise to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

536
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.170
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also allows people to be themselves,</v>

537
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.610
<v Speaker 2>which is what allows the talent to rise </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the top or allows the.</v>

538
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.173
<v Speaker 2>Let me say the word talent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but allows content to find its way in a </v>

539
00:23:11.351 --> 00:23:12.184
<v Speaker 2>pure manner where it's not like if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a bunch of people influencing what </v>

540
00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:18.160
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you start compromising and as</v>

541
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:20.530
<v Speaker 2>soon as you start compromising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just can't.</v>

542
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.270
<v Speaker 2>It's never going to get through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right way.</v>

543
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:23.104
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the beautiful things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup and one of the beautiful things </v>

544
00:23:26.231 --> 00:23:27.064
<v Speaker 2>about podcasting is that like if you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see a guy like bill burr has netflix </v>

545
00:23:29.621 --> 00:23:31.600
<v Speaker 2>specials out right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in gentleman just came out,</v>

546
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.160
<v Speaker 2>he was on earlier today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you see his thoughts.</v>

547
00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:38.860
<v Speaker 2>There's no one telling him what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no one needed to know.</v>

548
00:23:38.861 --> 00:23:41.650
<v Speaker 2>When you watch a stand up on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their thoughts.</v>

549
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:44.230
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a way to hone it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their personality.</v>

550
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Speaker 2>And then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it out there like that.</v>

551
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.053
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same thing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasting and that's never existed </v>

552
00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:50.900
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've never had the opportunity.</v>

553
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.650
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We take it for granted.</v>

554
00:23:54.651 --> 00:23:58.340
<v Speaker 1>It's really fundamentally only 20 to 21 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

555
00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.353
<v Speaker 1>Windows 95 really kind of put normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on it is the great shift in our </v>

556
00:24:04.701 --> 00:24:09.290
<v Speaker 1>society and I think we haven't fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantified it's impact across the board.</v>

557
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Well if you think about 20 years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

558
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.133
<v Speaker 1>what a short period of time that is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>human history and if we go a hundred </v>

559
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:15.763
<v Speaker 1>years from now and look back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will look at this like this great </v>

560
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:22.490
<v Speaker 1>explosion of content and creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion and integration.</v>

561
00:24:22.491 --> 00:24:23.324
<v Speaker 1>This integration of thoughts and ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the instantaneous ability to </v>

562
00:24:27.231 --> 00:24:28.064
<v Speaker 1>communicate that's just never existed </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and they're going to think it's </v>

563
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:32.060
<v Speaker 1>slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

564
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is going to say everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

565
00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:34.730
<v Speaker 1>it's so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the kids,</v>

566
00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:35.564
<v Speaker 1>the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I love these kids are not going </v>

567
00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:40.400
<v Speaker 1>to be capable to live in society because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on a phone.</v>

568
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.660
<v Speaker 1>I was told that I would not be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning human being because I played</v>

569
00:24:44.661 --> 00:24:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Zelda and Mike Tyson's punch out too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much while they were right.</v>

570
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:52.060
<v Speaker 1>They knew it in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

571
00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.800
<v Speaker 1>but I tell my friends all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

572
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.170
<v Speaker 1>what world do you think our kids are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be living in?</v>

573
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.650
<v Speaker 1>You think it would be outside throwing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>racquet ball against the fucking wall.</v>

574
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Like the world shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

575
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.970
<v Speaker 1>there'll be taking selfies of her ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly right.</v>

576
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.833
<v Speaker 1>So they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be putting lenses and </v>

577
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.790
<v Speaker 1>let me get a vr world 24 slash seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're really going to be,</v>

578
00:25:10.791 --> 00:25:11.810
<v Speaker 1>is really what they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

579
00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is next?</v>

580
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:14.833
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at the cell phone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at technology and the </v>

581
00:25:17.121 --> 00:25:19.520
<v Speaker 1>integration in our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is the next step?</v>

582
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Voice voice is going to be really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because it's on us now.</v>

583
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.850
<v Speaker 1>So voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here let's take a step back.</v>

584
00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.810
<v Speaker 1>It's all about time arbitrage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that we're all addicted to his</v>

585
00:25:29.811 --> 00:25:31.400
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Uber,</v>

586
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Uber doesn't sell transportation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber sells time this whole convenience.</v>

587
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.040
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's.</v>

588
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:37.993
<v Speaker 1>And it's packaged in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So voice when Alexa can order your </v>

589
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.680
<v Speaker 1>package for you instead of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever's faster,</v>

590
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.530
<v Speaker 1>like the head of the I pads that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>

591
00:25:48.531 --> 00:25:50.620
<v Speaker 1>like the yearbook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you there.</v>

592
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Whatever's faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever's faster is what we're going to</v>

593
00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:57.200
<v Speaker 1>gravitate towards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think voice activation,</v>

594
00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:58.400
<v Speaker 1>ai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ar,</v>

595
00:25:58.401 --> 00:25:59.234
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of things are really gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to populate up over the next half </v>

596
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:03.411
<v Speaker 1>decade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

597
00:26:03.411 --> 00:26:05.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those earbuds that you're wearing,</v>

598
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 1>do you work out in those things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

599
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't hang in there.</v>

600
00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.370
<v Speaker 1>They'll fall out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't tried it.</v>

601
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:11.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

602
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.043
<v Speaker 1>I'm not quite sure they look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing I would worry </v>

603
00:26:14.691 --> 00:26:15.980
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look pretty bad ass.</v>

604
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.613
<v Speaker 1>I'm upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best product that was put out </v>

605
00:26:18.801 --> 00:26:21.130
<v Speaker 1>since the phone itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really believe that.</v>

606
00:26:21.131 --> 00:26:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

607
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.593
<v Speaker 1>Do they work the way the other way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a button you can press on them </v>

608
00:26:25.341 --> 00:26:26.960
<v Speaker 1>to answer the phone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how does that work?</v>

609
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is I'm not even sure,</v>

610
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:34.300
<v Speaker 1>like by the way probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm so weirded out like I don't do.</v>

611
00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.213
<v Speaker 1>I'm so bad at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I never get the full value out of </v>

612
00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:39.650
<v Speaker 1>products because I don't even have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to read.</v>

613
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>That's actually probably good because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that a product has to be</v>

614
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.903
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good to impress you because it </v>

615
00:26:46.891 --> 00:26:49.590
<v Speaker 2>becomes so easy to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have very good insight.</v>

616
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

617
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:51.151
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

618
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:51.984
<v Speaker 2>Because there's some shit like on one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those fitbit's like good luck with all </v>

619
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:55.074
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting in there and pulling up </v>

620
00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.200
<v Speaker 2>apple product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

621
00:26:57.201 --> 00:26:58.800
<v Speaker 2>You know what they're gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna make all that ship.</v>

622
00:26:58.801 --> 00:27:01.380
<v Speaker 2>Not work stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

623
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.660
<v Speaker 2>They're not here to be friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want your fucking money.</v>

624
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.523
<v Speaker 2>Somebody gave me one of these gps </v>
<v Speaker 2>watches that you have to charge every </v>

625
00:27:07.561 --> 00:27:11.250
<v Speaker 2>other day or some fucking stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that thing charges,</v>

626
00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.830
<v Speaker 2>like I thought it was like that three </v>
<v Speaker 2>days like,</v>

627
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like instantaneous.</v>

628
00:27:15.661 --> 00:27:17.760
<v Speaker 2>It's been really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It lasts for three days.</v>

629
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Mine have been lasting for as long as </v>
<v Speaker 2>three days here.</v>

630
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ordered it,</v>

631
00:27:20.731 --> 00:27:22.680
<v Speaker 2>but they're not going to deliver it </v>
<v Speaker 2>until March.</v>

632
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.130
<v Speaker 2>I think they're back ordered for quite a</v>
<v Speaker 2>while because too many people like you.</v>

633
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can predict it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucked it up,</v>

634
00:27:28.581 --> 00:27:29.520
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry everyone.</v>

635
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

636
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.903
<v Speaker 2>So you think voice meaning like voice </v>
<v Speaker 2>control voice and I'm one of the things </v>

637
00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:36.654
<v Speaker 2>that I use all the time as a comic is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the notes feature on the iphone yet has </v>

638
00:27:41.161 --> 00:27:41.994
<v Speaker 2>that little voice thing and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazingly accurate and accurate enough </v>

639
00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:46.704
<v Speaker 2>that I could realize what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even if it fucks up a word or </v>

640
00:27:49.351 --> 00:27:50.850
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go back and look at it.</v>

641
00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:52.590
<v Speaker 2>But if you've ever used it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

642
00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:53.730
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking granted.</v>

643
00:27:53.731 --> 00:27:55.500
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the two point.</v>

644
00:27:55.501 --> 00:27:55.921
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

645
00:27:55.921 --> 00:27:57.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where like things are actually happening</v>

646
00:27:57.571 --> 00:27:58.404
<v Speaker 2>because of your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we could talk right now and this </v>

647
00:28:01.261 --> 00:28:02.094
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing is going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick up a good 99 percent of everything </v>

648
00:28:05.521 --> 00:28:07.260
<v Speaker 2>we're saying and I'm not even touching </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

649
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.140
<v Speaker 2>You see it crushed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just Uhm,</v>

650
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.680
<v Speaker 2>killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

651
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

652
00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:12.813
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to me where it gets really exciting </v>

653
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.550
<v Speaker 2>is when everything around you is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>

654
00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:18.443
<v Speaker 2>So when everything becomes smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it starts getting really </v>

655
00:28:21.181 --> 00:28:22.500
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our phones are smart,</v>

656
00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.343
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what happens when your belt is </v>

657
00:28:25.501 --> 00:28:26.334
<v Speaker 2>smart?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

658
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.413
<v Speaker 2>and now all of a sudden you go to order </v>
<v Speaker 2>a big Mac and you try to pay with your </v>

659
00:28:31.621 --> 00:28:33.960
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your belts talking to your phone and</v>

660
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.020
<v Speaker 2>when you go to pay it declines and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks at you and says,</v>

661
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:38.910
<v Speaker 2>order a salad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fat Ass,</v>

662
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your belt is telling you it's tightened,</v>

663
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.000
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tights pushing against your body.</v>

664
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.980
<v Speaker 2>And what about when your refrigerator </v>
<v Speaker 2>reorders?</v>

665
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.293
<v Speaker 2>Another case of Budweiser because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>understands how often you drink it and </v>

666
00:28:52.111 --> 00:28:52.944
<v Speaker 2>so you're down to two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It knows that you're going to drink to </v>

667
00:28:54.721 --> 00:28:55.554
<v Speaker 2>tonight because that's your average and </v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you get home that night and </v>

668
00:28:57.871 --> 00:29:01.080
<v Speaker 2>open and grabbed the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's already reordering it for you.</v>

669
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.900
<v Speaker 2>So your refrigerator becomes an enabler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's going to be.</v>

670
00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Then they started doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>refrigerator,</v>

671
00:29:05.531 --> 00:29:06.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your traffic,</v>

672
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.090
<v Speaker 2>your toothpaste is going to have one </v>
<v Speaker 2>drop left.</v>

673
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:09.983
<v Speaker 2>If he orders it for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to get into that place </v>

674
00:29:12.361 --> 00:29:13.194
<v Speaker 2>where everything is smart and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it starts getting a little bit </v>

675
00:29:15.511 --> 00:29:16.344
<v Speaker 2>interesting and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then virtual reality porn is going </v>

676
00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:21.090
<v Speaker 2>to be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's already interesting.</v>

677
00:29:21.091 --> 00:29:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever done the htc vive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever fuck with?</v>

678
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duncan has the porn and the htc vive and</v>

679
00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:27.363
<v Speaker 2>he tried to get me to look at it briefly</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they looked at it briefly like six </v>

680
00:29:30.991 --> 00:29:31.824
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

681
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.090
<v Speaker 2>a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

682
00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.970
<v Speaker 2>you're just getting too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

683
00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:38.730
<v Speaker 2>you could just stare at someone's tits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just too big.</v>

684
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is too weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too.</v>

685
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

686
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:44.500
<v Speaker 2>it was bizarre 10 years ago.</v>

687
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Dating somebody that you met online like</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre gets redefined real quick.</v>

688
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And guys are real simple.</v>

689
00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.163
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you need is one of your buddies and </v>

<v Speaker 2>Just that tone.</v>

693
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:01.150
<v Speaker 2>And that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

694
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:02.320
<v Speaker 2>And You wonder,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

701
00:30:14.141 --> 00:30:14.974

719
00:31:01.601 --> 00:31:04.750
<v Speaker 2>water finds its own level so you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>find your level.</v>

720
00:31:04.751 --> 00:31:05.770
<v Speaker 2>You find what it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're out there always someone.</v>

723
00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Someone's willing to fuck you 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

724
00:31:12.071 --> 00:31:12.904
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just gotta find that person might </v>

725
00:31:14.321 --> 00:31:15.500
<v Speaker 2>not be everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

726
00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.960
<v Speaker 2>but what's real fun is when you actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>break out of your level.</v>

727
00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:20.853
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once in a blue moon every now and then </v>

728
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:26.020
<v Speaker 2>every now and then below your level or </v>
<v Speaker 2>above your level.</v>

729
00:31:26.021 --> 00:31:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Every now and then the moment you </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually talk about the three point line</v>

730
00:31:28.991 --> 00:31:30.280
<v Speaker 2>and it's nothing but net.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

731
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:31.900
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did that happen?</v>

732
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:34.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

733
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:36.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

734
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:37.223
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating to me because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>really concerned about the integration </v>

735
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.430
<v Speaker 2>of human beings and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Concerned.</v>

736
00:31:45.431 --> 00:31:49.150
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say concern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but puzzled as to the end point.</v>

737
00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.580
<v Speaker 2>The end point is the robots kill us all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think so?</v>

738
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

739
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that?</v>

740
00:31:54.131 --> 00:31:54.964
<v Speaker 2>I think we integrate with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can come see me until we </v>

741
00:31:57.401 --> 00:32:00.070
<v Speaker 2>become bothering forced to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

742
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.270
<v Speaker 2>and we don't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

743
00:32:01.271 --> 00:32:02.104
<v Speaker 2>I think it's those pussies that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>scared to integrate that we're going to </v>

744
00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:06.490
<v Speaker 2>have to kill off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's folks like you and me,</v>

745
00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:07.324
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get the chips so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think we'll be able to survive on team </v>

746
00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:12.800
<v Speaker 2>robot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really killed those humans.</v>

747
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.673
<v Speaker 2>I think there's gonna be some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some folks that want to make their own </v>

748
00:32:15.551 --> 00:32:17.820
<v Speaker 2>homemade bows and arrows and shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chop the.</v>

749
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a stone ax like those assholes.</v>

750
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:22.503
<v Speaker 2>I don't use matches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking robe starts to grow those </v>

751
00:32:24.551 --> 00:32:26.170
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be a problem.</v>

752
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:28.480
<v Speaker 2>I think people can be scared of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as we continue.</v>

753
00:32:28.481 --> 00:32:31.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean people are scared of technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>for regeneration of it.</v>

754
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:36.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm real curious how far it gets before </v>
<v Speaker 2>we get to 80,</v>

755
00:32:36.161 --> 00:32:36.730
<v Speaker 2>90,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred.</v>

756
00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Like what are we going to really see at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tail end?</v>

757
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:39.883
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you think of somebody who's 90 </v>

758
00:32:40.341 --> 00:32:42.410
<v Speaker 2>years old now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit they saw.</v>

759
00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Like I mean if you go the whole gamut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

760
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:48.050
<v Speaker 2>like in their forties and fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like a television,</v>

761
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:48.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

762
00:32:48.571 --> 00:32:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know.</v>

763
00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old are you?</v>

764
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Forty nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

765
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Your little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

766
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how this plays out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might have been a slightly.</v>

767
00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm 41,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's slightly.</v>

768
00:32:58.551 --> 00:32:59.900
<v Speaker 2>It'll be interesting to see what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>

769
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.020
<v Speaker 2>The jumped from fucking Atari to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nintendo.</v>

770
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.033
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa giant insanity or the iphone from </v>

771
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:10.670
<v Speaker 2>the fucking razor or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you have those moments,</v>

772
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.193
<v Speaker 2>that's when it gets interesting when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have that quantum product that leaps </v>

773
00:33:15.501 --> 00:33:16.334
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ipod from whatever the MP3 fucking </v>

774
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:23.360
<v Speaker 2>horseshit things we had said it's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be artificial parts too.</v>

775
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I think that's going to be a big part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

776
00:33:24.981 --> 00:33:25.814
<v Speaker 2>Like people who are blind getting them </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial eyes that worked better than </v>

777
00:33:28.671 --> 00:33:29.504
<v Speaker 2>realize and then people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean initially it's gonna be not as </v>

778
00:33:32.271 --> 00:33:35.430
<v Speaker 2>good and then it's going to be as good </v>
<v Speaker 2>as you were.</v>

779
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.280
<v Speaker 2>80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 slash 50.</v>

780
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Now you're 19.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well not even plastic surgery.</v>

781
00:33:39.711 --> 00:33:40.544
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be genetic manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that the back to pattern </v>

782
00:33:43.101 --> 00:33:46.010
<v Speaker 2>recognition when when plastic surgery </v>
<v Speaker 2>came out,</v>

783
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.980
<v Speaker 2>you are 50 40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that range now,</v>

784
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:49.993
<v Speaker 2>18 year old girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 year old girls are attacking it </v>

785
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.310
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>

786
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.143
<v Speaker 2>So when first it's going to be for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blind and then some dudes going to be </v>

787
00:33:56.211 --> 00:33:57.044
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

788
00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:57.973
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is my friend who was blind can see </v>

789
00:34:00.201 --> 00:34:02.000
<v Speaker 2>shit better than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to just do that.</v>

790
00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:02.834
<v Speaker 2>And it could go from defense to offense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody showed me a breakdown of Kylie </v>

791
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Jenner's plastic surgery over the years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's only like 20 years old.</v>

792
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.633
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this girl has had her face just </v>

793
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 2>chopped apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's had her chin widdled down,</v>

794
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:21.570
<v Speaker 2>she's had her hips widen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her breast enhance.</v>

795
00:34:21.571 --> 00:34:23.240
<v Speaker 2>She's a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

796
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.440
<v Speaker 2>And she's just there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's sculpting her with scalpels.</v>

797
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

798
00:34:28.551 --> 00:34:29.384
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strange because she doesn't look </v>

799
00:34:30.471 --> 00:34:33.020
<v Speaker 2>remotely like she used to look just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of years ago.</v>

800
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm thinking heralded for it amongst</v>

801
00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:38.654
<v Speaker 2>their peers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what do you think's going to </v>

802
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.650
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are going to follow that pattern.</v>

803
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

804
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:43.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're jumping in head first </v>

805
00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.310
<v Speaker 2>starts with celebrity than it supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

806
00:34:46.311 --> 00:34:47.480
<v Speaker 2>The affluent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

807
00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.240
<v Speaker 2>the amount of money that it cost to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

808
00:34:50.241 --> 00:34:51.074
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be in the hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of dollars because she's had </v>

809
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.790
<v Speaker 2>some really extensive stuff done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

810
00:34:55.791 --> 00:34:57.740
<v Speaker 2>you just didn't see that when we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

811
00:34:57.741 --> 00:34:58.574
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't see a 20 year old girl that </v>

812
00:35:00.411 --> 00:35:02.300
<v Speaker 2>hadn't been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a girl got a boob job.</v>

813
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.650
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not even.</v>

814
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was so rare for later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

815
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.210
<v Speaker 2>maybe in our twenties we heard about </v>
<v Speaker 2>such stuff.</v>

816
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One didn't to do that,</v>

817
00:35:09.551 --> 00:35:11.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>

818
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.780
<v Speaker 2>but now it's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're doing stuff to their hips,</v>

819
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.063
<v Speaker 2>like girls are getting their hips wide </v>
<v Speaker 2>and because asses the offense now I </v>

820
00:35:19.791 --> 00:35:21.860
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just so strange to see.</v>

821
00:35:21.861 --> 00:35:22.694
<v Speaker 2>Like when you look at a person and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know their asses mostly like some weird </v>

822
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:31.180
<v Speaker 2>extra substance that they're sticking in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their lap it up.</v>

823
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:32.083
<v Speaker 2>But you know what the guys respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my good friend moves set a long </v>

824
00:35:34.581 --> 00:35:36.550
<v Speaker 2>time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said good friend named Moose.</v>

825
00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robin use.</v>

826
00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:41.670
<v Speaker 2>We call them loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said about fake boobs.</v>

827
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:42.810
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're fake,</v>

828
00:35:42.811 --> 00:35:45.060
<v Speaker 2>why can I put them in my mouth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

829
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.950
<v Speaker 2>If I can touch them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're real.</v>

830
00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.380
<v Speaker 2>It was in 1999 albums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

831
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:52.050
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

832
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.540
<v Speaker 2>it's a fascinating thing because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't care,</v>

833
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.300
<v Speaker 2>but we do care when it gets to lips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

834
00:35:57.301 --> 00:35:58.780
<v Speaker 2>there's something about lips were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

835
00:35:58.781 --> 00:35:59.251
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

836
00:35:59.251 --> 00:36:02.760
<v Speaker 2>slow the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can get those preposterous tits</v>

837
00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:05.340
<v Speaker 2>and nobody blinks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as soon as you get to lips,</v>

838
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:06.174
<v Speaker 2>gods go Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's something about when they </v>

839
00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:10.060
<v Speaker 2>have this crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

840
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:13.470
<v Speaker 2>The lip implant thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a strange one,</v>

841
00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:14.304
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a,</v>

842
00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.173
<v Speaker 2>there's something sad about that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it elicits a response that you </v>

843
00:36:18.571 --> 00:36:19.710
<v Speaker 2>don't get out of the boobs.</v>

844
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:20.813
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

845
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.650
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude's nothing.</v>

846
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.140
<v Speaker 2>Not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a Dick Implant and site.</v>

847
00:36:25.141 --> 00:36:28.860
<v Speaker 2>Not a goddamn thing you can do to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening soon or thing it's going to be</v>

848
00:36:28.861 --> 00:36:30.480
<v Speaker 2>genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

849
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.760
<v Speaker 2>And when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to have a bit about that.</v>

850
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:33.623
<v Speaker 2>It's going to take about 30 minutes for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first guy to dive and overdose </v>

851
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:39.270
<v Speaker 2>because they go out with a pill that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes your dick bigger.</v>

852
00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:40.104
<v Speaker 2>We're not taking one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're taking them all just going to go </v>

853
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:45.010
<v Speaker 2>give me a stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me one less than that.</v>

854
00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Let's fucking do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simple that way.</v>

855
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.313
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we're going to morph because </v>

856
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.173
<v Speaker 2>vaginas are going to have to change to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with the size of the Dick because </v>

857
00:36:53.221 --> 00:36:56.850
<v Speaker 2>dudes are going to have carpet roll Cox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to be this giant.</v>

858
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.883
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to stop like people </v>

859
00:36:59.281 --> 00:36:59.790
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>

860
00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Like once we have that ability to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger dicks than once,</v>

861
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:03.533
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be like those crazy ladies</v>
<v Speaker 2>who bought crushed beer cans with her </v>

862
00:37:05.881 --> 00:37:07.030
<v Speaker 2>tits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever see them?</v>

863
00:37:07.031 --> 00:37:11.940
<v Speaker 2>They get like a triple Z on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to get to that point.</v>

864
00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:14.320
<v Speaker 2>It's the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

865
00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.370
<v Speaker 2>It's soft porn though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like how they don't go full twitter.</v>

866
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why I'm glad it's soft porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But twitter,</v>

867
00:37:19.511 --> 00:37:22.600
<v Speaker 2>let's use twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can fuck me.</v>

868
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.750
<v Speaker 2>You can do whatever you want on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kinda liked that.</v>

869
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Don't be confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instagram can go there too.</v>

870
00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:30.390
<v Speaker 2>If what you have to be private is to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a private page.</v>

871
00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean nothing and then they get pulled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tumbler was really there.</v>

872
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

873
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.713
<v Speaker 2>nodding furiously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It investor and Tumbler and the growth </v>

874
00:37:39.811 --> 00:37:41.160
<v Speaker 2>was enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At one point I'm like,</v>

875
00:37:41.161 --> 00:37:42.660
<v Speaker 2>where's all this growth coming from?</v>

876
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.111
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

877
00:37:43.111 --> 00:37:43.944
<v Speaker 2>poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well what tumbler at one point in </v>

878
00:37:45.571 --> 00:37:48.780
<v Speaker 2>time became like really tormented social</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice warriors,</v>

879
00:37:48.781 --> 00:37:52.080
<v Speaker 2>making bizarre blogs that are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult for you to understand.</v>

880
00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.170
<v Speaker 2>On that note though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a very creative space.</v>

881
00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:56.910
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say was like,</v>

882
00:37:56.911 --> 00:37:57.840
<v Speaker 2>it's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>

883
00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.510
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody left is it?</v>

884
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.850
<v Speaker 2>But it's still active,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

885
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I like my space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a club,</v>

886
00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.173
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes the clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hottest club in your city still in </v>

887
00:38:09.271 --> 00:38:10.104
<v Speaker 2>business six years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like it's bridges and tunnels and </v>

888
00:38:13.201 --> 00:38:14.180
<v Speaker 2>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

889
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.023
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

890
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:15.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird bridges and tunnels that people </v>

891
00:38:18.091 --> 00:38:18.924
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What that means is they give you a </v>

892
00:38:19.321 --> 00:38:22.470
<v Speaker 2>little doing some recall for powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jersey.</v>

893
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:23.963
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

894
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.490
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting the trends,</v>

895
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.353
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why did my space go away like that </v>

896
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.900
<v Speaker 2>because the operators weren't good </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

897
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.793
<v Speaker 2>So I'll tell you what's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the trends in social and business </v>

898
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 2>digital that people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody</v>

899
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.400
<v Speaker 1>was waiting for facebook to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sucks as a beast.</v>

900
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:41.283
<v Speaker 1>He's an extremely talented all time CEO </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he was good enough if my space </v>

901
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:48.340
<v Speaker 1>was run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

902
00:38:48.341 --> 00:38:49.174
<v Speaker 1>it's sold to newscorp and so once it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>owned by the big company you talked </v>

903
00:38:52.721 --> 00:38:53.950
<v Speaker 1>about earlier today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

904
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:54.903
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to milk it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what they did with the first </v>

905
00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.100
<v Speaker 1>second?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got it.</v>

906
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.113
<v Speaker 1>They pump the shit out of their x men </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie that they owned into the platform </v>

907
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:02.733
<v Speaker 1>because the economics and the movie were</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater than the investment they </v>

908
00:39:04.721 --> 00:39:06.310
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were milking it.</v>

909
00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:07.213
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like somebody buying this and just </v>

910
00:39:09.821 --> 00:39:13.060
<v Speaker 1>pumping ungodly amounts of whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>products they thought.</v>

911
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Your audience read into the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just saturated it.</v>

912
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it weird how something gets a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stink on it and then that's kind of it.</v>

913
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:23.050
<v Speaker 1>Like no one wants to come along and try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to revamp my space.</v>

914
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:24.191
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

915
00:39:24.191 --> 00:39:27.280
<v Speaker 1>That's another interesting insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I'm dying to know</v>

916
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:30.340
<v Speaker 1>in a 15 year window is will there ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a recall?</v>

917
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Will something die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will anybody,</v>

918
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.470
<v Speaker 1>because I want to buy it to the B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two b space.</v>

919
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.140
<v Speaker 1>I want to buy a historic brand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I want to buy friendster.</v>

920
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.190
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want.</v>

921
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I just want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want the Ip,</v>

922
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:44.290
<v Speaker 1>so I think nostalgia plays so the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

923
00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:48.220
<v Speaker 1>We talk about like saved by the bell and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking the sparks and I think that</v>

924
00:39:48.221 --> 00:39:53.221
<v Speaker 1>I can buy tumbler in nine years for $40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aka $11,000,000</v>

925
00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:59.680
<v Speaker 1>and just make enough on tee shirts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids when they're 40.</v>

926
00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:00.903
<v Speaker 1>They're now 25 that were 15 year olds </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing all those weird sites because </v>

927
00:40:03.461 --> 00:40:03.971
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

928
00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:05.980
<v Speaker 1>tell him that it was the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You a good point.</v>

929
00:40:05.981 --> 00:40:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Because Jamie and I were looking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day at all the Netflix shows,</v>

930
00:40:09.011 --> 00:40:10.180
<v Speaker 1>like what's most popular?</v>

931
00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Fuller House is the most popular show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bringing everything back to him for just</v>

932
00:40:13.961 --> 00:40:17.200
<v Speaker 1>coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at 24 is going to be on Netflix now</v>

933
00:40:17.201 --> 00:40:19.690
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a Fox Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a different 24,</v>

934
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:20.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

935
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:21.603
<v Speaker 1>But I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

936
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.790
<v Speaker 1>yes they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're bringing the style.</v>

937
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

938
00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.240
<v Speaker 1>my big theory is nostalgia is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most under priced assets in the world.</v>

939
00:40:28.241 --> 00:40:30.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my entire thesis in business,</v>

940
00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.110
<v Speaker 1>so I want to buy the New York jets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a step back.</v>

941
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

942
00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to.</v>

943
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm so.</v>

944
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make it happen.</v>

945
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.493
<v Speaker 1>So the way I think I'm going to buy the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jets and the reason I built my company </v>

946
00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.360
<v Speaker 1>gonna sell friendster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

947
00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:47.613
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to go and buy Mug croupier</v>
<v Speaker 1>or animal crackers or cracker jacks or </v>

948
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:58.330
<v Speaker 1>or rainbow pops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy a brand and then market</v>

949
00:40:58.331 --> 00:40:59.164
<v Speaker 1>it like it's 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 instead of the Horse Shit TV </v>

950
00:41:01.151 --> 00:41:01.984
<v Speaker 1>commercials and fucking billboards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>print and all the bullshit that these </v>

951
00:41:04.661 --> 00:41:05.630
<v Speaker 1>companies do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

952
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm going to buy it for $130 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>

953
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:12.580
<v Speaker 1>do my thing and then resell it for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>point 3 billion by the jets,</v>

954
00:41:12.581 --> 00:41:15.010
<v Speaker 1>win super bowls and then I can die.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that you're the kind of guy </v>

959

<v Speaker 1>that you'll own the jets and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to be like crazy.</v>

962
00:41:27.911 --> 00:41:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm going to make all these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>owners seem calm.</v>

963
00:41:30.251 --> 00:41:31.084
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be like,</v>

967
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:39.044
<v Speaker 2>Genetic engineering kits to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they could just to come out with </v>

974
00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:54.123
<v Speaker 2>What was that article about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their integrating spider silk into a </v>

975
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:59.803
<v Speaker 2>human tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're grading artificial skin for </v>

976
00:42:02.151 --> 00:42:04.640
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were they going to integrate spider silk</v>

977
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.610
<v Speaker 2>into human tissue to make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>bulletproof?</v>

978
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.300
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking Rad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

979
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real thing.</v>

980
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I heard the Peter Teal and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure I'm saying this,</v>

981
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.033
<v Speaker 2>but I think till they leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is bulletproof skin made from </v>

982
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:19.400
<v Speaker 2>spider silk proteins and human skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells.</v>

983
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:21.711
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

984
00:42:21.711 --> 00:42:22.544
<v Speaker 2>this is all coming.</v>

985
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Teal,</v>

986
00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 2>but it might be some other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A mogul and silicon valley is,</v>

987
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.340
<v Speaker 2>is putting young blood in himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is him.</v>

988
00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:31.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

989
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:32.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

990
00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.000
<v Speaker 2>So is that going to work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

991
00:42:34.001 --> 00:42:36.920
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like ask him do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bullets based.</v>

992
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:40.460
<v Speaker 2>This is the theory that it's based on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget about getting like a log dick.</v>

993
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Tell me something that won't let me die </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that I will definitely do.</v>

994
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only will not let you die,</v>

995
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.860
<v Speaker 2>which is entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to extend your life,</v>

996
00:42:48.861 --> 00:42:49.694
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll give you more energy while you're </v>

997
00:42:50.931 --> 00:42:51.764
<v Speaker 2>alive now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which makes it fascinating because </v>

998
00:42:53.421 --> 00:42:55.440
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be able to do the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

999
00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.560
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about doing it tomorrow.</v>

1000
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:01.010
<v Speaker 2>I might fly up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the spider doing that too?</v>

1001
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shoot,</v>

1002
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.180
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the thing is that bullet will destroy</v>

1003
00:43:05.181 --> 00:43:05.960
<v Speaker 2>your bones.</v>

1004
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.850
<v Speaker 2>That's so they're going to have to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something with the bone.</v>

1005
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.690
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have to give you some </v>
<v Speaker 2>read Adam and tanium bones underneath,</v>

1006
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:12.583
<v Speaker 2>because like the spider silk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing gets so jacked in like four </v>

1007
00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:17.750
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he do that 100 percent?</v>

1008
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.840
<v Speaker 2>One thousand percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One million percent good.</v>

1009
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.710
<v Speaker 2>And he also does intermittent fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he drops a lot of body fat.</v>

1010
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:25.161
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1011
00:43:25.161 --> 00:43:28.310
<v Speaker 2>you get into a state of Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't eat for 14 hours.</v>

1012
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:33.200
<v Speaker 2>He pounds like low fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low carbohydrate,</v>

1013
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:34.860
<v Speaker 2>high fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high contact.</v>

1014
00:43:34.861 --> 00:43:36.410
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his body's burning fat.</v>

1015
00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.420
<v Speaker 2>He's doing tons of steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1016
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know you.</v>

1017
00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.260
<v Speaker 2>You seem like a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not shitting on you buddy.</v>

1020
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.600

<v Speaker 2>Just sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that shit.</v>

1023
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:54.223
<v Speaker 2>I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's very difficult to look the </v>

1024
00:43:56.601 --> 00:43:58.730
<v Speaker 2>way he looks without doing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

1025
00:43:58.731 --> 00:43:59.860
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult.</v>

1026
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me the other day and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1030
00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.420
<v Speaker 2>But that's the thing about like saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone does steroids,</v>

1031
00:44:08.421 --> 00:44:11.200
<v Speaker 2>it's not enough like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like he takes a pill,</v>

1032
00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.260
<v Speaker 2>a conversation that might train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started working out three years ago</v>

1033
00:44:15.261 --> 00:44:16.490
<v Speaker 2>finally taking this serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had two,</v>

<v Speaker 2>two trainers full time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They travel with me.</v>

1035
00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:20.660
<v Speaker 2>I've really gotten into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got my life damaged.</v>

1036
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.880
<v Speaker 2>How many trainers I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>

1037
00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.490
<v Speaker 2>I only have one trainer at a time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they travel with you,</v>

1038
00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:28.640
<v Speaker 2>but they travel with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was really out of shape,</v>

1039
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.863
<v Speaker 2>like come never worked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a muscle my fucking body </v>

1040
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:33.713
<v Speaker 2>three years ago.</v>

1041
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.950
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna die.</v>

1042
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.040
<v Speaker 2>This is stupid and I can afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hire.</v>

1043
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:39.263
<v Speaker 2>I'm not held accountable to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm very good at being accountable </v>

1044
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:43.320
<v Speaker 2>to others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I run good businesses.</v>

1045
00:44:43.321 --> 00:44:45.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to let the team down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I figured it out.</v>

1046
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I fucking found the binary switch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I hired somebody and they travel with</v>

1047
00:44:49.741 --> 00:44:50.930
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's so days.</v>

1048
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:54.410
<v Speaker 2>That's an awesome idea because it will </v>
<v Speaker 2>force you to work out.</v>

1049
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Both of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1050
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.760
<v Speaker 2>not with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first guy,</v>

1051
00:44:56.761 --> 00:44:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Mike is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was interesting.</v>

1052
00:44:58.831 --> 00:44:59.664
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't saying do steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was interesting to hear a </v>

1053
00:45:01.621 --> 00:45:03.240
<v Speaker 2>perspective of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peep.</v>

1054
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.750
<v Speaker 2>I've been fascinated by the steroid </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation in general.</v>

1055
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Like I think certain things become taboo</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they don't like marijuana.</v>

1056
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:12.763
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Steroids that I'm asking you because </v>

1057
00:45:13.981 --> 00:45:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you're closer to that genre </v>
<v Speaker 2>than I am.</v>

1058
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they most certainly work 100 percent.</v>

1059
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.960
<v Speaker 2>So let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go over that first.</v>

1060
00:45:21.961 --> 00:45:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Let's take it from step by step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's important.</v>

1061
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.493
<v Speaker 2>It's very important that young people </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do them and this is why because </v>

1062
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:29.184
<v Speaker 2>you ruined your endocrine system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very important that young people </v>

1063
00:45:31.891 --> 00:45:35.580
<v Speaker 2>realize that if you do get an 18 now </v>
<v Speaker 2>even into your twenties,</v>

1064
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.953
<v Speaker 2>when you do steroids and you're a young </v>
<v Speaker 2>person and you have a healthy endocrine </v>

1065
00:45:40.321 --> 00:45:41.154
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is you inject exogenous </v>

1066
00:45:43.651 --> 00:45:46.170
<v Speaker 2>steroids or exotic testosterone into </v>
<v Speaker 2>your system.</v>

1067
00:45:46.171 --> 00:45:47.004
<v Speaker 2>It shuts down your natural production of</v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone and then you're fucked </v>

1068
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:52.830
<v Speaker 2>because then when you get off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids,</v>

1069
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:53.903
<v Speaker 2>your body doesn't work right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your testicles aren't functioning </v>

1070
00:45:57.151 --> 00:46:00.750
<v Speaker 2>correctly and it takes you roughly </v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on the person and depending on</v>

1071
00:46:00.751 --> 00:46:01.820
<v Speaker 2>how you treat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>

1072
00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:05.100
<v Speaker 2>what treatments you use to kickstart </v>
<v Speaker 2>your endocrine system.</v>

1073
00:46:05.101 --> 00:46:05.934
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half the time you want to steroids to </v>

1074
00:46:07.321 --> 00:46:07.980
<v Speaker 2>recover.</v>

1075
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.500
<v Speaker 2>So if you did a two month cycle for one </v>
<v Speaker 2>month,</v>

1076
00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:12.300
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be miserable and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick's not going to work.</v>

1077
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:14.670
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very important for young people.</v>

1078
00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:16.740
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get older,</v>

1079
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:21.180
<v Speaker 2>like I'm 49 and it becomes sort of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why people do it,</v>

1080
00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:24.930
<v Speaker 2>put him in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well because it's a self esteem enabler,</v>

1081
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:26.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For a guy.</v>

1082
00:46:26.311 --> 00:46:27.144
<v Speaker 2>And if I'm a guy right now and I feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I need the muscles for the </v>

1083
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:30.960
<v Speaker 2>summertime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1084
00:46:30.961 --> 00:46:32.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go on a cycle for two </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

1085
00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a shitty fucking ma may or </v>
<v Speaker 2>April and that will be ready to roll.</v>

1086
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1087
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:41.383
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should get your blood work </v>

1088
00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:43.523
<v Speaker 2>monitored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're really considering doing </v>

1089
00:46:44.821 --> 00:46:45.654
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the most important thing is to </v>

1090
00:46:47.161 --> 00:46:51.180
<v Speaker 2>do very little to do just a small amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>and give yourself a little boost.</v>

1091
00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:52.283
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to go fucking hog wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>and take some Androgel 50 and turn into </v>

1092
00:46:55.471 --> 00:46:56.304
<v Speaker 2>a fucking gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to do that because it's </v>

1093
00:46:57.841 --> 00:47:00.240
<v Speaker 2>too much of a shock to your system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

1094
00:47:00.241 --> 00:47:01.800
<v Speaker 2>when you're in your forties like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1095
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:02.903
<v Speaker 2>then testosterone replacement therapy </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes a very viable alternative </v>

1096
00:47:06.091 --> 00:47:09.240
<v Speaker 2>because your body is just simply not </v>
<v Speaker 2>producing testosterone correctly.</v>

1097
00:47:09.241 --> 00:47:10.074
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we use gorilla because I just got </v>

1098
00:47:11.131 --> 00:47:11.800
<v Speaker 2>excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could.</v>

1099
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.610
<v Speaker 2>You could kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could still take some time,</v>

1100
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.320
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Hugh Jackman thing,</v>

1101
00:47:16.321 --> 00:47:19.740
<v Speaker 2>because when I get back to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that motherfucker works hard.</v>

1102
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.800
<v Speaker 2>There is no way you look like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you work hard,</v>

1103
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:25.170
<v Speaker 2>so you have to do like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1104
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:28.440
<v Speaker 2>really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to do fucking heavy dead lifts,</v>

1105
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.120
<v Speaker 2>heavy squats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to shock your system.</v>

1106
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:33.760
<v Speaker 2>You're got to get your body to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1107
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:38.980
<v Speaker 2>This crazy asshole wants to carry around</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic amounts of weight.</v>

1108
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:39.814
<v Speaker 2>We're fighting against gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to incorporate all of our </v>

1109
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body does not want to use resources</v>

1110
00:47:44.411 --> 00:47:45.580
<v Speaker 2>to get bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't.</v>

1111
00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:46.414
<v Speaker 2>It resists it because it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not healthy and it's not a smart </v>

1112
00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:52.270
<v Speaker 2>survival tactic like for your body to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put on all this meat.</v>

1113
00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:53.283
<v Speaker 2>Then all that meet needs fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your body's not totally convinced </v>

1114
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:58.990
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have this fuel because </v>
<v Speaker 2>for thousands and thousands of years,</v>

1115
00:47:58.991 --> 00:48:00.940
<v Speaker 2>food was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to come by.</v>

1116
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:05.620
<v Speaker 2>So for your body to be convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing this all the time,</v>

1117
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:10.360
<v Speaker 2>we need this extra mass like you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have massive amounts of food and massive</v>

1118
00:48:10.361 --> 00:48:13.180
<v Speaker 2>amounts of work that's hugely important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then steroids,</v>

1119
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.313
<v Speaker 2>those things too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more important than steroids is </v>

1120
00:48:16.901 --> 00:48:20.710
<v Speaker 2>balancing your diet out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure your nutrient levels are all</v>

1121
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.430
<v Speaker 2>consistent.</v>

1122
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:22.263
<v Speaker 2>They're all healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have the proper amount of </v>

1123
00:48:24.311 --> 00:48:26.230
<v Speaker 2>vitamin B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vitamin D,</v>

1124
00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:29.920
<v Speaker 2>All these different essential nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essential fatty acids,</v>

1125
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:30.903
<v Speaker 2>all the proper amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a steroid is just a bandaid on an </v>

1126
00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:38.890
<v Speaker 2>account a least five days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least five days a week.</v>

1127
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie runs a lot.</v>

1128
00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:45.160

<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1129
00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:47.830

<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of different shit.</v>

1130

<v Speaker 2>miles right now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1133

<v Speaker 2>When you were at your peak of running,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1137
00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:01.493
<v Speaker 2>that's back to basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just put up a post so I didn't let my </v>

1138
00:49:04.361 --> 00:49:05.194
<v Speaker 2>brother Aja score on me and he's 11 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years younger than me until he was like </v>

1139

<v Speaker 2>15 score score.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't let them know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's got a Zander,</v>

1142

<v Speaker 2>my little guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a weird condition when he picks</v>

1143

00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:32.614
<v Speaker 2>watch everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody's in these fucking </v>

1147
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:34.743
<v Speaker 2>eighth place trophies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill people like all this </v>

1148
00:49:37.001 --> 00:49:37.834
<v Speaker 2>fucking infrastructure of fake fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>self esteem and then these kids go into </v>

1149
00:49:40.751 --> 00:49:43.510
<v Speaker 2>the market and they get punched in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth and they don't know what to do.</v>

1150
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:45.760
<v Speaker 2>So you don't let your kids score and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>either know.</v>

1151
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.600
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will not let I'm,</v>

1152
00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:50.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking gonna.</v>

1153
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:52.780
<v Speaker 2>Beat the like until he could win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he's good.</v>

1154
00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:53.320
<v Speaker 2>Like age.</v>

1155
00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:57.790
<v Speaker 2>My brother has a better basketball </v>
<v Speaker 2>player than me because I didn't let him.</v>

1156
00:49:57.791 --> 00:49:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1157
00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:00.160
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to let people score </v>
<v Speaker 2>for?</v>

1158
00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:03.310
<v Speaker 2>That's a very interesting perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you mine,</v>

1159
00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:04.570
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1160
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:05.583
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should ever be very </v>

1161
00:50:07.151 --> 00:50:09.790
<v Speaker 2>competitive with people who are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive with you.</v>

1162
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.310
<v Speaker 2>So here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An interesting thing.</v>

1163
00:50:12.311 --> 00:50:15.310
<v Speaker 2>When I do Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a black belt in Jujitsu,</v>

1164
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu with a white belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I treat them very kindly.</v>

1165
00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:20.980
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might tap them out a little bit,</v>

1166
00:50:20.981 --> 00:50:21.814
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I roll with them the way </v>

1167
00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:24.580
<v Speaker 2>I roll with another black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1168
00:50:24.581 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 2>that's fighting in that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>

1169
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:29.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not a statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a game.</v>

1170
00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:32.660
<v Speaker 2>The game respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what like when,</v>

1171
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.150
<v Speaker 2>like if I'm rolling with someone and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making mistakes,</v>

1172
00:50:35.151 --> 00:50:37.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll correct their mistakes if I want it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1173
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.440
<v Speaker 2>If I'm wrong with someone who's a white </v>
<v Speaker 2>belt,</v>

1174
00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.920
<v Speaker 2>I could just cut right through them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just keep cutting right through them.</v>

1175
00:50:42.921 --> 00:50:43.754
<v Speaker 2>But you know what you do with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you discourage people from doing it and </v>

1176
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:50.300
<v Speaker 2>it's not really fair because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting anything out of it either.</v>

1177
00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:51.163
<v Speaker 2>All you're getting out of you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>practicing like a grappling dummy and </v>

1178
00:50:53.481 --> 00:50:55.820
<v Speaker 2>like occasionally maybe that's a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to do.</v>

1179
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.360
<v Speaker 2>I feel like once you get into the blue </v>
<v Speaker 2>belt and purple belt range,</v>

1180
00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:02.810
<v Speaker 2>then I'm going to go with you 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent because when you're dealing with</v>

1181
00:51:02.811 --> 00:51:05.120
<v Speaker 2>someone who's not really competitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you,</v>

1182
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:06.523
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting anything out of it </v>

1183
00:51:08.631 --> 00:51:09.770
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1184
00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an interesting perspective.</v>

1185
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:16.390
<v Speaker 2>So what you really lovely like kids kick</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit out of me.</v>

1186
00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:19.370
<v Speaker 2>I have an eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone martial arts?</v>

1187
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:20.880
<v Speaker 2>I have an eight year old and she's.</v>

1188
00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:23.450
<v Speaker 2>She's allowed to punch me and kick me </v>
<v Speaker 2>full blast.</v>

1189
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:25.550
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't kick the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:51:25.551 --> 00:51:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's 50 pounds,</v>

1191
00:51:27.711 --> 00:51:31.130
<v Speaker 2>but she leg kicks me full blast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't ever hit her back.</v>

1192
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:32.910
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she sets up leg kicks,</v>

1193
00:51:32.911 --> 00:51:33.744
<v Speaker 2>she throws a left hook to the body and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then she comes around with that right </v>

1194
00:51:35.241 --> 00:51:36.500
<v Speaker 2>leg kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>WHAP whap.</v>

1195
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:39.080
<v Speaker 2>And as long you mean she's allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit me full blast.</v>

1196
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:40.880
<v Speaker 2>So like she'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll go,</v>

1197
00:51:40.881 --> 00:51:41.714
<v Speaker 2>can I hit you on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1198
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:46.750
<v Speaker 2>go ahead and she'll just tee off on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it gets her used to doing it now if I</v>

1199
00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:48.710
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time she went to do that,</v>

1200
00:51:48.711 --> 00:51:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I checked it and it hurt her shin or </v>
<v Speaker 2>punched her in the face.</v>

1201
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:53.203
<v Speaker 2>Well then she's going to have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental block in her head that she's not </v>

1202
00:51:55.461 --> 00:51:58.340
<v Speaker 2>gonna be able to overcome one day she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get to be,</v>

1203
00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:00.950
<v Speaker 2>get to a point where I can light spar </v>
<v Speaker 2>with her.</v>

1204
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:01.881
<v Speaker 2>She's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1205
00:52:01.881 --> 00:52:05.120
<v Speaker 2>I do think maybe she'll get there some </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain games play out differently.</v>

1206
00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean fun.</v>

1207
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not letting my seven year old </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter score basket either.</v>

1208
00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I probably wouldn't punch her in the</v>

1209
00:52:11.601 --> 00:52:12.434
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1210
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:13.230
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1211
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:14.760
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not letting her beat me in.</v>

1212
00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even letting her know.</v>

1213
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.863
<v Speaker 2>That's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't like snap her neck or rip your </v>

1214
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:22.750
<v Speaker 2>throat out like yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what I do is like say like,</v>

1215
00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.040
<v Speaker 2>here's another example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I'm rolling with a girl,</v>

1216
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:26.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a man is doing Jujitsu with a </v>

1217
00:52:28.221 --> 00:52:28.770
<v Speaker 2>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1218
00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:29.603
<v Speaker 2>If you're going full blast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting anything out of it </v>

1219
00:52:32.061 --> 00:52:32.894
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I do is if I'm sparring with a </v>

1220
00:52:34.611 --> 00:52:35.444
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pretend that I'm only as strong as </v>

1221
00:52:37.431 --> 00:52:39.470
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if they're pushing against me instead</v>

1222
00:52:39.471 --> 00:52:42.770
<v Speaker 2>of going the fuck out of here and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>locking down and you know,</v>

1223
00:52:42.771 --> 00:52:46.670
<v Speaker 2>and giving them the full chimpanzee </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength I give,</v>

1224
00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:47.780
<v Speaker 2>I give with things.</v>

1225
00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:48.613
<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to allow my body to use </v>

1226
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:51.960
<v Speaker 2>full blast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

1227
00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:52.813
<v Speaker 2>So as they push I just give in and try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to use technique and find a better way </v>

1228
00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:56.970
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1229
00:52:56.970 --> 00:52:58.640
<v Speaker 2>I just try it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll try to go with it,</v>

1230
00:52:59.090 --> 00:52:59.923
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1231
00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.660
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I let them score on me in that sense.</v>

1232
00:53:02.661 --> 00:53:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll let them get side control on </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1233
00:53:04.251 --> 00:53:06.140
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll hit escape and try to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in,</v>

1234
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:09.830
<v Speaker 2>but everything I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do with almost no strength.</v>

1235
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I just move my own body away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would tap them out in four seconds.</v>

1236
00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.440
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

1237
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:18.343
<v Speaker 2>Probably wouldn't by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because 99 percent of you don't </v>

1238
00:53:20.841 --> 00:53:22.850
<v Speaker 2>know me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have done it at all.</v>

1239
00:53:22.851 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I would've never even got in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that thing.</v>

1240
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:26.963
<v Speaker 2>But if you did know that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe you'd probably have a </v>

1241
00:53:28.321 --> 00:53:29.220
<v Speaker 2>different opinion on it.</v>

1242
00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I mean by that thing is if I like,</v>

1243
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:34.523
<v Speaker 2>I'm either going to go in there and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>let the guy score or what would have </v>

1244
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:39.390
<v Speaker 2>mostly likely happened is I wouldn't go </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the ring.</v>

1245
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.960
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that ring is at all in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>

1246
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to discourage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1247
00:53:44.611 --> 00:53:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like.</v>

1248
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:47.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that when you're playing </v>

1249
00:53:47.491 --> 00:53:49.830
<v Speaker 2>basketball and you're playing basketball</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a small person,</v>

1250
00:53:49.831 --> 00:53:50.664
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't move as good as you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to blow them out of just </v>

1251
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:58.110
<v Speaker 2>knocking them by slamming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slamming shit.</v>

1252
00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:00.363
<v Speaker 2>Put it if I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I can win 11 nothing and remind </v>

1253
00:54:03.361 --> 00:54:05.400
<v Speaker 2>them for the rest of their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in that.</v>

1254
00:54:05.401 --> 00:54:06.240
<v Speaker 2>So fine.</v>

1255
00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:11.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what else to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand what you're saying.</v>

1256
00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did the competition.</v>

1257
00:54:12.631 --> 00:54:13.770
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it.</v>

1258
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.753
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think there's two ways to build </v>

1259
00:54:16.501 --> 00:54:18.000
<v Speaker 2>the biggest building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1260
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:21.720
<v Speaker 2>just build the biggest building or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tear everybody else's.</v>

1261
00:54:21.721 --> 00:54:22.554
<v Speaker 2>Building down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No interest in hearing other people's </v>

1262
00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:26.213
<v Speaker 2>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I fucking build the biggest </v>

1263
00:54:27.241 --> 00:54:28.074
<v Speaker 2>building I'm letting you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the same way that you should let me </v>

1264
00:54:30.271 --> 00:54:34.110
<v Speaker 2>know I'm not gonna cry about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love the game.</v>

1265
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:35.063
<v Speaker 2>That's why I love business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the one place you can do that </v>

1266
00:54:36.121 --> 00:54:37.560
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>

1267
00:54:37.561 --> 00:54:38.394
<v Speaker 2>but I just feel like physical things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that becomes a very to a different </v>

1268
00:54:41.761 --> 00:54:43.720
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in rings and that gets into it.</v>

1269
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in basketball,</v>

1270
00:54:44.971 --> 00:54:45.804
<v Speaker 2>like you run faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll feel very comfortable shutting </v>

1271
00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:50.910
<v Speaker 2>out my seven year old daughter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball,</v>

1272
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:53.980
<v Speaker 2>but I'm completely not comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>punching so you know.</v>

1273
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.750
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1274
00:54:55.751 --> 00:54:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Let's let her score,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1275
00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Let her let her sneak through a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

1276
00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:01.040
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the paper view of Mcgregor </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mayweather?</v>

1277
00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:03.690
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be because it's not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a debate anymore.</v>

1278
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:05.063
<v Speaker 2>Hundred percent going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that 100 percent </v>

1279
00:55:06.271 --> 00:55:07.104
<v Speaker 2>gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1280
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Putting it on tape right now might not </v>
<v Speaker 2>be right.</v>

1281
00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>

1282
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1283
00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.173
<v Speaker 2>Either build the biggest building or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I will have a nice little exchange </v>

1284
00:55:14.881 --> 00:55:16.260
<v Speaker 2>in 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will.</v>

1285
00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:18.180
<v Speaker 2>You'll make fun of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll know you're close as clip.</v>

1286
00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:19.100
<v Speaker 2>It's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1287
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:19.943
<v Speaker 2>I would say doing everything they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you looked at it as in terms of a </v>

1288
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:25.350
<v Speaker 2>zero percent chance to 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>number,</v>

1289
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.860
<v Speaker 2>I think we're in the seventies in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies or eighties,</v>

1290
00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:30.780
<v Speaker 2>clarify because I think that's where </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brad as well.</v>

1291
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:34.980
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a significant legal </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurdle to overcome with the UFC and they</v>

1292
00:55:34.981 --> 00:55:35.520
<v Speaker 2>might not.</v>

1293
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Might not overcome that depending on how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they play that card.</v>

1294
00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:40.470
<v Speaker 2>This is my opinion on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1295
00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor has publicly stated that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes because of the Ali Act,</v>

1296
00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:47.790
<v Speaker 2>he can compete in boxing and not do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the UFC,</v>

1297
00:55:47.791 --> 00:55:52.050
<v Speaker 2>but he wants everything to be smooth so </v>
<v Speaker 2>he would rather have the UFC involved,</v>

1298
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:56.250
<v Speaker 2>but he also wants the UFC to recognize </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he says is their place,</v>

1299
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:59.750
<v Speaker 2>so there's mayweather productions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC and mcgregor productions,</v>

1300
00:55:59.751 --> 00:56:00.584
<v Speaker 2>so this is what he's promotions rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is what he is stating now he's </v>

1301
00:56:04.471 --> 00:56:05.304
<v Speaker 2>going to be a partner in the promotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's going to be some sort of </v>

1302
00:56:09.071 --> 00:56:09.904
<v Speaker 2>a negotiation for how things are split </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in three ways and then the question </v>

1303
00:56:12.871 --> 00:56:16.710
<v Speaker 2>becomes can can they work that out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1304
00:56:16.711 --> 00:56:17.544
<v Speaker 2>If they can work that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes a question of should </v>

1305
00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:21.294
<v Speaker 2>they do it and will it be competitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and is it good for their brand and </v>

1306
00:56:24.191 --> 00:56:26.040
<v Speaker 2>that's where they might have a debate on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1307
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:26.913
<v Speaker 2>I think what's gonna end up happening is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economics are going to be so big </v>

1308
00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:32.320
<v Speaker 2>that it's going to override the brand </v>
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>

1309
00:56:32.321 --> 00:56:34.240
<v Speaker 2>The the math is just going to be too </v>
<v Speaker 2>big.</v>

1310
00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.250
<v Speaker 2>It's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mcgregor so big.</v>

1311
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.710
<v Speaker 2>The economics of him fighting and MMA </v>
<v Speaker 2>like see,</v>

1312
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:41.140
<v Speaker 2>look at it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he fights mayweather,</v>

1313
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe there'll be 4 million pay per view</v>
<v Speaker 2>buys.</v>

1314
00:56:43.991 --> 00:56:45.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was packed.</v>

1315
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:48.250
<v Speaker 2>What was Pacquiao mayweather before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it,</v>

1316
00:56:48.251 --> 00:56:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four and a half or something.</v>

1317
00:56:49.601 --> 00:56:51.310
<v Speaker 2>We looked at it the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just Google it.</v>

1318
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Google it real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like four and a half.</v>

1319
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:55.200
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the biggest of all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four point six,</v>

1320
00:56:55.201 --> 00:56:56.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it a four point six?</v>

1321
00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.480
<v Speaker 2>I think was the biggest of all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1322
00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:00.670
<v Speaker 2>we'll find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the biggest of all time.</v>

1323
00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:03.070
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

1324
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:05.380
<v Speaker 2>that those numbers though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the deal.</v>

1325
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor can do those numbers over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>course of three fights.</v>

1326
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:13.120
<v Speaker 2>So is that a 44 point six?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So four point 6 million papers using now</v>

1327
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:17.410
<v Speaker 2>mcgregor has done one point five for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nate Diaz rematch.</v>

1328
00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.940
<v Speaker 2>One point three for Eddie Alvarez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some.</v>

1329
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere around those range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that right there,</v>

1330
00:57:22.271 --> 00:57:23.104
<v Speaker 2>just those two together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A roughly $3 million pay per views for </v>

1331
00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:27.900
<v Speaker 2>to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He making notes.</v>

1332
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck load.</v>

1333
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:29.803
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1334
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:30.753
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to make the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not as not the same money he </v>

1335
00:57:32.651 --> 00:57:33.980
<v Speaker 2>would make as a co promoter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1336
00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:35.013
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if he loses in a bat in a boxing </v>

1337
00:57:37.271 --> 00:57:40.090
<v Speaker 2>match,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so simple for him to say,</v>

1338
00:57:40.091 --> 00:57:42.820
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I do and go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1339
00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:43.853
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>MMA,</v>

1340
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:46.750
<v Speaker 2>the not even remotely close to you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not enough to be dangerous here,</v>

1341
00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:48.160
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what I understand,</v>

1342
00:57:48.161 --> 00:57:49.210
<v Speaker 2>I've done a little homework.</v>

1343
00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:51.310
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have a lot of great natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

1344
00:57:51.311 --> 00:57:53.650
<v Speaker 2>He's a third fight with Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great natural fights.</v>

1345
00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:55.810
<v Speaker 2>These next three fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a bunch.</v>

1346
00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:58.240
<v Speaker 2>So help me understand what like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1347
00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:01.870
<v Speaker 2>that's why I'm setting it up for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from a financial standpoint,</v>

1348
00:58:01.871 --> 00:58:03.130
<v Speaker 2>from what the fans want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1349
00:58:03.131 --> 00:58:06.190
<v Speaker 2>The champions underneath of it seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's fought several of them.</v>

1350
00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:08.290
<v Speaker 2>He's one those pretty glaringly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

1351
00:58:08.291 --> 00:58:10.470
<v Speaker 2>What's the boy when the Nate Diaz fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>glaring?</v>

1352
00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.870
<v Speaker 2>The first one on the second one was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very close decision.</v>

1353
00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean the other new ideas is the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>one is the big one.</v>

1354
00:58:18.581 --> 00:58:21.520
<v Speaker 2>So that one brings in close to 2 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay per view buys.</v>

1355
00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grieve ds three,</v>

1356
00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:26.170
<v Speaker 2>one point three and one point two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one point five,</v>

1357
00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:30.030
<v Speaker 2>one point five and one point three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three for Eddie Alvarez where he won his</v>

1358
00:58:30.031 --> 00:58:31.150
<v Speaker 2>second world title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1359
00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:32.253
<v Speaker 2>The other one is tyron woodley or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever wins the tyron woodley versus </v>

1360
00:58:35.471 --> 00:58:38.620
<v Speaker 2>Stephen Wonderboy Thompson rematch for </v>
<v Speaker 2>170 pound title.</v>

1361
00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:42.460
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting fight too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if it goes up and and challenges</v>

1362
00:58:42.461 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 2>at one 70 and winds that Jesus fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ,</v>

1363
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:49.060
<v Speaker 2>now he's through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's the biggest star in sports.</v>

1364
00:58:49.061 --> 00:58:54.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean he becomes this gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge global worldwide phenomenon that's,</v>

1365
00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.300
<v Speaker 2>that's entirely inside the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>

1366
00:58:58.450 --> 00:58:59.283
<v Speaker 2>Now he's not favored in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets 170 pound champion because the </v>

1367
00:59:01.991 --> 00:59:04.020
<v Speaker 2>guys are bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're faster or they're,</v>

1368
00:59:04.021 --> 00:59:05.230
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're stronger rather.</v>

1369
00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:07.870
<v Speaker 2>But he's fast as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really clever.</v>

1370
00:59:07.871 --> 00:59:10.330
<v Speaker 2>He's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way he approached his fights,</v>

1371
00:59:10.331 --> 00:59:11.164
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very intelligent and it's not </v>

1372
00:59:13.271 --> 00:59:14.104
<v Speaker 2>outside the realm of possibility that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>could beat someone at 170 pounds that's </v>

1373
00:59:17.861 --> 00:59:19.270
<v Speaker 2>holding the world title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever that is.</v>

1374
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:22.770
<v Speaker 2>So that's a big fight too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that could also with him attached to</v>

1375
00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:27.290
<v Speaker 2>bring in one point five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 2 million pay per view buys.</v>

1376
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:28.243
<v Speaker 2>So what you're talking about is in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of fights he could make what he </v>

1377
00:59:30.921 --> 00:59:34.160
<v Speaker 2>could make in that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Floyd mayweather fight.</v>

1378
00:59:34.161 --> 00:59:37.280
<v Speaker 2>He wants to be a global icon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>

1379
00:59:37.281 --> 00:59:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Anything he does in just MMA trumps that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1380
00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:41.751
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1381
00:59:41.751 --> 00:59:42.510
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

1382
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:46.670
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a short sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It transcends the sport also.</v>

1383
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:47.563
<v Speaker 2>It's a really good match for him because</v>
<v Speaker 2>mayweather doesn't really knock people </v>

1384
00:59:50.511 --> 00:59:53.030
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he knocked out Victor Ortiz,</v>

1385
00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Ortiz had his hands down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1386
00:59:55.251 --> 00:59:57.260
<v Speaker 2>He fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He headbutted him and then he was trying</v>

1387
00:59:57.261 --> 00:59:59.090
<v Speaker 2>to apologize and then may whether the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaotic.</v>

1388
00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:01.160
<v Speaker 2>But that was a different sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>scenario.</v>

1389
01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last guy,</v>

1390
01:00:02.511 --> 01:00:05.480
<v Speaker 2>I believe he stopped as Ricky Hatton and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he stumped.</v>

1391
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 or 12.</v>

1392
01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by the way,</v>

1393
01:00:09.081 --> 01:00:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Ricky Hatton is like half the size of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conor mcgregor.</v>

1394
01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Conor mcgregor is a big guy.</v>

1395
01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.020
<v Speaker 2>He's tall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's five,</v>

1396
01:00:15.021 --> 01:00:17.600
<v Speaker 2>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's broad shouldered and he fights.</v>

1397
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:19.850
<v Speaker 2>He can fight easily at one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1398
01:00:19.851 --> 01:00:24.770
<v Speaker 2>he cuts weight down to 1:55.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a fairly healthy manner.</v>

1399
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Very unhealthy for him to get down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>1:45,</v>

1400
01:00:27.111 --> 01:00:28.760
<v Speaker 2>but he has done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they fight,</v>

1401
01:00:28.761 --> 01:00:31.820
<v Speaker 2>I assume they're going to fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in 155 pound range.</v>

1402
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Connor will be significantly bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody floyd's ever fought before.</v>

1403
01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:39.230
<v Speaker 2>What was your favorite sport growing up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martial arts growing up?</v>

1404
01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1405
01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

1406
01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.333
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't definitely that Chuck </v>

1407
01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Norris Movies got me into it times for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1408
01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was that,</v>

1409
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:56.710
<v Speaker 2>but there was also the finality of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and also finish him.</v>

1410
01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it was just,</v>

1411
01:00:57.921 --> 01:01:01.110
<v Speaker 2>it was so real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it didn't matter to me anymore.</v>

1412
01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Have a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

1413
01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:03.533
<v Speaker 2>The hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously a mortal Kombat the guy right </v>

1414
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:09.760
<v Speaker 2>next to the guy had the hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sliced you with the hat.</v>

1415
01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:10.623
<v Speaker 2>Random.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's slice to mortal Kombat three </v>

1416
01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:14.610
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1417
01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:18.140
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it was so much more dangerous.</v>

1418
01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.010
<v Speaker 2>It was so much more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much more on the line.</v>

1419
01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Or you'll fight fan like a boxing fan </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1420
01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:24.913
<v Speaker 2>I've always described martial arts as </v>
<v Speaker 2>high level problem solving with dire </v>

1421
01:01:29.211 --> 01:01:31.520
<v Speaker 2>physical consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I looked at it.</v>

1422
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:32.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1423
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:33.103
<v Speaker 2>it's also your problem solving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who's improvising in the moment </v>

1424
01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.473
<v Speaker 2>with like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's such a psychological factor </v>

1425
01:01:40.911 --> 01:01:42.640
<v Speaker 2>in why you like stand up to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:44.800
<v Speaker 2>It's how I think about keynotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what.</v>

1427
01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:45.973
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons I think my speaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>career has gone so well is I'm reverse </v>

1428
01:01:48.351 --> 01:01:51.020
<v Speaker 2>engineering the crowd in realtime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>

1429
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm literally give them the talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1430
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:54.463
<v Speaker 2>Feeding off the reactions and navigating</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an Improv manner on my business </v>

1431
01:01:58.731 --> 01:01:59.980
<v Speaker 2>content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1432
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:01.063
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have a clear outline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a clear outline for the first </v>

1433
01:02:04.131 --> 01:02:06.770
<v Speaker 2>seven minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I already gave you that spiel.</v>

1434
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I like to frame up my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an immigrant,</v>

1435
01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.590
<v Speaker 2>made that little Schpeel I already gave </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1436
01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.753
<v Speaker 2>That's all I've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I basically go into the state </v>

1437
01:02:16.311 --> 01:02:17.360
<v Speaker 2>of the union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1438
01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 2>So now if you're going to give a speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going to give</v>

1439
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>one of these keynotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your objective?</v>

1440
01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:23.004
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you trying to accomplish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing that leg brand </v>

1441
01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>legacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legacy.</v>

1442
01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:27.913
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I talk about stuff that most people </v>

1443
01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:30.324
<v Speaker 1>think is coming and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually here and they don't think it's </v>

1444
01:02:33.511 --> 01:02:34.344
<v Speaker 1>real anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a futurist or a or a destructor and </v>

1445
01:02:37.351 --> 01:02:38.184
<v Speaker 1>so I'll go and talk about instagram and </v>
<v Speaker 1>why I think people can go from zero to </v>

1446
01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>$100 million in their business in seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>years or from zero to $100,000.</v>

1447
01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>So the amount of people listening right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now that are making $81,000</v>

1448
01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>a year doing something they hate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could make $80,000</v>

1449
01:02:55.681 --> 01:02:56.514
<v Speaker 1>a year on instagram either selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>something or slowly but surely building </v>

1450
01:03:00.601 --> 01:03:04.980
<v Speaker 1>their brand and then doing content deals</v>
<v Speaker 1>is staggeringly practical.</v>

1451
01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:07.800
<v Speaker 1>How do people make money on instagram?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't make any money.</v>

1452
01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:11.040
<v Speaker 1>I have one point 8 million instagram </v>
<v Speaker 1>followers have made zero sense.</v>

1453
01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:11.903
<v Speaker 1>The way people make money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way people make money is always the </v>

1454
01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:16.374
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would argue you do make money </v>

1455
01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:18.683
<v Speaker 1>because you're using a chest move </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of transacting just on that </v>

1456
01:03:22.261 --> 01:03:23.094
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a platform where you create </v>

1457
01:03:24.961 --> 01:03:25.794
<v Speaker 1>reach and awareness that drives towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>things of this nature and then you </v>

1458
01:03:28.891 --> 01:03:29.724
<v Speaker 1>either sell advertising or get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>business development where you have </v>

1459
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.983
<v Speaker 1>pieces of equity in businesses that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>build through the attention people sell </v>

1460
01:03:37.111 --> 01:03:37.944
<v Speaker 1>against the tension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So either you're doing commercials or </v>

1461
01:03:40.201 --> 01:03:42.540
<v Speaker 1>you're doing step two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you're building brand,</v>

1462
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:43.793
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one thing I've never done is I've </v>

1463
01:03:44.461 --> 01:03:47.970
<v Speaker 1>never been paid ever for a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>content I put out on social,</v>

1464
01:03:47.971 --> 01:03:49.740
<v Speaker 1>which is the majority of how people get </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid,</v>

1465
01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:50.963
<v Speaker 1>but I get paid $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give a speech and I've done that </v>

1466
01:03:55.261 --> 01:03:56.094
<v Speaker 1>because of the attention and awareness </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've been able to build on those </v>

1467
01:03:58.591 --> 01:03:58.970
<v Speaker 1>platforms.</v>

1468
01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Every book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

1469
01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches,</v>

1470
01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:02.693
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck all this posts and pictures of my </v>

1471
01:04:04.921 --> 01:04:07.820
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do I think.</v>

1472
01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>

1473
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:09.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could sell stuff right now I'm </v>

1474
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.930
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with people buying and selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1475
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is scary.</v>

1476
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:17.453
<v Speaker 1>Scary how much money can be made if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to thrift stores and Marshall's and </v>

1477
01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:25.350
<v Speaker 1>dollar stores and garage sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Flip Shit on craigslist.</v>

1478
01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Ebay let go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1479
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:32.250
<v Speaker 1>And I mean real economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people go to thrift stores,</v>

1480
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.020
<v Speaker 1>they buy a bunch of vintage clothes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they go on craigslist.</v>

1481
01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:36.893
<v Speaker 1>It's even scarier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that you have a phone and you get </v>

<v Speaker 2>that thinking.</v>

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.473
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand because then I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna think about it and that's very </v>

1570
01:08:19.731 --> 01:08:20.564
<v Speaker 2>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thoughts and having that resource </v>

1571
01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:26.210
<v Speaker 2>occupied by anything that in is you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something,</v>

1572
01:08:26.211 --> 01:08:29.810
<v Speaker 2>they're leveraging your name and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're associated with it and you've got</v>

1573
01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:31.190
<v Speaker 2>and you care about your name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1574
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:33.300

01:08:33.301 --> 01:08:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Even if my name wasn't associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1576
01:08:35.271 --> 01:08:36.760
<v Speaker 2>if it was just they were just using my </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

1577
01:08:36.761 --> 01:08:37.594
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to think like I have a </v>

1578
01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:40.820
<v Speaker 2>limit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's honestly what you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you talk about,</v>

1596
01:09:26.451 --> 01:09:27.284
<v Speaker 2>but not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been following you for the </v>

1597
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:29.383
<v Speaker 2>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been following you since you run </v>

1598
01:09:29.650 --> 01:09:31.220
<v Speaker 2>diggnation a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1599
01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.113
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's the first person to tell me </v>

1600
01:09:32.811 --> 01:09:33.644
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You initially talked to you about about </v>

1601
01:09:35.451 --> 01:09:36.284
<v Speaker 2>him too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like twice and then I got an email from </v>

1602
01:09:37.651 --> 01:09:41.420
<v Speaker 2>your guy like serendipitous asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a content and different things.</v>

1603
01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:42.373
<v Speaker 2>Pattern recognition to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to figure out all this </v>

1604
01:09:43.851 --> 01:09:46.730
<v Speaker 2>stuff almost because I was five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years ago.</v>

1605
01:09:46.731 --> 01:09:49.040
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be Zuckerberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram,</v>

1606
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:51.350
<v Speaker 2>all of that stuff and I know now it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not there.</v>

1607
01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing a different job and you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting about that?</v>

1608
01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.673
<v Speaker 2>The thing that has really come to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top and my content that's really also </v>

1609
01:09:58.731 --> 01:10:00.170
<v Speaker 2>helping people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Self awareness.</v>

1610
01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.240
<v Speaker 2>One thing I'm enjoying listening to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1611
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy really like you can just like a</v>

1612
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:06.830
<v Speaker 2>martial art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been really interesting.</v>

1613
01:10:06.831 --> 01:10:08.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting here kind of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1614
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.983
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some real self awareness going </v>

1615
01:10:10.131 --> 01:10:10.964
<v Speaker 2>on here and even just thinking about you</v>
<v Speaker 2>now saying that I wish I could figure </v>

1616
01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.233
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about drug to make your Dick </v>

1617
01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.113
<v Speaker 2>Bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I could give somebody a pill that </v>

1618
01:10:18.831 --> 01:10:20.750
<v Speaker 2>would allow them to deploy self </v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness,</v>

1619
01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:21.763
<v Speaker 2>the amount of happiness that would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in this world would be </v>

1620
01:10:24.081 --> 01:10:26.120
<v Speaker 2>tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I I understand that.</v>

1621
01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:26.954
<v Speaker 2>I can give them a solution struggle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>overcoming obstacles and very difficult </v>

1622
01:10:31.581 --> 01:10:32.414
<v Speaker 2>problems to solve problem solving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's through martial arts or </v>

1623
01:10:35.391 --> 01:10:39.410
<v Speaker 2>even through complicated things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't seem complicated like yoga,</v>

1624
01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:43.070
<v Speaker 2>very difficult tasks teach you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

1625
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Those things teach you about personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness.</v>

1626
01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Let's let's take a step back amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that when they do that and fail,</v>

1627
01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:52.543
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide to spend all their fucking time </v>

1628
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:58.550
<v Speaker 2>on pondering and blaming is unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

1629
01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a problem with the way their</v>

1630
01:11:00.471 --> 01:11:03.770
<v Speaker 2>mind is structured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just consciousness structuring.</v>

1631
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.633
<v Speaker 2>Hence why I'm interested in that self </v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness pill and slash or populating </v>

1632
01:11:09.051 --> 01:11:12.860
<v Speaker 2>this conversation to the top because </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start caring about what you are</v>

1633
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:15.840
<v Speaker 2>versus what you're not good shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

1634
01:11:15.890 --> 01:11:17.400
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1635
01:11:17.401 --> 01:11:18.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1636
01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:19.344
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume when I think about Larry </v>

1637
01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:23.493
<v Speaker 2>Holmes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had a conversation once about </v>

1638
01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.830
<v Speaker 2>like how the Jab that he was deceased in</v>
<v Speaker 2>assassin.</v>

1639
01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:29.603
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting when you start </v>

1640
01:11:30.691 --> 01:11:31.524
<v Speaker 2>tripling down in your strengths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you have to round yourself </v>

1641
01:11:33.211 --> 01:11:34.470
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to get exposed,</v>

1642
01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:35.513
<v Speaker 2>especially in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's so multidimensional that </v>

1643
01:11:37.591 --> 01:11:38.390
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1644
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:39.600
<v Speaker 2>that it becomes a vulnerability.</v>

1645
01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:40.463
<v Speaker 2>But fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm big on tripling down on people's </v>

1646
01:11:42.901 --> 01:11:43.640
<v Speaker 2>strengths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1647
01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.221
<v Speaker 2>it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1648
01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:45.054
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the interesting things about mma </v>

1649
01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:46.734
<v Speaker 2>is people that you call specialists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a few people that are </v>

1650
01:11:49.831 --> 01:11:54.120
<v Speaker 2>really good at one aspect of MMA and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they dominate people because of that.</v>

1651
01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:55.283
<v Speaker 2>Like Anderson Silva is the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial artist of all time was just a </v>

1652
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.160
<v Speaker 2>sensational striker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you,</v>

1653
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:05.700
<v Speaker 2>every fight starts off standing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to deal with his striking before</v>

1654
01:12:05.701 --> 01:12:07.380
<v Speaker 2>you could get to him before you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>take him down,</v>

1655
01:12:07.381 --> 01:12:08.940
<v Speaker 2>before he could try to submit him </v>
<v Speaker 2>through that.</v>

1656
01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.970
<v Speaker 2>He had to get through that and that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

1657
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:11.873
<v Speaker 2>he's a specialist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damien Maia is a specialist in a </v>

1658
01:12:13.231 --> 01:12:15.660
<v Speaker 2>completely different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the top welterweight contenders,</v>

1659
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.530
<v Speaker 2>probably number one now next to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderboy was going to be fighting for a</v>

1660
01:12:19.531 --> 01:12:20.400
<v Speaker 2>rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the title,</v>

1661
01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:23.430
<v Speaker 2>but Damien Maia is a pure Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>specialists.</v>

1662
01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:24.563
<v Speaker 2>His striking is only to get close enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you to grab you dragged to the </v>

1663
01:12:27.361 --> 01:12:28.230
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strangle you,</v>

1664
01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:31.650
<v Speaker 2>and in that way he's a lot of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he is as a throwback,</v>

1665
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.753
<v Speaker 2>but his jujitsu skill is so elite that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else who goes to the ground </v>

1666
01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:38.394
<v Speaker 2>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even guys like Carlos Condit who was a </v>

1667
01:12:39.661 --> 01:12:42.570
<v Speaker 2>former world champion to really high </v>
<v Speaker 2>level guy,</v>

1668
01:12:42.571 --> 01:12:43.404
<v Speaker 2>just get smushed like a bug and </v>
<v Speaker 2>strangled because he's such a </v>

1669
01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:48.270
<v Speaker 2>specialist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1670
01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:50.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's martial arts is very interesting in</v>

1671
01:12:50.701 --> 01:12:52.560
<v Speaker 2>that way because that works with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1672
01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:54.930
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't work with other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and other people have beaten.</v>

1673
01:12:54.931 --> 01:12:55.764
<v Speaker 2>Damien Maia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the fact that in many ways </v>

1674
01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:01.880
<v Speaker 2>one dimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that one dimension is a motherfucker</v>

1675
01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:03.040
<v Speaker 2>of a dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

1676
01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:04.003
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big boxing fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up a big Aaron Pryor family to a </v>

1677
01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:08.040
<v Speaker 2>big pernell whitaker fan.</v>

1678
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Like what was in that bottle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man?</v>

1679
01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck did he slip them?</v>

1680
01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:13.830
<v Speaker 2>What did he slip them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dying to know.</v>

1681
01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:16.040
<v Speaker 2>I would like to know Panama Lewis is </v>
<v Speaker 2>still alive.</v>

1682
01:13:16.041 --> 01:13:16.874
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm able to quantify that because I </v>

1683
01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:20.940
<v Speaker 2>think about a lot of the boxers who had </v>
<v Speaker 2>their one or two things.</v>

1684
01:13:20.941 --> 01:13:22.440
<v Speaker 2>Then it was just fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1685
01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:24.000
<v Speaker 2>Like had to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1686
01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.750
<v Speaker 2>Jones Rojo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1687
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:26.603
<v Speaker 2>it's funny you're talking about Condo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when Roy Jones found his moment to </v>

1688
01:13:28.741 --> 01:13:30.900
<v Speaker 2>go up to heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

1689
01:13:30.901 --> 01:13:31.321
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1690
01:13:31.321 --> 01:13:33.480
<v Speaker 2>here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about steroids.</v>

1691
01:13:33.481 --> 01:13:34.314
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Roy Jones went up to fight John </v>

1692
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:36.511
<v Speaker 2>Ruiz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1693
01:13:36.511 --> 01:13:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Roy Dot well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've met him.</v>

1694
01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:39.570
<v Speaker 2>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan.</v>

1695
01:13:39.571 --> 01:13:41.850
<v Speaker 2>He's probably one of my favorite boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not my favorite of all.</v>

1696
01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:42.684
<v Speaker 2>Time was great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty sure he did some Mexican </v>

1697
01:13:44.651 --> 01:13:46.800
<v Speaker 2>supplements to fight John Ruiz to get up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that way.</v>

1698
01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:49.500
<v Speaker 2>He was 200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was jacked.</v>

1699
01:13:49.501 --> 01:13:50.334
<v Speaker 2>He was shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily that natural for </v>

1700
01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:57.200
<v Speaker 2>you to put on that kind of weight in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that short period of one slash 68 to one</v>

1701
01:13:57.201 --> 01:13:59.250
<v Speaker 2>slash 75 to 200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big.</v>

1702
01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:03.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of CIG jumping and looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing and you know,</v>

1703
01:14:03.181 --> 01:14:04.890
<v Speaker 2>kept a speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then here's the thing,</v>

1704
01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:09.570
<v Speaker 2>dropped back down to one 75 again to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight tarver and looked like shit.</v>

1705
01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:10.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had a really hard time making the way </v>

1706
01:14:11.471 --> 01:14:15.160
<v Speaker 2>and I think also you look at his body </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was smooth,</v>

1707
01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:16.203
<v Speaker 2>his muscle tone was different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't look the same and I think a </v>

1708
01:14:18.431 --> 01:14:22.390
<v Speaker 2>lot of that is endocrine system </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially suffering from the steroids,</v>

1709
01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.030
<v Speaker 2>like taking steroids and then the crash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1710
01:14:25.031 --> 01:14:28.510
<v Speaker 2>this is pure speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all my years of seeing people do the</v>

1711
01:14:28.511 --> 01:14:29.344
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing people take steroids or take </v>

1712
01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.313
<v Speaker 2>anything that any anabolic enhancements </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then dropping down and getting off </v>

1713
01:14:36.191 --> 01:14:36.400
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

1714
01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.121
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

1715
01:14:37.121 --> 01:14:39.870
<v Speaker 2>you've seen flat pattern recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1716
01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.830
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of pattern recognition </v>
<v Speaker 2>about fighting.</v>

1717
01:14:41.831 --> 01:14:42.664
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things about fighting </v>

1718
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:45.830
<v Speaker 2>is pattern chunking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1719
01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:47.830
<v Speaker 2>you see things that you've seen before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1720
01:14:47.831 --> 01:14:48.664
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see it coming before maybe even the </v>

1721
01:14:50.171 --> 01:14:51.004
<v Speaker 2>other guy sees it coming and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do with consumer behavior and that's </v>

1722
01:14:53.471 --> 01:14:55.180
<v Speaker 2>how I bet on business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

1723
01:14:55.181 --> 01:14:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I was an early investor in facebook and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tumblr and twitter.</v>

1724
01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:01.810
<v Speaker 2>It was because I just knew that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked to me like email.</v>

1725
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:05.740
<v Speaker 2>That looked to me like I saw that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>invested in twitter because I thought it</v>

1726
01:15:05.741 --> 01:15:08.110
<v Speaker 2>was the next email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of snapchat?</v>

1727
01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.900
<v Speaker 2>So I invest at a first full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full disclosure.</v>

1728
01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.930
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a $5,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>check into snapchat,</v>

1729
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:15.340
<v Speaker 2>snapchat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snapchat.</v>

1730
01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:17.620
<v Speaker 2>That you're responsible for those puppy </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog filters.</v>

1731
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:18.760
<v Speaker 2>That shit's got to stop.</v>

1732
01:15:19.090 --> 01:15:20.650
<v Speaker 2>But ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to me.</v>

1733
01:15:20.651 --> 01:15:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Stop taking pictures with the puppy dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>nose stop.</v>

1734
01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:25.190
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more the don't.</v>

1735
01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Don't listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just fucking around.</v>

1736
01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.353
<v Speaker 2>Do whatever you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The flowers on the head though aren't </v>

1737
01:15:29.771 --> 01:15:32.360
<v Speaker 2>making it look any better yet is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you a coachella.</v>

1738
01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:33.753
<v Speaker 2>It's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fake flowers or think you're </v>

1739
01:15:34.811 --> 01:15:35.644
<v Speaker 2>crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do that or should they put the </v>

1740
01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:38.560
<v Speaker 2>check?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1741
01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:39.723
<v Speaker 2>they should definitely take flowers to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out the next move because </v>

1742
01:15:42.461 --> 01:15:43.294
<v Speaker 2>instagram's features have in the short </v>
<v Speaker 2>term affected it and where snapchat was </v>

1743
01:15:47.921 --> 01:15:48.754
<v Speaker 2>on the verge of becoming a monster was </v>
<v Speaker 2>we started seeing 40 and 50 year olds </v>

1744
01:15:52.031 --> 01:15:56.020
<v Speaker 2>download it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The features came to instagram.</v>

1745
01:15:56.770 --> 01:15:57.603
<v Speaker 2>It gave those 45 year olds a reason not </v>
<v Speaker 2>to download another APP and that's why </v>

1746
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.680
<v Speaker 2>snapchat's lost a little momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that a 20 year old.</v>

1747
01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:06.933
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some are using stories more than </v>

1748
01:16:07.901 --> 01:16:10.750
<v Speaker 2>instagram now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like a mass exodus of that.</v>

1749
01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.670
<v Speaker 2>It was the growth that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

1750
01:16:12.671 --> 01:16:13.504
<v Speaker 2>Forty and 50 year olds that were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting just like facebook back in </v>

1751
01:16:16.301 --> 01:16:16.931
<v Speaker 2>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

1752
01:16:16.931 --> 01:16:20.110
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just started getting your aunt that</v>

1753
01:16:20.111 --> 01:16:20.944
<v Speaker 2>wanted to act like she was in it </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to download and then the </v>

1754
01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.600
<v Speaker 2>network effect because her aunt has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend and that's what happens.</v>

1755
01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:30.220
<v Speaker 2>It stopped that and that is the concern </v>
<v Speaker 2>that snapchat has,</v>

1756
01:16:30.221 --> 01:16:31.054
<v Speaker 2>which is in wants to be at full scale </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's how you justify a </v>

1757
01:16:34.181 --> 01:16:36.520
<v Speaker 2>$20,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>valuation,</v>

1758
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:40.300
<v Speaker 2>which is what it wants to go IPO at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think snapchat's big things.</v>

1759
01:16:40.301 --> 01:16:44.200
<v Speaker 2>The filters like the Zombie filter in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rainbow throw up all that stuff.</v>

1760
01:16:44.201 --> 01:16:47.410
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what makes it cool and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that I could take your face and put</v>

1761
01:16:47.411 --> 01:16:49.690
<v Speaker 2>her on my face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's kind of dope.</v>

1762
01:16:49.691 --> 01:16:53.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of people do that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really pretty amazing.</v>

1763
01:16:53.411 --> 01:16:56.650
<v Speaker 2>If your face is similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like similar sized,</v>

1764
01:16:56.651 --> 01:16:58.840
<v Speaker 2>what you can pull off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1765
01:16:59.050 --> 01:16:59.741
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1766
01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:01.420
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done a lot of smart stuff,</v>

1767
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:04.870
<v Speaker 2>especially with ar and all that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1768
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna be very fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the glasses take off at full</v>

1769
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.640
<v Speaker 1>scale or what else are they up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call themselves snap now.</v>

1770
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a snapchat anymore as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

1771
01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Their snapchat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a holding company,</v>

1772
01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.480
<v Speaker 1>corporate bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody cares about.</v>

1773
01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:25.140
<v Speaker 1>The reason I care is when they came out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the glasses speckles I,</v>

1774
01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a social network act </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fashion brand.</v>

1775
01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:30.590
<v Speaker 1>There's something different about </v>
<v Speaker 1>snapchat that way.</v>

1776
01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:34.130
<v Speaker 1>How's it act like a fashion brand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the glass is like if you said if</v>

1777
01:17:34.131 --> 01:17:37.520
<v Speaker 1>I woke up tomorrow and found out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>snapchat was coming out with sneakers,</v>

1778
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's.</v>

1779
01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:42.800
<v Speaker 1>That would make no sense for twitter or </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram or facebook.</v>

1780
01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:43.723
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where I'm curious if they're </v>

1781
01:17:45.111 --> 01:17:48.860
<v Speaker 1>opening up that avenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snap is very la out.</v>

1782
01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.100
<v Speaker 1>It is not hardcore silicon valley </v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

1783
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:55.010
<v Speaker 1>It's got a little that La Flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evan's got that.</v>

1784
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:59.090
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference is Silicon Valley is very</v>

1785
01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:00.080
<v Speaker 1>tech nerded out.</v>

1786
01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:00.913
<v Speaker 1>It's a little different now because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's gone there to make their </v>

1787
01:18:03.021 --> 01:18:03.854
<v Speaker 1>millions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is still very grounded in </v>

1788
01:18:05.421 --> 01:18:06.254
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Engineers are the rock stars and it's a </v>

1789
01:18:08.571 --> 01:18:13.310
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snapchat is an La company and it started</v>

1790
01:18:13.311 --> 01:18:14.144
<v Speaker 1>by a very young entrepreneur who is way </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooler than the majority of </v>

1791
01:18:17.691 --> 01:18:20.900
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs that we've seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Build these products just in life.</v>

1792
01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:25.790
<v Speaker 1>He was a cooler kid and the vibe of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>product that the exclusiveness of it,</v>

1793
01:18:25.791 --> 01:18:27.950
<v Speaker 1>the awkwardness abusing it and they like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1794
01:18:27.951 --> 01:18:29.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't understand us,</v>

1795
01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:30.253
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had that vibe and so I'm curious to </v>

1796
01:18:33.021 --> 01:18:35.270
<v Speaker 1>see how that plays out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1797
01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have it on my phone.</v>

1798
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.760
<v Speaker 1>I use instagram and twitter and facebook</v>
<v Speaker 1>and facebook.</v>

1799
01:18:40.761 --> 01:18:41.594
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of use facebook only because </v>

1800
01:18:43.341 --> 01:18:45.120
<v Speaker 1>instagram links up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1801
01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting like distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1802
01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd use it and I don't interact with </v>

1803
01:18:50.871 --> 01:18:52.550
<v Speaker 1>people that much on facebook and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>get mad,</v>

1804
01:18:52.551 --> 01:18:55.930
<v Speaker 1>but this don't have that much time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is native to interact there.</v>

1805
01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot easier to interact in an on a</v>

1806
01:18:58.071 --> 01:18:59.920
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twitter's easiest.</v>

1807
01:18:59.930 --> 01:19:00.763
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instagram's a little weirder because </v>

1808
01:19:02.181 --> 01:19:05.150
<v Speaker 1>like when you get a comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you reply to that comment,</v>

1809
01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.340
<v Speaker 1>then you have to go find the original </v>
<v Speaker 1>comment.</v>

1810
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:08.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not a native.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's clunkier.</v>

1811
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Twitter is the watercooler of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

1812
01:19:11.670 --> 01:19:12.503
<v Speaker 1>It's got a lot of shortcomings for </v>
<v Speaker 1>content and how much people are paying </v>

1813
01:19:15.321 --> 01:19:16.154
<v Speaker 1>attention to the newsfeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but definitely from a conversation </v>

1814
01:19:18.591 --> 01:19:20.600
<v Speaker 1>standpoint there's nothing close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1815
01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:21.793
<v Speaker 1>when this airs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's where I'll go and engage </v>

1816
01:19:23.901 --> 01:19:25.850
<v Speaker 1>with people because a lot of people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>never heard of me before that,</v>

1817
01:19:25.851 --> 01:19:26.684
<v Speaker 1>listen to this and I'll respond to those</v>
<v Speaker 1>feedbacks much more data than anyone </v>

1818
01:19:29.921 --> 01:19:30.380
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

1819
01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will too.</v>

1820
01:19:31.281 --> 01:19:32.114
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I have the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>followers too and I will interact with </v>

1821
01:19:34.461 --> 01:19:36.590
<v Speaker 1>people more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also feel like I said,</v>

1822
01:19:36.591 --> 01:19:37.424
<v Speaker 1>I just think that Jamie was just telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>me the other day that a instagram makes </v>

1823
01:19:40.491 --> 01:19:42.440
<v Speaker 1>it so you can like people's comments </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1824
01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a new little feature.</v>

1825
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:44.663
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been,</v>

1826
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:45.551
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim,</v>

1827
01:19:45.551 --> 01:19:47.420
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like you're really getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper and deeper in this game.</v>

1828
01:19:47.421 --> 01:19:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Like they've been innovating very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tons,</v>

1829
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:52.363
<v Speaker 1>tons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snapchat today put out a way for you to </v>

1830
01:19:53.571 --> 01:19:55.340
<v Speaker 1>link out to websites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's just movement.</v>

1831
01:19:55.341 --> 01:19:56.174
<v Speaker 1>There's always moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Facebook is definitely gonna launch </v>

1832
01:19:58.341 --> 01:20:00.560
<v Speaker 1>stories in facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1833
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:02.240
<v Speaker 1>because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just launched it in Ireland,</v>

1834
01:20:02.970 --> 01:20:05.840
<v Speaker 1>so I've already seen the preview of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's out like it,</v>

1835
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:06.703
<v Speaker 1>so that's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that will be interesting to see what </v>

1836
01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:10.500
<v Speaker 1>that does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So plenty more to come.</v>

1837
01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:11.363
<v Speaker 1>I think facebook should become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>television company like I think they </v>

1838
01:20:12.991 --> 01:20:13.824
<v Speaker 1>should actually come out with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>television and then I think when you're </v>

1839
01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:17.490
<v Speaker 1>in an actual towe have an actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical television.</v>

1840
01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.050
<v Speaker 1>This is just what I think they should </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1841
01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:21.600
<v Speaker 1>And when you're in your feed you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1842
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:24.240
<v Speaker 1>you just flick it and it goes on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

1843
01:20:24.241 --> 01:20:26.370
<v Speaker 1>you watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like apple TV does.</v>

1844
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>

1845
01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

1846
01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:31.643
<v Speaker 1>listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to talk about fighting </v>

1847
01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:35.430
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Facebook,</v>

1848
01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:40.431
<v Speaker 1>if you want to fight for job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to buy your fucking TV.</v>

1849
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:42.623
<v Speaker 1>You're got to make a lot of TVS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be sitting in a </v>

1850
01:20:44.521 --> 01:20:45.730
<v Speaker 1>warehouse somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we?</v>

1851
01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:50.370
<v Speaker 1>The mistake I made that mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the TV I'm going to say,</v>

1852
01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:53.760
<v Speaker 1>and in this keynote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this great clip from 2017 when I</v>

1853
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:55.590
<v Speaker 1>fully predicted the facebook TV.</v>

1854
01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:56.613
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they get involved in selling </v>

1855
01:20:58.111 --> 01:20:58.944
<v Speaker 1>tvs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would it be different than their </v>

1856
01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 1>TV?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you own the hardware,</v>

1857
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:02.183
<v Speaker 1>you own the action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would anybody buy that when you </v>

1858
01:21:04.621 --> 01:21:05.454
<v Speaker 1>could do like a little google chrome </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that sticks right into a Usb port </v>

1859
01:21:08.581 --> 01:21:09.414
<v Speaker 1>and just shoot it right from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>android phone and TV and make the best </v>

1860
01:21:12.691 --> 01:21:13.524
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has permission to play in </v>

1861
01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:17.070
<v Speaker 1>anybody space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you make the best tv,</v>

1862
01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:18.503
<v Speaker 1>Sony had no permission to go in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>video game space until they made the </v>

1863
01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:23.430
<v Speaker 1>fucking playstation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>

1864
01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:25.220
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1865
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Like Netflix wasn't supposed to produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best original content,</v>

1866
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:30.320
<v Speaker 1>but that's a difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1867
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:31.183
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're selling a console that makes </v>

1868
01:21:33.631 --> 01:21:34.464
<v Speaker 1>video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to hire a bunch of people </v>

1869
01:21:36.121 --> 01:21:36.954
<v Speaker 1>to make games for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you're the razor and the razor blade </v>

1870
01:21:40.291 --> 01:21:40.680
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1871
01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Like facebook and just first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>razor and razor blade.</v>

1872
01:21:43.111 --> 01:21:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Would it be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you just become the platform.</v>

1873
01:21:44.491 --> 01:21:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Other people can make it like Sony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sony to make those games.</v>

1874
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they hired people to.</v>

1875
01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:51.840
<v Speaker 1>They made some of their own game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly bought from other professors,</v>

1876
01:21:51.841 --> 01:21:52.674
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly they created a </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform that people built for that </v>

1877
01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.553
<v Speaker 1>facebook has facebook can go out and buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number for TB manufacturer steel to </v>

1878
01:21:59.401 --> 01:22:02.190
<v Speaker 1>people from Samsung and they're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking game.</v>

1879
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:03.053
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everybody already has a TV like </v>

1880
01:22:04.021 --> 01:22:07.240
<v Speaker 1>getting them to buy a facebook tv one </v>
<v Speaker 1>more time and you know this Joe,</v>

1881
01:22:07.241 --> 01:22:09.630
<v Speaker 1>like we used to have Sony Tvs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we have Samsung.</v>

1882
01:22:09.631 --> 01:22:10.464
<v Speaker 1>People like Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you with me on this now he's with me </v>

1883
01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:13.320
<v Speaker 1>with both of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1884
01:22:13.321 --> 01:22:16.660
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're both saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of you.</v>

1885
01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm leaving Jamie,</v>

1886
01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

1887
01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:21.353
<v Speaker 1>This is historic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also knows that I'm not connected </v>

1888
01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:23.813
<v Speaker 1>directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1889
01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great point because I.</v>

1890
01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:28.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean you brought up that snapchat </v>
<v Speaker 1>sneaker thing a few weeks ago.</v>

1891
01:22:28.891 --> 01:22:29.724
<v Speaker 1>At least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I saw with a few weeks ago </v>

1892
01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.970
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's a great point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not gonna work for everyone.</v>

1893
01:22:33.010 --> 01:22:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Good idea if you want to go broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

1894
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:39.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a brand thing like put all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and you know what's interesting is</v>

1895
01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:43.080
<v Speaker 1>actually where I was about to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just walked into it.</v>

1896
01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by the following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you even said easy's three</v>

1897
01:22:46.891 --> 01:22:48.150
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1898
01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:49.133
<v Speaker 1>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have never said anything to </v>

1899
01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:51.743
<v Speaker 1>understand us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why I say because he buys </v>

1900
01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:57.710
<v Speaker 1>easiest and mock him on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what are the shittiest fucking goofy</v>

1901
01:22:57.790 --> 01:23:01.440
<v Speaker 1>look at sneakers I've ever seen in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and and they sell it crazy.</v>

1902
01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.010
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of retards out there.</v>

1903
01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Hey Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about this?</v>

1904
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:06.223
<v Speaker 1>What I'm of the age then when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have ceased started when mixed </v>

1905
01:23:10.091 --> 01:23:11.530
<v Speaker 1>martial arts started hitting the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1906
01:23:11.531 --> 01:23:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Royce Gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like way back.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So I apologize.</v>

1908
01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.680
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did everybody say about that?</v>

1909

<v Speaker 1>No chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking stupid.</v>

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's different.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's not sure.</v>

1912
01:23:22.151 --> 01:23:22.984

<v Speaker 1>Everybody understood that fighting at </v>

1913
01:23:25.171 --> 01:23:28.000
<v Speaker 1>the fashion is primal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the way we express.</v>

1914
01:23:28.001 --> 01:23:31.510
<v Speaker 1>These are definitely not private.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brother yeezys are primal.</v>

1915
01:23:31.570 --> 01:23:33.460
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stripe and color.</v>

1916
01:23:33.461 --> 01:23:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Stripe on the side of Christ makes them </v>
<v Speaker 1>harder to duplicate.</v>

1917
01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:41.320
<v Speaker 1>They look like shit wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:24.673
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loyal to his characteristics that you </v>

1934
01:24:26.201 --> 01:24:29.560
<v Speaker 1>admire and you do on your own daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1935
01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:31.023
<v Speaker 1>I respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1936
01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:31.893
<v Speaker 1>I fully respect that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect and understand he's the </v>

1937
01:24:34.901 --> 01:24:36.280
<v Speaker 1>greatest basketball player of all time.</v>

1938
01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he still,</v>

1939
01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:40.510
<v Speaker 1>is that still a jam?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is probably right.</v>

1940
01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:41.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1941
01:24:41.681 --> 01:24:42.514
<v Speaker 1>you want to get into the Wilton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some different ways to the bait </v>

1942
01:24:44.591 --> 01:24:45.730
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I will say.</v>

1943
01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:48.850
<v Speaker 1>You can say I hate when people argue </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me on this.</v>

1944
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:54.040
<v Speaker 1>You can separate respecting somebody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>skillset and thinking they're a piece of</v>

1945
01:24:54.041 --> 01:24:54.874
<v Speaker 1>fucking shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you only thing he's a piece of shit </v>

1946
01:24:56.261 --> 01:24:57.670
<v Speaker 1>because he beat your team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1947
01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.400
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that more than a fuck enough?</v>

1948
01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:01.893
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See Tom Brady choke would be </v>

1949
01:25:04.871 --> 01:25:06.670
<v Speaker 1>phenomenally happy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he died.</v>

1950
01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go there because I could</v>

1951
01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.820
<v Speaker 1>never put it again right after Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be real happy.</v>

1952
01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Real fucking happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't like that.</v>

1953
01:25:15.521 --> 01:25:17.230
<v Speaker 1>He's really good and he wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1954
01:25:17.410 --> 01:25:18.620
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Expensive.</v>

1955
01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.860
<v Speaker 1>My team see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that whole my team,</v>

1956
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

1957
01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I understand if you own that team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't own it yet.</v>

1958
01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my escape,</v>

1959
01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the one place I get to escape.</v>

1960
01:25:26.261 --> 01:25:27.094
<v Speaker 1>It's my three hours fucking 16 times a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year where I can recalibrate my whole </v>

1961
01:25:30.251 --> 01:25:31.450
<v Speaker 1>fucking insane life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1962
01:25:31.451 --> 01:25:32.284
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming in from a perspective of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird perspective as a person who is a </v>

1963
01:25:35.201 --> 01:25:36.034
<v Speaker 1>sports fan because my sports that I only</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch her martial arts and as a fan of </v>

1964
01:25:40.691 --> 01:25:43.180
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of performance more than I'm a</v>

1965
01:25:43.181 --> 01:25:45.800
<v Speaker 1>fan of a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not a fan.</v>

1966
01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Like when I watch people fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of whoever wins the fight.</v>

1967
01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of how they win it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of what goes down.</v>

1968
01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Not a bandwagon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>

1969
01:25:53.051 --> 01:25:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>

1970
01:25:53.650 --> 01:25:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You love the craft.</v>

1971
01:25:55.750 --> 01:26:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I love the craft and I also love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love moments.</v>

1972
01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I love someone dominating a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is exactly right.</v>

1973
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:07.190
<v Speaker 2>And I love when I don't have a horse in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the race,</v>

1974
01:26:07.191 --> 01:26:08.024
<v Speaker 2>so you always have a horse race when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to the ball and football and I </v>

1975
01:26:10.701 --> 01:26:11.534
<v Speaker 2>used to in hockey and baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my teams won championships and then </v>

1976
01:26:13.461 --> 01:26:14.294
<v Speaker 2>I get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1977
01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:16.610
<v Speaker 2>so you can if so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no baseball.</v>

1978
01:26:16.611 --> 01:26:18.820
<v Speaker 2>So if you could appreciate someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad motherfucker,</v>

1979
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:21.380
<v Speaker 2>breaks the home run record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stuff I get excited about.</v>

1980
01:26:21.381 --> 01:26:22.850
<v Speaker 2>That's why I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I liked.</v>

1981
01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:26.060
<v Speaker 2>I liked boxing so much for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend not to have a horse in the race.</v>

1982
01:26:26.061 --> 01:26:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I usually root for the underdog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good move.</v>

1983
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels better when they win.</v>

1984
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:32.220
<v Speaker 2>That's usually my default.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1985
01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.073
<v Speaker 2>When you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When someone is the favorite and they </v>

1986
01:26:34.701 --> 01:26:35.750
<v Speaker 2>beat the shit out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to go.</v>

1987
01:26:35.751 --> 01:26:36.584
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that coming when Tyson was in his </v>

1988
01:26:38.871 --> 01:26:39.704
<v Speaker 2>prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were weird fights because they </v>

1989
01:26:41.271 --> 01:26:46.040
<v Speaker 2>were an execution fibrous cells and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those were real event.</v>

1990
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:48.560
<v Speaker 2>Bruce Allen was post was posted by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1991
01:26:48.561 --> 01:26:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Bruce Selden had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1992
01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:51.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1993
01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.330
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's smoke smoking.</v>

1994
01:26:53.331 --> 01:26:54.164
<v Speaker 2>Burke Cooper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I think of when I think about bruce </v>

1995
01:26:56.261 --> 01:26:57.980
<v Speaker 2>selling because they had a similar body </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape,</v>

1996
01:26:57.981 --> 01:26:59.720
<v Speaker 2>jacked smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burke Cooper,</v>

1997
01:26:59.830 --> 01:27:01.840
<v Speaker 2>knockdown holyfield in Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1998
01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:04.670
<v Speaker 2>And I thought he had that excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1999
01:27:04.671 --> 01:27:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holyfield.</v>

2000
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of great boxers,</v>

2001
01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:15.430
<v Speaker 2>but Tyson had something going on where </v>
<v Speaker 2>pop culture.</v>

2002
01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an executioner.</v>

2003
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:18.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's popcorn when they transcend into </v>

2004
01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:20.643
<v Speaker 2>popcorn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that a lot of times is </v>

2005
01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:24.920
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad for those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda.</v>

2006
01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the drop off is so extreme when you</v>

2007
01:27:28.131 --> 01:27:30.890
<v Speaker 2>get to become a cultural icon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2008
01:27:30.891 --> 01:27:31.724
<v Speaker 2>but she's a real weird case because </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's essentially done so you gotta </v>

2009
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:42.220
<v Speaker 2>wonder like her mindset when she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>winning was this mindset of a destroyer.</v>

2010
01:27:43.701 --> 01:27:47.060
<v Speaker 2>She would go in there and smash these </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls and she was all in,</v>

2011
01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.373
<v Speaker 2>but then she got wooed by Hollywood and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the distractions and movies and TV </v>

2012
01:27:52.221 --> 01:27:53.054
<v Speaker 2>shows and all that nonsense and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>bought into a bad strategy against one </v>

2013
01:27:59.661 --> 01:28:00.494
<v Speaker 2>of the best strikers in the sport and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought the absolute worst way she could </v>

2014
01:28:04.201 --> 01:28:05.034
<v Speaker 2>have fought against that elite striker </v>
<v Speaker 2>and got fucked up and once she got </v>

2015
01:28:09.231 --> 01:28:11.420
<v Speaker 2>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man the wheels came off.</v>

2016
01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:12.673
<v Speaker 2>She takes a whole year off and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes back again and just gets </v>

2017
01:28:16.491 --> 01:28:20.960
<v Speaker 2>annihilated and now dilated and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's essentially done.</v>

2018
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:24.540
<v Speaker 2>Here's my biggest crazy mma in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern world [inaudible],</v>

2019
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:29.590
<v Speaker 2>you lose the entire fight in within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time of an instagram post.</v>

2020
01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:32.080
<v Speaker 2>You're in deep shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are,</v>

2021
01:28:32.081 --> 01:28:33.110
<v Speaker 2>but you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2022
01:28:33.111 --> 01:28:33.944
<v Speaker 2>because she beat cats in Ghana in 14 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds and cat Zingano is still in the </v>

2023
01:28:36.861 --> 01:28:39.590
<v Speaker 2>mix and mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>math is all fucked up,</v>

2024
01:28:39.591 --> 01:28:42.200
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't really work this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is a fact.</v>

2025
01:28:42.710 --> 01:28:45.200
<v Speaker 2>Cat Zingano stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amanda Nunez,</v>

2026
01:28:45.201 --> 01:28:46.034
<v Speaker 2>she beat her in the third round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Ronda Rousey after that fight arm </v>

2027
01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:53.530
<v Speaker 2>barred cat Zingano in 14 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I get those banana.</v>

2028
01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:55.370
<v Speaker 2>What's really cool about Emma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have said this,</v>

2029
01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:56.233
<v Speaker 2>you may have caught the shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the closest thing to </v>

2030
01:28:57.681 --> 01:29:01.360
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurship because everybody loses</v>
<v Speaker 2>an entrepreneurship boxing's.</v>

2031
01:29:01.410 --> 01:29:04.110
<v Speaker 2>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That loss really dangles.</v>

2032
01:29:04.710 --> 01:29:06.390
<v Speaker 2>It's devastating that loss.</v>

2033
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:09.030
<v Speaker 2>I've been more fascinated from afar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as deep into sport,</v>

2034
01:29:09.031 --> 01:29:12.900
<v Speaker 2>and you can correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is an absolute different level</v>

2035
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:18.470
<v Speaker 2>because the way the sport is structured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an acceptance by the fan base of</v>

2036
01:29:18.661 --> 01:29:21.900
<v Speaker 2>the loss in this sport that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very different than boxing.</v>

2037
01:29:21.901 --> 01:29:23.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a scarlet letter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing.</v>

2038
01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.550
<v Speaker 2>When you're coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to keep it clean,</v>

2039
01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be undefeated and want to be</v>

2040
01:29:28.231 --> 01:29:29.064
<v Speaker 2>an undefeated contender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a is a big factor and an MMA </v>

2041
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.903
<v Speaker 2>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one is undefeated except number man </v>

2042
01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:34.953
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the very few guys that's a </v>

2043
01:29:35.881 --> 01:29:36.714
<v Speaker 2>top contender right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's undefeated and he's just a </v>

2044
01:29:38.581 --> 01:29:41.340
<v Speaker 2>destroyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know he's rare.</v>

2045
01:29:41.370 --> 01:29:42.480
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very rare.</v>

2046
01:29:42.481 --> 01:29:43.314
<v Speaker 2>Most people at the top have lost a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of times what connor showed when </v>

2047
01:29:46.741 --> 01:29:49.260
<v Speaker 2>he lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he showed the ability to regroup,</v>

2048
01:29:49.261 --> 01:29:51.240
<v Speaker 2>take it on the chin like a fucking man.</v>

2049
01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:54.030
<v Speaker 2>Make no excuses whatsoever and jump </v>
<v Speaker 2>right back in and when,</v>

2050
01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:56.640
<v Speaker 2>and that's super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super rare.</v>

2051
01:29:57.150 --> 01:30:02.040
<v Speaker 2>He's a phenomenal individual in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to visualize things.</v>

2052
01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:03.053
<v Speaker 2>His belief in himself is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>unflappable and his incredible </v>

2053
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:11.730
<v Speaker 2>confidence and ability to operate under </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>

2054
01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.790
<v Speaker 2>That's the big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is being dwarfed by the moment,</v>

2055
01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:18.000
<v Speaker 2>by the moment happened so many times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

2056
01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:21.180
<v Speaker 2>People let allow those negative thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 2>to creep into their mind.</v>

2057
01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:24.660
<v Speaker 2>All those eyeballs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all fucking eyeballs,</v>

2058
01:30:24.661 --> 01:30:26.760
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of eyeballs and a lot of doubt.</v>

2059
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:27.623
<v Speaker 2>What was the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the biggest audience you </v>

2060
01:30:28.961 --> 01:30:29.794
<v Speaker 2>performed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the first time you took a </v>

2061
01:30:31.081 --> 01:30:32.700
<v Speaker 2>quantum jump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what was the number?</v>

2062
01:30:32.701 --> 01:30:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Did he go from like consistently doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like clubs?</v>

2063
01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Then what was the first time like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>

2064
01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Because I had a very weird thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to me with speaking.</v>

2065
01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:40.433
<v Speaker 2>It was always like 500,</v>
<v Speaker 2>349 and then I got this weird Gig for </v>

2066
01:30:44.611 --> 01:30:48.780
<v Speaker 2>remax natural national convention at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mgm Grand,</v>

2067
01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:51.690
<v Speaker 2>like 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2068
01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:53.500
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was such a like.</v>

2069
01:30:54.130 --> 01:30:55.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do it everyday if I could.</v>

2070
01:30:55.730 --> 01:30:56.970
<v Speaker 2>It seems really bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2071
01:30:56.990 --> 01:30:57.823
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I focused on the people that were </v>

2072
01:31:02.221 --> 01:31:03.510
<v Speaker 2>closest to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2073
01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:04.770
<v Speaker 2>It worked for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2074
01:31:04.771 --> 01:31:06.210
<v Speaker 2>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way to do it.</v>

2075
01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:09.240
<v Speaker 2>And while taking into account all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that aren't right there.</v>

2076
01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about for you?</v>

2077
01:31:10.801 --> 01:31:12.900
<v Speaker 2>What was the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2078
01:31:12.901 --> 01:31:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I mostly started out with clubs for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time,</v>

2079
01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:16.973
<v Speaker 2>mostly did clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as I started getting more and </v>

2080
01:31:20.011 --> 01:31:20.844
<v Speaker 2>more popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved into larger places and the </v>

2081
01:31:23.341 --> 01:31:26.880
<v Speaker 2>biggest place that I've ever sold out </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in Denver,</v>

2082
01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:30.000
<v Speaker 2>which was like 5,700</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2083
01:31:30.450 --> 01:31:32.640
<v Speaker 2>So that's a different experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2084
01:31:32.641 --> 01:31:34.650
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

2085

2112
01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Gratitude is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think gratitude is a real drug,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like other people recognize true </v>
<v Speaker 2>gratitude and they get excited by it </v>

<v Speaker 2>Your Dad might've decided to jerk off </v>

01:33:12.281 --> 01:33:14.280
<v Speaker 2>one more time the day before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2128
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:15.790
<v Speaker 2>And we wouldn't be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

<v Speaker 2>400 Janie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mom might've wanted to take a quick</v>

2130
01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:23.650
<v Speaker 2>glass of wine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 400 trillion to one.</v>

2131
01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:26.260
<v Speaker 2>The odds of being a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2132
01:33:26.261 --> 01:33:27.094
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

2133
01:33:27.450 --> 01:33:29.620
<v Speaker 2>This is a little weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like we're going down this path,</v>

2134
01:33:29.621 --> 01:33:32.020
<v Speaker 2>like I'm fascinated by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2135
01:33:32.021 --> 01:33:32.854
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>

2136
01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:34.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a real statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think about,</v>

2137
01:33:34.511 --> 01:33:37.170
<v Speaker 2>come really start dividing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conquering.</v>

2138
01:33:37.210 --> 01:33:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Understand that you can end up on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad's.</v>

2139
01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Come instead or Napkin instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming a human trait.</v>

2140
01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:44.040
<v Speaker 2>It's humbling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2141
01:33:44.110 --> 01:33:45.750
<v Speaker 2>it is a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2142
01:33:45.970 --> 01:33:48.340
<v Speaker 2>But once that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you become a human,</v>

2143
01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:49.333
<v Speaker 2>once you become a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then even then the odds of being </v>

2144
01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:56.050
<v Speaker 2>fortunate to have good health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fortunate to not have been,</v>

2145
01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:58.750
<v Speaker 2>have the fuck beat out of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your parents,</v>

2146
01:33:59.110 --> 01:33:59.943
<v Speaker 2>or being in foster care with abusive </v>
<v Speaker 2>people or a million different factors </v>

2147
01:34:03.061 --> 01:34:03.894
<v Speaker 2>going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going down the path that I think </v>

2148
01:34:05.411 --> 01:34:09.970
<v Speaker 2>about on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also had the misfortune of three of my</v>

2149
01:34:09.971 --> 01:34:10.804
<v Speaker 2>four grandparents dying before I knew </v>
<v Speaker 2>them because everybody died in Russia </v>

2150
01:34:13.281 --> 01:34:16.030
<v Speaker 2>and in their fifties because everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking miserable from communism.</v>

2151
01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:17.800
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2152
01:34:18.010 --> 01:34:20.170
<v Speaker 2>so I haven't had a whole lot of death in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my family.</v>

2153
01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.550
<v Speaker 2>Like I had A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2154
01:34:21.670 --> 01:34:23.470
<v Speaker 2>it's real good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm grateful.</v>

2155
01:34:23.770 --> 01:34:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Gratitude is giant man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>

2156
01:34:26.441 --> 01:34:28.630
<v Speaker 2>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can extend that gratitude.</v>

2157
01:34:28.631 --> 01:34:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people that woe is</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2158
01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:32.800
<v Speaker 2>but God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just need to look at,</v>

2159
01:34:33.250 --> 01:34:34.083
<v Speaker 2>look at it in a balanced perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people in parts of the world </v>

<v Speaker 1>the icon in Silicon Valley and all my </v>
<v Speaker 1>young friends started becoming dicks to </v>

2207
01:36:38.541 --> 01:36:39.374
<v Speaker 1>their employees because they thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were getting more out of their </v>

2208
01:36:40.881 --> 01:36:45.200
<v Speaker 1>employees that way about him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative.</v>

2209
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:46.303
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wish I knew what the actual truth </v>

2210
01:36:49.311 --> 01:36:51.710
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I got to see him communicate with</v>

2211
01:36:51.711 --> 01:36:54.980
<v Speaker 1>his employees and see what it was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaked them out.</v>

2212
01:36:54.981 --> 01:36:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Like was he really a dick or did he work</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a bunch of ne'er?</v>

2213
01:36:57.691 --> 01:37:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Do Wells are lazy people were fools or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is?</v>

2214
01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Is it number one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why he wanted to be number one?</v>

2215
01:37:04.041 --> 01:37:06.680
<v Speaker 1>For sure he was a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was definitely Dick.</v>

2216
01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:08.293
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth is back to the way you talk about </v>

2217
01:37:09.591 --> 01:37:10.430
<v Speaker 1>steroid Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hugh,</v>

2218
01:37:10.431 --> 01:37:11.730
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2219
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know her hard when a whole lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of human beings are saying it.</v>

2220
01:37:15.170 --> 01:37:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Who worked for him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2221
01:37:16.371 --> 01:37:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I think he was absolutely completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed and I think for a lot of people</v>

2222
01:37:21.051 --> 01:37:24.110
<v Speaker 1>that really wasn't what they wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted a job,</v>

2223
01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want us to do good at their jobs,</v>

2224
01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.400
<v Speaker 1>but I deploy empathy.</v>

2225
01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:29.293
<v Speaker 1>I know that other people have other </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals and wants and needs and that </v>

2226
01:37:32.271 --> 01:37:34.700
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mine mine,</v>

2227
01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:37.520
<v Speaker 1>even though it's my company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't come at their expense.</v>

2228
01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:38.503
<v Speaker 1>It's my job as a leader to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to provide for them and figure out </v>

2229
01:37:41.601 --> 01:37:44.540
<v Speaker 1>what's left for me to do what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's leverage,</v>

2230
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:45.643
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what he wanted to do was create </v>

2231
01:37:46.911 --> 01:37:51.290
<v Speaker 1>something unbelievably powerful and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had this supervision of it and he wanted</v>

2232
01:37:51.291 --> 01:37:52.124
<v Speaker 1>everybody else to share that vision but </v>
<v Speaker 1>not really necessarily share in the </v>

2233
01:37:54.711 --> 01:37:57.540
<v Speaker 1>rewards of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a big problem,</v>

2234
01:37:57.541 --> 01:37:58.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's like me saying,</v>

2274
01:39:44.851 --> 01:39:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm a basketball player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I play basketball,</v>

2275
01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:50.640
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making any fucking money.</v>

2276
01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>

2277
01:39:51.991 --> 01:39:54.420
<v Speaker 1>we have a real issue in fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship right now.</v>

2278
01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2279
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.510
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became cool.</v>

2280
01:39:58.340 --> 01:39:59.173
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to me how cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship became when I was a </v>

2281
01:40:01.521 --> 01:40:02.354
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being an entrepreneur meant you were a </v>

2282
01:40:03.171 --> 01:40:06.200
<v Speaker 1>loser and had an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2283
01:40:07.090 --> 01:40:09.200
<v Speaker 1>you're laughing because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>youngsters will listen.</v>

2284
01:40:09.201 --> 01:40:10.340
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in our day,</v>

2285
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:12.890
<v Speaker 1>like entrepreneur was a word that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>rarely heard.</v>

2286
01:40:12.891 --> 01:40:15.020
<v Speaker 1>I used to think I was a businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said,</v>

2287
01:40:15.021 --> 01:40:15.854
<v Speaker 1>not an entrepreneur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must hear a lot of really shitty </v>

2288
01:40:17.691 --> 01:40:18.524
<v Speaker 1>ideas for living for a living because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>get some email sometime and I'll get </v>

2289
01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:27.410
<v Speaker 1>like one paragraph and I'll get the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>outta here.</v>

2290
01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:29.960

<v Speaker 1>And I just deleted.</v>

2291
01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:33.260
<v Speaker 1>But you must get that like all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day long.</v>

2292
01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to separate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2293
01:40:36.021 --> 01:40:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you find those little </v>
<v Speaker 1>diamonds?</v>

2294
01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you do and sometimes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

2295
01:40:39.471 --> 01:40:40.304

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2307
01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Who saw that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A glasses company was going to be giant,</v>

2308
01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:18.940
<v Speaker 1>but other times you know Venmo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zappos knew it right away.</v>

2309
01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:19.391
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean it goes both ways.</v>

2311
01:41:20.770 --> 01:41:22.330

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2315
01:41:27.190 --> 01:41:28.023
<v Speaker 1>I use it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from the generation where people </v>

2316
01:41:29.741 --> 01:41:30.574
<v Speaker 1>made fun of my dad for because I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>open a second wine store and I went on </v>

2317
01:41:35.081 --> 01:41:38.490
<v Speaker 1>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet's youngsters.</v>

2318
01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Listen real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People debated the Internet itself.</v>

2319
01:41:41.621 --> 01:41:42.454
<v Speaker 1>Forget about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is snapchat going to be here in five </v>

2320
01:41:43.811 --> 01:41:45.760
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in 1994.</v>

2321
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:46.391
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

2322
01:41:46.391 --> 01:41:47.050
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>

2323
01:41:47.050 --> 01:41:49.060
<v Speaker 1>People like the Internet not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>here in five years.</v>

2324
01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:50.253
<v Speaker 1>Go earlier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When ibm first came out with their home </v>

2325
01:41:52.391 --> 01:41:54.160
<v Speaker 1>computer thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

2326
01:41:54.161 --> 01:41:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a joke.</v>

2327
01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Telephone is not a viable product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One said.</v>

2328
01:41:58.600 --> 01:41:59.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the people that didn't want the </v>

2329
01:42:00.371 --> 01:42:03.730
<v Speaker 1>telephone to win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody saw a lot of things coming.</v>

2330
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:06.100
<v Speaker 1>So what should we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary Vee?</v>

2331
01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:07.750
<v Speaker 1>What's wrap this up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What should we do?</v>

2332
01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:10.960
<v Speaker 1>What should people do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People should fucking stop complaining,</v>

2333
01:42:11.110 --> 01:42:11.943
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People should figure out how the fuck </v>

2334
01:42:12.791 --> 01:42:13.624
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good people should not listen to </v>

2335
01:42:15.131 --> 01:42:15.964
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Propaganda of fixing the shit they suck </v>

2336
01:42:18.401 --> 01:42:19.234
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be tripling down on what </v>

2337
01:42:20.081 --> 01:42:20.914
<v Speaker 1>they're good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be competent in certain </v>

2338
01:42:23.291 --> 01:42:24.124
<v Speaker 1>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not gonna become beyonce or </v>

2339
01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:28.893
<v Speaker 1>your bone structure is a certain way </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're not going to solve </v>

2340
01:42:31.481 --> 01:42:34.150
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Iq can get a little bit better,</v>

2341
01:42:34.151 --> 01:42:34.984
<v Speaker 1>but don't worry about the incremental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figure out what you fucking puts you on </v>

2342
01:42:37.901 --> 01:42:38.734
<v Speaker 1>fire and you're halfway decent at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're lucky enough right now to be </v>

2343
01:42:41.291 --> 01:42:42.124
<v Speaker 1>listening and you're good at what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like become tunnel fucking vision </v>

2344
01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:50.740
<v Speaker 1>because there's way too many voices </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you what and how.</v>

2345
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:52.660
<v Speaker 1>And here's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the big one job,</v>

2346
01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:54.160
<v Speaker 1>because you have a humongous audience.</v>

2347
01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:55.173
<v Speaker 1>The biggest thing that I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>dividends from have the conversation </v>

2348
01:42:58.871 --> 01:43:02.440
<v Speaker 1>with the person that's holding you back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason most people who are listening</v>

2349
01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:03.274
<v Speaker 1>right now are not doing that thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're worried about the opinion of </v>

2350
01:43:05.891 --> 01:43:08.140
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually their mother,</v>

2351
01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:09.633
<v Speaker 1>usually their father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reality is is that your spouse </v>

2352
01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:16.780
<v Speaker 1>may be the person holding you back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have that conversation.</v>

2353
01:43:16.810 --> 01:43:17.643
<v Speaker 1>Turn them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to get to a place where you're </v>

2354
01:43:19.601 --> 01:43:20.434
<v Speaker 1>doing you because the number one thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that scares the fuck out of me is </v>

2355
01:43:23.321 --> 01:43:24.880
<v Speaker 1>regret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're gonna.</v>

2356
01:43:24.890 --> 01:43:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Sit there at 72 and I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I wish,</v>

2357
01:43:28.001 --> 01:43:28.834
<v Speaker 1>I wish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whether that's money or spend more </v>

2358
01:43:30.071 --> 01:43:32.200
<v Speaker 1>time with your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a million ways to do this.</v>

2359
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody wants to buy the jets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody wants to smoke weed on the</v>

2360
01:43:36.341 --> 01:43:38.860
<v Speaker 1>beach and Bahamas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody's got a different fucking</v>

2361
01:43:38.861 --> 01:43:39.694
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figured out what your fucking thing is </v>

2362
01:43:40.811 --> 01:43:44.110
<v Speaker 1>and stop making fucking bullshit excuses</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the president is.</v>

2363
01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Your mom did this like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2364
01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had that idea for Uber.</v>

2365
01:43:48.641 --> 01:43:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Then why didn't you fucking do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick?</v>

2366
01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

2367
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:52.963
<v Speaker 3>what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

2368
01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Better words have never been spoken.</v>
