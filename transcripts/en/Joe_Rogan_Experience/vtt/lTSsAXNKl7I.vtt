00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>It was like you don't trust it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but didn't start think.</v>

2
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello Michael.</v>

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Hello Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you,</v>

4

<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you.</v>

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.400
<v Speaker 1>So this main thing to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is why don't you have a </v>

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>fucking blue check next to your name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do on twitter where it matters,</v>

7
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>but not on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instagram doesn't matter.</v>

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Well it does stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hurting like I've in into shade </v>

9
00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:33.551
<v Speaker 1>the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to figure out who we </v>

10
00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>need to contact the sunshine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shade everywhere.</v>

11
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:35.180
<v Speaker 1>What the hell?</v>

12
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

13
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

14
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they decide who gets a blue check</v>

15
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>mark and who doesn't instance the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardest one?</v>

16
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>What do you have to get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know Joe.</v>

18
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an insect blue check mark.</v>

19
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm just curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hurts my feelings.</v>

20
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even verified on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm A.</v>

21
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pledge.</v>

23
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>But you've been on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've published books.</v>

24
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck I these people.</v>

25
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>This is why we need regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The social media giants.</v>

26
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>This is outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think</v>

27
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.610
<v Speaker 2>about that idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there should be some sort of </v>

28
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.521
<v Speaker 2>regulation like rules as to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutes something that can pull you </v>

29
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 2>off of the social media platform by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>

30
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by the law.</v>

31
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 2>That's unconscionable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unconscionable.</v>

32
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is it constable that someone can </v>

33
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.570
<v Speaker 2>just decide based on their political </v>
<v Speaker 2>affiliation that they don't like the way</v>

34
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:30.100
<v Speaker 2>someone is talking and pull them off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>plan?</v>

35
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.970
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in freedom of association,</v>

36
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:34.790
<v Speaker 1>which means if you want to dissociate </v>
<v Speaker 1>from anyone at any time,</v>

37
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:36.410
<v Speaker 1>not only do you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it,</v>

38
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.210
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't even have to give a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

39
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.870
<v Speaker 1>It's up to you.</v>

40
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Is that what's happening when you pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone off of a social media platform </v>

41
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 2>is just this association?</v>

42
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also.</v>

43
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>being honest and upfront about why </v>

44
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

45
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 1>so they're being deceptive because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying they're being objective.</v>

46
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>If they want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

47
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>the cost of having this person on </v>
<v Speaker 1>outweighs the benefit.</v>

48
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can wrap your head around it,</v>

49
00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>but they twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

50
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 1>twitter especially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

51
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:04.761
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to tell you what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules are because then people will be </v>

52
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:04.761
<v Speaker 1>able to exploit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

53
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you tell us what the rules are,</v>

54
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can follow them and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to live in fear.</v>

55
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>That is a hilarious way of interpreting </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

56
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>People would exploit those rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the quote from Jack Dorsey.</v>

57
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>That is a ridiculous quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.110
<v Speaker 2>What about following the rules?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

59
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 2>guidelines are supposed to be there so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't step outside of it.</v>

60
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.570
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to that way.</v>

61
00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:27.571
<v Speaker 1>You can also say we're being objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like we're following these </v>

62
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:28.160
<v Speaker 1>guidelines that we set that are open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think</v>

63
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.460
<v Speaker 2>perhaps something that was brought to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them by lawyers with Laura's like </v>

64
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you tell them what they can and</v>

65
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:39.851
<v Speaker 2>can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more difficult it's going to be to </v>

66
00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:39.851
<v Speaker 2>justify kicking someone off?</v>

67
00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have their hardcore agenda </v>

68
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>and this way they can cover their </v>
<v Speaker 1>tracks.</v>

69
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is the lawyers at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then they blamed the lawyers.</v>

70
00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>They'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legally we have to x,</v>

71
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Y,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and z.</v>

72
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.830
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

73
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.860
<v Speaker 2>you think it's just they have a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong political leaning and anything </v>

74
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:56.930
<v Speaker 2>that deviates from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to just get removed from the.</v>

75
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say and philosophical,</v>

76
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that they want to,</v>

77
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 3>but they regard as having less </v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimacy.</v>

78
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Do you see the Tucker Carlson show </v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday?</v>

79
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

80
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The big victims.</v>

81
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Jim Acosta?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

82
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's two scenarios.</v>

83
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 3>One is you're not allowed to come to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>house anymore.</v>

84
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 3>The other one is my house is being </v>
<v Speaker 3>surrounded by the purge,</v>

85
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 3>but clearly the first one is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nightmare scenario.</v>

86
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the Jim Acosta one was strange </v>

87
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.980
<v Speaker 3>because Jim Acosta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

88
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.280
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't supposed to be talking then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

89
00:03:25.281 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was interrupting.</v>

90
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 3>He was deciding that he was more </v>
<v Speaker 3>important than the other person who's </v>

91
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

92
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 3>And he was also deciding that he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>more important than everyone else in the</v>

93
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:39.001
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's also deciding that having a </v>

94
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:39.001
<v Speaker 3>White House press the grandchild is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human.</v>

95
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically,</v>

96
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do over your one.</v>

97
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 3>It'll never be taken away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's gotta be some decorum.</v>

98
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

99
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:50.101
<v Speaker 3>their argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would guess I can't speak for Jim </v>

100
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:50.101
<v Speaker 3>Acosta because I could speak in normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>voice,</v>

101
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:54.150
<v Speaker 3>but they're arguing with that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the president has made things so lack of</v>

102
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 3>decor and when she has children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore they're following suit.</v>

103
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.030
<v Speaker 3>So I guess that's real leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this month is really kicking in.</v>

104
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like it?</v>

105
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:05.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot.</v>

106
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.020
<v Speaker 3>A lot of stuff going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Karen got the Taurine it says.</v>

107
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

108
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

109
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 3>it's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

110
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:19.741
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I appreciate the fact that he </v>

111
00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 3>goes out of his way to question the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whitehouse narrative when he goes out of</v>

112
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 3>his way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's his job.</v>

113
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

114
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.170
<v Speaker 3>To,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to put the irons to the president and </v>

115
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 3>get them to answer questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't do that while someone else</v>

116
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 3>is talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other guy had the microphone.</v>

117
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.730
<v Speaker 3>You're the guy was supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking right here.</v>

118
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why I think he is unforgivable </v>

119
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.620
<v Speaker 3>because during the Singapore summit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you had president trump and Kim </v>

120
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 3>Jong Un from North Korea and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>making,</v>

121
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 3>signing a piece of paper and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to kind of hopefully go towards a</v>

122
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 3>peaceful direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cost that gets up and yells,</v>

123
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.010
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

124
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 3>what about Ottawa Beer Marshal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kim Johnson.</v>

125
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.910
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Online beard.</v>

126
00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:54.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like you got this guy who's got 25 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million hostages.</v>

127
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 3>He's hold on taking the first step that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dropping his gun.</v>

128
00:04:57.551 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

129
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 3>what about that kid you killed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about a time and a place?</v>

130
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think Kim Jong Un's speaks </v>
<v Speaker 3>English.</v>

131
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

132
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the guy took wrestling a little </v>

133
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 3>too seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

134
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

135
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of reporters.</v>

136
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 3>I know that our report is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't act like this.</v>

137
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he likes attention and I think </v>

138
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 3>he feels like there's something very </v>
<v Speaker 3>significant about what he's doing.</v>

139
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he also wants to be a martyr.</v>

140
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.620
<v Speaker 3>He wants to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

141
00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 3>like every like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

142
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 3>he's got the weight of the world on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulders in,</v>

143
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 3>but for him we'd be facing Nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

144
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:38.281
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the question is like when does </v>

145
00:05:38.281 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 3>someone get their press credentials </v>
<v Speaker 3>removed from the White House?</v>

146
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:44.821
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when can they no longer have whitehouse </v>

147
00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:44.821
<v Speaker 3>credentials?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When is,</v>

148
00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:48.510
<v Speaker 3>what is what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you have to do to the point </v>

149
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.330
<v Speaker 3>where everyone agrees you're a nuisance </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're interrupting regularly.</v>

150
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.790
<v Speaker 3>CNN could just get someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

151
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.900
<v Speaker 3>Who's not going to scream out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they're trying to block </v>

152
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 3>CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're to this guy like</v>

153
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.660
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

154
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.430
<v Speaker 4>you are interrupting like you're yelling</v>
<v Speaker 4>things out and then what?</v>

155
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 4>Have everyone yelled things out at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same time.</v>

156
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 4>Are you better than everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're not.</v>

157
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 4>You're just a person here and if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just decide,</v>

158
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 4>my opinion in my voice is more </v>
<v Speaker 4>significant than anyone else's will you?</v>

159
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 4>You've thrown everybody else under the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bus the entire rest of the room and the </v>

160
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.601
<v Speaker 4>whole process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember Leslie Stahl had trump on 60 </v>

161
00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:22.601
<v Speaker 4>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that long ago and you know,</v>

162
00:06:22.601 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 4>they're going back and forth and she </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>

163
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

164
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 4>well I don't want to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

165
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 4>this is the fucking president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a reporter.</v>

166
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:32.441
<v Speaker 4>If he wants to talk about it at the very</v>
<v Speaker 4>least it's going to be the president </v>

167
00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:32.441
<v Speaker 4>says x,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Y,</v>

168
00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:32.441
<v Speaker 4>and Z,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so who are you to be like,</v>

169
00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 4>Nigga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut up.</v>

170
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to talk about this.</v>

171
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

172
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the president.</v>

173
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.490
<v Speaker 4>So I think there is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad this is happening because I </v>

174
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 4>think for a long time the press who has </v>
<v Speaker 4>had an agenda since Washington's days as</v>

175
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:48.071
<v Speaker 4>they should have an agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretend that they're honest and </v>

176
00:06:48.071 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 4>objective and they use the veneer of </v>
<v Speaker 4>politeness and civility to be like,</v>

177
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're professional,</v>

178
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:53.780
<v Speaker 4>we're decent people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now the mask is dropping and you see</v>

179
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 4>that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

180
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.690
<v Speaker 4>often lunatics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

181
00:06:56.691 --> 00:07:01.691
<v Speaker 4>I was watching this piece on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really wish I remember what it was on,</v>

182
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.660
<v Speaker 4>but it was on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

183
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.710
<v Speaker 4>maybe I was listening to it either way </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was on the news and when the news </v>

184
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 4>started becoming an entertainment </v>
<v Speaker 4>program versus when it was just,</v>

185
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.780
<v Speaker 4>here's the events of the day and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

186
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 4>this is what the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the significance of these events could </v>

187
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.500
<v Speaker 4>be and this is the impact it could have </v>
<v Speaker 4>on our society.</v>

188
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 4>Instead it just became this really </v>
<v Speaker 4>flamboyant,</v>

189
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.860
<v Speaker 4>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

190
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 4>If it bleeds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it leads and it became entertainment and</v>

191
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.760
<v Speaker 4>they really nail it down to 60 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were saying when 60 minutes became </v>

192
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:40.640
<v Speaker 4>a hugely successful financial show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's that in the seventies then?</v>

193
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.490
<v Speaker 4>Somewhere around there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right when was 60 minutes.</v>

194
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 4>It's been around for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long time,</v>

195
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 4>long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long time.</v>

196
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 4>But when 60 minutes became a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a hit show,</v>

197
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 4>like big advertiser money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

198
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire country would watch it and </v>

199
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.771
<v Speaker 4>then that sort of changed the way they </v>
<v Speaker 4>viewed the news because now they've </v>

200
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.550
<v Speaker 4>viewed the news as a potentially </v>
<v Speaker 4>profitable venture.</v>

201
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.350
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>

202
00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:08.351
<v Speaker 4>once I realized that people can clearly </v>
<v Speaker 4>affiliate with one side versus another </v>

203
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:11.000
<v Speaker 4>side and they want that and their news </v>
<v Speaker 4>coverage,</v>

204
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.020
<v Speaker 4>then you get the Weird Fox News slash </v>
<v Speaker 4>CNN bias,</v>

205
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:20.410
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is one of the weirdest polar like </v>

206
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:20.410
<v Speaker 4>distinctions.</v>

207
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:25.360
<v Speaker 4>If you watch the news,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you watch television during the </v>

208
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:25.790
<v Speaker 4>elections particular anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>really significant going on.</v>

209
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.780
<v Speaker 4>You go back and forth between.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The two of them were like,</v>

210
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.280
<v Speaker 4>are we just separate universes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

211
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:35.590
<v Speaker 4>Scott Adams has that metaphor which is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're looking at one movie screen </v>

212
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.761
<v Speaker 4>and there's two movies in one movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>screen that different people see this </v>

213
00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:40.250
<v Speaker 4>exact same data and see different </v>
<v Speaker 4>conclusions.</v>

214
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.700
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think I don't think we need to </v>

215
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.361
<v Speaker 4>be all united.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people should like what they </v>

216
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:50.270
<v Speaker 4>like and the idea that we all got a </v>
<v Speaker 4>great and everything is totalitarianism.</v>

217
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I definitely think that we should</v>

218
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 4>be able to enjoy what we enjoy and</v>

219
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 2>we should lean whatever way we choose to</v>
<v Speaker 2>lean.</v>

220
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.320
<v Speaker 2>I think the issue with the news though </v>
<v Speaker 2>is when it's just straight up </v>

221
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:03.320
<v Speaker 2>propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

222
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.790
<v Speaker 2>Like when is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when is this actually the real objective</v>

223
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:10.791
<v Speaker 2>version of the events or when are they </v>
<v Speaker 2>deleting and editing stuff out and </v>

224
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 2>adding things to concentrating on one </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe possibly insignificant thing,</v>

225
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.660
<v Speaker 2>but pumping it up to be more than it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then it changes the narrative </v>

226
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:20.660
<v Speaker 2>for their side.</v>

227
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this morning I,</v>

228
00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I went after some dimwit from Memphis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

229
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.290
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from NBC,</v>

230
00:09:24.291 --> 00:09:29.291
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the worst attack by the White </v>

231
00:09:29.291 --> 00:09:29.291
<v Speaker 1>House and the press freedoms in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

232
00:09:29.291 --> 00:09:33.491
<v Speaker 1>John Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second precedent put journalists in </v>

233
00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:33.491
<v Speaker 1>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did Lincoln.</v>

234
00:09:33.491 --> 00:09:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you could say it's the civil </v>

235
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.071
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there have been many cases of </v>

236
00:09:39.071 --> 00:09:40.721
<v Speaker 1>attacks on the press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course because everyone is so </v>

237
00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:40.721
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's happening to them,</v>

238
00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:45.280
<v Speaker 1>it's the worst thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is basically the gulag even </v>

239
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:45.280
<v Speaker 1>though they can go on twitter and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>

240
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:45.590
<v Speaker 1>followers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

241
00:09:45.591 --> 00:09:46.880
<v Speaker 1>they're good book deals with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

242
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Is anybody criticizing Jim Acosta from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left?</v>

243
00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Is anybody saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

244
00:09:51.641 --> 00:09:54.040
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what you did,</v>

245
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.080
<v Speaker 2>what you did is out of line.</v>

246
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

247
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I've been having fun in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have not seen that.</v>

248
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I think they have been running </v>
<v Speaker 1>interference because I do think that the</v>

249
00:10:02.961 --> 00:10:04.790
<v Speaker 1>press corps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any organization you work with,</v>

250
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:09.791
<v Speaker 1>some of the side by side every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be friendly with them </v>

251
00:10:09.791 --> 00:10:09.791
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do think they,</v>

252
00:10:09.791 --> 00:10:14.240
<v Speaker 1>there is very much obviously acrimony </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Sarah Sanders and the White </v>

253
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.700
<v Speaker 1>House press corps and she's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulting and hostile to them and you </v>

254
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.301
<v Speaker 1>could say it's deserved or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course they're going to kind of </v>

255
00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:22.301
<v Speaker 1>team up together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

256
00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:25.900
<v Speaker 1>lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just trying to do our job and </v>

257
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:25.900
<v Speaker 1>you're just spitting on our face every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single day.</v>

258
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do these people have,</v>

259
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.850
<v Speaker 1>should have their faces spit it in or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not?</v>

260
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they both suck.</v>

261
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what she's doing sucks.</v>

262
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Like the way she treats people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some shoes,</v>

263
00:10:37.731 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Speaker 2>some fucking school teacher in seventh </v>
<v Speaker 2>grade.</v>

264
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.080
<v Speaker 2>That's what it seems like when Sarah's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing those,</v>

265
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 2>those White House press things.</v>

266
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:50.770
<v Speaker 1>I Love Venom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I love that the venom is flowing in </v>

267
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.060
<v Speaker 1>both directions and the mid like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>

268
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:58.450
<v Speaker 1>I think people get over politically by </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying let's all get along and then </v>

269
00:10:58.761 --> 00:11:03.761
<v Speaker 1>people who don't get along or </v>
<v Speaker 1>marginalized and those are the ones who </v>

270
00:11:03.761 --> 00:11:06.371
<v Speaker 1>innovate things that the troublemakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other ones who move culture and move </v>

271
00:11:06.371 --> 00:11:07.040
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whenever everyone gets together,</v>

272
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:07.240
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

273
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.660
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of us agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then where fits venom.</v>

274
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

275
00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:16.301
<v Speaker 1>if this country has been at least two </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture since the beginning and it only </v>

276
00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:20.110
<v Speaker 1>stayed one because one conquered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and held it under martial law for </v>

277
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.321
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason for us to be one </v>

278
00:11:23.321 --> 00:11:23.321
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

279
00:11:23.321 --> 00:11:23.840
<v Speaker 1>when everyone hates each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

280
00:11:23.841 --> 00:11:24.950
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a divorce.</v>

281
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.980
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just if you want to separate it out</v>

282
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.920
<v Speaker 1>America to different parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone get along a lot nicer.</v>

283
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:36.150
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean like make separate countries </v>

284
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.750
<v Speaker 2>out of America?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course like Europe.</v>

285
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you looked at the size of Europe</v>

286
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:44.991
<v Speaker 2>and the relative size of countries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how easy it is to travel from one </v>

287
00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:48.441
<v Speaker 2>country to another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make a real honest comparison </v>

288
00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:51.651
<v Speaker 2>between Texas and New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they basically are different </v>

289
00:11:51.651 --> 00:11:51.651
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>

290
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's because we all speak</v>

291
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.980
<v Speaker 3>English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it seems like we're one we're united </v>

292
00:11:58.980 --> 00:11:58.980
<v Speaker 3>on and like why does this have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>this way?</v>

293
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because Texas will start invading.</v>

294
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:05.521
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

295
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.870
<v Speaker 3>Prison will just steal New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like whose garden it?</v>

296
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:16.540
<v Speaker 3>That's ours now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they'll just start marching </v>

297
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.471
<v Speaker 3>their way through Phoenix and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fucking disaster waiting to </v>

298
00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:22.651
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is a disaster that's </v>

299
00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:22.651
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

300
00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:25.710
<v Speaker 3>And I think the acrimony which I enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 3>on some level because I think it's </v>

301
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:26.680
<v Speaker 3>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to get much worse.</v>

302
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:32.130
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes you think he's going to get </v>

303
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.751
<v Speaker 3>worse?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think both sides are just </v>

304
00:12:33.751 --> 00:12:33.780
<v Speaker 3>doubling down both sides left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

305
00:12:33.781 --> 00:12:37.930
<v Speaker 3>I very much doubling down the right has </v>
<v Speaker 3>become radicalized as function of trump.</v>

306
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:42.400
<v Speaker 3>The left has been radicalized for </v>
<v Speaker 3>decades and there's no look,</v>

307
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.110
<v Speaker 3>here's what happened with capital </v>
<v Speaker 3>hearings.</v>

308
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.200
<v Speaker 3>Either this very innocent family man has</v>
<v Speaker 3>been railroaded completely by shameless </v>

309
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.600
<v Speaker 3>leftist or someone who is quite possibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rapist,</v>

310
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.430
<v Speaker 3>was nominated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was puts us supreme court,</v>

311
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without being.</v>

312
00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:01.260
<v Speaker 3>And everyone knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no in between and when you </v>

313
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.700
<v Speaker 3>have one event and two completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>obscenely different perspectives,</v>

314
00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 3>meeting each side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sees the others have seen,</v>

315
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:07.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't see where you get together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

316
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:12.540
<v Speaker 3>don't you have a different perspective </v>
<v Speaker 3>on it than either one of those polar </v>

317
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 3>burn it all down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody been with Kevin.</v>

318
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

319
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:20.970
<v Speaker 3>my perspective is I don't agree with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>constitution or regardless Valis I don't</v>

320
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 3>care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

321
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.330
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

322
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how I would vote if our </v>
<v Speaker 3>center,</v>

323
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 3>to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

324
00:13:27.251 --> 00:13:31.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she was lying a Dr Ford </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously sweat.</v>

325
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Nick I think was lying in the one who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

326
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to 10 parties and kept getting </v>

327
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:37.920
<v Speaker 3>gang raped a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a certain point,</v>

328
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like there was two different </v>

329
00:13:41.281 --> 00:13:41.460
<v Speaker 3>women that had absolutely fabricated </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories that.</v>

330
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.070
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't mean Dr Ford's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fabricated,</v>

331
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't,</v>

332
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.090
<v Speaker 3>but it just shows you that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

333
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.140
<v Speaker 3>that whole zoo can get pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty smelling.</v>

334
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:55.260
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine any job on earth where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to be talking about your </v>

335
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.670
<v Speaker 3>yearbook quotes and I don't run it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that 30 plus years later,</v>

336
00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.750
<v Speaker 3>30 plus years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

337
00:13:58.751 --> 00:14:01.240
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's the issue with Kevin.</v>

338
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.150
<v Speaker 3>This is why I think it's really unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

339
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.610
<v Speaker 3>how come they're not asking him to step?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he had,</v>

340
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.440
<v Speaker 3>why didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one asked him to step down from.</v>

341
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.450
<v Speaker 3>He was already on the court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just want to supreme court.</v>

342
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.790
<v Speaker 3>If you believed all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you ask him to resign,</v>

343
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If this is so serious.</v>

344
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then on top of that,</v>

345
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.160
<v Speaker 3>why didn't they really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the left,</v>

346
00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:26.161
<v Speaker 3>why didn't they go whole hog into all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>his policy decisions which are much eat </v>

347
00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 3>fairer and more Germane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now Dr Ford,</v>

348
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.240
<v Speaker 3>I saw her on the side of a milk carton </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other day.</v>

349
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.180
<v Speaker 3>She's vanished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as soon as her purpose was served,</v>

350
00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:35.470
<v Speaker 3>she's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

351
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.680
<v Speaker 3>she probably wants to vanish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't seem like she was really </v>

352
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.190
<v Speaker 3>enjoying her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wrote that letter in secret and then</v>

353
00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:44.080
<v Speaker 3>there's the whole investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did this become public?</v>

354
00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:49.081
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want this to be public and I </v>

355
00:14:49.081 --> 00:14:49.081
<v Speaker 3>believe her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't.</v>

356
00:14:49.081 --> 00:14:52.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone want this </v>
<v Speaker 3>testifying from the Senate in a hearing </v>

357
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

358
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.930
<v Speaker 4>that where the knives are out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's terrifying.</v>

359
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.960
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a few people that would enjoy </v>

360
00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:58.960
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

361
00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:58.960
<v Speaker 4>to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not her,</v>

362
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.980
<v Speaker 4>not her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She didn't seem like it and she didn't </v>

363
00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:02.980
<v Speaker 4>see it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

364
00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that she was lying either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also boy,</v>

365
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to get,</v>

366
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:13.810
<v Speaker 4>you want to go into what we understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We actually understand about the human </v>

367
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.681
<v Speaker 4>memory and you want to stand in front of</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

368
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:23.801
<v Speaker 4>many people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>millions worldwide with incredible </v>

369
00:15:23.801 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 4>consequences on the line and relay </v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

370
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.490
<v Speaker 4>these memories from 30 plus years ago </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you mean you're not even the same </v>

371
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:33.410
<v Speaker 4>human being as you were when you were 17</v>
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>

372
00:15:33.411 --> 00:15:37.360
<v Speaker 4>It's just like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even have memories of being 17.</v>

373
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 4>I have memories of things that I've told</v>
<v Speaker 4>about my memories.</v>

374
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean,</v>

375
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:46.240
<v Speaker 4>like you of course you remember the </v>
<v Speaker 4>story teller.</v>

376
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You tell stories of what you remember,</v>

377
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:53.531
<v Speaker 4>but if I had to like give you the real </v>
<v Speaker 4>solid memories that are unquestionable </v>

378
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:59.960
<v Speaker 4>about my 17th year of life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking shaky shit.</v>

379
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:05.140
<v Speaker 4>Real shaky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously nobody tried to hold my mouth </v>

380
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.321
<v Speaker 4>closed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck me on a bed and some weird party </v>

381
00:16:08.321 --> 00:16:08.321
<v Speaker 4>when I was half drunk and I really </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to go home.</v>

382
00:16:08.321 --> 00:16:10.160
<v Speaker 4>Not that you remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it happened.</v>

383
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.500
<v Speaker 4>Pretty sure it didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

384
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.570
<v Speaker 4>but I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't testify.</v>

385
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.520
<v Speaker 4>And in all fairness to her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

386
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.760
<v Speaker 4>trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

387
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.780
<v Speaker 4>if I'm using the word loosely also </v>
<v Speaker 4>things get mixed up and things like </v>

388
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.951
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are people who think she's a </v>

389
00:16:26.951 --> 00:16:29.591
<v Speaker 4>complete fraud and thought she knew she </v>
<v Speaker 4>was going to get money from go fund me </v>

390
00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:29.600
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't say it.</v>

391
00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.070
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

392
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't think a 55 year old professor </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows how crowdfunding works.</v>

393
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

394
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.870
<v Speaker 4>one thing that I did see that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating though was the,</v>

395
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:44.030
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the university that she teaches a is so </v>

396
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.130
<v Speaker 4>heavily skewed towards women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's almost,</v>

397
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:51.370
<v Speaker 4>I think it's 70 something percent female</v>
<v Speaker 4>students and a high percentage of uh,</v>

398
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.520
<v Speaker 4>like predominantly female professors as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

399
00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:01.180
<v Speaker 4>And their whole thing is social justice </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's there when you know their lists </v>

400
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:07.661
<v Speaker 4>or objectives as far as education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like social justice is number one.</v>

401
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.360
<v Speaker 4>It's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the thing that they emphasize </v>

402
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:13.360
<v Speaker 4>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's it going to be?</v>

403
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.030
<v Speaker 4>Architecture education.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

404
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:22.060
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think universities are there to </v>

405
00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:22.130
<v Speaker 4>promulgate and ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

406
00:17:22.131 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 4>But they literally framed it as social </v>
<v Speaker 4>justice and that does that term today is</v>

407
00:17:26.751 --> 00:17:28.580
<v Speaker 4>so fraught with peril.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

408
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the enemy.</v>

409
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such a goofy term,</v>

410
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.800
<v Speaker 4>like social justice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it,</v>

411
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.940
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's such a blanket term and so all </v>

412
00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:39.030
<v Speaker 4>encompassing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

413
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:44.100
<v Speaker 4>you hear it and you start thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>people banging on Tucker Carlson's door </v>

414
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:44.570
<v Speaker 4>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know where you sleep.</v>

415
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.740
<v Speaker 4>That's what I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean.</v>

416
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:46.440
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

417
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:51.490
<v Speaker 4>And here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I was just talking about just a </v>

418
00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.680
<v Speaker 4>couple of ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it means 90 percent of people have </v>

419
00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.091
<v Speaker 4>agreed that 10 percent or don't agree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to be shut down because we're </v>

420
00:17:56.091 --> 00:17:56.091
<v Speaker 4>talking about social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

421
00:17:56.091 --> 00:17:58.410
<v Speaker 4>there's no such thing as individual </v>
<v Speaker 4>justice because that's subordinate.</v>

422
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.040
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what percentage of </v>

423
00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:04.710
<v Speaker 4>people would agree with banging on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy's house,</v>

424
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.010
<v Speaker 4>like knocking on his door and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know where your sleep.</v>

425
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you,</v>

426
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 4>this is a form of mental terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're threatening him.</v>

427
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 4>You're scaring him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think most people are capable of</v>

428
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:19.800
<v Speaker 4>empathy by which they mean they can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>put themselves in tucker shoes.</v>

429
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.200
<v Speaker 4>So all they see is someone I hate had </v>
<v Speaker 4>something bad happens.</v>

430
00:18:23.201 --> 00:18:25.950
<v Speaker 4>I him good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they don't understand.</v>

431
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:30.090
<v Speaker 4>Like when these Republicans are saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's okay to torture terrorists.</v>

432
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:35.180
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the point I make is there's people </v>

433
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:35.180
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

434
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:35.280
<v Speaker 4>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ian Black,</v>

435
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:40.340
<v Speaker 4>or will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tweet out every day the NRA is a </v>

436
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.251
<v Speaker 4>terrorist organization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happens when the government </v>

437
00:18:43.251 --> 00:18:44.190
<v Speaker 4>defines you as a terrorist?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you're gonna say,</v>

438
00:18:44.191 --> 00:18:49.191
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it never happened to me that that's not </v>

439
00:18:49.191 --> 00:18:49.191
<v Speaker 4>how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the fear.</v>

440
00:18:49.191 --> 00:18:49.590
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

441
00:18:49.591 --> 00:18:54.591
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to have principals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to apply them to people that </v>

442
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:57.081
<v Speaker 4>you hate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Tucker Carlson is hardly some Nazi </v>

443
00:18:57.081 --> 00:19:00.240
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tucker Carlson is,</v>

444
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 4>if you think that he has ideas that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>questionable,</v>

445
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.520
<v Speaker 4>the solution is to present better ideas </v>
<v Speaker 4>and to debate him and to go back and </v>

446
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:15.741
<v Speaker 4>forth with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Tucker Cross is not leading some </v>

447
00:19:15.741 --> 00:19:17.751
<v Speaker 4>hate mom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not the centerpiece in </v>

448
00:19:17.751 --> 00:19:19.620
<v Speaker 4>Charlottesville for the extermination of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Jews or he's not that radical.</v>

449
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.450
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just a right wing guy.</v>

450
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:22.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they,</v>

451
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:27.260
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what critical theory allows them to do </v>

452
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:27.260
<v Speaker 4>is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

453
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.260
<v Speaker 4>you can read between the lines and </v>
<v Speaker 4>ascribe intent to the person.</v>

454
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.220
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you read a book,</v>

455
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:29.640
<v Speaker 4>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

456
00:19:29.641 --> 00:19:30.540
<v Speaker 4>this is race because x,</v>
<v Speaker 4>y,</v>

457
00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:32.280
<v Speaker 4>and z reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they can easily say,</v>

458
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.510
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he says a,</v>

459
00:19:33.511 --> 00:19:34.680
<v Speaker 4>B and c,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he means x,</v>

460
00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:35.190
<v Speaker 4>Y,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and z.</v>

461
00:19:35.191 --> 00:19:40.191
<v Speaker 4>So these are all dog whistles and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can impugn whatever motives you want </v>

462
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:40.191
<v Speaker 4>onto a person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

463
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:42.840
<v Speaker 4>and at that point you could do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want and the thing is,</v>

464
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:47.841
<v Speaker 4>he's a dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so not only you have to be comfortable </v>

465
00:19:47.841 --> 00:19:47.841
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with fucking,</v>

466
00:19:47.841 --> 00:19:51.741
<v Speaker 4>with Tucker Carlson's house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to be comfortable with the </v>

467
00:19:51.741 --> 00:19:51.741
<v Speaker 4>scaring as kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

468
00:19:51.741 --> 00:19:55.190
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think the history of totalitarian </v>

469
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.400
<v Speaker 4>and totalitarianism shows us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're more than happy to sacrifice the</v>

470
00:19:56.401 --> 00:20:01.401
<v Speaker 4>kids to get their goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just really disturbing to me </v>

471
00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:04.650
<v Speaker 4>because I think these idealistic kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are doing this,</v>

472
00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:09.651
<v Speaker 4>they're mostly young people have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamental lack of understanding when </v>

473
00:20:09.651 --> 00:20:12.380
<v Speaker 4>it comes to what violence is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what causes violence.</v>

474
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.770
<v Speaker 4>This is intentional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how,</v>

475
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.800
<v Speaker 4>how close that scene was to violence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

476
00:20:16.801 --> 00:20:18.840
<v Speaker 4>because you do that to the wrong guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>door.</v>

477
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.620
<v Speaker 4>He's going to come out with a baseball </v>
<v Speaker 4>bat or a gun and he's going to kill some</v>

478
00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:24.500
<v Speaker 4>people or smash some people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

479
00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.490
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it absolutely can happen.</v>

480
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.220
<v Speaker 4>It's not likely to happen with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>garlic Tucker Carlson.</v>

481
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:34.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if they decided to go after the </v>

482
00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:34.450
<v Speaker 4>wrong general?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or what if they decided to go after the.</v>

483
00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:39.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything can happen in these situations </v>

484
00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:39.010
<v Speaker 4>and also those people are all going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get outed.</v>

485
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.390
<v Speaker 4>Once those people are out at the outrage</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're going to experience is </v>

486
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.140
<v Speaker 4>going to be an handleable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

487
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.140
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be unmanageable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The</v>

488
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:52.460
<v Speaker 2>the amount of people that are furious at</v>
<v Speaker 2>that group of 20 or what?</v>

489
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:53.830
<v Speaker 2>How many people was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

490
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.260
<v Speaker 2>it was plenty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm angry.</v>

491
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not going to do anything but </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm angry.</v>

492
00:20:58.271 --> 00:20:59.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it was disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

493
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:05.280
<v Speaker 2>if I'm angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many really loosely held people.</v>

494
00:21:05.771 --> 00:21:09.010
<v Speaker 2>People that are just like really barely </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it in together already,</v>

495
00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:14.150
<v Speaker 2>but here's the scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not those 20 that aren't going to </v>

496
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.441
<v Speaker 2>have the consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be people who think like </v>

497
00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:16.441
<v Speaker 2>them who haven't done what they did and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's going to be like,</v>

498
00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you agree with this that it's.</v>

499
00:21:17.201 --> 00:21:22.201
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to be them to what's </v>

500
00:21:22.201 --> 00:21:22.201
<v Speaker 2>going to be both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

501
00:21:22.201 --> 00:21:24.160
<v Speaker 2>I think those people don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>like people are gonna find their names.</v>

502
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.130
<v Speaker 2>They're going to find where they live </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's going to be people that have</v>

503
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:30.650
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not Tucker Carlson and it's not them and</v>

504
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.300
<v Speaker 2>these people are going to seek them out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're gonna.</v>

505
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:38.370
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna get ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just bang on people's doors </v>

506
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:38.370
<v Speaker 2>like that and scare them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

507
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Because people get furious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when there's not enough.</v>

508
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.560
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not a bad guy.</v>

509
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Tucker Carlson is not some evil demon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

510
00:21:47.781 --> 00:21:52.781
<v Speaker 2>like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you looked at who he is and what he </v>

511
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:53.680
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you pulled out the worst shit that he</v>

512
00:21:53.681 --> 00:21:58.681
<v Speaker 2>said and and taken it in comparison to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the woman that we were talking about </v>

513
00:21:58.681 --> 00:22:00.010
<v Speaker 2>from Msnbc that's still in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan Reed,</v>

514
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:05.190
<v Speaker 2>who lied about her blog being hacked and</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter lied just to try to cover up for</v>

515
00:22:07.421 --> 00:22:11.740
<v Speaker 2>the fact that she said some blatantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>homophobic things in the past and called</v>

516
00:22:11.741 --> 00:22:14.830
<v Speaker 2>it and called him the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking insane.</v>

517
00:22:14.831 --> 00:22:19.090
<v Speaker 2>That should be a federal crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You removing resources right from people</v>

518
00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:24.091
<v Speaker 2>that are already on very serious cases </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are already trying to solve real </v>

519
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.670
<v Speaker 2>real crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>save people's lives,</v>

520
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:32.790
<v Speaker 2>save people's safety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're deciding that your job at </v>

521
00:22:32.981 --> 00:22:36.640
<v Speaker 2>msnbc is more important than that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she hasn't even fired.</v>

522
00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Lauren saw Donald tweeted out not that </v>
<v Speaker 2>long ago,</v>

523
00:22:38.681 --> 00:22:42.430
<v Speaker 2>something akin to regarding to trump if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're interfering with the FBI,</v>

524
00:22:42.431 --> 00:22:44.770
<v Speaker 2>that should be a federal crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said she works down the hall.</v>

525
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.500
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a coworker.</v>

526
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

527
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:54.010
<v Speaker 2>But because she's African American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just stepping away from it.</v>

528
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.530
<v Speaker 2>They're letting it go because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be called racist.</v>

529
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's that so much as </v>
<v Speaker 2>people cover their own.</v>

530
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't always cover their own.</v>

531
00:23:01.701 --> 00:23:03.970
<v Speaker 2>They got rid of Al Sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Al Sharpton.</v>

532
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.060
<v Speaker 2>Al Franken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got rid of him pretty quick,</v>

533
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.820
<v Speaker 2>but that's the senate I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're still left wing.</v>

534
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

535
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.510
<v Speaker 2>that they're covered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're on all men.</v>

536
00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.500
<v Speaker 2>MSNBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

537
00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:14.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my.</v>

538
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:19.560
<v Speaker 2>My point is like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that lady should be </v>

539
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:19.560
<v Speaker 2>fired.</v>

540
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.400
<v Speaker 2>I think she should be able to say she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry for shit that she wrote.</v>

541
00:23:21.401 --> 00:23:23.050
<v Speaker 2>That was insensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

542
00:23:23.051 --> 00:23:24.580
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

543
00:23:24.581 --> 00:23:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Brian Williams guy who was completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>full of shit is still in the air.</v>

544
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.370
<v Speaker 2>You don't just lie once about something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

545
00:23:30.371 --> 00:23:32.290
<v Speaker 2>It's probably been line his whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

546
00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.950
<v Speaker 2>it's the degree of the lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one thing to say,</v>

547
00:23:35.951 --> 00:23:36.760
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this.</v>

548
00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to be like,</v>

549
00:23:37.781 --> 00:23:39.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was getting shot at.</v>

550
00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:41.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine.</v>

551
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.460
<v Speaker 2>I was just talking about lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>empathy.</v>

552
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine being in a situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm on television and I'm saying</v>

553
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.990
<v Speaker 1>things that are so removed from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

554
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

555
00:23:49.031 --> 00:23:50.380
<v Speaker 1>I can't wrap my head around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

556
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Hillary did the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's a congenital iris as a.</v>

557
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.430
<v Speaker 1>She was referred to by the New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>Times back in the day</v>

558
00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:56.820
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rightly so,</v>

559
00:23:56.821 --> 00:23:58.440
<v Speaker 2>but she.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People forget this.</v>

560
00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.080
<v Speaker 2>She did talk about a firefight that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in.</v>

561
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:04.650
<v Speaker 1>It was under sniper fire and the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about that that people didn't give</v>

562
00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:06.030
<v Speaker 1>a shit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said when she was in Boston,</v>

563
00:24:06.031 --> 00:24:07.290
<v Speaker 1>she was under sniper fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

564
00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:12.560
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were throwing the secret service and </v>

565
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.111
<v Speaker 1>the bus because what kind of secrets </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface is going to let the first lady </v>

566
00:24:15.111 --> 00:24:18.420
<v Speaker 1>run under sniper fire and there has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she just basically did a double talk</v>

567
00:24:18.421 --> 00:24:23.421
<v Speaker 1>around that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's got a lot of whoppers in her </v>

568
00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:23.421
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said she was named after Hillary,</v>

569
00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Edmund Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though he climbed Mount Everest </v>

570
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 1>after she was born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's,</v>

571
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

572
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.200
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that woman.</v>

573
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I love her so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the funniest person on earth.</v>

574
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.560
<v Speaker 1>She's a scary lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like a slinky.</v>

575
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.300
<v Speaker 1>She's always falling down the stairs.</v>

576
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

577
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.300
<v Speaker 2>She's the human slave called dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

578
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.400
<v Speaker 2>she's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an odd duck.</v>

579
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:46.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things where women </v>

580
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.400
<v Speaker 2>want a woman to be president so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want one for the team so bad.</v>

581
00:24:47.401 --> 00:24:52.401
<v Speaker 2>And then there's so many people from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left thinks she has the best chance of </v>

582
00:24:52.401 --> 00:24:54.000
<v Speaker 2>beating trump or whoever is on the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they want her so bad.</v>

583
00:24:54.001 --> 00:24:55.680
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're willing to exonerate her.</v>

584
00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:01.250
<v Speaker 2>So many different horrendous things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I always point </v>

585
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.440
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people want to talk progressive,</v>

586
00:25:01.441 --> 00:25:02.340
<v Speaker 2>they want you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to talk,</v>

587
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being left wing.</v>

588
00:25:04.291 --> 00:25:08.850
<v Speaker 2>And she didn't even believe in gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage until 2013</v>

589
00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:14.140
<v Speaker 1>best part was she was on NPR,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this far left far right fringe </v>

590
00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:14.140
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

591
00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.130
<v Speaker 1>NPR,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terry Gross.</v>

592
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.580
<v Speaker 1>And Terry Gross says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be against gay marriage.</v>

593
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:19.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your husband passed Doma,</v>

594
00:25:19.811 --> 00:25:24.811
<v Speaker 1>which made it a federal law that gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage won't be recognized by the </v>

595
00:25:24.811 --> 00:25:24.811
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

596
00:25:24.811 --> 00:25:24.811
<v Speaker 1>and you change your position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

597
00:25:24.811 --> 00:25:29.460
<v Speaker 1>how did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it because Americans became a </v>

598
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:29.460
<v Speaker 1>hillary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

599
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:29.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America changed their point of view.</v>

600
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:29.460
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

601
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:34.080
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand Americans change their </v>

602
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:34.080
<v Speaker 1>point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was your mental process?</v>

603
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:34.180
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

604
00:25:34.181 --> 00:25:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Terry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying that I changed my mind for</v>

605
00:25:37.481 --> 00:25:39.930
<v Speaker 1>political purposes and that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

606
00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.940
<v Speaker 1>she starts yelling at her and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

607
00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:47.941
<v Speaker 1>you're at NPR and you think they're too </v>
<v Speaker 1>right wing for you because they're </v>

608
00:25:47.941 --> 00:25:47.941
<v Speaker 1>calling you out on your bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking loon.</v>

609
00:25:47.941 --> 00:25:52.320
<v Speaker 1>But the worst part is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one Ito Broderick on my show two </v>

610
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.020
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago and she's the one who accused </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton of raping her.</v>

611
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.440
<v Speaker 1>And I asked her who was worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton or Hillary?</v>

612
00:25:56.441 --> 00:25:57.100
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary.</v>

613
00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.280
<v Speaker 1>She said she's the one who knew what was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on and let them get away with it.</v>

614
00:26:00.281 --> 00:26:02.410
<v Speaker 1>So that was scary to hear.</v>

615
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that got me was when they were</v>

616
00:26:06.641 --> 00:26:09.460
<v Speaker 2>confronting bill recently about Monica </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lewinsky,</v>

617
00:26:09.461 --> 00:26:11.830
<v Speaker 2>and they asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you owe her an apology?</v>

618
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was like a bed.</v>

619
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:15.280
<v Speaker 2>But if things that I got out of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>free,</v>

620
00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.500
<v Speaker 2>your crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something that I was.</v>

621
00:26:17.501 --> 00:26:19.790
<v Speaker 2>I left the White House millions dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

622
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.430
<v Speaker 2>And he stole the furniture and they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to return it.</v>

623
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.750
<v Speaker 1>And they stole the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They looted the White House.</v>

624
00:26:24.751 --> 00:26:25.980
<v Speaker 1>They have to return all the shit they </v>
<v Speaker 1>stole.</v>

625
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a book called final exit written</v>

626
00:26:28.171 --> 00:26:29.760
<v Speaker 1>by Barbara Olson who died in nine slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

627
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.650
<v Speaker 1>and it's all about they fucking stole </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

628
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the staff also popped out all the </v>

629
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:36.770
<v Speaker 1>w's of the keyboards.</v>

630
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:37.210
<v Speaker 2>So the George Bush office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people could use them.</v>

631
00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:39.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went out there like assholes.</v>

632
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.190
<v Speaker 2>They pop it up.</v>

633
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.970
<v Speaker 4>That's actually kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was actually kind of funny.</v>

634
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.380
<v Speaker 4>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a a good little.</v>

635
00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:50.390
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

636
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:55.550
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that this guy would in </v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in today's political climate </v>

637
00:26:56.431 --> 00:27:01.431
<v Speaker 4>and dealing with me too and all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>various scandals that have been going </v>

638
00:27:01.431 --> 00:27:06.201
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rapist exposed that this guy who if all </v>

639
00:27:06.201 --> 00:27:11.181
<v Speaker 4>that shit was going on today with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>likely either be under indictment or at </v>

640
00:27:11.181 --> 00:27:14.970
<v Speaker 4>the very least under heavy investigation</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sexual assault,</v>

641
00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.560
<v Speaker 4>but because it's so long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems to be like this weird sort of </v>

642
00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.050
<v Speaker 4>gray area that he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what her.</v>

643
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:27.140
<v Speaker 4>An apology you if things that I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>punished like you weren't punished,</v>

644
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:30.240
<v Speaker 4>like you're worth hundreds of millions </v>
<v Speaker 4>of dollars now.</v>

645
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.970
<v Speaker 4>How?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How are you worth so much money now?</v>

646
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 4>One of the greatest things I remember at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time,</v>

647
00:27:35.191 --> 00:27:40.191
<v Speaker 4>this has been forgotten,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the press likes to throw this under the </v>

648
00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:40.191
<v Speaker 4>rug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sweep it under the rug.</v>

649
00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:41.160
<v Speaker 4>They said at first and Monica Lewinsky </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a stocker.</v>

650
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.340
<v Speaker 4>All of Clinton's goons had gotten the </v>
<v Speaker 4>news channels at the time.</v>

651
00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:46.110
<v Speaker 4>Say she's a lunatic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's a stalker.</v>

652
00:27:46.111 --> 00:27:51.111
<v Speaker 4>They never had an affair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're sitting there and she's like </v>

653
00:27:51.111 --> 00:27:53.271
<v Speaker 4>23.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck do you stuck a precedent </v>

654
00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:53.310
<v Speaker 4>that that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it wasn't for that dress,</v>

655
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.710
<v Speaker 4>let's keep that in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If she didn't have physical evidence,</v>

656
00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:01.130
<v Speaker 4>nothing would have happened to him and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she would be regarded as a loon to this </v>

657
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:02.900
<v Speaker 4>day and she be treat a complete pariah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were ready,</v>

658
00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.190
<v Speaker 4>would have never went public with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was that other lady.</v>

659
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.530
<v Speaker 4>She was forced her to go pump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

660
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.470
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ken Starr found her and he.</v>

661
00:28:08.471 --> 00:28:09.810
<v Speaker 4>He subpoenaed her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

662
00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:11.580
<v Speaker 4>but it was because of that woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Linda Tripp,</v>

663
00:28:11.581 --> 00:28:12.270
<v Speaker 4>Linda Tripp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

664
00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.470
<v Speaker 4>It was her coaxing her to keep the </v>
<v Speaker 4>treasure,</v>

665
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.960
<v Speaker 4>keep the dress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but go public with this and talk about </v>

666
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:20.960
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

667
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:20.960
<v Speaker 4>He was outed by drudge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember,</v>

668
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.520
<v Speaker 4>was that before that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before Linda Tripp was doing all this </v>

669
00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:25.980
<v Speaker 4>light fixture and the trip was coaching </v>
<v Speaker 4>her through the whole thing.</v>

670
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:31.010
<v Speaker 4>Linda Tripp was coaching her privately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is all private drudge broke it </v>

671
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.430
<v Speaker 4>because the press wasn't covering it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't know what to do because this</v>

672
00:28:32.431 --> 00:28:34.020
<v Speaker 4>is a big moment internet history where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

673
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:38.450
<v Speaker 4>this website is revealing information </v>
<v Speaker 4>and now we're going to talk about it.</v>

674
00:28:38.451 --> 00:28:43.451
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was also coming from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Linda TRIPP and I thought Linda tripp </v>

675
00:28:43.451 --> 00:28:44.700
<v Speaker 4>keeping the conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Linda tripp was taping the conversations</v>

676
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:49.760
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know drudge was the one who made all </v>

677
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.791
<v Speaker 4>the shit public.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she was being subpoenaed </v>

678
00:28:52.791 --> 00:28:55.100
<v Speaker 4>privately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was going to drudge and she was </v>

679
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:55.100
<v Speaker 4>leaking and familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that true?</v>

680
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.090
<v Speaker 4>Can you look that up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think Linda TRIPP was linking to</v>

681
00:28:57.091 --> 00:28:58.110
<v Speaker 4>drudge or maybe she was.</v>

682
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.050
<v Speaker 4>I thought the story was A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know though.</v>

683
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:06.140
<v Speaker 4>I thought the story was that she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>coaching Monica Lewinsky and trying to </v>

684
00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:06.930
<v Speaker 4>get her to go public with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's possible,</v>

685
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.770
<v Speaker 4>but Monica didn't go public force </v>
<v Speaker 4>throughout the class and she also did it</v>

686
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:13.620
<v Speaker 4>without Monica's consent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As far as the record.</v>

687
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:15.120
<v Speaker 4>That was true and she went to jail for </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

688
00:29:15.121 --> 00:29:17.630
<v Speaker 4>Didn't she or she was at least arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something happened.</v>

689
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was already at very least arrested </v>

690
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.850
<v Speaker 4>for recording and I consent to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My point was like him sat on television,</v>

691
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:29.090
<v Speaker 4>like the lack of insight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lack of objectivity is his lack of </v>

692
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:33.720
<v Speaker 4>personal objectivity that he's getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>asked this question,</v>

693
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.900
<v Speaker 4>do you or apology that he can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

694
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.670
<v Speaker 4>I made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't have done it.</v>

695
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:43.700
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a bad thing to do and especially </v>

696
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.080
<v Speaker 4>bad thing to do to a 20 year old girl </v>
<v Speaker 4>and have her exposed like that as close </v>

697
00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:46.080
<v Speaker 4>to my daughter's age.</v>

698
00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for him to not say that is like some</v>

699
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:51.570
<v Speaker 4>serious sociopathic shit involved in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

700
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.320
<v Speaker 4>He's never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's his ammo.</v>

701
00:29:53.321 --> 00:29:54.490
<v Speaker 4>He never ever will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>

702
00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:56.860
<v Speaker 4>if you're apologizing there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably legally culpable.</v>

703
00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:01.890
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they were going to get him for </v>

704
00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:01.890
<v Speaker 4>perjury.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Paul and apologies,</v>

705
00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:02.110
<v Speaker 4>that acknowledgement possibly from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Miami,</v>

706
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.700
<v Speaker 4>they pulled this legal license because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this.</v>

707
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:05.770
<v Speaker 4>That was part of the deal and left the </v>
<v Speaker 4>White House.</v>

708
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.140
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

709
00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:10.090
<v Speaker 4>I forgot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

710
00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:11.350
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing's a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then.</v>

711
00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:16.000
<v Speaker 4>And then when Hillary is asked about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that a some sort of abuse of power?</v>

712
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:17.110
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

713
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:19.420
<v Speaker 4>because they're adults.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Monica Lewinsky was an adult.</v>

714
00:30:19.421 --> 00:30:22.990
<v Speaker 4>Choose a comparison to like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>

715
00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:26.170
<v Speaker 4>So the only time there's an abusive </v>
<v Speaker 4>power is when children are involved.</v>

716
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:27.910
<v Speaker 4>Like what the fuck are you talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about?</v>

717
00:30:27.911 --> 00:30:29.500
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes no sense.</v>

718
00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:34.530
<v Speaker 4>But not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is the biggest is the between an </v>

719
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:35.980
<v Speaker 4>intern and the later of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

720
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's no bigger gap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

721
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.290
<v Speaker 4>Forget about like studio executive and </v>
<v Speaker 4>actress,</v>

722
00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's,</v>

723
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:48.300
<v Speaker 4>that's tiny in comparison to the leader </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the world and an intern.</v>

724
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.520
<v Speaker 4>And at the time all the feminist ran </v>
<v Speaker 4>interference for him.</v>

725
00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:53.350
<v Speaker 4>The only one who did it was the craziest</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

726
00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:55.360
<v Speaker 4>Andrea dworkin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she goes,</v>

727
00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.720
<v Speaker 4>we know he's a rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bernita Broderick.</v>

728
00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.860
<v Speaker 4>We know that this was sexual harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>assault,</v>

729
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:04.980
<v Speaker 4>sexual harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone's covering for him and you </v>

730
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:05.140
<v Speaker 4>guys are being complete hypocrites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

731
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.180
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're willing to do that.</v>

732
00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.130
<v Speaker 4>It's tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

733
00:31:09.131 --> 00:31:13.300
<v Speaker 4>but it's so fascinating when you see it </v>
<v Speaker 4>so blatant and so obvious,</v>

734
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.510
<v Speaker 4>but I mean you see it from the right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean she will experience for them.</v>

735
00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.390
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

736
00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:18.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's.</v>

737
00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:21.040
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the human mind convinced it</v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

738
00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:22.690
<v Speaker 4>It makes double standards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I hate you,</v>

739
00:31:22.691 --> 00:31:25.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to believe I know have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies about this.</v>

740
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:30.390
<v Speaker 4>If I hate you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to believe something </v>

741
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:30.390
<v Speaker 4>negative about you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I like you,</v>

742
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to believe a compliment </v>
<v Speaker 4>about you and a more resistant to,</v>

743
00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.240
<v Speaker 4>to a hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something negative about.</v>

744
00:31:34.241 --> 00:31:39.241
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's just how our brain filters </v>

745
00:31:39.241 --> 00:31:39.241
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

746
00:31:39.241 --> 00:31:39.241
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all guilty of it.</v>

747
00:31:39.241 --> 00:31:40.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm guilty of it with my friends for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

748
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:42.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone's mad at my friends,</v>

749
00:31:42.551 --> 00:31:43.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

750
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:45.400
<v Speaker 4>it's nothing I can tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

751
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.030
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

752
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:49.210
<v Speaker 4>I had seven trying to talk shit on one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of my friends and I said,</v>

753
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:51.370
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing you can say that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna.</v>

754
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.430
<v Speaker 4>Make me throw him under the bus to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

755
00:31:54.431 --> 00:31:55.930
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just wasting your breath.</v>

756
00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:57.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's certain friends like yeah,</v>

757
00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.020
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might fuck up,</v>

758
00:31:59.021 --> 00:31:59.890
<v Speaker 4>but they're still my friends.</v>

759
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:00.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to.</v>

760
00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:01.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not hearing it.</v>

761
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's people I know really well.</v>

762
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.920
<v Speaker 4>The real problem with this whole tribal </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing is like it,</v>

763
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:12.930
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me when it comes to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>political tribes and people are so </v>

764
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.730
<v Speaker 4>invested in winning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so sports like yes,</v>

765
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.950
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just so.</v>

766
00:32:17.951 --> 00:32:20.070
<v Speaker 4>It's so strange to see it play out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

767
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:24.340
<v Speaker 4>it's disturbing to me also that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think your life is a function of who the</v>

768
00:32:24.341 --> 00:32:25.420
<v Speaker 4>president is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

769
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.600
<v Speaker 4>And it's just like this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is everything's things be good.</v>

770
00:32:28.601 --> 00:32:31.570
<v Speaker 4>Things could be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This doesn't affect you directly effects</v>

771
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:32.680
<v Speaker 4>you indirectly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

772
00:32:32.681 --> 00:32:34.750
<v Speaker 4>It affects you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

773
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.780
<v Speaker 4>most day to day lives mean hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>S Thompson talked about that back the </v>

774
00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.760
<v Speaker 4>seventies when he was running for </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sheriff,</v>

775
00:32:40.761 --> 00:32:41.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>picking county.</v>

776
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.670
<v Speaker 4>He's saying local politics really affect</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

777
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:52.120
<v Speaker 4>like that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's something that really changes </v>

778
00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:52.120
<v Speaker 4>your life.</v>

779
00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.340
<v Speaker 4>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the day to day happenings of the </v>

780
00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.040
<v Speaker 4>White House,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of it is just you're fixating on </v>

781
00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:57.470
<v Speaker 4>these things that really are probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>never going to have any impact,</v>

782
00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:02.690
<v Speaker 4>but local local stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's the mayor that has a direct impact</v>

783
00:33:02.691 --> 00:33:07.691
<v Speaker 4>on your life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are they going to do with the </v>

784
00:33:07.691 --> 00:33:07.691
<v Speaker 4>streets?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

785
00:33:07.691 --> 00:33:09.851
<v Speaker 4>it's not only the impact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like how much power do you have to </v>

786
00:33:09.851 --> 00:33:10.130
<v Speaker 4>effect change at the local level a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the White House level?</v>

787
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.210
<v Speaker 4>Very little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

788
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:16.480
<v Speaker 4>and we're seeing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really one of the really </v>

789
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.271
<v Speaker 4>fascinating things about trump being </v>
<v Speaker 4>president is how much he's trying to do </v>

790
00:33:19.271 --> 00:33:23.170
<v Speaker 4>and how much he's not able to do and how</v>
<v Speaker 4>much pushback there is and how much he </v>

791
00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:27.311
<v Speaker 4>is able to do and how much outrage there</v>
<v Speaker 4>is about it and how much chaos is </v>

792
00:33:27.311 --> 00:33:27.790
<v Speaker 4>surrounding the whole situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

793
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:33.040
<v Speaker 4>it's fascinating to watch all the safe </v>
<v Speaker 4>check the checks and balances and the </v>

794
00:33:33.201 --> 00:33:38.201
<v Speaker 4>safety procedures that are sort of built</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the system of government act out </v>

795
00:33:38.201 --> 00:33:42.490
<v Speaker 4>and now that like you see the Senate </v>
<v Speaker 4>controlled by the Republicans and the </v>

796
00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:45.320
<v Speaker 4>house controlled by the Democrats like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh Jesus,</v>

797
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:46.880
<v Speaker 4>this is what I was helping for chaos.</v>

798
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:51.940
<v Speaker 4>As much cash as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The shit show and it's going to be more </v>

799
00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.120
<v Speaker 4>of a shit show in the house with trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to pick Pelosi's number two.</v>

800
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

801
00:33:54.891 --> 00:33:57.140
<v Speaker 4>and also to see that trump was saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>nice things.</v>

802
00:33:57.310 --> 00:34:01.040
<v Speaker 4>Polosi hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trolling the fuck at heart woman.</v>

803
00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:03.890
<v Speaker 4>She does a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she really loves our country.</v>

804
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.090
<v Speaker 4>Now that you see what she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

805
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.300
<v Speaker 4>she deserves to be speaker and if the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Democrats won't vote for her,</v>

806
00:34:08.301 --> 00:34:10.970
<v Speaker 4>we'll throw her republican votes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

807
00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:13.370
<v Speaker 4>He said that he tweeted it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>

808
00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:18.460
<v Speaker 4>Growing up like I'm just going to press </v>
<v Speaker 4>some buttons and see what happens.</v>

809
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.870
<v Speaker 4>They all freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

810
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:25.930
<v Speaker 4>It really is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I thought was really </v>

811
00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:28.001
<v Speaker 4>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually enjoyed it when Alec Baldwin </v>

812
00:34:28.001 --> 00:34:28.160
<v Speaker 4>got arrested and they said to trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

813
00:34:28.161 --> 00:34:30.050
<v Speaker 4>Alec Baldwin got arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you feel?</v>

814
00:34:30.051 --> 00:34:32.780
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish them luck and you know how,</v>

815
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:37.870
<v Speaker 4>and I tweeted it out and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet you see an end is going to say </v>

816
00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:37.870
<v Speaker 4>trump refuses to denounce violence in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his hometown.</v>

817
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:42.320
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

818
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.210
<v Speaker 4>the fact that he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

819
00:34:44.211 --> 00:34:45.110
<v Speaker 4>I wish them luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

820
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.180
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just knocked a home,</v>

821
00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:52.181
<v Speaker 4>run out in the parking lot and smashed </v>
<v Speaker 4>every window in the car is parked out </v>

822
00:34:52.181 --> 00:34:56.070
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean with Baldwin getting arrested for </v>

823
00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:57.140
<v Speaker 4>punching someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After all those years of him mocking him</v>

824
00:34:57.141 --> 00:35:00.680
<v Speaker 4>on CNN and on a Saturday night live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

825
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.960
<v Speaker 4>But it's the trump curse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everyone who goes after him,</v>

826
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:04.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they ended up getting destroyed.</v>

827
00:35:04.731 --> 00:35:05.910
<v Speaker 4>Like Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

828
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:07.670
<v Speaker 4>she just fell and broke three of her </v>
<v Speaker 4>hips.</v>

829
00:35:07.671 --> 00:35:09.230
<v Speaker 4>I hope she gets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's a curse?</v>

830
00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.050
<v Speaker 4>It's a trump kirby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Old Lady just falls down,</v>

831
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.890
<v Speaker 4>but the timing of these things are so </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect and so like hilariously perfect.</v>

832
00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:20.891
<v Speaker 4>What about stormy Daniels?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you've got to pay his legal fees </v>

833
00:35:20.891 --> 00:35:22.330
<v Speaker 4>like that is kind of hilarious that </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's going to pay his legal fees.</v>

834
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:27.330
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much strip and you got to do to pay </v>

835
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:27.330
<v Speaker 4>those legal fees?</v>
<v Speaker 4>His leg.</v>

836
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His legal fees must be through the roof.</v>

837
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.060
<v Speaker 4>They're probably millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>

838
00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:32.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got be crazy.</v>

839
00:35:32.991 --> 00:35:33.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

840
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:34.610
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

841
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean he has an enormous legal team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've been.</v>

842
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:39.930
<v Speaker 4>And then how about all these people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to turn and I'm like Michael</v>

843
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:40.980
<v Speaker 4>Cohen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now he's fucked.</v>

844
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.560
<v Speaker 4>What is he going to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is he going to say?</v>

845
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.580
<v Speaker 4>You?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

846
00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:48.660
<v Speaker 4>we already know that you paid her off </v>
<v Speaker 4>and now no one cares because he just won</v>

847
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:49.470
<v Speaker 4>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

848
00:35:49.471 --> 00:35:53.240
<v Speaker 4>And so she has to pay his legal fees and</v>
<v Speaker 4>now you're stuck with nothing.</v>

849
00:35:53.241 --> 00:35:54.140
<v Speaker 4>You have nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

850
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 4>And now he always tried to say a trump </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

851
00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.380
<v Speaker 4>I'll trump used racist language with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

852
00:35:58.381 --> 00:35:59.490
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

853
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.790
<v Speaker 4>Well they're supposedly that Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mark Burnett tape.</v>

854
00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.160
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

855
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.550
<v Speaker 4>Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom Arnold,</v>

856
00:36:05.551 --> 00:36:06.420
<v Speaker 4>trying to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

857
00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.340
<v Speaker 4>That's the APP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mark Burnett,</v>

858
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.120
<v Speaker 4>the guy is that Mark Burnett?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The survivor guidance apprentice guy,</v>

859
00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.060
<v Speaker 4>apparently very religious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

860
00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:18.110
<v Speaker 4>and he is inclined to support trump's </v>
<v Speaker 4>positions on many things and he's just </v>

861
00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:20.130
<v Speaker 4>not going to release that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

862
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:21.330
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way.</v>

863
00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:27.220
<v Speaker 4>Trump who is running a TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We look at t look at Megan Kelly joined </v>

864
00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:27.220
<v Speaker 4>reed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's.</v>

865
00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.150
<v Speaker 4>If he's using racial slurs in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>cameras and a cast of 50,</v>

866
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:31.830
<v Speaker 4>which I'm sure are going to have people </v>
<v Speaker 4>of color.</v>

867
00:36:31.831 --> 00:36:34.110
<v Speaker 4>This is New York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way this wouldn't have leaked</v>

868
00:36:34.111 --> 00:36:36.300
<v Speaker 4>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not true.</v>

869
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.760
<v Speaker 4>If he's using the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not true.</v>

870
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:39.720
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there's.</v>

871
00:36:39.721 --> 00:36:44.721
<v Speaker 4>If there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a sound guy and there is a </v>

872
00:36:44.721 --> 00:36:46.700
<v Speaker 4>producer and they're collecting tapes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone has.</v>

873
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.950
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

874
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.550
<v Speaker 4>If he's doing this publicly in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

875
00:36:48.551 --> 00:36:49.680
<v Speaker 4>he's not doing it publicly.</v>

876
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:54.710
<v Speaker 4>He's talking to someone and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>recorded much like the billy Bush thing </v>

877
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.710
<v Speaker 4>when he was on the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

878
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.760
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of doing it publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's talking to somebody.</v>

879
00:36:56.761 --> 00:37:00.120
<v Speaker 4>I thought he was talking to one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cast members supposedly does somewhat.</v>

880
00:37:00.121 --> 00:37:03.480
<v Speaker 4>I heard this tape is big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big foot.</v>

881
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.100
<v Speaker 4>It's like a small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hang on 18,</v>

882
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.650
<v Speaker 4>but at the other thing is if he's using </v>
<v Speaker 4>this language,</v>

883
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.680
<v Speaker 4>he would have been using it frequently </v>
<v Speaker 4>was he does hit certain words over and </v>

884
00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:12.680
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

885
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.110
<v Speaker 4>but it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used it in a very specific way.</v>

886
00:37:16.111 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 4>Like you know the story about the guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>from Netflix,</v>

887
00:37:18.511 --> 00:37:23.511
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or here's how about the story about the </v>

888
00:37:23.511 --> 00:37:23.511
<v Speaker 4>hub of John.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John got.</v>

889
00:37:23.511 --> 00:37:23.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's outrageous.</v>

890
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.530
<v Speaker 4>We'll we'll explain it to people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know.</v>

891
00:37:25.531 --> 00:37:30.531
<v Speaker 4>The store was on that conference call </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a PR firm,</v>

892
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.120
<v Speaker 4>the PR firm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he said he was saying,</v>

893
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:37.470
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to be like Colonel </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sanders saying Blah Blah Blah with the n</v>

894
00:37:37.471 --> 00:37:37.800
<v Speaker 4>word.</v>

895
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:43.310
<v Speaker 4>He was quoting somebody else as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>example of don't use this kind of </v>

896
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.500
<v Speaker 4>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really bad.</v>

897
00:37:43.501 --> 00:37:43.980
<v Speaker 4>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

00:37:43.981 --> 00:37:45.210
<v Speaker 4>you invoke that word.</v>

899
00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:50.730
<v Speaker 4>Literally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he is the CEO of the company and </v>

900
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:52.980
<v Speaker 4>he's saying to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to use these words.</v>

901
00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.140
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to be like these person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't think I know this one.</v>

925
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:46.120
<v Speaker 4>What is his name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

926
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:48.580
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a gentleman who was like,</v>

927
00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:53.581
<v Speaker 4>one of the top dogs at Netflix says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't say the word retard </v>

928
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:59.970
<v Speaker 4>because two people that have someone in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their life that has down syndrome.</v>

929
00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:03.490
<v Speaker 4>It's like using,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he doesn't say the n word,</v>

930
00:39:03.491 --> 00:39:08.491
<v Speaker 4>he says nigger in front of African </v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans and he says this in a room </v>

931
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.700
<v Speaker 4>filled with people and some of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen to be African Americans.</v>

932
00:39:12.701 --> 00:39:13.750
<v Speaker 4>How many of them were retarded?</v>

933
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:22.380
<v Speaker 4>So they freak out that he's used this </v>
<v Speaker 4>word saying that it is just as offensive</v>

934
00:39:23.411 --> 00:39:25.140
<v Speaker 4>as using the n word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's.</v>

935
00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.490
<v Speaker 4>He's a false equivalency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're saying like,</v>

936
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:29.610
<v Speaker 4>this is much worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

937
00:39:29.611 --> 00:39:29.950
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

938
00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:33.620
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just using it in terms of saying,</v>

939
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 4>this is about my friend Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend Tom Segura has a bit in his </v>

940
00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:43.471
<v Speaker 4>last Netflix special and the bit was </v>
<v Speaker 4>about you can't use the word retarded </v>

941
00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:48.860
<v Speaker 4>and this is what he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he goes into all these different </v>

942
00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.171
<v Speaker 4>words that you can't use anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because he said Tom stole this from </v>

943
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:54.880
<v Speaker 4>George Carlin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

944
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.810
<v Speaker 4>that's the George Carlin bit though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How?</v>

945
00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.090
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The seven words.</v>

946
00:39:58.091 --> 00:39:59.560
<v Speaker 4>You can't stand television now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've done.</v>

947
00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:00.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>

948
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.790
<v Speaker 4>it's very different when he's saying he </v>
<v Speaker 4>has a whole,</v>

949
00:40:03.791 --> 00:40:08.791
<v Speaker 4>it's a very good bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's in no way endorsing using that </v>

950
00:40:08.791 --> 00:40:09.790
<v Speaker 4>word so.</v>

951
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.530
<v Speaker 4>But the fact that he uttered it out loud</v>
<v Speaker 4>with this guy was saying was this is the</v>

952
00:40:14.531 --> 00:40:18.190
<v Speaker 4>same thing as someone uttering the n </v>
<v Speaker 4>word out loud,</v>

953
00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:21.730
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't say the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said Nigger,</v>

954
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:26.080
<v Speaker 4>and because he said that they fired him </v>
<v Speaker 4>from Netflix.</v>

955
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:31.230
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Literally saying a noise to represent a </v>

956
00:40:31.961 --> 00:40:35.530
<v Speaker 4>word that's an offensive word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is.</v>

957
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:38.980
<v Speaker 4>They said enough is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said Abracadabra,</v>

958
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.170
<v Speaker 4>that is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a retarded decision.</v>

959
00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:45.580
<v Speaker 4>Is it niggardly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of they're saving money.</v>

960
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:50.610
<v Speaker 4>That's a different word that people are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are saying you shouldn't say to </v>

961
00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:51.400
<v Speaker 4>anymore because it sounds too much like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the n word,</v>

962
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.230
<v Speaker 4>even though it means stingy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

963
00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.360
<v Speaker 4>Which is very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

964
00:40:55.361 --> 00:40:56.540
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

965
00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.240
<v Speaker 4>it's moises.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

966
00:40:58.241 --> 00:41:03.241
<v Speaker 4>It's not about intent anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just about never been about </v>

967
00:41:03.241 --> 00:41:03.241
<v Speaker 4>attendance about domination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

968
00:41:03.241 --> 00:41:05.440
<v Speaker 4>It's always about domination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one thing that Carlin said.</v>

969
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:10.440
<v Speaker 4>That's absolutely correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's political correctness is just </v>

970
00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:10.440
<v Speaker 4>fascism with better language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

971
00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.090
<v Speaker 4>It's all about domination and telling </v>
<v Speaker 4>the line and you know,</v>

972
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:16.150
<v Speaker 4>picking off the people that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pick off and making examples.</v>

973
00:41:16.151 --> 00:41:18.370
<v Speaker 4>I then for everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

974
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.830
<v Speaker 4>What it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

975
00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.880
<v Speaker 4>he didn't say better language that </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascism disguised as being polite or </v>

976
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:27.691
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that they felt like it was </v>

977
00:41:27.691 --> 00:41:31.110
<v Speaker 4>a smart decision to just fire someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he said annoys you should.</v>

978
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.680
<v Speaker 4>What you should say is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand what you're to say,</v>

979
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.960
<v Speaker 4>but let's just not use that word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

980
00:41:35.961 --> 00:41:39.400
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Done not no more job.</v>

981
00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.870
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do bad work.</v>

982
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:43.850
<v Speaker 4>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No more income.</v>

983
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:46.160
<v Speaker 4>Public shaming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get out of here.</v>

984
00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.460
<v Speaker 4>And the people that were in the room </v>
<v Speaker 4>were the ones that turned him in.</v>

985
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:54.700
<v Speaker 4>There were some African Americans </v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently that heard him say that word </v>

986
00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.090
<v Speaker 4>out loud and they just saw it as a green</v>
<v Speaker 4>light and they just went after him,</v>

987
00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:56.560
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

988
00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made at the same time,</v>

989
00:41:57.861 --> 00:42:00.110
<v Speaker 4>you have to wonder if those executives </v>
<v Speaker 4>are living in fear.</v>

990
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Of course they said know they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

991
00:42:01.761 --> 00:42:03.370
<v Speaker 4>we better do something really quick </v>
<v Speaker 4>because now the.</v>

992
00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.930
<v Speaker 4>Now we're going to have lawsuits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were boycotts and blah,</v>

993
00:42:05.931 --> 00:42:06.320
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

994
00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Roseann thing,</v>

995
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:09.470
<v Speaker 4>they trigger and now do you know how </v>
<v Speaker 4>much money is that?</v>

996
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.390
<v Speaker 4>You can't say anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sounds too close.</v>

997
00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.990
<v Speaker 4>That was my last special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

998
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.360
<v Speaker 4>you can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

999
00:42:14.361 --> 00:42:19.361
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't say that word like it </v>

1000
00:42:19.361 --> 00:42:19.361
<v Speaker 4>sounds too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the analyst got to really emphasize</v>

1001
00:42:19.361 --> 00:42:20.630
<v Speaker 4>that the er,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1002
00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.480
<v Speaker 4>when the Roseanne thing happened and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1003
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.480
<v Speaker 4>they immediately stepped up and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1004
00:42:25.481 --> 00:42:27.260
<v Speaker 4>this is a warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We hate racism.</v>

1005
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:31.310
<v Speaker 4>You're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have lost so much fucking money.</v>

1006
00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:34.220
<v Speaker 4>That show is hemorrhaging money and this</v>
<v Speaker 4>return,</v>

1007
00:42:34.221 --> 00:42:37.310
<v Speaker 4>the connors has done terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The audience,</v>

1008
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:40.100
<v Speaker 4>not just half the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but half the audience and then shrinking</v>

1009
00:42:40.101 --> 00:42:42.800
<v Speaker 4>every week and it's most likely being </v>
<v Speaker 4>canceled.</v>

1010
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:46.730
<v Speaker 4>But this is what I think people don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a ostensibly the point of,</v>

1011
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:51.250
<v Speaker 4>of businesses to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why people go into business for a</v>

1012
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:56.320
<v Speaker 4>lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the people running these </v>

1013
00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.120
<v Speaker 4>organizations are there to further.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are cultural ideology.</v>

1014
00:42:57.121 --> 00:43:02.121
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the profit will be secondary to </v>

1015
00:43:02.121 --> 00:43:02.330
<v Speaker 4>cultural acceptance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1016
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.630
<v Speaker 4>cultural acceptance comes along with </v>
<v Speaker 4>future profitability.</v>

1017
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.660
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lack of cultural acceptance could be</v>

1018
00:43:08.661 --> 00:43:10.580
<v Speaker 4>financial devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's,</v>

1019
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.230
<v Speaker 4>that's the way they're looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of it,</v>

1020
00:43:12.231 --> 00:43:13.490
<v Speaker 4>but part of it there also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1021
00:43:13.491 --> 00:43:18.491
<v Speaker 4>if you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you live in New York and then you go </v>

1022
00:43:18.491 --> 00:43:21.131
<v Speaker 4>to a lefty school and then you become an</v>
<v Speaker 4>executive and your entire culture is </v>

1023
00:43:21.131 --> 00:43:22.310
<v Speaker 4>this lefty worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna think this is how all right</v>

1024
00:43:22.311 --> 00:43:24.530
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right thinking people act.</v>

1025
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:29.740
<v Speaker 4>You're going to act in a certain way </v>
<v Speaker 4>accordingly and not even have </v>

1026
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:29.740
<v Speaker 4>consideration for any possible other </v>
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>

1027
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.340
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point,</v>

1028
00:43:31.341 --> 00:43:34.310
<v Speaker 4>but it's fascinating that she was not </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed to apologize.</v>

1029
00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:38.780
<v Speaker 4>Roseanne was not allowed to apologize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that woman from Msnbc joined was who</v>

1030
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.150
<v Speaker 4>said much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much more awful things.</v>

1031
00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.980
<v Speaker 4>Roseanne was near.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she was hysterical or near tears</v>

1032
00:43:45.981 --> 00:43:49.040
<v Speaker 4>that day because she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I care about the crew.</v>

1033
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.410
<v Speaker 4>They're the ones who are getting fucked </v>
<v Speaker 4>please.</v>

1034
00:43:51.411 --> 00:43:52.700
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll do what I want.</v>

1035
00:43:52.701 --> 00:43:53.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1036
00:43:53.421 --> 00:43:56.570
<v Speaker 4>and that's why she let the show go on </v>
<v Speaker 4>without her and she didn't fight it.</v>

1037
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:57.710
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1038
00:43:57.711 --> 00:43:59.480
<v Speaker 4>and Kudos to her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1039
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:04.900
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's a friend of mine and she's an </v>

1040
00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:04.900
<v Speaker 4>awesome person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She really is.</v>

1041
00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.920
<v Speaker 4>She adore her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's not what anybody is trying to </v>

1042
00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.180
<v Speaker 4>paint her out too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's talk about tribalism because I</v>

1043
00:44:08.181 --> 00:44:11.120
<v Speaker 4>remember you remember not that long ago </v>
<v Speaker 4>when her show was on,</v>

1044
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:13.460
<v Speaker 4>she had that whole Brouhaha with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>national anthem.</v>

1045
00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:18.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the Republicans are out for blood </v>

1046
00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:18.820
<v Speaker 4>and now all of a sudden they love her </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the memories are very,</v>

1047
00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:23.741
<v Speaker 4>very short.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love her because she's controversial </v>

1048
00:44:23.741 --> 00:44:23.741
<v Speaker 4>and speaks her mind in both cases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1049
00:44:23.741 --> 00:44:28.310
<v Speaker 4>she's also legitimately mentally ill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had a terrible car accident when she was</v>

1050
00:44:28.311 --> 00:44:33.311
<v Speaker 4>15 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was institutionalized in a mental </v>

1051
00:44:33.311 --> 00:44:33.311
<v Speaker 4>institution for</v>

1052
00:44:33.311 --> 00:44:35.340
<v Speaker 2>nine months afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it has personnel,</v>

1053
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:37.290
<v Speaker 2>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple personality disorder,</v>

1054
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 2>trauma induced multiple personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>

1055
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.600
<v Speaker 2>has been on a host of medications or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole life.</v>

1056
00:44:42.601 --> 00:44:47.601
<v Speaker 2>Because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my analogy that I say is a asking </v>

1057
00:44:47.601 --> 00:44:51.591
<v Speaker 2>her to behave normally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like asking a person with a broken </v>

1058
00:44:51.591 --> 00:44:51.591
<v Speaker 2>leg to not limp.</v>

1059
00:44:51.591 --> 00:44:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1060
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.660
<v Speaker 1>and the other one thing against her that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say she did accused both her </v>

1061
00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.750
<v Speaker 1>parents of molesting her and she laid </v>
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>

1062
00:44:57.751 --> 00:44:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to speak for her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think she</v>

1063
00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:02.390
<v Speaker 2>track that a little because they denied </v>
<v Speaker 2>it completely.</v>

1064
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:05.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't be surprised dude.</v>

1065
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:08.480
<v Speaker 2>She got brained by a car when she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>

1066
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:10.300
<v Speaker 2>like smashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not.</v>

1067
00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Some woman was driving through an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intersection,</v>

1068
00:45:12.351 --> 00:45:17.351
<v Speaker 2>couldn't see because the sun glare in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the window and clipped her with a car </v>

1069
00:45:17.351 --> 00:45:18.890
<v Speaker 2>and she was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she was,</v>

1070
00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:23.980
<v Speaker 2>she went from being a straight a student</v>
<v Speaker 2>to being someone who could no longer do </v>

1071
00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:27.101
<v Speaker 2>math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She detailed it like really emotionally </v>

1072
00:45:27.101 --> 00:45:31.080
<v Speaker 2>and very honestly and vulnerably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was very vulnerable.</v>

1073
00:45:31.081 --> 00:45:33.020
<v Speaker 2>And in discussing it on my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really good.</v>

1074
00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1075
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:36.850
<v Speaker 1>she's done such a big heart to eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>really is very,</v>

1076
00:45:36.851 --> 00:45:40.480
<v Speaker 1>very obvious whenever she talks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's on twitter and she's super funny.</v>

1077
00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1078
00:45:41.231 --> 00:45:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm a big fan of her twitter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it in that</v>

1079
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.710
<v Speaker 2>things that she said about that woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1080
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:50.310
<v Speaker 2>being a marriage of this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the apes,</v>

1081
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:53.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not the worst thing to say.</v>

1082
00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.740
<v Speaker 2>And The lady looks like the lady from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet of the apes.</v>

1083
00:45:55.741 --> 00:45:59.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck what you say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>does that even though she was black,</v>

1084
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I thought that bitch was to write things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she was Jewish.</v>

1085
00:46:05.451 --> 00:46:08.000
<v Speaker 1>She looks like my sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's running the government,</v>

1086
00:46:08.001 --> 00:46:13.001
<v Speaker 1>she must be Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought the thing that's great about </v>

1087
00:46:13.001 --> 00:46:13.001
<v Speaker 1>Roseanne is she was on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Tucker Carlson,</v>

1088
00:46:13.001 --> 00:46:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Sean Hannity and she looked and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1089
00:46:13.761 --> 00:46:15.020
<v Speaker 1>do you want to apologize to Valerie </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jarret?</v>

1090
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:16.310
<v Speaker 1>She looked the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1091
00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Valerie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on genuinely sorry,</v>

1092
00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.720
<v Speaker 1>I did not want to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was not acceptable.</v>

1093
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:22.820
<v Speaker 1>But I also do think you need a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>haircut.</v>

1094
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she still had a joke in there,</v>

1095
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:30.190
<v Speaker 1>but she's such a sweetheart and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think the thing that I have </v>

1096
00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:34.871
<v Speaker 1>people arguing with me about when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran and </v>

1097
00:46:34.871 --> 00:46:34.871
<v Speaker 1>people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1098
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:36.710
<v Speaker 1>she's not black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was born in Iran.</v>

1099
00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1100
00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.960
<v Speaker 1>black people can give birth in Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1101
00:46:38.961 --> 00:46:40.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was rapid.</v>

1102
00:46:40.361 --> 00:46:41.330
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't wrap their heads around </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1103
00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:43.250
<v Speaker 1>that she was black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Iran her parents were American,</v>

1104
00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:43.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1105
00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1106
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.470
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing's a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also one of those things.</v>

1107
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.790
<v Speaker 2>It's fiercely tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said before,</v>

1108
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:54.910
<v Speaker 2>and then our tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tribe of the left of the tribe of </v>

1109
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.910
<v Speaker 2>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our tribe is decided.</v>

1110
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Your tribe is it acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unacceptable.</v>

1111
00:46:58.701 --> 00:47:03.701
<v Speaker 2>And what you've done is just beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of any sort of apology you </v>

1112
00:47:04.011 --> 00:47:07.730
<v Speaker 2>need to be removed even at a significant</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial loss.</v>

1113
00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:11.180
<v Speaker 2>And apparently the people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for getting her fired,</v>

1114
00:47:11.181 --> 00:47:13.370
<v Speaker 2>one of them has already been removed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1115
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:18.550
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they're realizing there was a </v>

1116
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:21.161
<v Speaker 2>horrendous decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went from having the number one </v>

1117
00:47:21.161 --> 00:47:23.060
<v Speaker 2>show on television to having this </v>
<v Speaker 2>bastard version,</v>

1118
00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.580
<v Speaker 2>the Hogan family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking terrible,</v>

1119
00:47:25.581 --> 00:47:26.630
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nobody wants it.</v>

1120
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:30.190
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they just decided bring her back</v>

1121
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.550
<v Speaker 4>and she apologized and everyone sued </v>
<v Speaker 4>that over and look,</v>

1122
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:36.130
<v Speaker 4>there could be money donated to </v>
<v Speaker 4>charitable causes.</v>

1123
00:47:36.131 --> 00:47:39.000
<v Speaker 4>It could be a teachable moment or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>learning moment for,</v>

1124
00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.570
<v Speaker 4>for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the whole country.</v>

1125
00:47:40.571 --> 00:47:42.120
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a moment also of like,</v>

1126
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:47.430
<v Speaker 4>like of bonding where we just abandoned </v>
<v Speaker 4>these ridiculous ideas.</v>

1127
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.830
<v Speaker 4>There was an episode I watched the </v>
<v Speaker 4>series a,</v>

1128
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:54.990
<v Speaker 4>it was like episode six.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her neighbors that moved into the house </v>

1129
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:57.040
<v Speaker 4>from Lanford were Muslims and Roseanne </v>
<v Speaker 4>was prejudice.</v>

1130
00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:59.380
<v Speaker 4>And then she realized she was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was an episode that's like,</v>

1131
00:47:59.381 --> 00:48:04.381
<v Speaker 4>stop being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she's always been very culturally </v>

1132
00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:04.381
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1133
00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:04.810
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

1134
00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:08.770
<v Speaker 4>she is in some ways and she's right in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some ways she's,</v>

1135
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.290
<v Speaker 4>she leans right in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's very pro Israel,</v>

1136
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:16.750
<v Speaker 4>like super.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much so that she could have even </v>

1137
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.750
<v Speaker 4>talked about moving to Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1138
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>

1139
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:17.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she,</v>

1140
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.420
<v Speaker 4>I think she feels I can't speak for her.</v>

1141
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.270
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the whole.</v>

1142
00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:24.010
<v Speaker 4>But what do you got here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie is their rating is actually pretty</v>

1143
00:48:24.011 --> 00:48:29.011
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the number to show overall and ABC </v>

1144
00:48:29.011 --> 00:48:30.940
<v Speaker 4>and it's their top rated comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's down from where it was obviously,</v>

1145
00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:34.160
<v Speaker 4>but getting to 10 million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you getting this from?</v>

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:39.190
<v Speaker 4>We're getting this from vulture.com,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a very left leaning show and </v>

1147
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:40.180
<v Speaker 4>it's probably will go to the title of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1148
00:48:40.181 --> 00:48:42.490
<v Speaker 4>Go to the title of all TV shows right </v>

1153
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:56.430
<v Speaker 4>But the ratings are significantly lower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More than 50 percent lower than they </v>

1154
00:48:56.591 --> 00:48:57.850
<v Speaker 4>were with the other show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>

1155
00:48:57.851 --> 00:49:00.370
<v Speaker 4>But it was also extremely an extreme </v>
<v Speaker 4>hit.</v>

1156
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:01.660
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's the same show,</v>

1157
00:49:01.661 --> 00:49:03.180
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1158
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:06.460
<v Speaker 4>There's no way you're going to tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fifty percent is not a problem.</v>

1159
00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:07.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the problem.</v>

1160
00:49:07.631 --> 00:49:12.631
<v Speaker 4>You reading a spin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're reading is vulture spin on </v>

1161
00:49:12.631 --> 00:49:12.730
<v Speaker 4>it that says it's not that bad.</v>

1162
00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:15.370
<v Speaker 4>They're circling the wagon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only is it not that bad,</v>

1163
00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:18.520
<v Speaker 4>they did 10 episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they ordered an 11th.</v>

1164
00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.160
<v Speaker 4>That's unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you order is,</v>

1165
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:22.630
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was on Sitcoms,</v>

1166
00:49:22.631 --> 00:49:24.250
<v Speaker 4>they would do a thing called the back </v>
<v Speaker 4>nine,</v>

1167
00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:29.460
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you would get 13 episodes and they </v>

1168
00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:29.460
<v Speaker 4>would order the back nine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which would bring you to 22,</v>

1169
00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.960
<v Speaker 4>which is a full order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not doing a full order.</v>

1170
00:49:31.961 --> 00:49:33.290
<v Speaker 4>This shows dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1171
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:35.380
<v Speaker 4>So it ain't good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing is,</v>

1172
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:39.790
<v Speaker 4>keep in mind this show is extremely </v>
<v Speaker 4>expensive because you've got to pay.</v>

1173
00:49:39.791 --> 00:49:42.520
<v Speaker 4>Laurie metcalf was probably the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedic actress out there.</v>

1174
00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:46.240
<v Speaker 4>Three hundred thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Diamond gets more than $300,000.</v>

1175
00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.080
<v Speaker 4>Given Sarah Gilbert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets more than think.</v>

1176
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:53.120
<v Speaker 4>You've got the others too and have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>million dollars right away just with </v>

1177
00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.690
<v Speaker 4>three members of the cast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you have production fees,</v>

1178
00:49:55.691 --> 00:50:00.691
<v Speaker 4>all these other different fees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There must be a billion eps in that </v>

1179
00:50:00.691 --> 00:50:00.691
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>

1180
00:50:00.691 --> 00:50:03.810
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy money and it could be the </v>

1181
00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:05.780
<v Speaker 4>biggest show on television.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If she was still on it and,</v>

1182
00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.610
<v Speaker 4>and the apology was accepted you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to lose viewers.</v>

1183
00:50:09.611 --> 00:50:12.210
<v Speaker 4>They could have easily done an episode </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they were.</v>

1184
00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:15.970
<v Speaker 4>The character did that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets clouded as an asshole.</v>

1185
00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:20.971
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 percent they could have done it </v>

1186
00:50:20.971 --> 00:50:23.281
<v Speaker 4>where they're interviewing her outside </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the polls and she says that TV for </v>

1187
00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:23.960
<v Speaker 4>television.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1188
00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:29.010
<v Speaker 4>they say she says it on television and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then she gets labeled as a racist and </v>

1189
00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:30.230
<v Speaker 4>then a bunch of people say what she </v>
<v Speaker 4>really does look like.</v>

1190
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:33.460
<v Speaker 4>That lady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That will be how it had data.</v>

1191
00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:36.170
<v Speaker 4>It would end with them coming home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan close the door and goes there.</v>

1192
00:50:36.171 --> 00:50:39.770
<v Speaker 4>She really does look like that the whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1193
00:50:39.771 --> 00:50:42.770
<v Speaker 4>But I didn't know she was black and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>how could you not know?</v>

1194
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:47.950
<v Speaker 4>And then they showed different people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that look black that aren't black and </v>

1195
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:51.581
<v Speaker 4>different people that look white,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but our black pull up Dan Berninia Bon </v>

1197
00:50:53.421 --> 00:50:55.850
<v Speaker 4>He's Italian and he has to say on </v>
<v Speaker 4>twitter,</v>

1198
00:50:55.851 --> 00:51:00.851
<v Speaker 4>I'm not black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who this guy as you'll see </v>

1199
00:51:00.851 --> 00:51:03.810
<v Speaker 4>his picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like you go to 23 and me </v>

1200
00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:04.190
<v Speaker 4>because I'm Italian too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I did my ancestry.</v>

1201
00:51:04.191 --> 00:51:06.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm one point six percent African.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1203
00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:12.560
<v Speaker 4>Elizabeth Warren is Indian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much more.</v>

1204
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:13.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1206
00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:15.890
<v Speaker 4>He's Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1207
00:51:15.891 --> 00:51:16.520
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1208
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:17.990
<v Speaker 4>don't lie to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

1209
00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:22.070
<v Speaker 4>That's a black man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that guy just gets at the hair.</v>

1210
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:25.280
<v Speaker 4>Listen Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy is so African.</v>

1211
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:28.190
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's an Italian.</v>

1212
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:29.510
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to Italian.</v>

1213
00:51:29.511 --> 00:51:31.430
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>depending upon what part of it.</v>

1214
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:32.180
<v Speaker 4>The Morris.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:33.250
<v Speaker 4>Oops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1216
00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean he probably had some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also Italy,</v>

1217
00:51:36.831 --> 00:51:40.610
<v Speaker 4>just if you look at how close Italy is </v>
<v Speaker 4>to northern Africa,</v>

1218
00:51:40.611 --> 00:51:43.340
<v Speaker 4>it's very close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like people just came over.</v>

1219
00:51:43.341 --> 00:51:43.810
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1220
00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:47.000
<v Speaker 4>they fucking fucked around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were real close to each other.</v>

1221
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:52.210
<v Speaker 4>They got on boats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they went back and forth at long </v>

1222
00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:53.480
<v Speaker 4>distance relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the Italians in particular,</v>

1223
00:51:53.481 --> 00:51:55.910
<v Speaker 4>especially northern Africans or an </v>
<v Speaker 4>African.</v>

1224
00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:58.120
<v Speaker 4>They're not black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're Middle Eastern.</v>

1225
00:51:58.380 --> 00:51:59.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1226
00:51:59.121 --> 00:52:00.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it is still Africa.</v>

1227
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:01.680
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:06.710
<v Speaker 4>It's African genetics when also Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Egypt also had a relationship with a </v>

1229
00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:10.370
<v Speaker 4>newbie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>EONS and eons eventually conquered Egypt</v>

1230
00:52:10.371 --> 00:52:11.820
<v Speaker 4>and Ethiopia is too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1231
00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:14.520
<v Speaker 4>So it's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of.</v>

1232
00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:17.740
<v Speaker 4>Lot of fucking gone around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

1233
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:21.230
<v Speaker 4>so what else were you in your eye?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 99 point eight.</v>

1234
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.990
<v Speaker 4>I need the Jewish or white.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like nothing else in there.</v>

1235
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm mostly Italian.</v>

1236
00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

1237
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:32.570
<v Speaker 4>the other percent is Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it also could be English.</v>

1238
00:52:32.571 --> 00:52:33.440
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1239
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:35.150
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're but it's Irish,</v>

1240
00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.270
<v Speaker 4>which is where Rogan comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1241
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:42.370
<v Speaker 4>one point six percent African and then I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think there a small amount of Asian in </v>

1242
00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:44.210
<v Speaker 4>there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No small amount of Asian,</v>

1243
00:52:44.211 --> 00:52:47.720
<v Speaker 4>like one percent plus or minus Asian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1244
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:48.770
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>native American.</v>

1245
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:54.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately I love her to still </v>

1246
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:54.080
<v Speaker 4>probably have more than Elizabeth </v>
<v Speaker 4>Warren.</v>

1247
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:54.620
<v Speaker 4>The best thing that I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This boring stuff.</v>

1248
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:59.650
<v Speaker 4>There's two things I love about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She takes this test in secret and of </v>

1249
00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:00.770
<v Speaker 4>course I wonder why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

1250
00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.630
<v Speaker 4>but she took a secret.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then she revealed it.</v>

1251
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:04.190
<v Speaker 4>She could have seen the results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1252
00:53:04.191 --> 00:53:06.240
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to talk about this because</v>

1253
00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:08.730
<v Speaker 4>she thought it might say zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1254
00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:11.420
<v Speaker 4>And because it said zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>zero,</v>

1255
00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:13.190
<v Speaker 4>zero point one.</v>

1256
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:16.310
<v Speaker 4>She was not even native American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was South American.</v>

1257
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:17.600
<v Speaker 4>She did like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1258
00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:19.790
<v Speaker 4>like Brazilian jeans or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Next skin genes.</v>

1259
00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:20.690
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1260
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:25.720
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't native American genes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't find native American DNA to </v>

1261
00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 4>match number one the best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the best part.</v>

1262
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:31.430
<v Speaker 4>Here's the best part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump per year for two years like </v>

1263
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.430
<v Speaker 4>Pocahontas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pocahontas,</v>

1264
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.890
<v Speaker 4>but guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when are you going to take the test?</v>

1265
00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:33.990
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took the test by the fuck.</v>

1266
00:53:33.991 --> 00:53:34.800
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who cares?</v>

<v Speaker 4>He's like each.</v>

1268
00:53:37.610 --> 00:53:42.610
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she said that he was supposed to pay a </v>

1269
00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:42.610
<v Speaker 4>million dollars towards charity because </v>
<v Speaker 4>she took the test,</v>

1270
00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:47.000
<v Speaker 4>but if that's the case and the test </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually shows South American genetics </v>

1271
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.330
<v Speaker 4>and not native American church,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well isn't that.</v>

1272
00:53:48.331 --> 00:53:52.110
<v Speaker 4>That's all very squirrely too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like what is native American?</v>

1273
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:57.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many similarities between </v>

1274
00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:00.471
<v Speaker 4>people from Mexico and native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people from Ecuador and native </v>

1275
00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:01.200
<v Speaker 4>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Peru.</v>

1276
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:06.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's extreme similarities </v>
<v Speaker 4>between what we think of as traditional </v>

1277
00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:10.020
<v Speaker 4>native Americans and then people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>lived in South America and then also the</v>

1278
00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:12.780
<v Speaker 4>actual path that they got here in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first place.</v>

1279
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:16.490
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them have Siberian genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sciatic,</v>

1280
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:17.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1281
00:54:17.101 --> 00:54:22.101
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what's really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you know the whole story behind how </v>

1282
00:54:22.101 --> 00:54:22.101
<v Speaker 4>that got discovered?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1283
00:54:22.101 --> 00:54:25.020
<v Speaker 4>It was a guy who was a mormon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is about a decade plus ago,</v>

1284
00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:30.110
<v Speaker 4>who was trying to prove this Mormon </v>
<v Speaker 4>doctrine that Jesus,</v>

1285
00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:34.470
<v Speaker 4>Jesus is lost tribe came the the lost </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribe of Israel America,</v>

1286
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:37.410
<v Speaker 4>and these were the native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this guy,</v>

1287
00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:41.430
<v Speaker 4>and this was when DNA tests were </v>
<v Speaker 4>insanely expensive.</v>

1288
00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:46.640
<v Speaker 4>This guy spent a shitload of money to </v>
<v Speaker 4>try to test native Americans to try to </v>

1289
00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:51.111
<v Speaker 4>find Israel like jeans and he found that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have Siberian jeans because I came </v>

1290
00:54:51.451 --> 00:54:56.451
<v Speaker 4>across the bering land bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was excellent because it really </v>

1291
00:54:56.451 --> 00:54:58.340
<v Speaker 4>did prove that theory that people did </v>
<v Speaker 4>migrate on foot through the,</v>

1292
00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.610
<v Speaker 4>through the bering land bridge.</v>

1293
00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:06.810
<v Speaker 4>It's just so silly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at like,</v>

1294
00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:10.650
<v Speaker 4>like native Americans and then you look </v>
<v Speaker 4>at like some Mexicans,</v>

1295
00:55:10.651 --> 00:55:11.220
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

1296
00:55:11.221 --> 00:55:15.930
<v Speaker 4>That was a distinct similarity between </v>
<v Speaker 4>these two in terms of their features are</v>

1297
00:55:15.931 --> 00:55:18.480
<v Speaker 4>coloration's like how they looked?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1298
00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:23.481
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to evolve the similar </v>

1299
00:55:23.481 --> 00:55:23.481
<v Speaker 4>climates and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1300
00:55:23.481 --> 00:55:25.230
<v Speaker 4>and I think probably similar origins of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancestors,</v>

1301
00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:30.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so she's got a point south </v>

1302
00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.170
<v Speaker 4>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's amazing.</v>

1303
00:55:31.171 --> 00:55:32.970
<v Speaker 4>She's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she's on the spectrum too,</v>

1304
00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:38.300
<v Speaker 4>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the number of percentage that she </v>

1305
00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:42.111
<v Speaker 4>has of this gene is so fucking small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

1306
00:55:42.261 --> 00:55:43.620
<v Speaker 4>1000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>24th.</v>

1307
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.670
<v Speaker 4>That is so small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm one point six percent right.</v>

1308
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:52.910
<v Speaker 4>That's literally like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like ten one hundred times as much as </v>

1309
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.910
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she's pointed.</v>

1310
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.910
<v Speaker 4>Oh six.</v>

1311
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:59.150
<v Speaker 4>So you're like 30 times as much as 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>times as much African as she is native </v>

1312
00:55:59.150 --> 00:56:02.901
<v Speaker 4>American and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yet she used that to get a job at </v>

1313
00:56:02.901 --> 00:56:05.451
<v Speaker 4>Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The funny part is she had contributed </v>

1314
00:56:05.451 --> 00:56:07.950
<v Speaker 4>recipes to a book called Powwow Chow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not making it up and she signed it.</v>

1315
00:56:07.951 --> 00:56:09.980
<v Speaker 4>Elizabeth Warren Navajo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here's the.</v>

1316
00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:12.600
<v Speaker 4>Here's the kicker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She plagiarize the recipe.</v>

1317
00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.370
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's beautiful.</v>

1318
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.950
<v Speaker 4>So not only was he not a fucking native </v>
<v Speaker 4>American,</v>

1319
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.530
<v Speaker 4>it's like a crab salad recipes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what native Americans are eating.</v>

1320
00:56:19.531 --> 00:56:22.020
<v Speaker 4>Fucking crab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fuck you're from Maryland.</v>

1321
00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:27.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Maryland Baltimore runs Tuesday.</v>

1322
00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:29.830
<v Speaker 4>So it was Ryan sickler would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1323
00:56:29.831 --> 00:56:32.410
<v Speaker 4>that is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is just,</v>

1324
00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:33.410
<v Speaker 4>it's one and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1325
00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:38.440
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because she has potential in terms of </v>

1326
00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.850
<v Speaker 4>like she's a strong woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's articulate,</v>

1327
00:56:39.851 --> 00:56:43.300
<v Speaker 4>she's very well educated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's been a professional politician for</v>

1328
00:56:43.301 --> 00:56:48.301
<v Speaker 4>a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People on the left are not denouncing </v>

1329
00:56:48.301 --> 00:56:48.301
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>

1330
00:56:48.301 --> 00:56:48.301
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have.</v>

1331
00:56:48.301 --> 00:56:48.400
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people were like,</v>

1332
00:56:48.401 --> 00:56:49.030
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1333
00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.440
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were articles that go,</v>

1334
00:56:50.441 --> 00:56:55.441
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this did not go as we planned because </v>

1335
00:56:55.441 --> 00:56:55.441
<v Speaker 4>they were just like this as genetics </v>
<v Speaker 4>test.</v>

1336
00:56:55.441 --> 00:57:00.271
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of people are uncomfortable </v>

1337
00:57:00.271 --> 00:57:02.401
<v Speaker 4>with her appropriating set asides that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are for people who are actually </v>

1338
00:57:02.401 --> 00:57:02.401
<v Speaker 4>suffering minorities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd be like,</v>

1339
00:57:02.401 --> 00:57:02.401
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1340
00:57:02.401 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not cool.</v>

1341
00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:06.160
<v Speaker 4>So she's gotten pushed back from small </v>
<v Speaker 4>blogs.</v>

1342
00:57:06.161 --> 00:57:08.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm not seeing this from anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>mainstream.</v>

1343
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.490
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because mainstream,</v>

1344
00:57:09.491 --> 00:57:11.010
<v Speaker 4>they're always going to cover for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>establishment.</v>

1345
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.470
<v Speaker 4>That's been 100 percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1346
00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.760
<v Speaker 4>They're going to cover about those blogs</v>
<v Speaker 4>is like,</v>

1347
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:19.770
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them are basically like Ari </v>
<v Speaker 4>shaffir refers to him as like college </v>

1348
00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:23.550
<v Speaker 4>papers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a lot of these blogs or like </v>

1349
00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:24.880
<v Speaker 4>college student written yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're often speaking truth.</v>

1350
00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:26.170
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1351
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:31.171
<v Speaker 4>I would hope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would hope more would come out and </v>

1352
00:57:31.171 --> 00:57:31.171
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1353
00:57:31.171 --> 00:57:32.550
<v Speaker 4>you can't say you're native American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like,</v>

1354
00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:37.000
<v Speaker 4>like imagine the outrage if I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>started calling myself African American.</v>

1355
00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:38.320
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know what?</v>

1356
00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:39.730
<v Speaker 4>Did you see what trump said?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

1357
00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:44.970
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't call her pocahontas anymore </v>

1358
00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:44.970
<v Speaker 4>because she's not an Indian.</v>

1359
00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:46.570
<v Speaker 4>And I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1360
00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:50.980
<v Speaker 4>we're not worthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says some hilarious shit.</v>

1361
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:52.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he really does.</v>

1362
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.570
<v Speaker 4>He really does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking funny off the cuff.</v>

1363
00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.400
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>

1364
00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:59.650
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the way he goes after people,</v>

1365
00:57:59.651 --> 00:58:01.240
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though he's the president,</v>

1366
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:04.480
<v Speaker 4>like he still calls people fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>losers.</v>

1367
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:08.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's still caused them losers on twitter</v>

1368
00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.800
<v Speaker 4>and goes after them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The horse face face,</v>

1369
00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:15.830
<v Speaker 4>he called stormy Daniels horseface.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just think of how repulsive he is </v>

1370
00:58:16.121 --> 00:58:21.121
<v Speaker 4>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fat is faces off fucking hanging </v>

1371
00:58:21.121 --> 00:58:23.200
<v Speaker 4>off of his bones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got white raccoon eyes,</v>

1372
00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:28.320
<v Speaker 4>an orange skin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yet he's still will mock stormy </v>

1373
00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.540
<v Speaker 4>Daniels and call her horseface.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone tweeted out,</v>

1374
00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:34.030
<v Speaker 4>I forgot who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I apologize the thing he said,</v>

1375
00:58:34.031 --> 00:58:35.760
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine what happens.</v>

1376
00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:39.610
<v Speaker 4>That trumps the first person who fucked </v>
<v Speaker 4>a porn star and she had to brag about it</v>

1377
00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.710
<v Speaker 4>and then she paid him.</v>

1378
00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:43.800
<v Speaker 4>She has to pay him now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1379
00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 4>Well he did pay her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1380
00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:50.820
<v Speaker 4>But what he paid her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what she's going to have to pay him is </v>

1381
00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:52.680
<v Speaker 4>probably like a factor of three or fours</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you.</v>

1382
00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:57.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean how much more she's going to wind</v>
<v Speaker 4>up paying him for 350 k.</v>

1383
00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:59.050
<v Speaker 4>that's all you asked for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1384
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.770
<v Speaker 4>that's a very reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that doesn't even cover her book.</v>

1385
00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.770
<v Speaker 4>It's probably like he just wants to just</v>
<v Speaker 4>get it.</v>

1386
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:07.870
<v Speaker 4>Just give me that paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just gave me a little something.</v>

1387
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.170
<v Speaker 4>I need a little something from you with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1390
00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:18.930
<v Speaker 4>That's probably a whole book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably all the money know she </v>

1391
00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:18.930
<v Speaker 4>got more than 3:50</v>
<v Speaker 4>on positive.</v>

1392
00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:19.780
<v Speaker 4>How much she thinks she got from that </v>
<v Speaker 4>book?</v>

1393
00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 4>A 750 guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1396
00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:30.120

1397
00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:30.120
<v Speaker 4>home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's all that money's gone.</v>

1398
00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:30.890
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all gone.</v>

1403
00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:39.830
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It was amazing.</v>

1418
01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:11.620
<v Speaker 4>The fact that he can call her a horse </v>
<v Speaker 4>face towards his face.</v>

1419
01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:12.500
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>

1420
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:14.010

<v Speaker 4>running for president or he was even.</v>

1450
01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he was 100 percent open </v>
<v Speaker 4>about running for president and he said,</v>

1451

<v Speaker 4>Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1498
01:03:46.801 --> 01:03:46.801
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's endorsed Romney.</v>

1499
01:03:46.801 --> 01:03:47.650
<v Speaker 4>He dressed Romney.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Republican budget.</v>

1500
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:49.570
<v Speaker 4>Regardless of race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a Democrat until what?</v>

1501
01:03:49.571 --> 01:03:54.571
<v Speaker 4>Twenty 10 probably around then because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was gonna run as an independent at </v>

1502
01:03:54.571 --> 01:03:54.571
<v Speaker 4>some point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump 2012.</v>

1503
01:03:54.571 --> 01:03:55.690
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the guy we've been looking for.</v>

1504
01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:57.400
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seven years ago,</v>

1505
01:03:57.790 --> 01:04:00.910
<v Speaker 4>but it's just deplorable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Changed it.</v>

1506
01:04:00.911 --> 01:04:04.270
<v Speaker 4>They probably wouldn't be good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Changed it in the future because it says</v>

1507
01:04:04.271 --> 01:04:05.210
<v Speaker 4>seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1508
01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:08.080
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that traveler deplorable.</v>

1509
01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.820
<v Speaker 4>That's the time travel that had joined </v>
<v Speaker 4>read.</v>

1510
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:11.270
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1511
01:04:11.271 --> 01:04:13.300
<v Speaker 4>Someone did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone definitely hacked it.</v>

1512
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just hilarious.</v>

1513
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:19.000
<v Speaker 4>They didn't give the good version of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that either because they believed it.</v>

1514
01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:24.180
<v Speaker 4>Well not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he also see if you can find the </v>

1515
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.030
<v Speaker 4>better version because he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he basically prefaces it like,</v>

1516
01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have been saying it like this,</v>

1517
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.360
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could say it like this or you can </v>

1518
01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:32.360
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen you motherfuckers.</v>

1519
01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.130
<v Speaker 4>And that's when everybody starts </v>
<v Speaker 4>cheering.</v>

1520
01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.360
<v Speaker 4>He actually gave an example of how he </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually go ahead.</v>

1521
01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.150
<v Speaker 4>What can you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1522
01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:44.320
<v Speaker 5>So easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm dropping 25 percent tax on and you </v>

1523
01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:52.800
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said to somebody that is really the </v>

1524
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:52.800
<v Speaker 5>Messenger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Messenger is important.</v>

1525
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:56.400
<v Speaker 5>I could have one man say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when did he text you?</v>

1526
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:59.330
<v Speaker 5>Twenty five percent and I can say </v>
<v Speaker 5>another.</v>

1527
01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:01.640
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you mother.</v>

1528
01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:12.200
<v Speaker 4>I know he wouldn't have the press lies </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the campaign trail.</v>

1529
01:05:12.201 --> 01:05:14.480
<v Speaker 4>He said a point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember what it was.</v>

1530
01:05:14.481 --> 01:05:17.240
<v Speaker 4>The sense that he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you better shut your mouth.</v>

1531
01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 4>So he didn't</v>

1532
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:23.010
<v Speaker 3>say the word [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>They bleeped it and they believed it to </v>

1533
01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:23.560
<v Speaker 3>make it look like he was cursing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

1534
01:05:23.561 --> 01:05:26.410
<v Speaker 3>you guys are fucking shady as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very shady.</v>

1535
01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

1536
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:32.910
<v Speaker 3>You can't just bleep a pause and pretend</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's some sort of on the fence </v>

1537
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.910
<v Speaker 3>of word in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1538
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:35.200
<v Speaker 3>So that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just deceptive.</v>

1539
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's pervasive.</v>

1540
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:40.300
<v Speaker 3>They do it all the fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1541
01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:43.480
<v Speaker 3>who's good out there to challenge him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're fucked.</v>

1542
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:46.180
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know why they're fucked.</v>

1543
01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:48.370
<v Speaker 3>Because we've never had this happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1544
01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:53.580
<v Speaker 3>The whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those Democrats are fighting each </v>

1545
01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:53.580
<v Speaker 3>other for the primary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the nomination.</v>

1546
01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:53.950
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be tweeting the shit out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those debates.</v>

1547
01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:57.070
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be live tweeting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>debates and they're not going to have to</v>

1548
01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:59.110
<v Speaker 3>worry about the tax from their </v>
<v Speaker 3>colleagues,</v>

1549
01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.520
<v Speaker 3>but also from the sitting precedent was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1550
01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:06.830
<v Speaker 3>look at this dope and he's going to come</v>
<v Speaker 3>up with nicknames for them in the stick.</v>

1551
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Denang Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He already did.</v>

1552
01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1553
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:11.110
<v Speaker 3>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick Dick Blumenthal.</v>

1554
01:06:11.111 --> 01:06:13.720
<v Speaker 3>Senator from Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lied about his Vietnam Service.</v>

1555
01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:18.340
<v Speaker 3>Has started calling him Denang Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lied about his Vietnam Service.</v>

1556
01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:19.060
<v Speaker 3>They've got elected.</v>

1557
01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.160
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

1558
01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:23.370
<v Speaker 3>shameless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1559
01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:24.900
<v Speaker 3>How did he lie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did he say?</v>

1560
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.750
<v Speaker 3>He said he served and he didn't look it </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1561
01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:28.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1562
01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:29.820
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is brazen.</v>

1563
01:06:29.821 --> 01:06:31.660
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't some ambiguous area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's like,</v>

1564
01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.480
<v Speaker 3>he never left America as my </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding.</v>

1565
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:36.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said he was in nom.</v>

1566
01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he's fucking going after Kevin.</v>

1567
01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.070
<v Speaker 6>Oh</v>

1568
01:06:40.450 --> 01:06:42.250
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does he get away with it?</v>

1569
01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.600
<v Speaker 3>But how do they all get away with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1570
01:06:43.601 --> 01:06:48.601
<v Speaker 3>Dennis Hastert was speaker of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dennis Hastert was speaker of the house </v>

1571
01:06:48.601 --> 01:06:49.960
<v Speaker 3>and he fucked how many kids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the wrestling team.</v>

1572
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:52.450
<v Speaker 3>And he only went to jail for 15 months </v>
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>

1573
01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1574
01:06:53.501 --> 01:06:58.501
<v Speaker 3>He went to jail for 15 months because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the statute of limitations or something </v>

1575
01:06:58.501 --> 01:06:58.501
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1576
01:06:58.501 --> 01:06:59.710
<v Speaker 3>I think then you go to jail for lying </v>
<v Speaker 3>about paying them off.</v>

1577
01:06:59.711 --> 01:07:00.480
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1578
01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:01.750
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

1579
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:06.810
<v Speaker 3>that isn't saying he's out now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just insane and it's no one </v>

1580
01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:10.831
<v Speaker 3>talks about him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which leads me to think there's plenty </v>

1581
01:07:10.831 --> 01:07:10.831
<v Speaker 3>of this and both sides of the aisle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1582
01:07:10.831 --> 01:07:11.610
<v Speaker 3>there must be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He must know where the bodies,</v>

1583
01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course you're speaker of the house.</v>

1584
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.160
<v Speaker 3>They just got to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just going to say,</v>

1585
01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:16.030
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 months,</v>

1586
01:07:16.031 --> 01:07:17.070
<v Speaker 3>not that big a deal with Russia.</v>

1587
01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:18.610
<v Speaker 3>Cakewalk in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay,</v>

1588
01:07:18.611 --> 01:07:21.060
<v Speaker 3>we'll get your books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be fine.</v>

1589
01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:24.510
<v Speaker 3>That's as foreign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one will not only that,</v>

1590
01:07:24.511 --> 01:07:27.220
<v Speaker 3>like when did he stop fucking kids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1591
01:07:27.221 --> 01:07:29.080
<v Speaker 3>That's the real question because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1592
01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:32.020
<v Speaker 3>that's a sickness that just doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>cured.</v>

1593
01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like quitting cigarettes or </v>

1594
01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:39.661
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The recidivism rate for people that are </v>

1595
01:07:39.661 --> 01:07:40.120
<v Speaker 3>molesters is insanely high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1596
01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.610
<v Speaker 3>So who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1597
01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:46.080
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the creepier things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>

1598
01:07:46.081 --> 01:07:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Drudge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That said,</v>

1599
01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.470
<v Speaker 3>or was it Breitbart?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1600
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.820
<v Speaker 3>I think it was bright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That said before he died,</v>

1601
01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:53.720
<v Speaker 3>where he's talking about Podesta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1602
01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:57.670
<v Speaker 3>This was the one issue I had with legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>from my forthcoming book because I,</v>

1603
01:07:57.710 --> 01:08:02.710
<v Speaker 3>because drudge said how the tweets still</v>
<v Speaker 3>up dried says how John Podesta is not </v>

1604
01:08:03.551 --> 01:08:08.551
<v Speaker 3>known as an international like child </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marissa coverup or completely eludes me </v>

1605
01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:10.180
<v Speaker 3>and no one said anything at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a big deal.</v>

1606
01:08:10.181 --> 01:08:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Podesta never sued and what he might </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been referring to is Robert Epstein</v>

1607
01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 3>with pedophile island where</v>

1608
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:18.710
<v Speaker 4>guys all go to like Jeff Epstein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me.</v>

1609
01:08:18.711 --> 01:08:19.530
<v Speaker 4>Jeff Epstein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1610
01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:24.780
<v Speaker 4>To go that island Clinton's gone like </v>
<v Speaker 4>nine times and you fuck all these </v>

1611
01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:28.211
<v Speaker 4>underage girls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they took it to be as proof of </v>

1612
01:08:28.211 --> 01:08:28.340
<v Speaker 4>pizza gate or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1613
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:34.030
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's Breitbart or wasn't breitbart </v>

1614
01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:34.090
<v Speaker 4>entered bipolar tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at drudge,</v>

1615
01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:35.450
<v Speaker 4>Breitbart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drudge,</v>

1616
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:37.680
<v Speaker 4>let's Breitbart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>breitbart.</v>

1617
01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:38.900
<v Speaker 4>So if I said to Roger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I apologize,</v>

1618
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:40.150
<v Speaker 4>just one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's,</v>

1619
01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:45.640
<v Speaker 4>here's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that everyone knows historically </v>

1620
01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.490
<v Speaker 4>that young women went to Hollywood and </v>
<v Speaker 4>had to do sexual favors.</v>

1621
01:08:49.530 --> 01:08:51.590
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since the twenties in order to get their</v>

1622
01:08:51.591 --> 01:08:52.880
<v Speaker 4>career head right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is very known.</v>

1623
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why wouldn't this happen with young men </v>

1624
01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:58.820
<v Speaker 4>with a older guy executive's why would </v>
<v Speaker 4>there be any difference?</v>

1625
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most certainly of course,</v>

1626
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:01.930
<v Speaker 4>but they like to pretend that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1627
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:02.780
<v Speaker 4>this is all crazy.</v>

1628
01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.430
<v Speaker 4>It's all a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1629
01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:05.030
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1630
01:09:05.031 --> 01:09:06.130
<v Speaker 4>it's true with this one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1631
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.070
<v Speaker 4>because it's so blatant and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>prevalent that it's horrifying,</v>

1632
01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.770
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because then it's also the powerless and</v>

1633
01:09:11.771 --> 01:09:12.710
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I going to do about it?</v>

1634
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:18.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just knowing how much it did happen </v>

1635
01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:20.660
<v Speaker 4>and if they did just uncover every </v>
<v Speaker 4>single instance of it.</v>

1636
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:22.430
<v Speaker 4>And that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like with,</v>

1637
01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.340
<v Speaker 4>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1638
01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:24.920
<v Speaker 4>Harvey Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how everyone knew,</v>

1639
01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:27.980
<v Speaker 4>we all knew and they all knew about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Clinton and all this stuff.</v>

1640
01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:33.250
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows who's a and who's when you're </v>

1641
01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:34.100
<v Speaker 4>looking up the other way when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>to kids that's so,</v>

1642
01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:35.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beyond the pale.</v>

1643
01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's start.</v>

1644
01:09:38.081 --> 01:09:39.300
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets very dark there.</v>

1645
01:09:39.301 --> 01:09:42.340
<v Speaker 4>So this Denang Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Denang Dick W,</v>

1646
01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.900
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what did he actually say and what was</v>

1647
01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.490
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to misquote him.</v>

1648
01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:47.680
<v Speaker 4>A Dick.</v>

1649
01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:51.260
<v Speaker 4>Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck did he get reelected?</v>

1650
01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:53.570
<v Speaker 4>Connecticut's influenced because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribalism.</v>

1651
01:09:53.810 --> 01:09:55.730
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna vote blue in Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how would,</v>

1652
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:58.310
<v Speaker 4>how would they accept him as their </v>
<v Speaker 4>candidate?</v>

1653
01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:03.340
<v Speaker 4>Because he got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it came out once he was the </v>

1654
01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:03.340
<v Speaker 4>candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

1655
01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:03.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a big one man.</v>

1656
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:06.650
<v Speaker 4>Yet is so invalid and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1657
01:10:06.651 --> 01:10:09.080
<v Speaker 4>forget about what Brian Williams did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's way bigger.</v>

1658
01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:12.390
<v Speaker 4>I get shit for having shaved sides of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>hair for like,</v>

1659
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:13.460
<v Speaker 4>is that the Nazi?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1660
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:14.780
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that stolen valor?</v>

1661
01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:15.680
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1662
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:17.630
<v Speaker 4>I've got that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1663
01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:21.200
<v Speaker 4>Come on a haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm politifact.com</v>

1664
01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:24.080
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He listened to the Marine Corps reserves</v>

1665
01:10:24.081 --> 01:10:28.970
<v Speaker 4>in 1970 and told him five deferments had</v>
<v Speaker 4>kept him out of the war,</v>

1666
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000
<v Speaker 4>getting a coveted slot in the reserves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reduced the chance of battlefield </v>

1667
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.031
<v Speaker 4>deployment Blumenthal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Went through basic training and served </v>

1668
01:10:37.031 --> 01:10:37.700
<v Speaker 4>six years in the Washington dc area in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Connecticut.</v>

1669
01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.010
<v Speaker 4>As Connecticut's Attorney General </v>
<v Speaker 4>Blumenthal.</v>

1670
01:10:40.011 --> 01:10:45.011
<v Speaker 4>Regularly attended Memorial Day parades </v>
<v Speaker 4>and other events at recognized soldiers </v>

1671
01:10:45.011 --> 01:10:46.250
<v Speaker 4>and veterans in New York Times wrote and</v>
<v Speaker 4>May Seventeenth,</v>

1672
01:10:46.251 --> 01:10:51.251
<v Speaker 4>2010 that in 2003 Blumenthal had spoken </v>
<v Speaker 4>at a rally supporting troops overseas.</v>

1673
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:56.480
<v Speaker 4>The newspaper reported that Blumenthal </v>
<v Speaker 4>said when we returned,</v>

1674
01:10:56.510 --> 01:11:01.510
<v Speaker 4>we saw nothing like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a comparison with soldiers who </v>

1675
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:05.441
<v Speaker 4>came back from Vietnam Blumenthal </v>
<v Speaker 4>repeatedly repeated a similar line in </v>

1676
01:11:05.441 --> 01:11:07.970
<v Speaker 4>2007 Memorial Day parade in Milford,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Connecticut,</v>

1677
01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:12.170
<v Speaker 4>and at a 2008 ceremony for veterans and </v>
<v Speaker 4>senior citizens.</v>

1678
01:11:12.171 --> 01:11:14.220
<v Speaker 4>Blumenthal said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have learned something</v>

1679
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.310
<v Speaker 2>important since the days that I served </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Vietnam.</v>

1680
01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1681
01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now look at the very bottom line.</v>

1682
01:11:20.841 --> 01:11:25.841
<v Speaker 3>Although I did not serve in Vietnam that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen firsthand the effects of </v>

1683
01:11:25.841 --> 01:11:25.841
<v Speaker 3>military action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1684
01:11:25.841 --> 01:11:27.080
<v Speaker 3>that's cool story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

1685
01:11:27.170 --> 01:11:28.970
<v Speaker 3>He's a lot you think firsthand mean.</v>

1686
01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's.</v>

1687
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:36.470
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have learned something important </v>

1688
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:39.060
<v Speaker 2>since the days that I served in Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they quoted that and that's it.</v>

1689
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.450
<v Speaker 2>He said that a 2008 ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a liar.</v>

1690
01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1691
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:45.750
<v Speaker 2>that's just that stolen valor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1692
01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.270
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1693
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:51.300
<v Speaker 2>it's a lie as much as it's still invalid</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he does have military service,</v>

1694
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:52.650
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1695
01:11:52.651 --> 01:11:54.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a part of the reserves,</v>

1696
01:11:54.061 --> 01:11:55.830
<v Speaker 2>which is an important part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>

1697
01:11:55.831 --> 01:11:57.450
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1698
01:11:57.451 --> 01:12:02.451
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to diminish that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but lying about having actually been in </v>

1699
01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:07.071
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as close to stolen valor you can </v>

1700
01:12:07.071 --> 01:12:08.640
<v Speaker 2>get with actually being a veteran.</v>

1701
01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1702
01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.030
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1703
01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:15.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like shady shady,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're dirty people.</v>

1704
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:16.560
<v Speaker 3>They're dirty people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1705
01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:18.340
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dirty business.</v>

1706
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:19.730
<v Speaker 3>It's a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible people.</v>

1707
01:12:19.731 --> 01:12:23.950
<v Speaker 3>So that's why when people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>venerating these monsters,</v>

1708
01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

1709
01:12:25.221 --> 01:12:28.310
<v Speaker 3>These people are horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just doing that.</v>

1710
01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:33.080
<v Speaker 3>Just doing that alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what's hilarious that he got</v>

1711
01:12:33.081 --> 01:12:34.520
<v Speaker 3>through though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1712
01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:40.060
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny when people can get away </v>

1713
01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:40.060
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does he ever said,</v>

1714
01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:40.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't have said that.</v>

1715
01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:41.420
<v Speaker 3>What'd he say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oops,</v>

1716
01:12:41.421 --> 01:12:45.760
<v Speaker 3>I did it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Made mistakes and I have.</v>

1717
01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I have</v>

1718
01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:50.890
<v Speaker 2>spoken about my service and I regret </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and I take full responsibility.</v>

1719
01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>full responsibility means resigning.</v>

1720
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're taking,</v>

1721
01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:56.820
<v Speaker 3>what does responsibility mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's no consequences?</v>

1722
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:59.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>

1723
01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the consequences are public shaming.</v>

1724
01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:07.250
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he is the best person for the job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite the fact that he lied a decade </v>

1725
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:10.820
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I still didn't know what </v>

1726
01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:10.820
<v Speaker 3>responsibility means in this context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have taken responsibility.</v>

1727
01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.820
<v Speaker 3>I remember Janet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a friend,</v>

1728
01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:13.860
<v Speaker 3>a mine.</v>

1730
01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:22.551

<v Speaker 3>generally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I knew Janet Reno Pals with Janet.</v>

1733
01:13:22.551 --> 01:13:27.471
<v Speaker 3>Reno was a friend of mine and she went </v>
<v Speaker 3>on TV after Waco and all those people </v>

1734
01:13:29.461 --> 01:13:31.380
<v Speaker 3>died and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is my fault.</v>

1735
01:13:31.381 --> 01:13:32.880
<v Speaker 3>I take full responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friends.</v>

1736
01:13:32.881 --> 01:13:37.881
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you should be in jail if you are </v>

1737
01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:38.400
<v Speaker 3>responsible for murdering dozens of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people getting killed,</v>

1738
01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:42.180
<v Speaker 3>you should be in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know sasquatch.</v>

1739
01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's that work?</v>

1740
01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:49.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just sturdy business.</v>

1741
01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:52.710
<v Speaker 3>It is a dirty business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is North Korea mad at us again?</v>

1742
01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:57.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad you're here today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was something this morning that I </v>

1743
01:13:57.770 --> 01:14:00.670
<v Speaker 3>was reading what happened this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea is angry at us again,</v>

1744
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:04.260
<v Speaker 3>so they just cycles of North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they'll do good cop,</v>

1745
01:14:04.261 --> 01:14:06.330
<v Speaker 3>bad cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we saw this happen.</v>

1746
01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:08.730
<v Speaker 3>It was just really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So North Korea has this,</v>

1747
01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a weapon that causes everyone</v>

1748
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:14.650
<v Speaker 1>on earth to have amnesia about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

1749
01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:17.380
<v Speaker 1>really angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was tensions as us,</v>

1750
01:14:17.381 --> 01:14:22.381
<v Speaker 1>tensions rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have this weapon that caused </v>

1751
01:14:22.381 --> 01:14:22.381
<v Speaker 1>everyone to have amnesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1752
01:14:22.381 --> 01:14:23.470
<v Speaker 1>So they'll do something and then people </v>
<v Speaker 1>forget what happened six months ago when</v>

1753
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:26.110
<v Speaker 1>the Singapore summit was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1754
01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:28.180
<v Speaker 1>and they were making nice and everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

1755
01:14:28.181 --> 01:14:28.930
<v Speaker 1>oh blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1756
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:32.620
<v Speaker 1>last year they had sentenced president </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump to death.</v>

1757
01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:38.280
<v Speaker 1>They were threatening to new Guam and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone just completely forgot about </v>

1758
01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:38.280
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>

1759
01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:38.620
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be nice.</v>

1760
01:14:38.621 --> 01:14:40.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he cancels the summit,</v>

1761
01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:43.630
<v Speaker 1>the summit comes back on there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do this,</v>

1762
01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:48.690
<v Speaker 1>they've done this for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like if you follow North Korea </v>

1763
01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:48.690
<v Speaker 1>as I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my gig.</v>

1764
01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:49.870
<v Speaker 1>You see it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then everyone's like,</v>

1765
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:51.040
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're mad at us.</v>

1766
01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:53.710
<v Speaker 1>This has never happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this has happened for 70 years.</v>

1767
01:14:53.711 --> 01:14:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is their shtick.</v>

1768
01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:58.270
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think the purpose of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is?</v>

1769
01:14:58.271 --> 01:15:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Just to stay relevant in the news and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>alert people that there's still conflict</v>

1770
01:15:02.351 --> 01:15:02.750
<v Speaker 2>between the two.</v>

1771
01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:08.850
<v Speaker 1>It's very important for them when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>make any sort of concessions to say that</v>

1772
01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.760
<v Speaker 1>they were putting up a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not,</v>

1773
01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.580
<v Speaker 1>we're doing this because we want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because you're making us doing it,</v>

1774
01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:15.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up for themselves.</v>

1775
01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:20.320
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to get pushed around </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can't show submission or </v>

1776
01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.801
<v Speaker 1>weakness in any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So president trump's been playing this </v>

1777
01:15:23.801 --> 01:15:26.981
<v Speaker 1>very intelligently and the rest then in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the corporate press won't tell you this </v>

1778
01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:30.521
<v Speaker 1>because it's everything's about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking care about trump and </v>

1779
01:15:30.521 --> 01:15:30.521
<v Speaker 1>this context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I care what the North Korean people,</v>

1780
01:15:30.521 --> 01:15:31.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is they are a,</v>

1781
01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:37.420
<v Speaker 1>they'll raise their radar rattler saber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll be nice the next day </v>

1782
01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:38.360
<v Speaker 1>and then they rattled a saber there </v>
<v Speaker 1>nights.</v>

1783
01:15:38.361 --> 01:15:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Next Day it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1784
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:41.960
<v Speaker 1>it's as night follows day with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1785
01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:42.760
<v Speaker 1>the culture is</v>

1786
01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:46.150
<v Speaker 2>a really fascinating culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The culture of Korea in general.</v>

1787
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:52.230
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much to it that we have a </v>

1788
01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:53.830
<v Speaker 2>really difficult time understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

1789
01:15:53.831 --> 01:15:57.820
<v Speaker 2>In terms of just the formalities in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which you're allowed to communicate with</v>

1790
01:15:57.821 --> 01:16:02.380
<v Speaker 2>people the in the way that they must </v>
<v Speaker 2>save face.</v>

1791
01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what they're doing.</v>

1792
01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:07.550
<v Speaker 2>Anytime there's any sort of negotiation </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1793
01:16:07.551 --> 01:16:11.890
<v Speaker 2>there has to be some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>acknowledgement of their social status,</v>

1794
01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:13.150
<v Speaker 2>their position.</v>

1795
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1796
01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:16.700
<v Speaker 1>They're very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And South Korea too,</v>

1797
01:16:16.701 --> 01:16:19.380
<v Speaker 1>so people think South Korea is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>America Junior.</v>

1798
01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:22.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are very different country from us</v>

1799
01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.320
<v Speaker 1>and just because they're our ally </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean they're all good guys too.</v>

1800
01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.820
<v Speaker 2>I was just reading Malcolm Gladwell's </v>
<v Speaker 2>outliers.</v>

1801
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:32.570
<v Speaker 2>One of the things about it is how South </v>
<v Speaker 2>Korea dealt with.</v>

1802
01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:36.800
<v Speaker 2>They went through a crisis of plane </v>
<v Speaker 2>crashes and one of the problems with the</v>

1803
01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:41.801
<v Speaker 2>plane crashes was the way the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subordinates were not allowed to </v>

1804
01:16:41.801 --> 01:16:42.290
<v Speaker 2>question the pilots and the pilots </v>
<v Speaker 2>retired,</v>

1805
01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they fixed it,</v>

1806
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.620
<v Speaker 2>they made them all speak English.</v>

1807
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:51.490
<v Speaker 1>How would that fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because English is a different language </v>

1808
01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:51.940
<v Speaker 1>of the structure of the syntax </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

1809
01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1810
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Of politeness and deferment in in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different things,</v>

1811
01:16:57.041 --> 01:17:02.041
<v Speaker 2>different sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you're not allowed to </v>

1812
01:17:02.041 --> 01:17:02.540
<v Speaker 2>communicate with people in Korean where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1813
01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:07.620
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very strong tradition of like the </v>

1814
01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Malcolm Gladwell goes into in great </v>
<v Speaker 2>detail like superiors when they're </v>

1815
01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:15.701
<v Speaker 2>around their subordinates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the subordinates are not allowed to </v>

1816
01:17:15.701 --> 01:17:15.701
<v Speaker 2>drink in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't smoke in front of them.</v>

1817
01:17:15.701 --> 01:17:17.900
<v Speaker 2>They have to turn away if they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>drink in front of them,</v>

1818
01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:21.860
<v Speaker 2>like the way they talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they bow to them,</v>

1819
01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:25.910
<v Speaker 2>they call them sir and I went through </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this in taekwondo.</v>

1820
01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Taekwondo is very structured that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I was teaching and when I was </v>

1821
01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:35.801
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was working for my Korean </v>

1822
01:17:35.801 --> 01:17:36.500
<v Speaker 2>instructors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was always sir,</v>

1823
01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:39.920
<v Speaker 2>it was always Mr Kim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was always very formal.</v>

1824
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:42.260
<v Speaker 2>There was always bowing and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

1825
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:47.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is an Americanized version in </v>

1826
01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:48.500
<v Speaker 2>English with their language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Korean language.</v>

1827
01:17:48.501 --> 01:17:53.501
<v Speaker 2>They were talking about all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>different proper forms of communication </v>

1828
01:17:53.501 --> 01:17:57.320
<v Speaker 2>and the structure that's in place to </v>
<v Speaker 2>establish who the dominant person is and</v>

1829
01:17:57.321 --> 01:17:58.370
<v Speaker 2>who the subordinate person</v>

1830
01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:03.760
<v Speaker 3>and in North Korea there's a tense that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they use only with regards to the </v>

1831
01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.101
<v Speaker 3>leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they've changed the language to that </v>

1832
01:18:07.101 --> 01:18:07.101
<v Speaker 3>extent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even for them.</v>

1833
01:18:07.101 --> 01:18:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they did was they made the South</v>

1834
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Korean pilots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all of them,</v>

1835
01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:14.070
<v Speaker 2>English was the primary language of </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>

1836
01:18:14.071 --> 01:18:16.410
<v Speaker 2>They had to learn English now and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to learn on their own dime.</v>

1837
01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll learn English and then I think </v>

1838
01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:23.400
<v Speaker 2>they went with first names so we would </v>
<v Speaker 2>work together.</v>

1839
01:18:23.401 --> 01:18:25.330
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Malice like,</v>

1840
01:18:25.331 --> 01:18:27.120
<v Speaker 2>because then I would have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be different.</v>

1841
01:18:27.190 --> 01:18:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1842
01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:28.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>plane.</v>

1844
01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:34.230
<v Speaker 2>We should probably defrost this fucker </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you and I would be.</v>

1845
01:18:34.290 --> 01:18:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Even though you would be the captain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be your copilot.</v>

1846
01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:41.700
<v Speaker 2>We would still be able to talk to each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other as if we're friends and equals not</v>

1847
01:18:41.701 --> 01:18:44.230
<v Speaker 2>on this traditional Korean social story </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure</v>

1848
01:18:44.410 --> 01:18:49.410
<v Speaker 3>at this happened in America too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people freak out that trump is </v>

1849
01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:49.410
<v Speaker 3>vulgar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rising the presidency,</v>

1850
01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:52.060
<v Speaker 3>but it was a big deal of JFK and wear a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hat at his inauguration.</v>

1851
01:18:52.330 --> 01:18:55.060
<v Speaker 3>And even before that ambulance you </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have the hat.</v>

1852
01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like vulgar hats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if it was important.</v>

1853
01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.330
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if trump wore a hat today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that hair.</v>

1854
01:19:01.331 --> 01:19:02.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's kind of wearing a hat.</v>

1855
01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:07.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wears the make America great again </v>

1856
01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:07.460
<v Speaker 3>hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean like a boulder hat,</v>

1857
01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:07.460
<v Speaker 3>like one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1858
01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:07.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1859
01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:07.950
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are there or the.</v>

1860
01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wicker ones and,</v>

1861
01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:15.011
<v Speaker 3>and FDR gotten shit because he referred </v>
<v Speaker 3>to all his subordinates by their first </v>

1862
01:19:15.011 --> 01:19:18.310
<v Speaker 3>name and this was a huge deal back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead it's interest to Roosevelt.</v>

1863
01:19:18.311 --> 01:19:19.580
<v Speaker 3>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Howard would be.</v>

1864
01:19:19.581 --> 01:19:23.540
<v Speaker 3>So he tried to be informal and correct </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was being informed was like,</v>

1865
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:25.840
<v Speaker 3>so this has been going on for a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1866
01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:30.840
<v Speaker 3>The lack of formality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look how people used to dress in </v>

1867
01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.671
<v Speaker 3>airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be been suits now there I had a </v>

1868
01:19:32.671 --> 01:19:34.690
<v Speaker 3>situation in a plane here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people are just like animals,</v>

1869
01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:40.500
<v Speaker 3>like dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dogs dress better than some of these </v>

1870
01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:40.500
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1871
01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:43.441
<v Speaker 3>they bring their dogs to bring in dogs </v>
<v Speaker 3>on planes and the subway in New York.</v>

1872
01:19:43.661 --> 01:19:45.520
<v Speaker 3>They started bringing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always find your way.</v>

1873
01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:50.580
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is have a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>paper from a doctor that says you need </v>

1874
01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:53.611
<v Speaker 3>help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they needed a dog like on </v>

1875
01:19:53.611 --> 01:19:53.611
<v Speaker 3>the subway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just take them like,</v>

1876
01:19:53.611 --> 01:19:53.611
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to fucking do about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

1877
01:19:53.611 --> 01:19:53.611
<v Speaker 3>Yet the bloods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

1878
01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:58.620
<v Speaker 3>let it go to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a real problem with people that </v>

1879
01:19:58.620 --> 01:19:59.920
<v Speaker 3>are scared of dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allergic dogs.</v>

1880
01:19:59.950 --> 01:20:04.950
<v Speaker 3>What about you have two dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to get into a fight or </v>

1881
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.950
<v Speaker 3>they start shitting somewhere.</v>

1882
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:05.440
<v Speaker 3>We know we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to San Francisco.</v>

1883
01:20:05.441 --> 01:20:07.210
<v Speaker 3>We don't have shit on the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that'd be really happy with his Dick.</v>

1968
01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:06.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

1969
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:08.560

<v Speaker 3>Does not make him a horrible person.</v>

1970
01:23:09.230 --> 01:23:14.230
<v Speaker 3>The horrible person is the guys whipping</v>
<v Speaker 3>out his dick and playing his music at </v>

1971
01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:14.230

<v Speaker 3>If he's playing that led music and he's </v>

1973
01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.470
<v Speaker 3>stroking his cock at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a horrible precedent.</v>

1974
01:23:20.471 --> 01:23:23.050
<v Speaker 3>I guess there's a locker room and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>just trying to drop sick burns.</v>

1975
01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1976
01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.600
<v Speaker 3>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all I want to do.</v>

1977
01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:28.440
<v Speaker 3>I just did my dead lifts pathetically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you gonna?</v>

1978
01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See Tucker Carlson alone for a little </v>

1979
01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:33.480
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never took it on as I.</v>

1980
01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:34.270
<v Speaker 3>I've been on Tucker's show a few times.</v>

1981
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:37.960
<v Speaker 3>I've never gotten tucker face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm very,</v>

1982
01:23:37.961 --> 01:23:39.760
<v Speaker 3>very happy face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1983
01:23:39.761 --> 01:23:40.940
<v Speaker 3>when he gives you that look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1984
01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:42.610
<v Speaker 3>I've never gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's going after you?</v>

1985
01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:47.880
<v Speaker 3>He's never done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's been very respectful because </v>

1986
01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:47.880
<v Speaker 3>very few people know North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm there to talk about,</v>

1987
01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:52.670
<v Speaker 3>so they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not being coming at that from a </v>

1988
01:23:52.670 --> 01:23:52.670
<v Speaker 3>partisan perspective at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1989
01:23:52.670 --> 01:23:52.670
<v Speaker 3>You're coming to educate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1990
01:23:52.670 --> 01:23:54.520
<v Speaker 3>So I've never gotten heat about that at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1991
01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:57.430
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what's going to happen with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and all this stuff because now that</v>

1992
01:23:57.431 --> 01:23:59.660
<v Speaker 3>his house is a bit like people know </v>
<v Speaker 3>where his house is,</v>

1993
01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:01.870
<v Speaker 3>when you probably going to move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

1994
01:24:01.871 --> 01:24:04.660
<v Speaker 3>when you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone's family that sets off some part</v>

1995
01:24:04.661 --> 01:24:09.661
<v Speaker 3>of your brain that's something fierce </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's not gonna just take this lying </v>

1996
01:24:09.661 --> 01:24:10.930
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1997
01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:14.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean I wonder if there's legal action </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be had.</v>

1998
01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:18.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all fucked up man.</v>

1999
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:23.750
<v Speaker 3>It's just we've it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've never had a time where in my life </v>

2000
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:26.050
<v Speaker 3>where I can remember the left and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right being so combative,</v>

2001
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:29.890
<v Speaker 3>not just disagreeing about things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just a debating things,</v>

2002
01:24:29.891 --> 01:24:31.840
<v Speaker 3>but this kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like riots,</v>

2003
01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:37.200
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is of the right was on their knees </v>

2004
01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:37.780
<v Speaker 3>all this time for a long time and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

2005
01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:39.460
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you people are fucking terrible.</v>

2006
01:24:39.461 --> 01:24:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the case,</v>

2007
01:24:42.101 --> 01:24:42.910
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's never.</v>

2008
01:24:43.650 --> 01:24:48.650
<v Speaker 3>Is it the right was underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was never a left wing anti foot </v>

2009
01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:50.170
<v Speaker 3>type organization because the right was </v>
<v Speaker 3>being subordinate to them in many ways,</v>

2010
01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.630
<v Speaker 3>like the press had a complete monopoly </v>
<v Speaker 3>on speech.</v>

2011
01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.580
<v Speaker 3>Twenty 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2012.</v>

2012
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Mitt Romney's having this debate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama,</v>

2013
01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:58.480
<v Speaker 3>Candy Crowley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the moderator,</v>

2014
01:24:58.481 --> 01:24:59.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The moderator,</v>

2015
01:24:59.710 --> 01:25:02.410
<v Speaker 3>and she starts arguing with Mitt Romney </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the debate.</v>

2016
01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.650
<v Speaker 3>You're the fucking moderator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sit down and shut up late.</v>

2017
01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:05.810
<v Speaker 3>You're arguing about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2018
01:25:05.811 --> 01:25:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got this tax wrong,</v>

2019
01:25:07.301 --> 01:25:07.570
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2020
01:25:07.571 --> 01:25:07.840
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2021
01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:08.220
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she,</v>

2022
01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:09.400
<v Speaker 3>even before the debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she says,</v>

2023
01:25:09.401 --> 01:25:11.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to correct them if necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bitch,</v>

2024
01:25:11.241 --> 01:25:12.220
<v Speaker 3>you're the moderator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sit down.</v>

2025
01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's supposed to.</v>

2026
01:25:15.341 --> 01:25:18.230
<v Speaker 3>If she knows something's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not supposed to say anything.</v>

2027
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:23.790
<v Speaker 3>It's like a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the judge has two sides as someone's </v>

2028
01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:24.790
<v Speaker 3>deloitte is lying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the other lawyer has to make it up.</v>

2029
01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:27.070
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as a moderator,</v>

2030
01:25:27.071 --> 01:25:31.450
<v Speaker 3>aren't you also some kind of an immune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You not necessarily an entertainer,</v>

2031
01:25:31.451 --> 01:25:33.610
<v Speaker 3>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're moving the thing along.</v>

2032
01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:37.450
<v Speaker 3>If you know something to be incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone says,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the Romney team and the Obama team sat </v>

2036
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:48.940
<v Speaker 3>down and worked out between them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how much time?</v>

2037
01:25:48.941 --> 01:25:50.050

01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:10.150
<v Speaker 7>the administration indicated that this </v>
<v Speaker 7>was a,</v>

2072
01:27:10.410 --> 01:27:15.410
<v Speaker 7>a reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do I do a video and was a spontaneous </v>

2073
01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:16.310
<v Speaker 7>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It took them a long time to say this was</v>

2074
01:27:16.311 --> 01:27:18.810
<v Speaker 7>a terrorist act by a terrorist group </v>
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

2075
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:22.370
<v Speaker 7>and to suggest it or am I incorrect in </v>
<v Speaker 7>that regard?</v>

2076
01:27:22.530 --> 01:27:23.570
<v Speaker 7>On,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on Sunday,</v>

2077
01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:24.520
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2078
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:25.700
<v Speaker 7>your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your secretary,</v>

2079
01:27:25.701 --> 01:27:28.880
<v Speaker 7>or excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the ambassador to the United Nations one</v>

2080
01:27:28.881 --> 01:27:33.881
<v Speaker 7>of the Sunday to television shows and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and spoke about how this was a </v>

2081
01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:37.091
<v Speaker 7>spontaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm happy to have a longer conversation </v>

2082
01:27:37.091 --> 01:27:37.091
<v Speaker 7>about for policy,</v>

2083
01:27:37.091 --> 01:27:37.840
<v Speaker 8>but I want.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I want to move you one and all.</v>

2084
01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:41.910
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What'd she seemed like?</v>

2085
01:27:41.911 --> 01:27:46.911
<v Speaker 4>She was just agreeing and seemed like </v>
<v Speaker 4>she was still on her role.</v>

2086
01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:49.020
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still a hurdle.</v>

2087
01:27:49.021 --> 01:27:51.420
<v Speaker 4>Say you're wrong about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You write about this in my opinion.</v>

2088
01:27:51.421 --> 01:27:52.020
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

2089
01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:53.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't think she said you're wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

2090
01:27:53.861 --> 01:27:56.340
<v Speaker 4>Did she?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She said that is correct.</v>

2091
01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.820
<v Speaker 4>It took two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean she's basically with Ron.</v>

2092
01:27:59.821 --> 01:28:04.821
<v Speaker 4>Was there another example of this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I remember that I remember it </v>

2093
01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:05.430
<v Speaker 4>got heated between the two of them so I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could be talking to my ass,</v>

2094
01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:07.410
<v Speaker 4>but I could see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Use your.</v>

2095
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:12.430
<v Speaker 4>You being correct that even what she did</v>
<v Speaker 4>there in saying that he's correct is </v>

2096
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:13.420
<v Speaker 4>really out of line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2097
01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She seemed a little flustered.</v>

2098
01:28:15.091 --> 01:28:17.760
<v Speaker 4>They're like not exactly sure what to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what not to do,</v>

2099
01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:20.840
<v Speaker 4>but there have been many example people </v>
<v Speaker 4>forgot about that.</v>

2100
01:28:20.850 --> 01:28:21.960
<v Speaker 4>Ben Gazi thing was</v>

2101
01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:26.140
<v Speaker 9>the same one.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know if this was the same one.</v>

2102
01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:28.860
<v Speaker 9>There's no volume.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know why just died.</v>

2103
01:28:29.230 --> 01:28:30.640
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either way.</v>

2104
01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like she's doing the same </v>

2105
01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:35.700
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that Ben Gazi thing that was.</v>

2106
01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:39.930
<v Speaker 4>That was so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People forgot about how that they were </v>

2107
01:28:39.930 --> 01:28:42.440
<v Speaker 4>trying to blame it on that video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your movie or video?</v>

2108
01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.200
<v Speaker 4>What was it called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something I don't remember,</v>

2109
01:28:44.201 --> 01:28:49.201
<v Speaker 4>and Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think at the time when she was </v>

2110
01:28:49.201 --> 01:28:49.201
<v Speaker 4>secretary of state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she refused to go on and they made Susan</v>

2111
01:28:49.201 --> 01:28:51.830
<v Speaker 4>rice walk the plank for that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2112
01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:54.130
<v Speaker 4>that was a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2113
01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:56.140
<v Speaker 4>That movie was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so bad.</v>

2114
01:28:56.141 --> 01:28:59.060
<v Speaker 4>It was almost like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they blame it on loose change?</v>

2115
01:28:59.061 --> 01:28:59.900
<v Speaker 4>Is that the one that they play?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2116
01:28:59.910 --> 01:29:00.270
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2117
01:29:00.271 --> 01:29:00.630
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2118
01:29:00.730 --> 01:29:01.920
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2119
01:29:01.921 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 4>It</v>

2120
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:06.980
<v Speaker 2>was a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a terrible movie that </v>

2121
01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:10.200
<v Speaker 2>someone had made like the tiers of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims or something like that.</v>

2122
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:12.480
<v Speaker 2>I forget the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was so bad.</v>

2123
01:29:12.510 --> 01:29:16.880
<v Speaker 2>It almost seemed like a parody film or </v>
<v Speaker 2>some people had said like,</v>

2124
01:29:16.890 --> 01:29:20.550
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is some CIA production.</v>

2125
01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:26.400
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting how memory works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remembered it being much more </v>

2126
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:29.551
<v Speaker 1>combative than it was when we just </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched it and I would have sworn on a </v>

2127
01:29:29.551 --> 01:29:31.420
<v Speaker 1>bible that it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very heated and then looking at that,</v>

2128
01:29:31.421 --> 01:29:32.060
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that bad.</v>

2129
01:29:32.130 --> 01:29:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this brings us back to what we're </v>

2130
01:29:37.130 --> 01:29:38.280
<v Speaker 2>talking about with cabinet and thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about things that happen when you're 17.</v>

2131
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:39.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And tribalism.</v>

2132
01:29:39.650 --> 01:29:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2133
01:29:40.410 --> 01:29:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean the memory that we have sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just shitty.</v>

2134
01:29:45.061 --> 01:29:50.061
<v Speaker 2>It's just being a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have some absolute memories </v>

2135
01:29:50.061 --> 01:29:54.081
<v Speaker 2>about facts that I know to be true in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of like statistics and things that</v>

2136
01:29:54.271 --> 01:29:58.180
<v Speaker 2>took place and that I've stored in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>memory because of my job because like,</v>

2137
01:29:58.410 --> 01:30:03.410
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I have a pretty good database of </v>

2138
01:30:03.571 --> 01:30:05.040
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd even then occasionally I'm like,</v>

2139
01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:10.220
<v Speaker 2>is that how it went?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't I think it was the second </v>

2140
01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:10.220
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2141
01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Memory suck.</v>

2142
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:12.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

2143
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're drinking booze </v>

2144
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.750
<v Speaker 2>will be telling me about all that booze </v>
<v Speaker 2>you drink.</v>

2145
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

2146
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:18.040
<v Speaker 1>This is such a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2147
01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:19.340
<v Speaker 1>the arduous march.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2148
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really exciting.</v>

2149
01:30:20.491 --> 01:30:25.170
<v Speaker 1>So I went on this rabbit hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big drinker,</v>

2150
01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did this.</v>

2151
01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:32.121
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a live stream and I tried eight </v>

2152
01:30:32.121 --> 01:30:34.341
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of Heinz Ketchup because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Heinz Ketchup and I thought this </v>

2153
01:30:34.341 --> 01:30:34.341
<v Speaker 1>is a different kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2154
01:30:34.341 --> 01:30:34.341
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's.</v>

2155
01:30:34.341 --> 01:30:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's work out.</v>

2156
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try all eight and give my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion in all eight.</v>

2157
01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:42.950
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went down a rabbit hole and I thought </v>

2158
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:45.431
<v Speaker 1>with all this weird liquor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big drinker if you guys want </v>

2159
01:30:45.431 --> 01:30:45.431
<v Speaker 1>to pay for these bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stupid,</v>

2160
01:30:45.431 --> 01:30:46.650
<v Speaker 1>the live stream people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience,</v>

2161
01:30:47.010 --> 01:30:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll buy them and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

2162
01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:53.280
<v Speaker 1>And they just kept checking in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought 32 bottles November 16th.</v>

2163
01:30:53.550 --> 01:30:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Me and six of my buddies are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

2164
01:30:56.490 --> 01:31:01.490
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I return value guys are chipping </v>

2165
01:31:01.490 --> 01:31:01.490
<v Speaker 1>in for these bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go do it with people.</v>

2166
01:31:01.490 --> 01:31:05.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's me and six of my friends were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing quarter shots and seeing if we get</v>

2167
01:31:05.161 --> 01:31:07.820
<v Speaker 1>through all 32 of these weird liquors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2168
01:31:07.930 --> 01:31:10.030
<v Speaker 1>and you can quit at any shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2169
01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:12.360
<v Speaker 1>32 times a quarter to eight shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2170
01:31:12.361 --> 01:31:13.770
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>

2171
01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:17.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of booze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of booze and some of them are</v>

2172
01:31:17.131 --> 01:31:19.200
<v Speaker 1>really exciting somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not succeeding mouth.</v>

2173
01:31:19.201 --> 01:31:24.201
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be numb after like shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>number five and also the different </v>

2174
01:31:24.201 --> 01:31:24.201
<v Speaker 1>alcohol by proof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're different.</v>

2175
01:31:24.201 --> 01:31:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Every one's a different flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all crazy.</v>

2176
01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

2177
01:31:28.271 --> 01:31:29.070
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2178
01:31:29.071 --> 01:31:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very excited with this.</v>

2179
01:31:30.241 --> 01:31:32.430
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be streaming it from </v>
<v Speaker 1>compound and at my house.</v>

2180
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found there's this one company from.</v>

2181
01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:37.800
<v Speaker 1>This is for credit for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people want to have credit,</v>

2182
01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:43.160
<v Speaker 1>there's this company from Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably haven't heard them called </v>

2183
01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:43.530
<v Speaker 1>empirical spirits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy's really wanker.</v>

2184
01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:48.531
<v Speaker 1>This former chef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he figured out new ways to make </v>

2185
01:31:48.531 --> 01:31:51.561
<v Speaker 1>liquor and he made one that's Habanero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the capsaicin doesn't get through </v>

2186
01:31:51.561 --> 01:31:53.820
<v Speaker 1>the distilling process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I can't handle heat.</v>

2187
01:31:53.821 --> 01:31:56.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're drinking the tastes that Habanero</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2190
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:03.120
<v Speaker 3>one which tastes called Charlene Mcgee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the character from firestarter,</v>

2191
01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Drew Barrymore's character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like drinking smoke.</v>

2192
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:09.010
<v Speaker 3>But it's smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's really cool.</v>

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:14.040
<v Speaker 3>What's the Habanero one calls A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate the name because it's so </v>

2194
01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:17.341
<v Speaker 3>pedestrian because it's so creative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he's done and it's called fuck </v>

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:29.510

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sweet.</v>

2252
01:34:30.630 --> 01:34:32.380
<v Speaker 3>Was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you compare it to something?</v>

2253
01:34:32.730 --> 01:34:35.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he cuts it with Habanero vinegar</v>

2254
01:34:35.771 --> 01:34:36.720
<v Speaker 3>also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't there?</v>

2255
01:34:36.850 --> 01:34:39.450

2257
01:34:41.411 --> 01:34:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

2258
01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.930
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for me to have the vocabulary </v>
<v Speaker 3>to compare these two.</v>

2259
01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:47.290
<v Speaker 3>It's got the bell pepper kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sweetness.</v>

2260
01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:49.150
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have a burn.</v>

2261
01:34:49.151 --> 01:34:50.320
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's smooth.</v>

2262
01:34:50.710 --> 01:34:55.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fire that charlene is the one I </v>

<v Speaker 3>The fire one.</v>

2264
01:34:55.710 --> 01:34:57.380
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels like a dragon.</v>

2265
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:58.280
<v Speaker 3>What's the alcohol</v>

2266

2267
01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:05.180

<v Speaker 1>This one's I think 54 proof.</v>

2268
01:35:05.690 --> 01:35:07.140
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2270
01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:12.650

<v Speaker 1>50 proof means 25 percent alcohol,</v>

2271
01:35:12.651 --> 01:35:13.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>When we were younger,</v>

2289
01:35:52.701 --> 01:35:54.740
<v Speaker 1>we played games like final fantasy and </v>

2290
01:35:54.741 --> 01:35:59.741
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2292
01:36:02.290 --> 01:36:05.891
<v Speaker 1>armor.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2295
01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:09.200
<v Speaker 1>That character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all he does is by armor and sell armor.</v>

2296
01:36:09.201 --> 01:36:10.490
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a life.</v>

01:36:12.381 --> 01:36:17.381
<v Speaker 1>he's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the player characters you're </v>

2300
01:36:17.381 --> 01:36:19.931
<v Speaker 1>playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the non-player character and the </v>

2301
01:36:19.931 --> 01:36:22.691
<v Speaker 1>point this mean makes is the vast </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of humans are non player </v>

2302
01:36:22.691 --> 01:36:26.051
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no pr mind outside their </v>

2303
01:36:26.051 --> 01:36:28.451
<v Speaker 1>programming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they call it msnbc or the at NPC is </v>

2304
01:36:28.451 --> 01:36:30.710
<v Speaker 1>the network and you'll go look the press</v>
<v Speaker 1>corps,</v>

2305
01:36:30.711 --> 01:36:32.470
<v Speaker 1>there'll be like orange man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad in peach,</v>

2306
01:36:32.490 --> 01:36:35.480
<v Speaker 1>45 Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all they know how to say,</v>

2307
01:36:35.481 --> 01:36:39.350
<v Speaker 1>and you see this on twitter where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing when people say cliched ideas,</v>

2308
01:36:39.650 --> 01:36:42.200
<v Speaker 1>but they'll say cliched ideas in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliched way.</v>

2309
01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you have no mind.</v>

2310
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:47.390
<v Speaker 1>You're just repeating what has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>programmed to you and your script and as</v>

2311
01:36:47.391 --> 01:36:52.391
<v Speaker 1>soon as you mentioned certain terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it just a kneejerk speech that they </v>

2312
01:36:52.391 --> 01:36:52.820
<v Speaker 1>give and once you identify identified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the Matrix,</v>

2313
01:36:53.150 --> 01:36:55.160
<v Speaker 1>like you see agent Smith everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2314
01:36:55.490 --> 01:36:58.190
<v Speaker 1>There's also a weird laziness to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2315
01:36:58.300 --> 01:36:58.890
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2316
01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:03.900
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that know that </v>

2317
01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:04.010
<v Speaker 1>that's what that is and they accept it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just do it anyway.</v>

2318
01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then because they know they can get </v>

2319
01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:09.040
<v Speaker 1>away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2320
01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that in journalism too.</v>

2321
01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the White House,</v>

2322
01:37:09.091 --> 01:37:14.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean journalism are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a pullup maddow npc because </v>

2323
01:37:14.871 --> 01:37:17.390
<v Speaker 1>there's a picture hurts that's tonight </v>
<v Speaker 1>on MSNBC,</v>

2324
01:37:17.391 --> 01:37:20.480
<v Speaker 1>orange man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad or like the angry intellectual show,</v>

2325
01:37:20.481 --> 01:37:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I think they call her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2326
01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:26.740
<v Speaker 1>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the twitter freak the fuck out and </v>

2327
01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:29.951
<v Speaker 1>started banning a lot of these accounts </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is really a calling the </v>

2328
01:37:29.951 --> 01:37:34.871
<v Speaker 1>bluff and a lot of these people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>these twitter banned because they say </v>

2329
01:37:34.871 --> 01:37:34.871
<v Speaker 1>it's dehumanizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2330
01:37:34.871 --> 01:37:35.930
<v Speaker 1>they didn't give a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the ostensible reason,</v>

2331
01:37:35.931 --> 01:37:40.931
<v Speaker 1>theoretically sooner never explained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dehumanizing to call someone a non </v>

2332
01:37:40.931 --> 01:37:41.510
<v Speaker 1>player characters in effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a way.</v>

2333
01:37:41.511 --> 01:37:43.250
<v Speaker 1>If you're saying they have no mind or </v>
<v Speaker 1>soul,</v>

2334
01:37:43.330 --> 01:37:45.350
<v Speaker 1>but is it okay to scrawl them a basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch?</v>

2335
01:37:46.130 --> 01:37:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it's super similar.</v>

2336
01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:50.180
<v Speaker 1>What about calling someone a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi?</v>

2337
01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why was that so easy?</v>

2338
01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're calling someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi,</v>

2339
01:37:53.821 --> 01:37:55.470
<v Speaker 1>you are reading them effectively out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human race.</v>

2340
01:37:55.471 --> 01:37:56.220
<v Speaker 1>You're saying this person</v>

2341
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.930
<v Speaker 3>is not deserving of any semblance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>decency of fairness,</v>

2342
01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:02.800
<v Speaker 3>and that's not a crazy perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They see ultimate subhuman designation.</v>

2343
01:38:02.801 --> 01:38:03.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2344
01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:05.340
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the new n word,</v>

2345
01:38:05.341 --> 01:38:06.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2346
01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:08.340
<v Speaker 3>Not seeing it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

2347
01:38:08.350 --> 01:38:13.350
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually really easy to say you </v>

2348
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.350
<v Speaker 3>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't pull it up.</v>

2349
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:17.280
<v Speaker 3>Not the actual thing that you asked for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but memes of her as this.</v>

2350
01:38:17.730 --> 01:38:18.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the one.</v>

2351
01:38:18.301 --> 01:38:19.560
<v Speaker 3>The third one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one.</v>

2352
01:38:19.561 --> 01:38:20.300
<v Speaker 3>That right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2353
01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:23.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the outrage intellectual show.</v>

2354
01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:31.830
<v Speaker 3>What's really hilarious is listening to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the liberals go off on her like real </v>

2355
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:32.450
<v Speaker 3>progressives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Jimmy Dore,</v>

2356
01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:33.920
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy Dore,</v>

2357
01:38:33.921 --> 01:38:35.520
<v Speaker 3>Michael Tracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Glenn Greenwald.</v>

2358
01:38:35.521 --> 01:38:36.900
<v Speaker 3>None of them follow me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wish they would,</v>

2359
01:38:36.901 --> 01:38:39.030
<v Speaker 3>but they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate when the right things.</v>

2360
01:38:39.031 --> 01:38:40.170
<v Speaker 3>Everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The left's the same,</v>

2361
01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:43.500
<v Speaker 3>there are many people on the left who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are not pc,</v>

2362
01:38:43.530 --> 01:38:46.950
<v Speaker 3>who are brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have left wing ideas and convictions</v>

2363
01:38:47.010 --> 01:38:50.130
<v Speaker 3>and they call shit out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the percentage of them in comparison</v>

2364
01:38:50.131 --> 01:38:55.131
<v Speaker 3>to the percentage that just follow the </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative is so small that we were just </v>

2365
01:38:55.131 --> 01:38:55.131
<v Speaker 3>talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 slash 10,</v>

2366
01:38:55.131 --> 01:38:59.720
<v Speaker 3>90 percent of any population are going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be npcs and 10 percent are going to </v>

2367
01:38:59.720 --> 01:38:59.720
<v Speaker 3>be the innovators.</v>

2368
01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:00.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2369
01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:04.890
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy Dore goes off on her when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the arduous march.</v>

2370
01:39:04.891 --> 01:39:07.000
<v Speaker 3>Me and the six friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Jay Irwin who was a four.</v>

2371
01:39:07.001 --> 01:39:08.550
<v Speaker 3>Chan Maude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my Buddy Michael Wolf,</v>

2372
01:39:08.551 --> 01:39:13.551
<v Speaker 3>strength coach Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was an immigrant and that's a </v>

2373
01:39:13.551 --> 01:39:13.551
<v Speaker 3>Virginia Simon's an immigrant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Paul,</v>

2374
01:39:13.551 --> 01:39:14.250
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a name for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I said,</v>

2375
01:39:14.251 --> 01:39:16.350
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be Paul and Dave Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know he's gonna.</v>

2376
01:39:16.351 --> 01:39:18.420
<v Speaker 3>Be excited from the Romney win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>

2377
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to say Paul the NPC,</v>

2378
01:39:21.090 --> 01:39:26.090
<v Speaker 3>and he immediately went out and got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gray sweatshirt and gray a ski to where </v>

2379
01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:27.840
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just looked like the name sounds very</v>

2380
01:39:27.841 --> 01:39:28.830
<v Speaker 3>proud of Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2381
01:39:28.831 --> 01:39:30.750
<v Speaker 3>What Romney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I'm not aware,</v>

2382
01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:32.710
<v Speaker 3>Ronnie's the senator from Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just was.</v>

2383
01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:38.090
<v Speaker 3>He just got elected Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does he go from Massachusetts to </v>

2384
01:39:38.090 --> 01:39:38.090
<v Speaker 3>Utah?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got,</v>

2385
01:39:38.090 --> 01:39:38.710
<v Speaker 3>he's a mormon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got the matching underwear.</v>

2386
01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:39.870
<v Speaker 3>But did he move there?</v>

2387
01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Did he have to move there to get that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Utah does think he lived there before </v>

2388
01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts because he ran the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympics,</v>

2389
01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:46.230
<v Speaker 3>didn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Out of Salt Lake.</v>

2390
01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a Mormon,</v>

2391
01:39:48.181 --> 01:39:50.340
<v Speaker 3>you've got Utah Roots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2392
01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:53.310
<v Speaker 3>He's so reasonable in comparison to </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

2393
01:39:53.370 --> 01:39:58.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if people would vote for </v>

2394
01:39:58.370 --> 01:39:58.370
<v Speaker 3>him now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's going to know.</v>

2395
01:39:58.370 --> 01:39:59.740
<v Speaker 3>I think he's completely soulless and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think people look away.</v>

2396
01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:01.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people go for </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonability.</v>

2397
01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was four.</v>

2398
01:40:02.610 --> 01:40:03.560
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he attack.</v>

2399
01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:06.840
<v Speaker 3>He went to the left of Ted Kennedy for </v>
<v Speaker 3>gay marriage and he's against it.</v>

2400
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:09.360
<v Speaker 3>He's saying Romneycare works for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts,</v>

2401
01:40:09.361 --> 01:40:11.040
<v Speaker 3>but it won't work for America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck does that mean?</v>

2402
01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:12.690
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the,</v>

2403
01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:15.550
<v Speaker 3>to the left of Ted Kennedy when it came </v>
<v Speaker 3>to gay marriage.</v>

2404
01:40:15.710 --> 01:40:18.150
<v Speaker 3>Look up a romney.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ted Kennedy gay rights.</v>

2405
01:40:18.570 --> 01:40:20.520
<v Speaker 3>He asked me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was for gay rights.</v>

2406
01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.590
<v Speaker 3>Then he's against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pro choice pro life.</v>

2407
01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:24.570
<v Speaker 3>What was his reasoning for going against</v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

2408
01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:26.850
<v Speaker 3>Because now he's running for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republican presidents.</v>

2409
01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:31.110
<v Speaker 3>The guy's a fucking phony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an odd duck.</v>

2410
01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:33.840
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But could you not be your dad's Mexican?</v>

2411
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:36.430
<v Speaker 3>His Dad is Mexican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2412
01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:39.390
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

2432
01:41:22.061 --> 01:41:24.610

<v Speaker 3>It's a great way to exonerate yourself.</v>

2433
01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:25.570
<v Speaker 3>It isn't though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2434
01:41:25.571 --> 01:41:27.160
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked about this in my next book.</v>

2435
01:41:27.230 --> 01:41:30.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm when people on the left are saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump is gaslighting me.</v>

2436
01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:33.130
<v Speaker 3>If your gas lit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means you're crazy.</v>

2437
01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:35.890
<v Speaker 3>Gas Lit means someone is making you feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>

2438
01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:37.540
<v Speaker 3>That's the definition of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2439
01:41:37.541 --> 01:41:39.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2440
01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.540
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird term.</v>

2441
01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:41.650
<v Speaker 3>Gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2442
01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:43.600
<v Speaker 3>I think I've ever used it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only read it.</v>

2443
01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:45.520
<v Speaker 3>It's been a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What movie?</v>

2444
01:41:45.970 --> 01:41:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Gaslight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2445
01:41:46.991 --> 01:41:48.220
<v Speaker 3>you didn't know where the term comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

2446
01:41:48.221 --> 01:41:53.221
<v Speaker 3>There's a movie from the forties where </v>
<v Speaker 3>the husband is trying to convince the </v>

2447
01:41:53.221 --> 01:41:53.221
<v Speaker 3>wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's going insane.</v>

2448
01:41:53.221 --> 01:41:54.970
<v Speaker 3>So he's like changing the light bulbs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like fucking with her head.</v>

2449
01:41:55.270 --> 01:42:00.270
<v Speaker 3>So two gas lights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you manipulate someone to believe </v>

2450
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:02.671
<v Speaker 3>they're going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how can someone say that trump has </v>

2451
01:42:02.671 --> 01:42:06.010
<v Speaker 3>manipulating them into believing they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going crazy.</v>

2452
01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:11.340
<v Speaker 3>They think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they think that he's making them </v>

2453
01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:11.770
<v Speaker 3>crazy because he's just such an asshole </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's making them crazy?</v>

2454
01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:16.780
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's such a liar that he's making me </v>

2455
01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:17.950
<v Speaker 3>lose my sense of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2456
01:42:17.951 --> 01:42:22.951
<v Speaker 3>but the person who's the recipient of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gaslighting is not in a good place no </v>

2457
01:42:22.951 --> 01:42:23.740
<v Speaker 3>matter how you cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2458
01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:26.620
<v Speaker 3>You're either losing touch with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're doubting things,</v>

2459
01:42:26.621 --> 01:42:31.621
<v Speaker 3>you're losing your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be that guy or that </v>

2460
01:42:31.621 --> 01:42:31.621
<v Speaker 3>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't give gifts.</v>

2461
01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get gas lit and they'll say,</v>

2462
01:42:33.461 --> 01:42:35.590
<v Speaker 3>you're getting gas lit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the movie from the twenties,</v>

2463
01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:36.490
<v Speaker 3>thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forties.</v>

2464
01:42:36.491 --> 01:42:38.620
<v Speaker 3>I need to go see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a brilliant idea.</v>

2465
01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:40.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like it.</v>

2466
01:42:40.681 --> 01:42:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds funny.</v>

2467
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:45.130
<v Speaker 3>It is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny to watch it too,</v>

2468
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:48.070
<v Speaker 3>like the time period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2469
01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:49.360
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2470
01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:51.880
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Ingmar Bergman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2471
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:53.350
<v Speaker 3>This is a major,</v>
<v Speaker 3>major film.</v>

2472
01:42:53.690 --> 01:42:55.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a creative plot.</v>

2473
01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is.</v>

2474
01:42:57.910 --> 01:43:01.210
<v Speaker 3>That's very creative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's the most creative show?</v>

2475
01:43:01.211 --> 01:43:06.211
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the most creative and </v>
<v Speaker 3>innovative shows of all time is the </v>

2476
01:43:06.211 --> 01:43:09.001
<v Speaker 3>twilight zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think about all the different </v>

2477
01:43:09.001 --> 01:43:09.001
<v Speaker 3>premises they covered in the twilight </v>
<v Speaker 3>zone.</v>

2478
01:43:09.001 --> 01:43:09.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good Lord.</v>

2479
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:12.100
<v Speaker 3>What a bounty of creative ideas.</v>

2480
01:43:12.130 --> 01:43:14.240
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every one of those was like.</v>

2481
01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:18.100
<v Speaker 3>It was like a twist and it has one every</v>
<v Speaker 3>three years.</v>

2482
01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:21.010
<v Speaker 3>They got to do it every week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He nailed it with one.</v>

2483
01:43:21.130 --> 01:43:24.210
<v Speaker 3>He nailed it with the sixth sense and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then after that it was like,</v>

2484
01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:30.480
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the village with all like living in a </v>

2485
01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:30.480
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Planes aren't allowed to fly over there.</v>

2486
01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:30.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2487
01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:35.640
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You find out they're right next to a </v>

2488
01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:35.640
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can walk to a road and a day,</v>

2489
01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:39.061
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how long that that's 20 miles </v>

2490
01:43:39.061 --> 01:43:39.061
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that far.</v>

2491
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:44.270
<v Speaker 3>Like you're 20 miles from people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're telling me people never got to </v>

2492
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:47.371
<v Speaker 3>your village.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you guessed the ending for the </v>

2493
01:43:47.371 --> 01:43:47.371
<v Speaker 3>success?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it right away.</v>

2494
01:43:47.371 --> 01:43:47.371
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

2495
01:43:47.371 --> 01:43:47.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I missed it.</v>

2496
01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:50.800
<v Speaker 3>I think when you're being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

2497
01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:51.980

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2500
01:43:55.910 --> 01:44:00.910
<v Speaker 4>because all those movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you come in looking at it from a </v>

2501
01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:00.910
<v Speaker 4>writer perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2502
01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:04.481
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to show their hand in the </v>

2503
01:44:04.481 --> 01:44:04.481
<v Speaker 4>first two minutes because then you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>

2504
01:44:04.481 --> 01:44:04.520
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2505
01:44:04.521 --> 01:44:09.521
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like watching him like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see the one where the plants </v>

2506
01:44:09.521 --> 01:44:10.550

01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:56.840
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2529
01:44:57.490 --> 01:45:00.080
<v Speaker 4>It's Mucky muck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We years this.</v>

2530
01:45:01.190 --> 01:45:02.600
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the other one.</v>

2531
01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:05.440
<v Speaker 4>First one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first and the.</v>

2532
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:09.200
<v Speaker 4>When they brought it back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really pretty sure.</v>

2533
01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:10.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there it is.</v>

2534
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:11.840
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at the image,</v>

2535
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:14.740
<v Speaker 4>the 2001 right above that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one to the right of that.</v>

2536
01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:16.820
<v Speaker 4>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I to look at that.</v>

2537
01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:19.000
<v Speaker 4>And that's good makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah,</v>

2538
01:45:19.001 --> 01:45:21.170
<v Speaker 4>it is probably a little bit of CGI,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2539
01:45:21.171 --> 01:45:22.790
<v Speaker 4>It's still impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2540
01:45:22.791 --> 01:45:26.510
<v Speaker 4>it's totally amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy that that was 2001.</v>

2541
01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:29.030
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2542
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:30.620
<v Speaker 4>So there's that.</v>

2543
01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:37.280
<v Speaker 4>I feel like this was a totally different</v>
<v Speaker 4>one than the one that was from 2010.</v>

2544
01:45:38.311 --> 01:45:43.311
<v Speaker 4>Like almost like it was a reboot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I don't think they were the same </v>

2545
01:45:43.311 --> 01:45:43.311
<v Speaker 4>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that.</v>

2546
01:45:43.311 --> 01:45:45.000
<v Speaker 4>I think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that it's the universe.</v>

2547
01:45:45.090 --> 01:45:50.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just totally different </v>

2548
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:50.090
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't this Tim Burton?</v>

2549
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:50.090
<v Speaker 4>It was Tim Burton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2550
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:51.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in this one,</v>

2551
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:57.350
<v Speaker 4>marky mark comes to the future and finds</v>
<v Speaker 4>the plant of the apes and the whole </v>

2552
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:58.680
<v Speaker 4>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in the next one,</v>

2553
01:45:58.681 --> 01:46:01.560
<v Speaker 4>the next reboot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was the James Franco one,</v>

2554
01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:05.790
<v Speaker 4>James Franco is a part of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>medical experiments at turn.</v>

2555
01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.740
<v Speaker 4>Caesar's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a prequel.</v>

2556
01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:09.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it was.</v>

2557
01:46:10.590 --> 01:46:12.180
<v Speaker 4>There's been a lot of planet of the apes</v>
<v Speaker 4>movies.</v>

2558
01:46:12.181 --> 01:46:14.220
<v Speaker 4>People are Goddamn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Except there we are,</v>

2559
01:46:14.221 --> 01:46:16.740
<v Speaker 4>we are like really obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 4>chimpanzees.</v>

2560
01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:19.320
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait for the crossover with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Muslim Brotherhood movie.</v>

2561
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:20.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're going to do that.</v>

2562
01:46:20.690 --> 01:46:22.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Call it barrel aged.</v>

2563
01:46:22.081 --> 01:46:27.081
<v Speaker 4>Valerie Jarrett,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think once they canceled the connors </v>

<v Speaker 4>that went out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got into vine in development.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>The.</v>

2567
01:46:34.051 --> 01:46:38.180

<v Speaker 4>explained the rise of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2636
01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:02.520

<v Speaker 4>start,</v>

2642
01:49:12.451 --> 01:49:15.780
<v Speaker 4>but hunger for fame and money was placed</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the movement.</v>

2643
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:20.990
<v Speaker 4>Funny how he was a free thinker in </v>
<v Speaker 4>quotes before and now he's a trader and </v>

2644
01:49:21.681 --> 01:49:25.110
<v Speaker 4>quotes sounds a lot like a tactic of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>

2645
01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:27.770
<v Speaker 4>I liked how she capitalized left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2646
01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:32.140
<v Speaker 4>You made your bed now lie in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was laying.</v>

2647
01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:33.090
<v Speaker 4>Laying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2648
01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:35.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe not.</v>

2649
01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:40.320
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's a double entendre or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it'd be in factual.</v>

2650
01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:47.900
<v Speaker 4>Tommy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I can speak on behalf of people </v>

2651
01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:52.200
<v Speaker 4>on both sides of the political aisle and</v>
<v Speaker 4>say we're sorry about your failed </v>

2652
01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.100
<v Speaker 4>career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That this is hilarious.</v>

2653
01:49:54.190 --> 01:49:57.910
<v Speaker 4>She's saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's literally had a career in this for</v>

2654
01:49:57.970 --> 01:50:01.390
<v Speaker 4>about eight months and you're failed </v>
<v Speaker 4>career.</v>

2655
01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:03.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she used to run an anti-trump website.</v>

2656
01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:05.270
<v Speaker 4>A excite you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2657
01:50:05.310 --> 01:50:05.710
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2658
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:11.550
<v Speaker 4>The desperation to be relevant again by </v>
<v Speaker 4>constantly saving me and slash or </v>

2659
01:50:12.161 --> 01:50:17.161
<v Speaker 4>attacking Kathy Griffin weekly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make sure it doesn't bode well for any </v>

2660
01:50:17.381 --> 01:50:18.820
<v Speaker 4>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Grow Up.</v>

2661
01:50:18.821 --> 01:50:20.290
<v Speaker 4>Whenever anyone writes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grow up.</v>

2662
01:50:20.291 --> 01:50:21.820
<v Speaker 4>I always hear it in cartons voice.</v>

2663
01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:26.170
<v Speaker 4>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they go out into the further?</v>

2664
01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:28.540
<v Speaker 4>Always was just one little bit of back </v>
<v Speaker 4>and forth.</v>

2665
01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:30.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so silly.</v>

2666
01:50:31.230 --> 01:50:36.230
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Owen's went on the defensive Wednesday </v>

2667
01:50:36.230 --> 01:50:38.491
<v Speaker 4>after West rejected claims that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>designed or created by Lexit tee shirts.</v>

2668
01:50:40.330 --> 01:50:41.500
<v Speaker 4>What is black,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black,</v>

2669
01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:43.510
<v Speaker 4>black lives they could show to called a </v>
<v Speaker 4>black set?</v>

2670
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:49.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they mean the blacks leaving the </v>

2671
01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:49.470
<v Speaker 4>Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And why didn't they do that?</v>

2672
01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:52.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to ask candice and our Kanye </v>

2673
01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:52.780
<v Speaker 4>and our.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kathy Griffin.</v>

2674
01:50:52.930 --> 01:50:57.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I get they did it because of </v>

2675
01:50:57.930 --> 01:50:57.930
<v Speaker 4>brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2676
01:50:57.930 --> 01:50:57.930
<v Speaker 4>but black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's center.</v>

2677
01:50:57.930 --> 01:50:58.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2678
01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.660
<v Speaker 4>Below.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not bad.</v>

2679
01:51:01.690 --> 01:51:03.880
<v Speaker 4>Black exit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2680
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:06.900
<v Speaker 4>but black state is also black exit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2681
01:51:06.901 --> 01:51:09.580
<v Speaker 4>It's called blaxploitation movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2682
01:51:09.581 --> 01:51:14.581
<v Speaker 4>But exit is spelled e x I t and if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just have bel and then fix it,</v>

2683
01:51:14.861 --> 01:51:16.660
<v Speaker 4>it's actually better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2684
01:51:17.210 --> 01:51:19.840
<v Speaker 4>if you want to be sure precisely </v>
<v Speaker 4>spelling is better,</v>

2685
01:51:19.841 --> 01:51:21.460
<v Speaker 4>but in terms of how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how it said,</v>

2686
01:51:21.461 --> 01:51:22.900
<v Speaker 4>I think blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds lacks it.</v>

2687
01:51:23.070 --> 01:51:27.700
<v Speaker 4>I have to opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think either.</v>

2688
01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:32.790
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to create exit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just keep exiting there and just be </v>

2689
01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:34.120
<v Speaker 4>all the beginning of it and it works or </v>
<v Speaker 4>it flex.</v>

2690
01:51:34.150 --> 01:51:35.620
<v Speaker 4>It also works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's.</v>

2691
01:51:35.850 --> 01:51:38.540
<v Speaker 4>I've sure candace think you're married </v>
<v Speaker 4>to your idea of blacks.</v>

2692
01:51:38.541 --> 01:51:41.140
<v Speaker 4>It's needed to let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a writer.</v>

2693
01:51:41.141 --> 01:51:44.110
<v Speaker 4>You know how to kill your babies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any black vaping's.</v>

2694
01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:47.170
<v Speaker 4>No excavating writing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You kill your darlings.</v>

2695
01:51:47.171 --> 01:51:49.420
<v Speaker 4>Kill your darling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kill your shitty ideas.</v>

2696
01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:50.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blacks.</v>

2697
01:51:50.741 --> 01:51:52.930
<v Speaker 4>It's a shitty idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Black sit is where it's at.</v>

2698
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:53.770
<v Speaker 4>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2699
01:51:53.771 --> 01:51:54.970
<v Speaker 4>Brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brexit.</v>

2700
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:57.400
<v Speaker 4>They were right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that this is gonna be a lot</v>

2701
01:51:57.401 --> 01:52:02.401
<v Speaker 4>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black people leaving the Democratic </v>

2702
01:52:02.401 --> 01:52:02.401
<v Speaker 4>Party?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

2703
01:52:02.401 --> 01:52:02.401
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2704
01:52:02.401 --> 01:52:06.600
<v Speaker 4>I think there's going to be a few that </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognize that it's a genuine pathway to</v>

2705
01:52:06.641 --> 01:52:08.590
<v Speaker 4>attention and I think there's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

2706
01:52:08.590 --> 01:52:10.300
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people are going to sit home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2707
01:52:10.301 --> 01:52:12.340
<v Speaker 4>That's what African American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a few.</v>

2708
01:52:12.370 --> 01:52:15.430
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a few on both sides of the aisle</v>

2709
01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:18.490
<v Speaker 4>that are contrarians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hucksters,</v>

2710
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:23.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's just two different types of </v>

2711
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:25.270
<v Speaker 4>posts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The contrarians are people that don't </v>

2712
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:27.451
<v Speaker 4>like the fact that they are being told </v>
<v Speaker 4>that as an African American I have to </v>

2713
01:52:27.451 --> 01:52:29.500
<v Speaker 4>vote Democrat and I have to lean left </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>

2714
01:52:29.501 --> 01:52:30.730
<v Speaker 4>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2715
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:32.620
<v Speaker 4>you don't tell me what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they go that way.</v>

2716
01:52:32.650 --> 01:52:37.650
<v Speaker 4>I think we're getting a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that from Kanye West and then there's </v>

2717
01:52:37.650 --> 01:52:40.300
<v Speaker 4>people that recognize that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's legitimate pathway to start them</v>

2718
01:52:40.570 --> 01:52:43.270
<v Speaker 4>to attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2719
01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:48.600
<v Speaker 4>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a career in being like reciting </v>

2720
01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:50.000
<v Speaker 4>conservative talking points as an </v>
<v Speaker 4>African American.</v>

2721
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:50.500
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2722
01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:53.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's an affirmative action.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2723
01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:56.030
<v Speaker 4>But it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and especially,</v>

2724
01:52:56.420 --> 01:53:01.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can get a little juice on some </v>

2725
01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:04.520
<v Speaker 4>sort of argument with some Tommy Lauren </v>
<v Speaker 4>check or any of these.</v>

2726
01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:06.440
<v Speaker 4>I was confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Her and Lauren Southern,</v>

2727
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:08.210
<v Speaker 4>they're very different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

2728
01:53:08.211 --> 01:53:10.840
<v Speaker 4>but they're both hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're both hot plates on.</v>

2729
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:16.030
<v Speaker 4>That's all I say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not really paying attention to what </v>

2730
01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:16.030
<v Speaker 4>they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2731
01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:16.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's fair to Lauren.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How dare you.</v>

2732
01:53:16.670 --> 01:53:21.670
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean had there has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is lauren the superior to the title?</v>

2733
01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:23.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2734
01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:26.000
<v Speaker 4>if I wouldn't have said not fair to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lauren,</v>

2735
01:53:26.001 --> 01:53:28.430
<v Speaker 4>so lauren is better than Tommy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2736
01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:33.800
<v Speaker 4>I think Lauren,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tommy is very much someone who's there </v>

2737
01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:35.930
<v Speaker 4>to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a standard Republican point of view.</v>

2738
01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:40.980
<v Speaker 4>What she does well and is that lauren is</v>
<v Speaker 4>more of kind of a filmmaker and she's </v>

2739
01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:41.480
<v Speaker 4>much edgier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2740
01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:43.520
<v Speaker 4>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she went with Molyneux to Australia.</v>

2741
01:53:43.521 --> 01:53:47.630
<v Speaker 4>There was all this beef beef about going</v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>

2742
01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:50.120
<v Speaker 4>like they wanted to stop their talks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2743
01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:52.580
<v Speaker 4>she's done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's going to South Africa to do work.</v>

2744
01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:54.030
<v Speaker 4>They want to stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's talks,</v>

2745
01:53:54.031 --> 01:53:59.031
<v Speaker 4>they want to stop Tommy's talks to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to start stock of lawrence </v>

2746
01:53:59.031 --> 01:53:59.810
<v Speaker 4>onto more controversial and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>controversial.</v>

2747
01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:00.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2748
01:54:00.771 --> 01:54:03.410
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's very anti anti immigrant.</v>

2749
01:54:03.411 --> 01:54:06.080
<v Speaker 4>She went to Europe to see the migrant </v>
<v Speaker 4>camps.</v>

2750
01:54:06.450 --> 01:54:09.500
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're not going to see Lauren really</v>

2751
01:54:09.501 --> 01:54:11.330
<v Speaker 4>on these mainstream outlets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2752
01:54:11.930 --> 01:54:16.670
<v Speaker 4>well I know Lauren was referenced in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of the discussions that I was having</v>

2753
01:54:16.671 --> 01:54:21.671
<v Speaker 4>with people on twitter about people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>South Africa who are farmers getting </v>

2754
01:54:21.771 --> 01:54:22.310
<v Speaker 4>murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2755
01:54:22.311 --> 01:54:24.740
<v Speaker 4>She had a documentary called farmlands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2756
01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:30.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a weird one where people were </v>

2757
01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:31.490
<v Speaker 4>getting angry at me and saying that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was reciting a racist conspiracy theory.</v>

2758
01:54:31.491 --> 01:54:32.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2759
01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:37.630
<v Speaker 4>but this is a racist conspiracy theory </v>
<v Speaker 4>that a black person was talking about in</v>

2760
01:54:37.791 --> 01:54:40.310
<v Speaker 4>front of Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2761
01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:46.010
<v Speaker 4>this is a black African guy talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it on television in Africa,</v>

2762
01:54:46.011 --> 01:54:47.960
<v Speaker 4>the problems with farm murders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2763
01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:52.290
<v Speaker 4>and then there was that guy who was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>one who wants reparations,</v>

2764
01:54:52.291 --> 01:54:57.200
<v Speaker 4>who was in South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's a very controversial character,</v>

2765
01:54:57.410 --> 01:54:57.890
<v Speaker 4>who was.</v>

2766
01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:03.100
<v Speaker 4>He was kicked out of one of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>organizations for doing a song singing </v>

2767
01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:04.640
<v Speaker 4>about killed the board.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2768
01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:10.090
<v Speaker 4>he's doing it and making guns sounds and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the audience is cheering around along </v>

2769
01:55:10.090 --> 01:55:13.010
<v Speaker 4>with his song with gun sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's about killing farmers.</v>

2770
01:55:13.011 --> 01:55:18.011
<v Speaker 4>The term conspiracy theory is a tactic </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the press and people use to shut </v>

2771
01:55:18.321 --> 01:55:20.090
<v Speaker 4>down conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you think about it,</v>

2772
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:22.370
<v Speaker 4>Harvey Weinstein was a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 4>theory.</v>

2773
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:25.850
<v Speaker 4>Bill cosby was a conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kevin Spacey was a conspiracy theory.</v>

2774
01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:30.230
<v Speaker 4>Everyone knew everyone and everyone kept</v>
<v Speaker 4>their mouth shut.</v>

2775
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:35.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the idea that a conspiracy theories </v>

2776
01:55:35.310 --> 01:55:37.330
<v Speaker 4>inherently false is itself inherently </v>
<v Speaker 4>false and it's just a way to stigmatize </v>

2777
01:55:37.330 --> 01:55:38.300
<v Speaker 4>a school of thought or an idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to talk about.</v>

2778
01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:43.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also labeling it as a racist </v>

2779
01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:43.720
<v Speaker 4>ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's true too.</v>

2780
01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:43.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

2781
01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:44.460
<v Speaker 4>you are immediately</v>

2782
01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:47.850
<v Speaker 2>rate and they also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was because of trump reciting it.</v>

2783
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Trump had repeated it on television </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about something in terms of the </v>

2784
01:55:53.581 --> 01:55:55.930
<v Speaker 2>issue with South African farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2785
01:55:56.130 --> 01:56:01.130
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of those things that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about before where even if </v>

2786
01:56:01.130 --> 01:56:01.320
<v Speaker 2>they know that the narrative is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>

2787
01:56:01.530 --> 01:56:06.530
<v Speaker 2>it supports what they're trying to push </v>
<v Speaker 2>so they run with it and so I just kept </v>

2788
01:56:07.291 --> 01:56:12.291
<v Speaker 2>doubling down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept posting all these different </v>

2789
01:56:12.291 --> 01:56:12.291
<v Speaker 2>things about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2790
01:56:12.291 --> 01:56:12.291
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about this guy talking about it?</v>

2791
01:56:12.291 --> 01:56:13.010
<v Speaker 2>What about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about here's,</v>

2792
01:56:13.070 --> 01:56:18.070
<v Speaker 2>here's some instances of these murders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's also the reality of </v>

2793
01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:19.830
<v Speaker 2>South Africa in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is extremely violent.</v>

2794
01:56:20.010 --> 01:56:25.010
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of violence and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of crime and some of it has to do </v>

2795
01:56:25.010 --> 01:56:29.661
<v Speaker 2>with the fact that these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these farms are targets because </v>

2796
01:56:29.661 --> 01:56:32.841
<v Speaker 2>they're out in the middle of nowhere and</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it's racist that they're </v>

2797
01:56:32.841 --> 01:56:34.110
<v Speaker 2>going after them because they're white.</v>

2798
01:56:34.290 --> 01:56:39.290
<v Speaker 2>That's debatable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but black farmers are also getting </v>

2799
01:56:39.290 --> 01:56:40.200
<v Speaker 2>attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not simply just white farmers.</v>

2800
01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:43.600
<v Speaker 2>There is some of that though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some of that.</v>

2801
01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are going after these </v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers because they're white and this.</v>

2802
01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:52.500
<v Speaker 2>The thing that's really disturbing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>are people that people are happier if </v>

2803
01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:53.220
<v Speaker 2>this is black people killing other black</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like the Hutu and the Tutsis.</v>

2804
01:56:53.221 --> 01:56:58.221
<v Speaker 2>That was the genocide and so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem when people are being </v>

2805
01:56:58.221 --> 01:57:00.750
<v Speaker 2>killed regardless of their race and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribalism cuts across racial lines,</v>

2806
01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:02.790
<v Speaker 2>but on the other side there was also </v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

2807
01:57:02.970 --> 01:57:06.120
<v Speaker 2>some legitimate claims to land that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>stolen,</v>

2808
01:57:06.330 --> 01:57:11.330
<v Speaker 2>stolen during apartheid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that the people who are alive today </v>

2809
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:13.230
<v Speaker 2>who might not have been around during </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stealing of that land,</v>

2810
01:57:13.231 --> 01:57:15.150
<v Speaker 2>are benefiting from the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

2811
01:57:15.450 --> 01:57:18.870
<v Speaker 2>They're living on stolen land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's all legitimate as well.</v>

2812
01:57:19.050 --> 01:57:22.920
<v Speaker 2>So there's legitimate arguments in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like how the land was procured in the</v>

2813
01:57:22.921 --> 01:57:25.110
<v Speaker 2>first place and how the person who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>owning it today,</v>

2814
01:57:25.290 --> 01:57:26.430
<v Speaker 2>how they came to own it.</v>

2815
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:27.970
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2816
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:30.180
<v Speaker 2>it's complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very complex,</v>

2817
01:57:30.181 --> 01:57:34.470
<v Speaker 2>but it also has to do with this culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>of violence in Africa in general,</v>

2818
01:57:34.710 --> 01:57:39.710
<v Speaker 2>especially particularly in South Africa </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's a lot of poverty and you </v>

2819
01:57:39.710 --> 01:57:43.341
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people who are out in these farms </v>

2820
01:57:43.341 --> 01:57:46.491
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of their targets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't what politics from both </v>

2821
01:57:46.741 --> 01:57:50.700
<v Speaker 2>sides who wants to teach us is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy things that never complex,</v>

2822
01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:55.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have your little package and </v>

2823
01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:56.190
<v Speaker 2>some things doesn't fit in that package,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what to make of it.</v>

2824
01:57:56.191 --> 01:58:01.191
<v Speaker 2>So you want to dismiss it because then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to do the work of </v>

2825
01:58:01.191 --> 01:58:01.191
<v Speaker 2>reconsidering your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2826
01:58:01.191 --> 01:58:05.540
<v Speaker 2>assumptions and certainly don't discuss </v>
<v Speaker 2>it publicly where you could be </v>

2827
01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:08.991
<v Speaker 2>misconstrued or labeled as a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was looking at all these people </v>

2828
01:58:08.991 --> 01:58:09.480
<v Speaker 2>labeling me as a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2829
01:58:09.481 --> 01:58:10.650
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're doing,</v>

2830
01:58:10.651 --> 01:58:15.651
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just going to keep posting these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things because this is all what I'm </v>

2831
01:58:15.651 --> 01:58:19.641
<v Speaker 2>saying is all being substantiated by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different people were also </v>

2832
01:58:19.641 --> 01:58:23.691
<v Speaker 2>black in South Africa like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a lot of what this discussion </v>

2833
01:58:23.691 --> 01:58:28.370
<v Speaker 2>revolves around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What trump's done is had had that word </v>

2834
01:58:28.370 --> 01:58:30.420
<v Speaker 2>lose a lot of its meaning because like </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just throw that term around Willy</v>

2835
01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Nilly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then a certain point it's like,</v>

2836
01:58:31.381 --> 01:58:34.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the boy who cried wolf and the term</v>

2837
01:58:34.051 --> 01:58:39.051
<v Speaker 2>is a very broad term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It someone's grandma's prejudice and </v>

2838
01:58:39.051 --> 01:58:39.051
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want my grandkids,</v>

2839
01:58:39.051 --> 01:58:43.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dating a black person that's not the </v>

2840
01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:43.220
<v Speaker 2>same as advocating genocide</v>

2841
01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:47.010
<v Speaker 4>and they're both racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't regard them as synonymous </v>

2842
01:58:47.010 --> 01:58:47.010
<v Speaker 4>at one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't necessarily lead to the other.</v>

2843
01:58:47.710 --> 01:58:48.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2844
01:58:48.971 --> 01:58:53.971
<v Speaker 4>It's the fact that racism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think that racism has probably </v>

2845
01:58:54.521 --> 01:58:59.521
<v Speaker 4>diminished somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you agree with that in terms of </v>

2846
01:58:59.521 --> 01:59:00.240
<v Speaker 4>like between now and say like when we </v>
<v Speaker 4>were.</v>

2847
01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:01.290
<v Speaker 4>What year were you born?</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]?</v>

2848
01:59:01.291 --> 01:59:04.480
<v Speaker 4>Seventy six.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think from 1976 to 2018?</v>

2849
01:59:04.530 --> 01:59:07.240
<v Speaker 4>Racism in this country is diminished or </v>
<v Speaker 4>enormously?</v>

2850
01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:08.500
<v Speaker 4>Enormously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2851
01:59:08.501 --> 01:59:10.290
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's.</v>

2852
01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:11.770
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm from Brooklyn,</v>

2853
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:16.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't really have friends who are </v>

2854
01:59:16.830 --> 01:59:17.110
<v Speaker 4>like waspy white people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine a situation where people</v>

2855
01:59:17.111 --> 01:59:19.990
<v Speaker 4>are hanging out and saying racist </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2856
01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:22.110
<v Speaker 4>Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2857
01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:23.920
<v Speaker 4>but I mean I can't imagine them sitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>race thing.</v>

2858
01:59:23.930 --> 01:59:25.540
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's looking at them like they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not crazy.</v>

2859
01:59:25.810 --> 01:59:30.280
<v Speaker 4>Like it would just be so shocking and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think 40 years ago that wouldn't be that</v>

2860
01:59:30.281 --> 01:59:30.760
<v Speaker 4>uncommon.</v>

2861
01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:35.880
<v Speaker 4>It would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's also the reality of </v>

2862
01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:39.661
<v Speaker 4>social media is that there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely real repercussions for any </v>

2863
01:59:40.511 --> 01:59:43.000
<v Speaker 4>sort of racist out al.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2864
01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:46.870
<v Speaker 4>AnYthing you say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything that's any,</v>

2865
01:59:46.890 --> 01:59:51.890
<v Speaker 4>any outburst,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that you say that in terms of </v>

2866
01:59:51.890 --> 01:59:56.761
<v Speaker 4>like dis you could if you're somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you say something publicly that's </v>

2867
01:59:56.891 --> 02:00:01.891
<v Speaker 4>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone could tweet that and it will </v>

2868
02:00:01.891 --> 02:00:03.040
<v Speaker 4>ruin your life so we could post that on </v>
<v Speaker 4>facebook and it would ruin your life and</v>

2869
02:00:03.041 --> 02:00:08.041
<v Speaker 4>I think that keeps legitimate racists </v>
<v Speaker 4>from being as out with it,</v>

2870
02:00:08.410 --> 02:00:12.910
<v Speaker 4>which reduces racism overall because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think when less people are doing it,</v>

2871
02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:18.240
<v Speaker 4>it seems less culturally acceptable and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then people change the way they think,</v>

2872
02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:23.820
<v Speaker 4>but it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's eAsier to be racist when you're </v>

2873
02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:26.041
<v Speaker 4>only talking to people who are like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're interacting with people </v>

2874
02:00:26.041 --> 02:00:26.041
<v Speaker 4>from all over the world and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2875
02:00:26.041 --> 02:00:28.060
<v Speaker 4>this guy's a putz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's also like the people I know.</v>

2876
02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:33.060
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard to maintain that </v>
<v Speaker 4>prejudice when you're seeing people who </v>

2877
02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:36.691
<v Speaker 4>are acting similar to you because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>anonymous behind the screen and if they </v>

2878
02:00:36.691 --> 02:00:36.691
<v Speaker 4>turn out to be black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2879
02:00:36.691 --> 02:00:37.060
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy's not different for me.</v>

2880
02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:42.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the interesting difference </v>

2881
02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:43.981
<v Speaker 4>between New York and los angeles is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that in New York everybody </v>

2882
02:00:43.981 --> 02:00:46.690
<v Speaker 4>integrates with everybody on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all walking together,</v>

2883
02:00:46.691 --> 02:00:49.780
<v Speaker 4>they're all getting on subways together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're in buildings together.</v>

2884
02:00:49.781 --> 02:00:54.781
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's walking around together like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all black and white and brown and </v>

2885
02:00:54.781 --> 02:00:56.260
<v Speaker 4>yellow and everybody's together and la </v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2886
02:00:56.261 --> 02:00:59.650
<v Speaker 4>everyone is in their cars and they'd go </v>
<v Speaker 4>from cars to their houses.</v>

2887
02:00:59.651 --> 02:01:03.700
<v Speaker 4>They go for their houses to their work </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a lot of segregation just in</v>

2888
02:01:03.701 --> 02:01:08.701
<v Speaker 4>terms of people just not interacting </v>
<v Speaker 4>with other people in a normal day to day</v>

2889
02:01:08.951 --> 02:01:12.050
<v Speaker 4>commuter type situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That my second favorite city,</v>

2890
02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:17.100
<v Speaker 4>even better than New York about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is toronto because everyone's </v>

2891
02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:17.470
<v Speaker 4>walking on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looks like the un,</v>

2892
02:01:17.490 --> 02:01:18.080
<v Speaker 4>so it's.</v>

2893
02:01:18.190 --> 02:01:20.560
<v Speaker 4>And they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very integrated and very cool.</v>

2894
02:01:20.561 --> 02:01:22.390
<v Speaker 4>I love that city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a great city.</v>

2895
02:01:22.410 --> 02:01:24.820

<v Speaker 4>it's too fucking cold.</v>

2896
02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:27.430
<v Speaker 4>I've never been there in the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I've been there in the winter.</v>

2897
02:01:27.930 --> 02:01:29.480
<v Speaker 4>Is that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's rough.</v>

<v Speaker 4>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this place is amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>pot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a legit melting pot.</v>

2925
02:02:23.441 --> 02:02:26.570
<v Speaker 4>And it's really funny for me as a troll </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're all passive aggressive.</v>

2926
02:02:26.571 --> 02:02:31.571
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can poke their buttons and get </v>

2927
02:02:31.571 --> 02:02:31.571
<v Speaker 4>them to lose their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2928
02:02:31.571 --> 02:02:31.571
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to do,</v>

2929
02:02:31.571 --> 02:02:32.750
<v Speaker 4>but when you get the canadians freaking </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

2930
02:02:32.751 --> 02:02:34.940
<v Speaker 4>it's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're one of the rare,</v>

2931
02:02:35.090 --> 02:02:36.890
<v Speaker 4>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent,</v>

2932
02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:41.920
<v Speaker 4>well educated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>successful people who also considers </v>

2933
02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:42.530
<v Speaker 4>themselves a troll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2934
02:02:42.620 --> 02:02:44.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess that's pretty rare.</v>

2935
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:49.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you do it with a smile on your </v>

2936
02:02:49.330 --> 02:02:50.000
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in my heart is a genuine playfulness</v>

2937
02:02:50.001 --> 02:02:50.780
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2938
02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:51.490
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

2939
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:54.740
<v Speaker 4>whereas a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's a bitterness and resentment,</v>

2940
02:02:55.250 --> 02:02:58.940
<v Speaker 4>if someone doesn't agree with me or I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't agree with them or if I don't like</v>

2941
02:02:59.610 --> 02:03:02.270
<v Speaker 4>their music or their tv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish them well.</v>

2942
02:03:02.330 --> 02:03:07.330
<v Speaker 4>I wish their family will just because we</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't be friends as it means something </v>

2943
02:03:07.330 --> 02:03:10.061
<v Speaker 4>bad should happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And most people can wrap their heads </v>

2944
02:03:10.061 --> 02:03:12.461
<v Speaker 4>around that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if they think you're a different </v>

2945
02:03:12.461 --> 02:03:12.461
<v Speaker 4>political person for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you to die.</v>

2946
02:03:12.461 --> 02:03:12.461
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2947
02:03:12.461 --> 02:03:17.080
<v Speaker 4>I want you to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well just we don't have to be friends </v>

2948
02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:17.080
<v Speaker 4>and that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's fun fucking with people.</v>

2949
02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:21.010
<v Speaker 4>Well my favorite one was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>how trump wants to build a wall in the </v>

2950
02:03:21.010 --> 02:03:22.820
<v Speaker 4>south.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hitler built the berlin wall,</v>

2951
02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:25.410
<v Speaker 4>wake up people and don't like hitler did</v>
<v Speaker 4>and while I'm like,</v>

2952
02:03:25.610 --> 02:03:27.200
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wrote about it in my comp.</v>

2953
02:03:27.210 --> 02:03:29.420
<v Speaker 4>They had the blueprints in it and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>start arguing for days.</v>

2954
02:03:29.421 --> 02:03:30.860
<v Speaker 4>They'll argue with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

2955
02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:36.100
<v Speaker 4>We'll some arguments do go on for days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I follow a few arguments that I'm not </v>

2956
02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:38.480
<v Speaker 4>involved in and I'll just go and dip my </v>
<v Speaker 4>toe and I'm like,</v>

2957
02:03:38.710 --> 02:03:41.750
<v Speaker 4>you guys are still going to add like </v>
<v Speaker 4>christ,</v>

2958
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:43.360
<v Speaker 4>don't you have shit to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2959
02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:48.400
<v Speaker 4>it's fun trolling people until we also </v>
<v Speaker 4>take into account the sheer amount of </v>

2960
02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:51.180
<v Speaker 4>time and constructing these zingers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

2961
02:03:51.181 --> 02:03:56.181
<v Speaker 4>these paragraphs and then then googling </v>
<v Speaker 4>the facts and then posting relevant </v>

2962
02:03:56.181 --> 02:03:58.850
<v Speaker 4>studies and the fact that people just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>

2963
02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:00.350
<v Speaker 4>they'll obsess on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2964
02:04:00.351 --> 02:04:05.351
<v Speaker 4>they're not just obsessing about it when</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're sitting right there probably at </v>

2965
02:04:05.351 --> 02:04:08.891
<v Speaker 4>restaurants talking to their spouse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just twisting it up in their head and </v>

2966
02:04:08.891 --> 02:04:10.700
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out a way to win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't argue with people really.</v>

2967
02:04:10.700 --> 02:04:12.260
<v Speaker 4>so if they come at me and they asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2968
02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:13.480
<v Speaker 4>how about when you think about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just go,</v>

2969
02:04:13.481 --> 02:04:15.500
<v Speaker 4>am I being detained?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's all I say,</v>

2970
02:04:15.501 --> 02:04:17.280
<v Speaker 4>and then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just say nah.</v>

2971
02:04:17.590 --> 02:04:18.980
<v Speaker 4>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2972
02:04:20.050 --> 02:04:21.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you like to fuck with them?</v>

2973
02:04:21.261 --> 02:04:23.330
<v Speaker 4>I do like to fuck with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you like to fuck with them?</v>

2974
02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:28.760
<v Speaker 4>Is it because they're non player </v>
<v Speaker 4>characters and you want to wind them up </v>

2975
02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:31.241
<v Speaker 4>and have bouncing off the walls in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>liquor store that you don't have to </v>

2976
02:04:31.241 --> 02:04:31.241
<v Speaker 4>visit it anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That that's part of it.</v>

2977
02:04:31.241 --> 02:04:32.780
<v Speaker 4>That could be part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just,</v>

2978
02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:34.370
<v Speaker 4>it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes me.</v>

2979
02:04:34.371 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 4>It's funny to me how life is a great fun</v>

2980
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:40.650
<v Speaker 1>adventure or you've worn many hats in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

2981
02:04:40.651 --> 02:04:41.460
<v Speaker 1>so vi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2982
02:04:41.490 --> 02:04:46.490
<v Speaker 1>And you never know what's gonna happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>next and if you have the sense of </v>

2983
02:04:46.490 --> 02:04:49.491
<v Speaker 1>appreciation and joy for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the best and right </v>

2984
02:04:49.491 --> 02:04:49.491
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take everything.</v>

2985
02:04:49.491 --> 02:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>So some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2986
02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:53.580
<v Speaker 1>some blue checked asshole speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself on twitter is wrong.</v>

2987
02:04:53.850 --> 02:04:55.440
<v Speaker 1>how does that affect you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine,</v>

2988
02:04:55.441 --> 02:04:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you care?</v>

2989
02:04:57.210 --> 02:05:00.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's very funny to me how easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>people flip their shit.</v>

2990
02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:05.900
<v Speaker 1>And this is the one how people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>marginally intelligent think they're </v>

2991
02:05:05.900 --> 02:05:08.370
<v Speaker 1>brilliant and how quick they are to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume everyone around them is a moron.</v>

2992
02:05:09.090 --> 02:05:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is ignorant of 99 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human knowledge.</v>

2993
02:05:12.330 --> 02:05:17.330
<v Speaker 1>And just because someone smarter than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you doesn't mean they're going to be </v>

2994
02:05:17.330 --> 02:05:19.461
<v Speaker 1>writing an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might not have access to data you </v>

2995
02:05:19.461 --> 02:05:19.461
<v Speaker 1>have or they might not just not see </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2996
02:05:19.461 --> 02:05:21.930
<v Speaker 1>but people who are marginally </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent think they know it all.</v>

2997
02:05:21.930 --> 02:05:22.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2998
02:05:22.261 --> 02:05:22.980
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2999
02:05:23.100 --> 02:05:24.000
<v Speaker 1>almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as,</v>

3000
02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>as do all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3001
02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:30.740
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people know almost nothing about </v>

3002
02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:30.740
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

3003
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:35.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't make them bad people if you </v>

3004
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.870
<v Speaker 1>don't know how to spell that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3005
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:39.890
<v Speaker 1>That's such a great point because lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>of information does not mean lack of </v>

3006
02:05:39.890 --> 02:05:40.140
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3007
02:05:40.141 --> 02:05:40.740
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3008
02:05:40.770 --> 02:05:44.100
<v Speaker 1>but also presence of intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean presence of information.</v>

3009
02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or presence of information doesn't mean </v>

3010
02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:49.560
<v Speaker 1>the presence of intel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

3011
02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3012
02:05:49.560 --> 02:05:51.780
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why my show is misspelled.</v>

3013
02:05:51.781 --> 02:05:55.050
<v Speaker 1>It's called your welcome while you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people correct me,</v>

3014
02:05:55.230 --> 02:06:00.230
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually wrong because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing I say is I'm michael malice </v>

3015
02:06:00.230 --> 02:06:01.830
<v Speaker 1>and let this be your welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're wrong on every level,</v>

3016
02:06:01.831 --> 02:06:04.470
<v Speaker 1>but they still got to jump in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy just re tweeted it out.</v>

3017
02:06:04.471 --> 02:06:05.220
<v Speaker 1>You're welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3018
02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:06.750
<v Speaker 1>And then if people are correcting her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3019
02:06:06.930 --> 02:06:09.870
<v Speaker 1>don't you think maybe an author and </v>
<v Speaker 1>brooklyn spelling bee champion.</v>

<v Speaker 1>A nine.</v>

3026
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:26.550
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jacket still fits.</v>

3027
02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:27.930
<v Speaker 1>It fits now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't fit then.</v>

3028
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was too big.</v>

3029
02:06:29.700 --> 02:06:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3030
02:06:30.421 --> 02:06:31.120
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

3031
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I grew a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they gave you a jacket.</v>

3032
02:06:33.711 --> 02:06:37.230
<v Speaker 1>They get a jacket and athletic stating </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would fit into it eventually?</v>

3033
02:06:37.231 --> 02:06:42.231
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone gets the same size jacket </v>

3034
02:06:42.231 --> 02:06:42.231
<v Speaker 1>because it's from like age or maybe it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was 10.</v>

3035
02:06:42.231 --> 02:06:42.630
<v Speaker 1>It was fifth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like 10 to 14.</v>

3036
02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:44.460
<v Speaker 1>One size fits all the daily news.</v>

3037
02:06:44.490 --> 02:06:46.710
<v Speaker 1>So if you were a football player or if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a nerd,</v>

3038
02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:48.450
<v Speaker 1>there's no skillful players in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spelling bee.</v>

02:06:48.451 --> 02:06:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I should not one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not one.</v>

3040
02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:53.550
<v Speaker 1>So that approaches on your part against </v>
<v Speaker 1>football?</v>

3041

<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3042
02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I was there and none of them were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there were no shoulders to be </v>

3043
02:06:59.220 --> 02:06:59.430
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:03.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no brush shoulders at the madison square</v>

3045
02:07:03.061 --> 02:07:05.460
<v Speaker 1>garden in 1986 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3046
02:07:05.490 --> 02:07:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were in madison square garden?</v>

3047
02:07:07.231 --> 02:07:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

3048
02:07:07.641 --> 02:07:09.300
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3049
02:07:09.690 --> 02:07:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like a small part I guess.</v>

3050
02:07:13.291 --> 02:07:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3051
02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:19.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like the big part of madison </v>

3052
02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:19.060
<v Speaker 1>square garden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the smallest theater.</v>

3053
02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a smaller one.</v>

3054
02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:22.050
<v Speaker 1>It was more than one theater in madison </v>
<v Speaker 1>square garden.</v>

3055
02:07:22.150 --> 02:07:27.150
<v Speaker 1>It was a tiny one because we did our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did a theater really small recently </v>

3056
02:07:27.211 --> 02:07:32.211
<v Speaker 1>where there was a ufc press conference </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a way in and that was not that </v>

3057
02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:32.211
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was with that.</v>

3058
02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that with matt hughes?</v>

3059
02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:34.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3060
02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:35.800
<v Speaker 1>That was a different one.</v>

3061
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:40.450
<v Speaker 3>That was just last weekend and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>a tiny one.</v>

3062
02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:46.080
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it looked like it was no </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than maybe a thousand,</v>

3063
02:07:46.450 --> 02:07:48.400
<v Speaker 3>1500 people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems small,</v>

3064
02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:50.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like a small little.</v>

3065
02:07:50.770 --> 02:07:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's called the hulu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3066
02:07:52.930 --> 02:07:55.890
<v Speaker 3>How many seats does that bad boy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say 2000.</v>

3067
02:07:56.730 --> 02:08:01.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go with 2000 because I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>done the other one which is 6,000</v>

3068
02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:04.300
<v Speaker 3>5,500.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it really?</v>

3069
02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:06.040
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a joke.</v>

3070
02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:08.740
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's more than one theater though,</v>

3071
02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:14.580
<v Speaker 3>but there's the big theater and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more than one little theater or </v>

3072
02:08:14.580 --> 02:08:15.730
<v Speaker 3>am I wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think so,</v>

3073
02:08:15.731 --> 02:08:20.731
<v Speaker 3>but the little one that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about doesn't really come up because </v>

3074
02:08:20.731 --> 02:08:22.060
<v Speaker 3>there's not tons of events at it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like write tickets all the time.</v>

3075
02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It dIdn't look like 5,500</v>

3076
02:08:23.771 --> 02:08:25.420
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looked way smaller than that.</v>

3077
02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:26.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could be wrong,</v>

3078
02:08:28.210 --> 02:08:29.740
<v Speaker 3>but still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty dope.</v>

3079
02:08:30.010 --> 02:08:34.750
<v Speaker 3>When fucking spelling bee champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you stick it in everybody's face for</v>

3080
02:08:34.770 --> 02:08:38.740
<v Speaker 3>a couple of weeks afterwards?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might have had a day in my honor at</v>

3081
02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:40.110
<v Speaker 3>my elementary school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3082
02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Because that was the first one to ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that day in your honor.</v>

3083
02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:45.910
<v Speaker 3>The chicks look at you differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember this?</v>

3084
02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3085
02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:49.090
<v Speaker 3>What's your recollection have any effect</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all?</v>

3086
02:08:49.091 --> 02:08:50.770
<v Speaker 3>It was still tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Total disdain?</v>

3087
02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it help being on fox news?</v>

3088
02:08:56.980 --> 02:08:58.630
<v Speaker 3>The chicks look at you differently </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that.</v>

3089
02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Not in a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the,</v>

3090
02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:06.180
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're on tv and doing panels and </v>

3091
02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:09.340
<v Speaker 3>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking to women who are not only</v>

3092
02:09:09.370 --> 02:09:14.370
<v Speaker 3>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're also extremely well spoken and </v>

3093
02:09:14.370 --> 02:09:16.570
<v Speaker 3>great conversationalists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The percent of human beings who are good</v>

3094
02:09:16.571 --> 02:09:21.571
<v Speaker 3>conversationalist is like one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's very hard to date because it's </v>

3095
02:09:22.481 --> 02:09:24.580

<v Speaker 3>fucks you up.</v>

3097
02:09:27.670 --> 02:09:30.310
<v Speaker 3>And it's also hard to meet people </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

3098
02:09:30.850 --> 02:09:35.850
<v Speaker 3>you meet people in green rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard for me to meet people day </v>

<v Speaker 3>to day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

02:09:40.570 --> 02:09:45.570
<v Speaker 3>let 10 had strong joe.</v>

<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

02:09:46.661 --> 02:09:47.920
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>career of her own and then you've got to</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3110
02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:04.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm impressed with so many of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

3111
02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:09.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean because they got to look amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're also funny and quick on </v>

<v Speaker 3>have to ignore that breeze going in </v>
<v Speaker 3>between their legs because he's not </v>

3114
02:10:15.901 --> 02:10:15.990
<v Speaker 3>wearing any pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

3115
02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:21.080
<v Speaker 3>I've got to sit in a lecture once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one of the great bucket list </v>

3116
02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:21.080
<v Speaker 3>moments of my life.</v>

3122
02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:34.460

<v Speaker 1>like bubble heads.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then to be around them like you feel</v>

<v Speaker 2>it was going on,</v>

3173
02:12:37.511 --> 02:12:40.690
<v Speaker 2>so they were all milling out into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hallways and we were walking through and</v>

3174
02:12:40.691 --> 02:12:44.140
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking strange.</v>

3175
02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:49.320
<v Speaker 2>There was so many of them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like these fat mom's that look </v>

3176
02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:53.200
<v Speaker 2>like a mama june.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they look like.</v>

3177
02:12:53.230 --> 02:12:58.230
<v Speaker 2>They all look like that and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>look strange and they have too much </v>

3178
02:12:58.230 --> 02:13:01.771
<v Speaker 2>lipstick on and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're wearing weird clothes </v>

3179
02:13:01.771 --> 02:13:03.220
<v Speaker 2>themselves and they got their little </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids dressed up like grown women.</v>

3180
02:13:03.221 --> 02:13:04.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

3181
02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:04.820

<v Speaker 1>it's upsetting.</v>

3183
02:13:05.850 --> 02:13:10.850
<v Speaker 1>And they're also the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is even if they're not </v>

3184
02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:13.011
<v Speaker 1>wearing the makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still extremely competitive and </v>

3185
02:13:13.011 --> 02:13:13.011
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking with the kids' emotions.</v>

3186
02:13:13.011 --> 02:13:13.011
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3187
02:13:13.011 --> 02:13:17.770
<v Speaker 2>And it's competitive in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're basically just judging them on </v>

3188
02:13:17.770 --> 02:13:21.050
<v Speaker 2>their physical presence and maybe some </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking shitty singing they're doing.</v>

3189
02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

3191
02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:23.630
<v Speaker 1>And for what,</v>

3192
02:13:25.020 --> 02:13:27.030
<v Speaker 2>what did the tap dance or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they do?</v>

3193
02:13:27.490 --> 02:13:30.270
<v Speaker 2>Tend to do things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this kind of stuff,</v>

3194
02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 2>but that's even more a tween I think</v>

3195
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:33.810
<v Speaker 3>at that bad grandpa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this is real bad grandpa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3197
02:13:35.161 --> 02:13:38.160
<v Speaker 3>that was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this.</v>

3198
02:13:38.161 --> 02:13:42.550
<v Speaker 3>But these are real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A real content is a real contest there.</v>

3199
02:13:42.570 --> 02:13:47.570
<v Speaker 3>Bud out and turn this off and at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>frosted hair.</v>

<v Speaker 3>good lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's best highlights from mom.</v>

3201
02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:55.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of those weird traditions </v>

3202
02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:55.760
<v Speaker 3>where people are going to look back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the future and they'll go,</v>

3203
02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:56.730
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck were people thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>

3204
02:13:56.910 --> 02:13:58.470
<v Speaker 3>When I had her on my show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>miss America,</v>

3205
02:13:58.471 --> 02:14:00.390
<v Speaker 3>I asked her a quiz that miss America </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

3206
02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:05.420
<v Speaker 3>There used to be a rule that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>rule like 14 or before miss America had </v>

3207
02:14:05.420 --> 02:14:08.110
<v Speaker 3>to be of the white race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

3208
02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:10.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Until not that long ago.</v>

3209
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:13.140
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have to approve it.</v>

3210

3211
02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:17.190
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like the twenties.</v>

<v Speaker 3>thirties.</v>

3225
02:14:53.221 --> 02:14:56.310
<v Speaker 3>That contestants must be of good health </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the lack of white race.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it gets better and better everyday.</v>

3238
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I wake up and I feel like I'm in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>smurf village or something.</v>

3239
02:15:30.421 --> 02:15:35.421
<v Speaker 3>I'm so happy all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But do you have any concerns that this </v>

3240
02:15:35.421 --> 02:15:39.081
<v Speaker 3>is going to go horribly wrong and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to wind up in a nuclear war with </v>

3241
02:15:39.081 --> 02:15:39.180
<v Speaker 3>Russia or nothing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3242
02:15:39.181 --> 02:15:39.470
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3243
02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:39.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were,</v>

3244
02:15:40.010 --> 02:15:45.010
<v Speaker 3>there are many times when we could have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been a nuclear war with Russia during </v>

3245
02:15:45.010 --> 02:15:47.481
<v Speaker 3>the cold war and they were actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped there at these great stories </v>

3246
02:15:47.481 --> 02:15:47.481
<v Speaker 3>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the submarine and the,</v>

3247
02:15:47.481 --> 02:15:48.900
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cuban missile crisis.</v>

3248
02:15:49.130 --> 02:15:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no concern actually both reagan </v>

3249
02:15:54.130 --> 02:15:56.511
<v Speaker 3>and gorbachev,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a great story of history </v>

3250
02:15:56.511 --> 02:15:57.850
<v Speaker 3>independently were taken to the bunker </v>
<v Speaker 3>and walk through and both of them refuse</v>

3251
02:15:57.851 --> 02:15:58.590
<v Speaker 3>to press the button.</v>

3252
02:15:58.620 --> 02:16:00.570
<v Speaker 3>Even as simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They both said,</v>

3253
02:16:00.690 --> 02:16:01.940
<v Speaker 3>if we get nuked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get nuked.</v>

3254
02:16:01.941 --> 02:16:03.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm not fucking retaliating killing </v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of people.</v>

3255
02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:06.550
<v Speaker 3>So I think this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember the,</v>

3256
02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:08.940
<v Speaker 3>the idea that trump has his finger on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the nuclear button,</v>

3257
02:16:09.150 --> 02:16:10.590
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be nuking people all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

3258
02:16:10.591 --> 02:16:14.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like he's never gotten a fistfight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's going to be,</v>

3259
02:16:14.150 --> 02:16:15.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes a lot to nukes,</v>

3260
02:16:15.530 --> 02:16:20.530
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only countries ever knew anyone was </v>

3261
02:16:20.530 --> 02:16:20.530
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's remember that.</v>

3262
02:16:20.530 --> 02:16:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember him threatening joe </v>
<v Speaker 3>barden sort of job on him?</v>

3263
02:16:22.381 --> 02:16:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he said,</v>

3264
02:16:23.370 --> 02:16:24.810
<v Speaker 3>I would knock you out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe biden,</v>

3265
02:16:24.811 --> 02:16:28.380
<v Speaker 3>joe biden would go down fast and hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he said,</v>

3266
02:16:29.370 --> 02:16:34.370
<v Speaker 3>I talked about in the beginning of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>netflix specials because it was so </v>

3267
02:16:34.370 --> 02:16:34.370
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3268
02:16:34.370 --> 02:16:35.620
<v Speaker 3>I want to get in his ear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to make this happen.</v>

3269
02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:37.330
<v Speaker 3>like you're great at everything.</v>

3270
02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:39.340
<v Speaker 3>You'd be great at fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3272
02:16:40.130 --> 02:16:42.260

<v Speaker 3>They'll let it talk to you.</v>

3273
02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:46.300
<v Speaker 3>Making fun of your kids to old men like </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump and biden.</v>

3274
02:16:46.301 --> 02:16:50.650
<v Speaker 3>Fight to the death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be amazing.</v>

3275
02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:55.800
<v Speaker 3>It would be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would probably be the biggest paper </v>

3290
02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:27.130

<v Speaker 3>ribs.</v>

3291
02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:28.320
<v Speaker 3>They don't talk about that.</v>

3294
02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:38.080

3299
02:17:46.270 --> 02:17:51.270

<v Speaker 3>The guy with no shoes does grounded </v>

<v Speaker 2>it's very strange what he's been able to</v>

3395
02:21:46.191 --> 02:21:47.300
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3396
02:21:47.390 --> 02:21:52.390

<v Speaker 2>where the guy drove into his car full </v>

3397
02:21:52.390 --> 02:21:56.471
<v Speaker 2>clip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed lanes on the highway and went </v>

3398
02:21:56.471 --> 02:21:57.260
<v Speaker 2>into the oncoming lane into the fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>lane on the other side.</v>

3399
02:21:57.620 --> 02:22:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Full clips slammed into his car and </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed his driver.</v>

3400
02:22:00.381 --> 02:22:02.120
<v Speaker 2>But he wasn't in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

3403
02:22:08.121 --> 02:22:09.560
<v Speaker 2>just didn't know that he wasn't in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

3404
02:22:09.561 --> 02:22:11.720
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that they were able to cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the lanes.</v>

3405
02:22:11.721 --> 02:22:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>

3407
02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:20.680
<v Speaker 2>they have access to the oncoming lanes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pick his car right out of all the </v>

3408
02:22:21.171 --> 02:22:26.171
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning it had to be coordinated with </v>

3409
02:22:26.171 --> 02:22:26.171
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3410
02:22:26.171 --> 02:22:26.171
<v Speaker 2>Because there's got to be a motorcade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3411
02:22:26.171 --> 02:22:26.171
<v Speaker 2>Because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3415
02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:31.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just do it from the beginning.</v>

3416
02:22:32.190 --> 02:22:34.290
<v Speaker 3>The beginning wasn't gold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a better version of it.</v>

3417
02:22:34.291 --> 02:22:37.320
<v Speaker 3>Then there's a better version of it out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and the better version of it.</v>

3418
02:22:37.321 --> 02:22:39.960
<v Speaker 3>You see the guy changed lanes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Foam.</v>

3419
02:22:39.990 --> 02:22:44.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And slam in and had to know that that's </v>

02:22:45.151 --> 02:22:46.710
<v Speaker 3>Him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Killed the driver,</v>

3422
02:22:46.711 --> 02:22:49.280
<v Speaker 3>but putin was not in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was putin's car.</v>

3423
02:22:49.330 --> 02:22:50.910
<v Speaker 3>He's magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3424
02:22:50.911 --> 02:22:55.911
<v Speaker 3>he just knew something was up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he must have a bunch of people </v>

3425
02:22:55.911 --> 02:22:58.950
<v Speaker 3>feeding them information all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how many assassination attempts have</v>

3426
02:22:58.951 --> 02:23:00.060
<v Speaker 3>there been on that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3427
02:23:00.061 --> 02:23:05.061
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about the assassination of sun on </v>

3428
02:23:05.061 --> 02:23:05.061
<v Speaker 3>the presidents that we don't hear about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both obama and trump.</v>

3429
02:23:05.061 --> 02:23:06.300
<v Speaker 3>There have been plenty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3430
02:23:06.330 --> 02:23:08.690
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what ones do you look at?</v>

3431
02:23:08.710 --> 02:23:10.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean they just trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3432
02:23:10.850 --> 02:23:11.820
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A red horse.</v>

3433
02:23:11.821 --> 02:23:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't heard anything of course,</v>

3434
02:23:14.281 --> 02:23:16.670
<v Speaker 3>because they don't want to talk about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] then he hit the victim and.</v>

3435
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:18.750
<v Speaker 3>And also you don't want to get these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's attention.</v>

3436
02:23:18.900 --> 02:23:21.150
<v Speaker 3>In all fairness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a good move to be like,</v>

3437
02:23:21.151 --> 02:23:22.350
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's not talk about this.</v>

3438
02:23:22.910 --> 02:23:27.910
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't want to talk about when </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorist attacks were foiled because </v>

3439
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:27.910
<v Speaker 3>then they'll know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3440
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:28.050
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to try it a different way.</v>

3441
02:23:28.051 --> 02:23:29.610
<v Speaker 3>So that's smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The press I think,</v>

3442
02:23:30.810 --> 02:23:32.500
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but</v>

3443
02:23:33.120 --> 02:23:35.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's been able to run Russia for </v>
<v Speaker 3>a long time.</v>

3444
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he had his number.</v>

3445
02:23:37.470 --> 02:23:40.040
<v Speaker 3>It was like teddy roosevelt and taft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had his number two there was terminal</v>

3446
02:23:40.041 --> 02:23:41.190
<v Speaker 3>and mitzi goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna be president.</v>

3447
02:23:41.191 --> 02:23:41.670
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3448
02:23:41.671 --> 02:23:43.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm done now I'm going to be back in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy's like,</v>

3449
02:23:43.141 --> 02:23:44.340
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here you go mr putin.</v>

3450
02:23:44.410 --> 02:23:46.650
<v Speaker 3>But that's what's crazy is he got back </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and everybody's like,</v>

3451
02:23:46.651 --> 02:23:48.040
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his approval rating.</v>

3452
02:23:48.041 --> 02:23:50.170
<v Speaker 3>so like 70 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something crazy there.</v>

3453
02:23:50.200 --> 02:23:55.200
<v Speaker 3>Some huge number of the russians love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they love him or do they say they </v>

3454
02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:55.260
<v Speaker 3>love them because they're scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3455
02:23:56.010 --> 02:24:01.010
<v Speaker 3>russians love aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We love someone who is nasty and an </v>

3456
02:24:01.860 --> 02:24:06.860
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is the assassination attempt on </v>

3457
02:24:06.860 --> 02:24:06.860
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bigger news.</v>

3458
02:24:06.860 --> 02:24:10.790
<v Speaker 3>What was the assassination attempt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A 20 year old man in vegas pulled a gun </v>

3459
02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:14.601
<v Speaker 3>from a las vegas polIce officer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to do a rally guy.</v>

3460
02:24:15.710 --> 02:24:16.860
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't tase me,</v>

3461
02:24:16.861 --> 02:24:18.150
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>End of his life.</v>

3462
02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:19.640
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3463
02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:23.520
<v Speaker 3>that's come on at 20 years old probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3464
02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:28.640
<v Speaker 3>from britain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you need overstayed his visa or </v>

3465
02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:29.950
<v Speaker 3>something like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy man</v>

3466
02:24:31.850 --> 02:24:36.850
<v Speaker 3>wasn't he trumped just giving a talk and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a was trump and there was a </v>

3467
02:24:36.850 --> 02:24:36.850
<v Speaker 3>boom and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you missed.</v>

3468
02:24:37.270 --> 02:24:39.150
<v Speaker 3>He allegedly trIed to pull a gun from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the holster.</v>

3469
02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:41.840
<v Speaker 3>The police officer at a trump rally in </v>
<v Speaker 3>las vegas on saturday.</v>

3470
02:24:42.020 --> 02:24:47.020
<v Speaker 3>He was arrested and later secret service</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he had driven to the advent from </v>

3471
02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:50.060
<v Speaker 3>California and had been planning to kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>the candidate for a year.</v>

3472
02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:54.050
<v Speaker 3>So this was before he was president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe it's 2016.</v>

3473
02:24:54.051 --> 02:24:55.070
<v Speaker 3>June.</v>
<v Speaker 3>June.</v>

3474
02:24:55.430 --> 02:24:56.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a few months before the election.</v>

3475
02:24:56.930 --> 02:24:59.810
<v Speaker 3>But this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's been other attempts on him since</v>

3476
02:24:59.811 --> 02:25:00.590
<v Speaker 3>he's the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3477
02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:04.190
<v Speaker 3>Other one says it was an isis attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is from the daily beast.</v>

3478
02:25:04.191 --> 02:25:04.880
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know</v>

3479
02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:06.300
<v Speaker 9>how</v>

3480
02:25:07.950 --> 02:25:09.740
<v Speaker 3>well they're not going to be pro trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if they're saying it,</v>

3481
02:25:09.741 --> 02:25:09.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

3482
02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:13.700
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

3483
02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:17.540
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy that he wanted the job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3484
02:25:17.541 --> 02:25:19.370
<v Speaker 3>it's scary for mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3485
02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:21.940
<v Speaker 3>look at gabby giffords in Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3486
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:24.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in voting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she had this tweet about like,</v>

3487
02:25:24.370 --> 02:25:29.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she went and voted and I couldn't think </v>

3488
02:25:29.370 --> 02:25:29.370
<v Speaker 3>of a better pro voting argument that she</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinda is like,</v>

3489
02:25:29.370 --> 02:25:29.440
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3490
02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:31.490
<v Speaker 3>you don't believe in voting voting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3491
02:25:31.750 --> 02:25:32.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

3492
02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:35.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in voting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

3493
02:25:35.410 --> 02:25:36.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do it.</v>

3494
02:25:36.611 --> 02:25:41.611
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never wrote an article about it for </v>

3495
02:25:41.611 --> 02:25:41.611
<v Speaker 3>the guardian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3496
02:25:41.611 --> 02:25:41.980
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think it's legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>voting democracy.</v>

3497
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:43.600
<v Speaker 3>In what way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>in any way.</v>

3498
02:25:43.630 --> 02:25:48.630
<v Speaker 3>Like the idea that I flick a switch and </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone gets to talk to me for four </v>

3499
02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:48.630
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taught for before years doesn't make any</v>

3500
02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:50.650
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think the alternative should</v>

3501
02:25:50.651 --> 02:25:51.280
<v Speaker 3>be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freedom.</v>

3502
02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:54.070
<v Speaker 3>If I want to someone to speak for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll hire them.</v>

3503
02:25:55.330 --> 02:26:00.330
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that me and my neighbors </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to be locked into some policy </v>

3504
02:26:00.330 --> 02:26:00.850
<v Speaker 3>because we're geographically close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

3505
02:26:00.851 --> 02:26:03.820
<v Speaker 3>His landline technology and a posts cell</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone world.</v>

3506
02:26:05.020 --> 02:26:06.580
<v Speaker 3>So how do you think things should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>run?</v>

3507
02:26:07.210 --> 02:26:12.210
<v Speaker 3>You organize based on how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you want to align with on any given </v>

3508
02:26:12.210 --> 02:26:15.930
<v Speaker 3>a context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm aligned with macy's when it </v>

3509
02:26:15.930 --> 02:26:16.990
<v Speaker 3>comes to my clothes and I'm aligned with</v>
<v Speaker 3>you when it comes to talking.</v>

3510
02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:21.250
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have one guy speak for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you for abortion and for uh,</v>

3511
02:26:21.370 --> 02:26:24.420
<v Speaker 3>the borders and for taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3512
02:26:24.430 --> 02:26:26.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in any of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is very old,</v>

3513
02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:30.010
<v Speaker 3>old model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree that it's a very old model,</v>

3514
02:26:30.011 --> 02:26:32.380
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is we don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>other one.</v>

3515
02:26:32.620 --> 02:26:37.620
<v Speaker 3>Sure we do because one of the other 99 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of our interactions are </v>

3516
02:26:37.620 --> 02:26:41.011
<v Speaker 3>voluntary and you come together with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people as you need to and then you go </v>

3517
02:26:41.011 --> 02:26:41.920
<v Speaker 3>your separate ways and it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very dynamic.</v>

3518
02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:46.920
<v Speaker 3>So this idea that you're stuck with this</v>
<v Speaker 3>person because a lot of people like him </v>

3519
02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:49.120
<v Speaker 3>for four years and they speak for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes no sense to me.</v>

3520
02:26:49.390 --> 02:26:54.390
<v Speaker 3>It does not make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also we feel like we need some </v>

3521
02:26:54.390 --> 02:26:57.211
<v Speaker 3>sort of a representation of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to have some sort of a </v>

3522
02:26:57.211 --> 02:26:57.640
<v Speaker 3>summit with a guy like putin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

3523
02:26:57.700 --> 02:27:00.100
<v Speaker 3>or someone kim jong moon or whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3524
02:27:00.130 --> 02:27:02.530
<v Speaker 3>whoever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone needs to speak for us.</v>

3525
02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:03.340
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3526
02:27:03.341 --> 02:27:05.140
<v Speaker 3>and I mean in the sense that is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction,</v>

3527
02:27:05.170 --> 02:27:10.170
<v Speaker 3>but the point is I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of people in this </v>

3528
02:27:10.170 --> 02:27:10.170
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not a vast.</v>

3529
02:27:10.170 --> 02:27:10.930
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump's not my president.</v>

3530
02:27:10.931 --> 02:27:15.010
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't speak for me and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>right to say that and the idea that just</v>

3531
02:27:15.011 --> 02:27:17.680
<v Speaker 3>because someone wins a contest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therefore he's the boss of me.</v>

3532
02:27:17.710 --> 02:27:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about voting when it </v>

3533
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:22.710
<v Speaker 3>comes to legitimate concerns?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like raising the speed limit,</v>

3534
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:23.800
<v Speaker 3>reducing taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this,</v>

3535
02:27:23.801 --> 02:27:25.510
<v Speaker 3>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fixing roads,</v>

3536
02:27:25.530 --> 02:27:28.840
<v Speaker 3>like certain things that we need to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

3537
02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:31.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do it.</v>

3538
02:27:31.850 --> 02:27:35.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean that makes more sense to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a direct representation,</v>

3539
02:27:35.411 --> 02:27:37.300
<v Speaker 3>but even that shouldn't be up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>majority rule.</v>

3540
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:42.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean people who understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dynamics of speed limits in cars should </v>

3541
02:27:42.750 --> 02:27:43.870
<v Speaker 3>have informed say rather than.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3542
02:27:43.871 --> 02:27:46.660
<v Speaker 3>But then there's influenced by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>insurance companies,</v>

3543
02:27:46.661 --> 02:27:49.710
<v Speaker 3>and this is why low rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why things changed,</v>

3544
02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:52.480
<v Speaker 3>but didn't she got lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But insurance companies are the ones who</v>

3545
02:27:52.481 --> 02:27:55.150
<v Speaker 3>have the campaigns to force people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>vote one way or another.</v>

3546
02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:56.400
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3547
02:27:56.440 --> 02:27:58.960
<v Speaker 3>One side's going to have much more like </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana laws,</v>

3548
02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:04.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these tobacco and alcohol </v>

3549
02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:04.280
<v Speaker 3>companies trying to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana is not legal.</v>

3550
02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:05.090
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these,</v>

3551
02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:07.540
<v Speaker 3>this propaganda you have because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want competitors.</v>

3552
02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Would you rather have people be high </v>
<v Speaker 3>than drunk?</v>

3553
02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:13.330
<v Speaker 3>Like if dad's coming home from work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather he had a joint that,</v>

3554
02:28:13.331 --> 02:28:14.430
<v Speaker 3>a six pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3555
02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:17.170
<v Speaker 3>and yet historically it's just because </v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol has been popular.</v>

3556
02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:19.000
<v Speaker 3>That's what's legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes no sense.</v>

3557
02:28:19.090 --> 02:28:22.310
<v Speaker 3>No drunk driving versus driving stoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3558
02:28:22.311 --> 02:28:24.310
<v Speaker 3>one guy's going to slow the other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3559
02:28:24.670 --> 02:28:29.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one's got probably paranoid to and </v>

3560
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:29.670
<v Speaker 3>checking every mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 3>checking a bag,</v>

3561
02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.990
<v Speaker 3>a cool drive slower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slow down Cuba together,</v>

3562
02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:34.220
<v Speaker 3>writing the lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3563
02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3564
02:28:36.291 --> 02:28:41.291
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that the system that we </v>

3565
02:28:41.291 --> 02:28:43.460
<v Speaker 3>have now is great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to just not participate at all,</v>

3566
02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:46.010
<v Speaker 3>but I do participate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously if I'm a public figure and I'm</v>

3567
02:28:46.011 --> 02:28:48.740
<v Speaker 3>talking is participating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just discourse.</v>

3568
02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:50.960
<v Speaker 3>You have to some extent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3569
02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:56.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't think the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're flicking a switch means you're </v>

3570
02:28:56.380 --> 02:28:56.380
<v Speaker 3>actually making a difference.</v>

3571
02:28:56.380 --> 02:28:58.340
<v Speaker 3>I think her doing something in secret </v>
<v Speaker 3>once every four years.</v>

3572
02:28:58.370 --> 02:29:03.370
<v Speaker 3>You're not actually participating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's something people like to tell </v>

3573
02:29:03.370 --> 02:29:03.560
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like getting a communion wafer.</v>

3574
02:29:04.100 --> 02:29:09.100
<v Speaker 3>do you think that it's archaic also to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have this timeline of four years and </v>

3575
02:29:09.100 --> 02:29:11.150
<v Speaker 3>especially when it comes to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>registering to vote?</v>

3576
02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:13.220
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the most archaic thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>

3577
02:29:13.221 --> 02:29:18.221
<v Speaker 3>that you have to go somewhere to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but meanwhile you have a driver's </v>

3578
02:29:18.221 --> 02:29:19.250
<v Speaker 3>license if you're driving around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a driver's license.</v>

3579
02:29:19.251 --> 02:29:21.320
<v Speaker 3>If you have a driver's license,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should be able to vote.</v>

3580
02:29:21.650 --> 02:29:22.570
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3581
02:29:22.571 --> 02:29:24.600
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a citizen now,</v>

3582
02:29:24.970 --> 02:29:27.290
<v Speaker 3>be a citizen to get it out and if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>a citizen.</v>

3583
02:29:27.291 --> 02:29:28.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And your.</v>

3584
02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:34.150
<v Speaker 3>What do you think about criminals being </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to vote like this one that's a hot </v>

3585
02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:34.150
<v Speaker 3>topic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3586
02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:34.150
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3587
02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:37.700
<v Speaker 3>I think that there should be more like </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've done your time,</v>

3588
02:29:37.701 --> 02:29:39.490
<v Speaker 3>especially if I nonviolent crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3589
02:29:39.730 --> 02:29:44.730
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what I'm really excited about </v>

3590
02:29:44.730 --> 02:29:46.751
<v Speaker 3>what happened in politics this week was </v>
<v Speaker 3>jeff sessions getting fired because he </v>

3591
02:29:47.150 --> 02:29:48.410
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me.</v>

3592
02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:50.210
<v Speaker 3>ThIs is one of the reasons I hate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>press.</v>

3593
02:29:50.510 --> 02:29:52.220
<v Speaker 3>when kim kardashian went to the white </v>
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>

3594
02:29:52.221 --> 02:29:55.010
<v Speaker 3>they all clowned her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kim kardashians saved the lady's life.</v>

3595
02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:57.890
<v Speaker 3>She saved someone's life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So unless you save a life,</v>

3596
02:29:57.891 --> 02:30:02.891
<v Speaker 3>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You went to the white house to talk </v>

3597
02:30:02.891 --> 02:30:05.951
<v Speaker 3>about prison reform and to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are innocent in jail right </v>

3598
02:30:05.951 --> 02:30:10.271
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she brought the case to Donald </v>

3599
02:30:10.271 --> 02:30:10.271
<v Speaker 3>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mandatory minimums.</v>

3600
02:30:10.271 --> 02:30:12.320
<v Speaker 3>And you tell that lady's family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We saw the footage of them crying.</v>

3601
02:30:12.321 --> 02:30:13.610
<v Speaker 3>You tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh ha ha.</v>

3602
02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:15.380
<v Speaker 3>Kim kardashian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kanye west.</v>

3603
02:30:15.381 --> 02:30:18.350
<v Speaker 3>When he went to the white house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he talked prison reform.</v>

3604
02:30:18.351 --> 02:30:19.780
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are not vial,</v>

3605
02:30:19.781 --> 02:30:20.230
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

3606
02:30:20.480 --> 02:30:24.500
<v Speaker 3>The point is it will be the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing for freedom ever if the republican</v>

3607
02:30:24.501 --> 02:30:26.090
<v Speaker 3>party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>traditionally law and order party,</v>

3608
02:30:26.091 --> 02:30:31.091
<v Speaker 3>we're in a position to be more liberal </v>
<v Speaker 3>about prison sentence thing because a </v>

3609
02:30:31.091 --> 02:30:34.421
<v Speaker 3>lot of these people don't need to be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>jail even if they need to be punished </v>

3610
02:30:34.421 --> 02:30:37.110
<v Speaker 3>and when you send someone to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be terrorized and </v>

3611
02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:37.110
<v Speaker 3>raped.</v>

3612
02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:37.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone's dealing weed,</v>

3613
02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:41.441
<v Speaker 3>is that really appropriate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sessions was when the big opponents </v>

3614
02:30:41.441 --> 02:30:41.441
<v Speaker 3>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

3615
02:30:41.441 --> 02:30:43.700
<v Speaker 3>He thinks marijuana and heroin are </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically the same.</v>

3616
02:30:43.701 --> 02:30:48.701
<v Speaker 3>So if he's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a great opportunitY for both </v>

3617
02:30:48.701 --> 02:30:52.121
<v Speaker 3>parties to work together and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people do not need to be in jail </v>

3618
02:30:52.121 --> 02:30:52.121
<v Speaker 3>and it's expensive as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3619
02:30:52.121 --> 02:30:53.750
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn'T agree more.</v>

3620
02:30:53.930 --> 02:30:58.930
<v Speaker 3>he also said something that was one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most ridiculous things I've ever </v>

3621
02:30:58.930 --> 02:30:58.930
<v Speaker 3>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good people don't smoke marijuana.</v>

3622
02:30:58.930 --> 02:31:00.830
<v Speaker 3>that's really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you done a survey?</v>

3623
02:31:00.980 --> 02:31:02.960
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>

3624
02:31:02.980 --> 02:31:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he lives in some 19 fifties norman </v>

3625
02:31:07.980 --> 02:31:07.980
<v Speaker 3>rockwell painting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the,</v>

3626
02:31:07.980 --> 02:31:12.040
<v Speaker 3>in 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are good people who smoke </v>

3627
02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:12.040
<v Speaker 3>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jack kerouac.</v>

3628
02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:12.040
<v Speaker 3>That's a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's what I'm saying,</v>

3629
02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:15.350
<v Speaker 3>it's like he lives in an idealistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>portrayal of life,</v>

3630
02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:20.680
<v Speaker 3>not life itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's such blanket statements which </v>

3631
02:31:20.680 --> 02:31:20.680
<v Speaker 3>are usually a fan of.</v>

3632
02:31:20.680 --> 02:31:21.480
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fuck you.</v>

3633
02:31:21.540 --> 02:31:25.230
<v Speaker 3>But he was an asshole long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that guy has been a piece of shit</v>

3634
02:31:25.231 --> 02:31:30.231
<v Speaker 3>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go back and some of his choices </v>

3635
02:31:30.231 --> 02:31:30.720
<v Speaker 3>and some of those decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what decades ago,</v>

3636
02:31:30.990 --> 02:31:33.210
<v Speaker 3>he was thought to be too creepy for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>supreme court.</v>

3637
02:31:33.211 --> 02:31:35.190
<v Speaker 3>He was thought to be too creepy for </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics.</v>

3638
02:31:35.191 --> 02:31:36.540
<v Speaker 3>He was thought to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3639
02:31:36.541 --> 02:31:38.670
<v Speaker 3>he's just a scary guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Now he's gone.</v>

3640
02:31:38.671 --> 02:31:40.200
<v Speaker 3>Thankfully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I.</v>

3641
02:31:40.201 --> 02:31:41.880
<v Speaker 3>But people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people are supporting him.</v>

3642
02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:43.740
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the president forced him out.</v>

3643
02:31:43.920 --> 02:31:48.920
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that's the best endorsement of trump </v>

3644
02:31:48.920 --> 02:31:51.501
<v Speaker 3>I fucking heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's amazing is like different </v>

3645
02:31:51.501 --> 02:31:53.661
<v Speaker 3>states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans supposedlY for the last </v>

3646
02:31:53.661 --> 02:31:53.661
<v Speaker 3>whatever decades were for states' </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights,</v>

3647
02:31:53.661 --> 02:31:55.110
<v Speaker 3>let's every state decide they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>compete.</v>

3648
02:31:55.410 --> 02:31:58.180
<v Speaker 3>We had that with marijuana legalization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Son had full blown.</v>

3649
02:31:58.200 --> 02:31:59.640
<v Speaker 3>Some had medical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some had none.</v>

3650
02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:01.170
<v Speaker 3>This is how it's supposed to work.</v>

3651
02:32:01.170 --> 02:32:06.170
<v Speaker 3>and sessions was one who was Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it's still ostensibly </v>

3652
02:32:06.170 --> 02:32:06.930
<v Speaker 3>illegAl at the federal level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that a sessions like,</v>

3653
02:32:07.110 --> 02:32:09.720
<v Speaker 3>fuck you federal overrides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have these rates.</v>

3654
02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Why leave them alone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let them decide on a state level like </v>

3655
02:32:15.180 --> 02:32:15.180
<v Speaker 3>you said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they never did it.</v>

3656
02:32:15.180 --> 02:32:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3657
02:32:15.180 --> 02:32:17.400
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of pushback by trump.</v>

3658
02:32:17.401 --> 02:32:22.401
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know obama actually did have some </v>

3659
02:32:22.401 --> 02:32:22.401
<v Speaker 3>rates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just insaNe.</v>

3660
02:32:22.401 --> 02:32:23.420
<v Speaker 3>Like you were part of the tomb gang in </v>
<v Speaker 3>high.</v>

3661
02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:24.940
<v Speaker 3>In high school or college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3662
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:29.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did have some raids during his </v>

3663
02:32:29.950 --> 02:32:31.401
<v Speaker 3>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on a grand jury duty and I talked </v>

3664
02:32:31.401 --> 02:32:36.291
<v Speaker 3>to the whole jury to let people off </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a marijuana stuff because I'm </v>

3665
02:32:36.421 --> 02:32:37.740
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to indict on this.</v>

3666
02:32:38.040 --> 02:32:39.720
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you want to ruin someone's life?</v>

3667
02:32:39.960 --> 02:32:42.870
<v Speaker 3>What was the jury?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you have a bunch of cases,</v>

3668
02:32:42.980 --> 02:32:44.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said I can't get into specifics,</v>

3669
02:32:44.581 --> 02:32:49.581
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are from all walks of life are </v>

3670
02:32:49.581 --> 02:32:51.090
<v Speaker 3>very receptive to the idea of when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about what jail means,</v>

3671
02:32:51.860 --> 02:32:53.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so fucked up.</v>

3672
02:32:53.670 --> 02:32:54.480
<v Speaker 3>And people are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3673
02:32:54.481 --> 02:32:59.481
<v Speaker 3>someone does something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should be punished even if someone </v>

3674
02:32:59.481 --> 02:33:01.911
<v Speaker 3>should be punished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that that punishment should be </v>

3675
02:33:01.911 --> 02:33:01.911
<v Speaker 3>jail is not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3676
02:33:02.310 --> 02:33:07.310
<v Speaker 3>And if someone's not at wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't it be better if they had house </v>

3677
02:33:07.310 --> 02:33:07.310
<v Speaker 3>arrest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example?</v>

3678
02:33:07.310 --> 02:33:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Why do you need them to be terrorized </v>
<v Speaker 3>and locked in with a roommate?</v>

3679
02:33:08.970 --> 02:33:10.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't want a roommate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3680
02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:15.920
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a roommate who's also locked in the </v>

3681
02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:15.920
<v Speaker 3>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3682
02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:16.590
<v Speaker 3>And only around other males.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3683
02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:18.000
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's dark.</v>

3684
02:33:18.420 --> 02:33:23.420
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes back to what you're talking </v>

3685
02:33:23.420 --> 02:33:23.420
<v Speaker 3>about early about empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3686
02:33:23.420 --> 02:33:27.650
<v Speaker 3>And how important that is and about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>easy it is for people to just dismiss </v>

3687
02:33:27.650 --> 02:33:27.860
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3688
02:33:27.890 --> 02:33:29.910
<v Speaker 3>You know what they call today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cancel culture.</v>

3689
02:33:30.090 --> 02:33:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Like people just want things cancel and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just want things.</v>

3690
02:33:32.060 --> 02:33:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Shut them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3691
02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Get rid of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forced them out.</v>

3692
02:33:34.470 --> 02:33:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Firearm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take away his thing.</v>

3693
02:33:36.580 --> 02:33:37.620
<v Speaker 3>Takeaways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gig.</v>

3694
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:41.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then put them in jail like this.</v>

3695
02:33:41.430 --> 02:33:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Put them in jail thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me it's like here's a big one.</v>

3696
02:33:45.330 --> 02:33:48.450
<v Speaker 3>Taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you don't pay your taxes,</v>

3697
02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:50.520
<v Speaker 3>that put you in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a child support.</v>

3698
02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was this meme I saw were like</v>

3699
02:33:53.010 --> 02:33:54.930
<v Speaker 3>a woman doesn't pay child support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She gets the government,</v>

3700
02:33:55.380 --> 02:34:00.380
<v Speaker 3>she gets an apartment and if a guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't pitch outs where he goes to </v>

3701
02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:00.380
<v Speaker 3>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3702
02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:04.880
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can't earn any money from when </v>

3703
02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:04.880
<v Speaker 3>you're in jail and all that money when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get out who's that helping?</v>

3704
02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:07.800
<v Speaker 3>And it's going to help someone that </v>
<v Speaker 3>their dad's a jailbird now is it because</v>

3705
02:34:07.801 --> 02:34:12.801
<v Speaker 3>the resources aren't available to force </v>
<v Speaker 3>the person to pay like there's not </v>

3706
02:34:12.801 --> 02:34:17.240
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they try to make the punishment as </v>

3707
02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:18.730
<v Speaker 3>terrible as possible so that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivate them to shore.</v>

3708
02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:23.880
<v Speaker 3>But at a certain point it's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a conscionable to </v>

3709
02:34:23.880 --> 02:34:27.781
<v Speaker 3>really be sending a jail is so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really needs to be someone who's a </v>

3710
02:34:27.781 --> 02:34:28.990
<v Speaker 3>danger to society if they're walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

3711
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:30.220
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

3712
02:34:30.420 --> 02:34:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

3713
02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:33.930
<v Speaker 3>even the Martha Stewart model,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be so much happier for a lot of</v>

3714
02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:35.380
<v Speaker 3>these people were just locked in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

3715
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:40.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do They need to be able to go to </v>

3716
02:34:40.750 --> 02:34:40.750
<v Speaker 3>jail?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3717
02:34:40.750 --> 02:34:40.750
<v Speaker 3>But afterwards I've actually had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ankle bracelet,</v>

3718
02:34:40.750 --> 02:34:44.700
<v Speaker 3>like why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>like once you start asking those </v>

3719
02:34:44.700 --> 02:34:46.711
<v Speaker 3>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what will matter for you if it's an </v>

3720
02:34:46.711 --> 02:34:48.511
<v Speaker 3>ankle bracelet or if they're in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would it matter that you've put them on </v>

3721
02:34:48.511 --> 02:34:51.631
<v Speaker 3>some island and they couldn't do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then people don't even think in </v>

3722
02:34:51.631 --> 02:34:51.631
<v Speaker 3>those terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3723
02:34:51.631 --> 02:34:52.570
<v Speaker 3>because you lose your humanity once </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a criminal,</v>

3724
02:34:52.571 --> 02:34:54.950
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're not a human being and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

3725
02:34:55.070 --> 02:35:00.070
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's wait until wait until there's a </v>

3726
02:35:00.070 --> 02:35:03.061
<v Speaker 3>joke that like a conservative as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal who's been mugged and a liberal </v>

3727
02:35:03.061 --> 02:35:03.670
<v Speaker 3>is a conservative who's had interactions</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the law.</v>

3728
02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:05.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like once you interact with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>law,</v>

3729
02:35:05.801 --> 02:35:07.600
<v Speaker 3>my friend ally's oral and she's a public</v>
<v Speaker 3>defender.</v>

3730
02:35:07.601 --> 02:35:12.601
<v Speaker 3>She is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's really easy once the eye </v>

3731
02:35:12.601 --> 02:35:13.720
<v Speaker 3>of sauron is on you and you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>criminal,</v>

3732
02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:16.690
<v Speaker 3>shit goes out the window really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>quick and it's very scary.</v>

3733
02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's people that are prosecutors </v>

3734
02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:24.450
<v Speaker 3>that are trying to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to win a case and that's </v>

3735
02:35:24.450 --> 02:35:28.021
<v Speaker 3>what their job is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their job is not to make sure that </v>

3736
02:35:28.021 --> 02:35:31.051
<v Speaker 3>everything is being done correctly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you are being represented </v>

3737
02:35:31.051 --> 02:35:31.660
<v Speaker 3>accurately and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3738
02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:32.010
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3739
02:35:32.210 --> 02:35:32.630
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3740
02:35:32.690 --> 02:35:36.040
<v Speaker 3>the job is there is a case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cases against you,</v>

3741
02:35:36.041 --> 02:35:38.380
<v Speaker 3>you're on trial when the trial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3742
02:35:38.530 --> 02:35:40.810
<v Speaker 3>That's my job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a game and it has to be their job.</v>

3743
02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3744
02:35:41.741 --> 02:35:43.250
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that.</v>

3745
02:35:43.260 --> 02:35:46.090
<v Speaker 3>This is the problem that I've said with </v>
<v Speaker 3>law enforcement period.</v>

3746
02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:49.300
<v Speaker 3>When cops see people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think of those people as a possible</v>

3747
02:35:49.301 --> 02:35:52.390
<v Speaker 3>arrest and there's a game and they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been lied to.</v>

3748
02:35:52.391 --> 02:35:53.270
<v Speaker 3>By so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3749
02:35:53.290 --> 02:35:55.570
<v Speaker 3>you're a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with people all day long.</v>

3750
02:35:55.571 --> 02:35:57.730
<v Speaker 3>They're lying to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You meet some new person.</v>

3751
02:35:57.731 --> 02:36:00.040
<v Speaker 3>You automatically assume they're lying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you as well,</v>

3752
02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:05.760
<v Speaker 3>and then things get weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a great video called do not </v>

3753
02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:06.160
<v Speaker 3>cooperate with the police and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a law professor,</v>

3754
02:36:06.161 --> 02:36:11.161
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had the cop standing right next </v>

3755
02:36:11.161 --> 02:36:12.901
<v Speaker 3>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told the cop anything I say that's </v>

3756
02:36:12.901 --> 02:36:14.521
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please jump in and correct me and his </v>

3757
02:36:14.521 --> 02:36:14.521
<v Speaker 3>broad point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just sum it up quickly is you can't</v>

3758
02:36:14.521 --> 02:36:16.090
<v Speaker 3>talk your way out of an arrest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can talk your way into one,</v>

3759
02:36:16.670 --> 02:36:18.730
<v Speaker 3>so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do not ever talk to them.</v>

3761
02:36:20.411 --> 02:36:25.411

<v Speaker 3>attorney present because there's no </v>

3762

02:36:59.681 --> 02:37:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want him.</v>

3781
02:37:00.641 --> 02:37:03.370
<v Speaker 3>They want him in britain and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>think they've been charges filed against</v>

3782
02:37:03.371 --> 02:37:04.450
<v Speaker 3>him here yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technically,</v>

3783
02:37:04.660 --> 02:37:08.020
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sure that they want his head on </v>
<v Speaker 3>a platter to what they want him for.</v>

3784
02:37:08.020 --> 02:37:09.750
<v Speaker 3>So preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so nice.</v>

3785
02:37:10.070 --> 02:37:12.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like a wannabe capone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3786
02:37:12.910 --> 02:37:15.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excavation instead of being a mobster.</v>

3787
02:37:15.500 --> 02:37:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3788
02:37:16.191 --> 02:37:21.191
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because I would think </v>

3789
02:37:21.191 --> 02:37:24.401
<v Speaker 3>that someone like trump who is such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy minded person would actually </v>

3790
02:37:24.590 --> 02:37:28.360
<v Speaker 3>like juliana massage because I'm sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been.</v>

3791
02:37:28.460 --> 02:37:33.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he's ever said in the </v>

3792
02:37:33.460 --> 02:37:33.500
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was anti wiki leaks from the start.</v>

3793
02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:34.030
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>

3794
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:36.410
<v Speaker 3>He said things about juliana signs that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were anti.</v>

3795
02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:37.490
<v Speaker 3>That's my understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3796
02:37:38.170 --> 02:37:40.760
<v Speaker 3>That's because there was something </v>
<v Speaker 3>julian assange tweeted,</v>

3797
02:37:40.761 --> 02:37:41.890
<v Speaker 3>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cassandra fairbank's,</v>

3798
02:37:41.930 --> 02:37:43.790
<v Speaker 3>she's a big support of him and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3799
02:37:43.791 --> 02:37:45.530
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there goes to the idea of clemency or.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Pardon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

3801
02:37:46.761 --> 02:37:49.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So trump tweeted,</v>

3802
02:37:49.821 --> 02:37:51.100
<v Speaker 3>or julian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

3803
02:37:51.610 --> 02:37:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3804
02:37:54.060 --> 02:37:55.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a piece of praise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The virtual prisoner.</v>

3805
02:37:56.020 --> 02:37:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3806
02:37:56.690 --> 02:37:59.450
<v Speaker 3>where's that end?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not gonna end.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3809

<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3810
02:38:04.261 --> 02:38:04.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3811
02:38:04.510 --> 02:38:07.550

<v Speaker 3>Taking that away.</v>

3812
02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:11.960
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how long he could stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it's been years.</v>

3813
02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:13.160
<v Speaker 3>Years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been years.</v>

3814
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:15.560
<v Speaker 3>Years to be in one building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3815
02:38:15.561 --> 02:38:17.090

<v Speaker 3>they won't let them.</v>

3817
02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:20.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he ever could.</v>

3818
02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:21.970
<v Speaker 3>Went on the balcony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where they're going to.</v>

3872
02:40:46.231 --> 02:40:47.080
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Putin is letting them in.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3874
02:40:47.891 --> 02:40:50.080
<v Speaker 3>So they better learn how to write those </v>
<v Speaker 3>arms backward pretty quick.</v>

3875
02:40:50.590 --> 02:40:52.240

3877
02:40:53.081 --> 02:40:55.990
<v Speaker 3>Well you have to learn the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole language and just a weird art.</v>

3878
02:40:55.991 --> 02:40:58.550
<v Speaker 3>It's just you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russians got a lot of weird ones.</v>

3879
02:40:58.551 --> 02:41:01.030
<v Speaker 3>So we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got barely literate in Russia.</v>

3880
02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:05.800
<v Speaker 3>The letters look fake letters are fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they look like alien language,</v>

3881
02:41:05.801 --> 02:41:10.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like somebody writing something </v>

3882
02:41:10.801 --> 02:41:12.451
<v Speaker 3>that is a piece of metal from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spaceship like snowden is.</v>

3883
02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:14.500
<v Speaker 3>He's fucked too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3884
02:41:14.530 --> 02:41:16.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean he can't even be public in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>

3885
02:41:19.090 --> 02:41:20.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

3886
02:41:20.650 --> 02:41:21.240
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds.</v>

3887
02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:26.280
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been following stoughton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's deep under when they must know </v>

3888
02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:26.280
<v Speaker 3>where he is though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no,</v>

3889
02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:30.931
<v Speaker 3>with the intelligence community is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have a fucking full line on </v>

3890
02:41:30.931 --> 02:41:31.640
<v Speaker 3>exactly where that guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question,</v>

3891
02:41:31.660 --> 02:41:33.670
<v Speaker 3>do they know all this stuff or are they </v>
<v Speaker 3>incompetent?</v>

3892
02:41:33.700 --> 02:41:36.210
<v Speaker 3>And there's examples of both directions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3893
02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:38.180
<v Speaker 3>I got to think they know where snowden </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

3894
02:41:38.290 --> 02:41:41.020
<v Speaker 3>Like glenn greenwald talks to them all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It says when did he die?</v>

3911
02:42:14.770 --> 02:42:17.500

<v Speaker 3>the putin's deciding to do this.</v>

3925
02:42:49.810 --> 02:42:51.550

02:46:32.650 --> 02:46:35.120
<v Speaker 3>What was that like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A interesting.</v>

4011
02:46:35.210 --> 02:46:36.900
<v Speaker 3>How stupid were they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4012
02:46:37.240 --> 02:46:38.040
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

4013
02:46:38.090 --> 02:46:41.630
<v Speaker 3>That's the big myth that these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are affected because they're bright.</v>

4014
02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:46.870
<v Speaker 3>It's like any 90 percent what the nazis </v>
<v Speaker 3>iN charlottesville or bright.</v>

4015
02:46:47.310 --> 02:46:52.310
<v Speaker 3>Then in a hold on any population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have 90 percent and it's 10 </v>

4016
02:46:52.310 --> 02:46:54.941
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there are people in that group who </v>

4017
02:46:54.941 --> 02:46:54.941
<v Speaker 3>are sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is whY they're getting traction.</v>

4018
02:46:54.941 --> 02:46:56.270
<v Speaker 3>You can just a kid but fucked up.</v>

4019
02:46:56.600 --> 02:46:57.800
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4020
02:46:58.730 --> 02:47:02.100
<v Speaker 3>So evil geniuses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4021
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:04.060
<v Speaker 3>I like to refer to myself as an evil </v>
<v Speaker 3>genius.</v>

4022
02:47:04.070 --> 02:47:06.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that I want to be lumped in</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that term,</v>

4023
02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:07.580
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4024
02:47:07.660 --> 02:47:11.030
<v Speaker 3>and I mean they're dangerous in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

4025
02:47:12.290 --> 02:47:13.880
<v Speaker 3>They are intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulative,</v>

4026
02:47:13.881 --> 02:47:17.540
<v Speaker 3>and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is right and it's,</v>

4027
02:47:17.690 --> 02:47:20.270
<v Speaker 3>as soon as they start talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see them as human beings.</v>

4028
02:47:20.271 --> 02:47:22.280
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard to dismiss people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their ideas.</v>

4029
02:47:22.281 --> 02:47:27.281
<v Speaker 3>And if the press won't talk about those </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas and sweep them under the rug and </v>

4030
02:47:27.281 --> 02:47:27.710
<v Speaker 3>they're saying things you've never heard</v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

4031
02:47:27.950 --> 02:47:29.660
<v Speaker 3>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an element of intrigue.</v>

4032
02:47:29.810 --> 02:47:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right is such a dirty word now.</v>

4033
02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:33.080
<v Speaker 3>The right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like jusT saying,</v>

4034
02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:38.200
<v Speaker 3>it's always been a dirty word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but was way dirtier now than it's ever </v>

4035
02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:38.200
<v Speaker 3>been before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4036
02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:38.200
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4037
02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:39.560
<v Speaker 3>In the past it was much worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4038
02:47:39.561 --> 02:47:40.940
<v Speaker 3>maybe in my lifetime I should.</v>

4039
02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean that there's a vested </v>

4040
02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:48.491
<v Speaker 3>interest on the part of the corporate </v>
<v Speaker 3>press to make it a dirty word because </v>

4041
02:47:48.491 --> 02:47:48.491
<v Speaker 3>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4042
02:47:48.491 --> 02:47:51.791
<v Speaker 3>the all the good people are in the left </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you don't have to do any </v>

4043
02:47:51.791 --> 02:47:54.280
<v Speaker 3>persuading.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that that's a strategy or </v>

4044
02:47:54.280 --> 02:47:57.281
<v Speaker 3>do you think that's really what evidence</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have the points to it being a </v>

4045
02:47:57.281 --> 02:47:58.910
<v Speaker 3>strategy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you have news articles,</v>

4046
02:47:58.911 --> 02:48:01.690
<v Speaker 3>they will always use the term far right </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a pejorative.</v>

4047
02:48:01.720 --> 02:48:03.710
<v Speaker 3>They never used the term far left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

4048
02:48:03.740 --> 02:48:06.170
<v Speaker 3>It's a complete asymmetry and today for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

4049
02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:11.230
<v Speaker 3>and different countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll have all these nationalist </v>

4050
02:48:11.230 --> 02:48:11.230
<v Speaker 3>movements and they're always referred to</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far right.</v>

4051
02:48:11.230 --> 02:48:15.401
<v Speaker 3>Which is not accurate because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>usually moderates when it comes to </v>

4052
02:48:15.401 --> 02:48:15.401
<v Speaker 3>things like social security or </v>
<v Speaker 3>government spending.</v>

4053
02:48:15.401 --> 02:48:18.200
<v Speaker 3>They're just on one issue nationalists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're far right.</v>

4054
02:48:18.590 --> 02:48:21.230
<v Speaker 3>so that's a way to kind of lump them in </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the nazis.</v>

4055
02:48:21.231 --> 02:48:26.231
<v Speaker 3>And in many cases they aren't at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A nigel farrage is an example of this </v>

4056
02:48:26.231 --> 02:48:28.550
<v Speaker 3>hit when he took over ukip and the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>british,</v>

4057
02:48:28.610 --> 02:48:30.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>independence movement.</v>

4058
02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:34.020
<v Speaker 3>He fought against the white supremacists</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they wanted to tie together.</v>

4059
02:48:34.021 --> 02:48:34.280
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4060
02:48:34.281 --> 02:48:34.400
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4061
02:48:34.401 --> 02:48:34.560
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4062
02:48:34.580 --> 02:48:39.580
<v Speaker 3>that's not what we're about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was one of his big </v>

4063
02:48:39.580 --> 02:48:41.681
<v Speaker 3>accomplishments and doesn't get ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting credited about this while he's </v>

4064
02:48:41.681 --> 02:48:43.550
<v Speaker 3>just so inexorably connected to brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4065
02:48:44.060 --> 02:48:46.630
<v Speaker 3>All anybody thinks about him as racism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4066
02:48:46.670 --> 02:48:47.910
<v Speaker 3>That's by intent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4067
02:48:48.150 --> 02:48:50.410
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also just convenience,</v>

4068
02:48:50.411 --> 02:48:55.411
<v Speaker 3>sloppy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lazy thinking by a lot of people were </v>

4069
02:48:55.411 --> 02:48:55.411
<v Speaker 3>just too many things to pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

4070
02:48:55.411 --> 02:48:55.890
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>YoU kNow,</v>

4071
02:48:55.910 --> 02:48:59.120
<v Speaker 3>and if you just all brexit bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>

4072
02:48:59.150 --> 02:49:04.150
<v Speaker 3>the definition of a racist is something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that a progressive doesn't like or </v>

4073
02:49:04.150 --> 02:49:05.690
<v Speaker 3>someone who's racist or someone is </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>

4074
02:49:05.691 --> 02:49:07.840
<v Speaker 3>So they're using these two things </v>
<v Speaker 3>interchAngeably,</v>

4075
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:09.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

4076
02:49:09.670 --> 02:49:09.780
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

4077
02:49:10.300 --> 02:49:15.300
<v Speaker 2>I remember when all used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all used to be like nerds.</v>

4078
02:49:15.910 --> 02:49:19.850
<v Speaker 2>he used to be all left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to be like alternative music,</v>

4079
02:49:19.910 --> 02:49:21.800
<v Speaker 2>all comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this.</v>

4080
02:49:22.220 --> 02:49:24.590
<v Speaker 2>But like sonic youth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't say that anymore.</v>

4081
02:49:24.780 --> 02:49:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Like even in comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't use the term alt rooms,</v>

4082
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:29.660
<v Speaker 2>but all comedy was a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4083
02:49:29.900 --> 02:49:32.700
<v Speaker 2>But now people stopped using it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>outright.</v>

4084
02:49:32.810 --> 02:49:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just used the ucb like,</v>

4085
02:49:35.270 --> 02:49:36.320
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to ucb.</v>

4086
02:49:36.330 --> 02:49:40.040
<v Speaker 2>They don't say I'm going to these rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes people do refer,</v>

4087
02:49:40.041 --> 02:49:45.041
<v Speaker 2>like it's sometimes there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of residual leftover or some </v>

4088
02:49:46.030 --> 02:49:48.130
<v Speaker 2>comics will still use that word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But alt.</v>

4089
02:49:48.410 --> 02:49:49.400
<v Speaker 2>If someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4090
02:49:49.401 --> 02:49:52.940
<v Speaker 2>he's alt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would automatically assume they were</v>

4091
02:49:52.941 --> 02:49:57.020
<v Speaker 2>like really low key left wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>progressive.</v>

4092
02:49:57.160 --> 02:50:02.160
<v Speaker 2>that was alt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now all is all right where it's like </v>

4093
02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:04.700
<v Speaker 2>racist nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4094
02:50:04.701 --> 02:50:05.510
<v Speaker 2>milo.</v>

4095
02:50:05.570 --> 02:50:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Well the npc script is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if a person is to the right of </v>

4096
02:50:10.570 --> 02:50:11.720
<v Speaker 1>hillary clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then execute.</v>

4097
02:50:11.721 --> 02:50:16.721
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>did ecc and I'm just giving you the </v>

4098
02:50:16.721 --> 02:50:16.721
<v Speaker 1>whole speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4099
02:50:16.721 --> 02:50:16.721
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4100
02:50:16.721 --> 02:50:17.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4101
02:50:17.650 --> 02:50:21.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean the discourse in this country has</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely collapsed and I love it.</v>

4102
02:50:21.650 --> 02:50:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Why do you love It though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This course is because my rights are up </v>

4103
02:50:26.650 --> 02:50:26.650
<v Speaker 1>for discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone a vote.</v>

4104
02:50:26.650 --> 02:50:29.870
<v Speaker 1>So whenever people sit down and have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about my life and freedom,</v>

4105
02:50:29.871 --> 02:50:34.871
<v Speaker 1>it's going to end badly for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if people can't talk to each other </v>

4106
02:50:34.871 --> 02:50:37.871
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll go our separate ways and </v>

4107
02:50:37.871 --> 02:50:39.371
<v Speaker 1>live peacefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd raTher not talk about it and </v>

4108
02:50:39.371 --> 02:50:39.410
<v Speaker 1>just go peacefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're saying,</v>

4109
02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:44.590
<v Speaker 1>someone's political opinions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>preferences should have as much impact </v>

4110
02:50:44.590 --> 02:50:46.760
<v Speaker 1>in my life as their sexual preferences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to fuck dudes.</v>

4111
02:50:46.761 --> 02:50:48.350
<v Speaker 1>You want to have a threesome?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

4112
02:50:48.351 --> 02:50:53.351
<v Speaker 1>I care if you're my friend and that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested but it's not going to impact </v>

4113
02:50:53.351 --> 02:50:53.510
<v Speaker 1>me and it shouldn't impact me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And same thing with,</v>

4114
02:50:53.650 --> 02:50:56.750
<v Speaker 1>oh You want more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well for grade go live your life.</v>

4115
02:50:56.751 --> 02:51:00.480
<v Speaker 1>That was sort of it becoming some </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouting match on your front door and,</v>

4116
02:51:00.500 --> 02:51:02.060
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4117
02:51:02.090 --> 02:51:05.240
<v Speaker 1>instead of you and your buddies coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and scaring the shit out of my kids.</v>

4118
02:51:05.390 --> 02:51:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean no one.</v>

4119
02:51:07.250 --> 02:51:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean very few people deserve that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say no one,</v>

4120
02:51:09.471 --> 02:51:11.180
<v Speaker 1>but very few people deserve that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4121
02:51:11.230 --> 02:51:16.230
<v Speaker 2>so disengaging from political discourse </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a strategy for just overall civility,</v>

4122
02:51:18.580 --> 02:51:23.580
<v Speaker 1>but also worsening political discourse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a purpose to make it so that people </v>

4123
02:51:23.580 --> 02:51:24.550
<v Speaker 1>can't actually form coalitions and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything done.</v>

4124
02:51:24.760 --> 02:51:29.010
<v Speaker 1>But it is amazing how personal people </v>
<v Speaker 1>take other people's opinions on things.</v>

4125
02:51:29.080 --> 02:51:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get,</v>

4126
02:51:31.870 --> 02:51:33.670
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is like when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dating and you think,</v>

4127
02:51:33.671 --> 02:51:33.970
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

4128
02:51:34.030 --> 02:51:35.740
<v Speaker 1>this girl likes the same kind of music I</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

4129
02:51:35.741 --> 02:51:40.741
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to get along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a very weak correlation and </v>

4130
02:51:40.741 --> 02:51:44.161
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of people who are right </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing who are good people and there's </v>

4131
02:51:44.161 --> 02:51:48.241
<v Speaker 1>lots of people who are left wing who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>good people and there's lots of people </v>

4132
02:51:48.241 --> 02:51:51.661
<v Speaker 1>who are right wing who are bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a very weak correlation between </v>

4133
02:51:51.661 --> 02:51:51.661
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4134
02:51:51.661 --> 02:51:56.191
<v Speaker 1>it's a cultural signifier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably came from the same culture </v>

4135
02:51:56.191 --> 02:51:56.191
<v Speaker 1>because people just take the culture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they grew up with.</v>

4136
02:51:56.191 --> 02:51:58.750
<v Speaker 1>But if you're going to just dismiss it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's higher schools of thought.</v>

4137
02:51:58.751 --> 02:52:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Just because they vote dIfferently from </v>
<v Speaker 1>you is as a personal level that's you're</v>

4138
02:52:02.801 --> 02:52:04.510
<v Speaker 1>missing out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of quality people.</v>

4139
02:52:04.990 --> 02:52:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't agree more.</v>

4140
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:08.260
<v Speaker 3>We should probably end it with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me about your book.</v>

4141
02:52:08.261 --> 02:52:09.220
<v Speaker 3>When's it out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>May,</v>

4142
02:52:09.310 --> 02:52:10.710
<v Speaker 3>May 14th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>29.</v>

4143
02:52:11.080 --> 02:52:12.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a long time from now.</v>

4144
02:52:12.190 --> 02:52:14.250
<v Speaker 3>Come back on again when it comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
