00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen tardy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here nonetheless,</v>

2
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like halfway through because the </v>

3
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one on Ustream says 3:00</v>

4
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>and this one says a and I said at 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm an Indian,</v>

5
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's supposed to be 3:00,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we figured we'll start somewhere </v>

6
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.291
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's all about checking out the </v>

7
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:52.291
<v Speaker 1>twitter that I to find out when really </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

8
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous Brian,</v>

9
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.600
<v Speaker 1>because some people have lives and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't just be on the fucking twitter all</v>

10
00:02:55.601 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>the time looking for you.</v>

11
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you met people that have their </v>

12
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.500
<v Speaker 2>twitter setup?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when twit they</v>

13
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.100
<v Speaker 1>automatically get like a text message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

14
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>People get mad at me sometimes you may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're tweet too much,</v>

15
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:13.081
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's blowing up my phone to take you </v>

16
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:13.081
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

17
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:17.161
<v Speaker 1>Why would you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe in the beginning it was </v>

18
00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:17.161
<v Speaker 1>almost like an instant message for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

19
00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really,</v>

20
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>that's just text messaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's someone who,</v>

21
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>text messaging but text messaging to all</v>

22
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:24.530
<v Speaker 1>their friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

23
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>And then it got crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange way of communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

25
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 1>twitter is one of the weirdest fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>interventions that the Internet has ever</v>

26
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>spurland sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spring gives birth to shit out.</v>

27
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

28
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>it's so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep it to 140 characters so that,</v>

29
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to fucking verbose stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn how to edit your shit,</v>

31
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have these long run on.</v>

32
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>You ever read someone's blogs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even my own blogs ramble so much,</v>

33
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>too much sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some people,</v>

34
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.250
<v Speaker 1>your blogs are for smart people that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

35
00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like readers,</v>

36
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:07.231
<v Speaker 1>like I have to be in a reader mode most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the time I'm in more of a video to </v>

37
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.040
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to read anything like that.</v>

38
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:11.910
<v Speaker 1>I write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

39
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

40
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I do,</v>

41
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I times I think when I have what I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to write it,</v>

42
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I have to write it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the,</v>

43
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.240
<v Speaker 1>if I'm writing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just because that's what I'm </v>

44
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.281
<v Speaker 1>thinking about and I've been fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it and I've been rolling around in </v>

45
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:26.281
<v Speaker 1>my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>and they might not be correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

47
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of my ideas are just pure </v>

48
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.151
<v Speaker 1>speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the only way to really be honest </v>

49
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so write in a blog.</v>

50
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 1>You can't like tell people stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

51
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.090
<v Speaker 1>You start talking to people about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories and you suddenly got nut least </v>

52
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 1>if you write it down for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

53
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 1>it looks more thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that weird?</v>

54
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you just tell people that you think</v>

55
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:58.201
<v Speaker 1>that technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a symbiotic life form </v>

56
00:04:58.201 --> 00:05:01.310
<v Speaker 1>that's existing with us and eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to overcome us and then </v>

57
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>everybody's looking at it like we </v>
<v Speaker 1>control it always,</v>

58
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

59
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those terminator movies,</v>

60
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>those guys got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

61
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:10.180
<v Speaker 1>that's like super possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

62
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one wants to believe that,</v>

63
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:16.680
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at how fucking chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>human life is and not,</v>

64
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>not really in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:24.841
<v Speaker 1>this is pretty bad ass country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you watch like documentaries on </v>

66
00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 1>like that vice squad guide to Liberia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what it was?</v>

67
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.810

<v Speaker 1>about all the cannibalism and shit </v>

<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>

86
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.860

<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

87
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they were smart.</v>

88
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:11.740
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.090
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to figure out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But most of the time Google works out </v>

92
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 3>pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you feel like a little genius when</v>

93
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:24.050

103
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 4>well it's up to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The flux Kragen how's life?</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like that lion shit was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

105
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 4>If you haven't seen what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about with the Lions Shit,</v>

106
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.090
<v Speaker 4>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these gigantic lions that lived in </v>

107
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 4>Africa and they got cut off from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of the continent and there was a,</v>

108
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:03.641
<v Speaker 4>there was stuck on an island and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were like regular size lines at first </v>

109
00:07:03.641 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 4>they presume and because they were on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the island with only water,</v>

110
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 4>buffalo water buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hardest to kill.</v>

111
00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:13.751
<v Speaker 4>So these lions got gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They grew fucking huge from taking down </v>

112
00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 4>water buffaloes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really pretty fucking spooky stuff.</v>

113
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.110
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's intense.</v>

114
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.190
<v Speaker 4>Like they looked like the hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't look real like,</v>

115
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.600
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those mice that have that milestone and </v>

116
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:28.600
<v Speaker 4>thing that they like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those dogs was whippets.</v>

117
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.820
<v Speaker 4>When they do those experiments on them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and make them look like cartoons</v>

118
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.400
<v Speaker 3>you ever seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That disease,</v>

119
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:37.760
<v Speaker 3>I guess it would be that makes you grow </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast.</v>

120
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.450
<v Speaker 3>Like they just showed this a woman that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was 12 years old,</v>

121
00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:43.820
<v Speaker 3>but she looked like she was 62 and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoker.</v>

122
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.770
<v Speaker 4>It has to do with the fat and your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have to do with growing fast </v>

123
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 4>and it has to do with the fat in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>skin.</v>

124
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.560
<v Speaker 4>When you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that happens is the </v>

125
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.171
<v Speaker 4>fat leaves your skin and these people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are like 13 and 12 and we're little </v>

126
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.780
<v Speaker 4>babies even they have this disease where</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how their body like starts </v>

127
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.041
<v Speaker 4>treating it right away so their skin </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts to behave like an old person's </v>

128
00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:09.510
<v Speaker 4>skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

129
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.560
<v Speaker 3>It was weird though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt so bad for her because she was </v>

130
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her mother had it too.</v>

131
00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:16.610
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super rare though,</v>

132
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:17.970
<v Speaker 3>so don't worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

133
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's pretty free</v>

134
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.480
<v Speaker 4>when you find diseases like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

135
00:08:21.481 --> 00:08:23.160
<v Speaker 4>but this Liberia Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I have to throw this link up because </v>

137
00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:29.910
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the gnarliest fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>documentaries I've ever seen ever.</v>

138
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.890

143
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 4>I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting tired of it.</v>

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.800
<v Speaker 3>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you didn't find it exciting.</v>

145
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 3>It was exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I like,</v>

150
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's going on now.</v>

151
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that one thing with the one thing </v>

152
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:10.180
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry for being that thing.</v>

153
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:10.180
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

154
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.920
<v Speaker 3>it was like a certain point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

155
00:09:12.921 --> 00:09:14.570
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like comical.</v>

156
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a caricature.</v>

157
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.400
<v Speaker 3>You know what I really hated also how </v>
<v Speaker 3>many commercials they're worried.</v>

158
00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:23.030
<v Speaker 3>There were like every three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a commercial in the future.</v>

159
00:09:23.031 --> 00:09:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully you could like go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

160
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:25.640
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want commercials.</v>

161
00:09:25.641 --> 00:09:27.900
<v Speaker 3>I want pop up ads on my tv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

162
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.980
<v Speaker 3>pretty pretty nutty because that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like you were into it,</v>

163
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.000
<v Speaker 3>out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into it,</v>

164
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.480
<v Speaker 3>out of it.</v>

165
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is pretty naughty.</v>

166
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:39.670
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to watch it on Dvr and even </v>

167
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.751
<v Speaker 4>then you've got to fast forward through </v>
<v Speaker 4>commercials are a very inefficient way </v>

168
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:43.900
<v Speaker 4>of reaching people because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>annoying the shit out of him,</v>

169
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it does have you stuff enough </v>

170
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.770
<v Speaker 4>shit down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our throats will eventually take it.</v>

171
00:09:50.771 --> 00:09:54.040
<v Speaker 4>But putting it out in the middle of like</v>
<v Speaker 4>shows and stuff like that.</v>

172
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:59.050
<v Speaker 3>What if you could go to like a group </v>
<v Speaker 3>once a month for like 10 minutes and </v>

173
00:09:59.091 --> 00:10:01.250
<v Speaker 3>they showed you a bunch of products and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they're like,</v>

174
00:10:01.251 --> 00:10:06.251
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no more advertising for you on the </v>

175
00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:06.251
<v Speaker 3>internet or for the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because you,</v>

176
00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:08.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you went to like a group meeting just so</v>

177
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.670
<v Speaker 3>advertisers can sell their products to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you in person.</v>

178
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.650
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is coke here.</v>

179
00:10:12.651 --> 00:10:13.700
<v Speaker 3>Taste tasted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

180
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.950
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we won't advertise on TV anymore.</v>

181
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.360
<v Speaker 4>Well I think there's maybe a better way </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be to do it the way they do it in </v>

182
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.380
<v Speaker 4>the movies where they show you the ads </v>
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>

183
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the movie.</v>

184
00:10:24.641 --> 00:10:25.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you have to watch it.</v>

185
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.670
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But still,</v>

186
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.370
<v Speaker 4>it's like once the show begins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you shut the fuck up.</v>

187
00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 4>You know when you go to the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the conceded,</v>

188
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:38.180
<v Speaker 4>the you're conceding is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You give them money so they're only </v>

189
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:38.800
<v Speaker 4>going to know you in the beginning and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're gonna stop annoying you.</v>

190
00:10:38.801 --> 00:10:40.930
<v Speaker 4>They're going to let the thing play out </v>
<v Speaker 4>in its full form,</v>

191
00:10:40.931 --> 00:10:45.931
<v Speaker 4>which is the most enjoyable way when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>appreciate any like a coca cola or any </v>

192
00:10:47.591 --> 00:10:49.270
<v Speaker 4>one of those people just stepped in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

193
00:10:49.271 --> 00:10:51.940
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all know the TV shows are better when</v>

194
00:10:51.941 --> 00:10:53.560
<v Speaker 4>you let them play from the beginning to </v>
<v Speaker 4>end.</v>

195
00:10:53.561 --> 00:10:55.570
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to interrupt him with </v>
<v Speaker 4>commercial all the time.</v>

196
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.060
<v Speaker 4>How about we'll do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll advertise in the beginning.</v>

197
00:10:58.061 --> 00:11:00.400
<v Speaker 4>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope you enjoy our product.</v>

198
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.350
<v Speaker 4>Hope you enjoy this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

199
00:11:02.351 --> 00:11:04.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how it's supposed to be.</v>

200
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.670
<v Speaker 4>They've got it nailed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These movie guys.</v>

201
00:11:06.671 --> 00:11:07.330
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nailed.</v>

202
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 4>These TV guys are retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be putting shit on the middle of </v>

203
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 4>the fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stupid.</v>

204
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.690
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

205
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.160
<v Speaker 3>and it was so bad last night that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

206
00:11:16.161 --> 00:11:19.870
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is getting an insane 15 minutes.</v>

207
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.380
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even 20 minutes.</v>

208
00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe every hour.</v>

209
00:11:23.331 --> 00:11:26.570
<v Speaker 3>If you have a two hour show every hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trolling a few commercials.</v>

210
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.510
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It pretty much was one hour show,</v>

211
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.420
<v Speaker 3>one hour of commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they built it as a two hour event.</v>

212
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's a lot of money,</v>

213
00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:36.210
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of money.</v>

214
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:41.540
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really enjoyed the series up until </v>

215
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:41.540
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but especially early on.</v>

216
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fellow is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a really creative series,</v>

217
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 4>but I got to admit that last night just </v>
<v Speaker 4>seemed kind of like hokey.</v>

218
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

219
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:53.710
<v Speaker 4>the Chinese guy who doesn't like to a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say anything right now.</v>

220
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you</v>

221
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.120
<v Speaker 3>gotta just go replace everything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>blah blah blah,</v>

222
00:11:56.121 --> 00:11:56.320
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

223
00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

224
00:11:57.301 --> 00:12:02.301
<v Speaker 4>no spoilers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to give it away if you </v>

225
00:12:02.301 --> 00:12:02.301
<v Speaker 4>haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

226
00:12:02.301 --> 00:12:02.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I think it's a,</v>

227
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:06.150
<v Speaker 4>it's still a great show still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though it seems Hokey,</v>

228
00:12:06.151 --> 00:12:08.250
<v Speaker 4>it's still fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at a certain point in time,</v>

229
00:12:08.251 --> 00:12:10.020
<v Speaker 4>the whole premise is hokey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

230
00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:10.980
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's silly.</v>

231
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.770
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the suspension of disbelief show.</v>

232
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:14.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm trying to censor it,</v>

242
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.610
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to do it.</v>

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.490
<v Speaker 3>watching Avatar and every five minutes </v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to take commercial.</v>

00:12:46.491 --> 00:12:47.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're absolutely right.</v>

251
00:12:47.751 --> 00:12:52.751
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be a better way to sell </v>

252
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:52.751
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the best way to sell shit.</v>

253
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:54.350
<v Speaker 3>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they think that just by,</v>

254
00:12:54.351 --> 00:12:56.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by conditioning people to be used to,</v>

255
00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:01.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interrupting and over and over again </v>

256
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.840
<v Speaker 3>that that's the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make us watch it in the beginning </v>

257

<v Speaker 3>Watch it anyway.</v>

259
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.291
<v Speaker 3>Then you have a Webcam set up on top of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your TV that detects if you're sitting </v>

<v Speaker 1>Are you pretending that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

350
00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:56.030
<v Speaker 1>in the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things don't turn out well.</v>

351
00:16:56.031 --> 00:17:01.031
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the real world stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a God damn fucking movie and I </v>

352
00:17:01.031 --> 00:17:01.031
<v Speaker 1>want a good ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

353
00:17:01.031 --> 00:17:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I want an interesting ending with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking cunt</v>

354
00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.190
<v Speaker 3>avatar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Avatar.</v>

355
00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:09.191
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to so many people that have </v>

356
00:17:09.191 --> 00:17:11.081
<v Speaker 3>been in the military that are pissed off</v>
<v Speaker 3>at that movie for killing what they say </v>

357
00:17:11.081 --> 00:17:14.951
<v Speaker 3>represents US soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet nowhere in there did they say </v>

358
00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:15.230
<v Speaker 3>they're like us or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just like an army,</v>

359
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.570
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point really,</v>

360
00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:18.910
<v Speaker 3>when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

361
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:24.210
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying who are whatever that </v>

362
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:24.210
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one guy was a marine,</v>

363
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.070
<v Speaker 3>but he was one of the blue guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see it,</v>

364
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.900
<v Speaker 3>I can see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

365
00:17:26.901 --> 00:17:27.800
<v Speaker 3>all right dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>calm down.</v>

366
00:17:27.801 --> 00:17:28.910
<v Speaker 3>There's Smurfs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

367
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.060
<v Speaker 3>Well that's this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a point,</v>

368
00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:33.590
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see it that way because you're</v>

369
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:35.120
<v Speaker 3>not a a military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

370
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:40.150
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially a military person in the </v>

371
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.330
<v Speaker 3>middle of two wars that they mean not </v>
<v Speaker 3>support and there's a lot of people that</v>

372
00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:46.331
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are in the military that don't </v>

373
00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:46.580
<v Speaker 3>think we should be there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people.</v>

374
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:51.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think Avatar in general is just </v>

375
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.561
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like Joe wasn't real us army </v>

376
00:17:53.561 --> 00:17:53.561
<v Speaker 3>troops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

377
00:17:53.561 --> 00:17:54.450
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason to get mad that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just an army.</v>

378
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.670
<v Speaker 3>They're representing like a space army </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>

379
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.440
<v Speaker 3>It was so much in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a thousand year old man.</v>

380
00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.660
<v Speaker 3>It was to human life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to be real to me,</v>

381
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.990
<v Speaker 3>don't get mad at Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine though,</v>

382
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.820
<v Speaker 3>for Real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if if</v>

383
00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:17.160
<v Speaker 4>was such a planet and there was such a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mineral and there were mercenaries who </v>

384
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 4>were going to that planet if it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>broadcast to us,</v>

385
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:23.160
<v Speaker 4>we don't know what the fuck is going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Afghanistan every day.</v>

386
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:28.430
<v Speaker 4>We don't know about these crazy drones </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're firing missiles into </v>

387
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.821
<v Speaker 4>Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is real stuff that's on the </v>

388
00:18:31.821 --> 00:18:31.821
<v Speaker 4>news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like science fiction,</v>

389
00:18:31.821 --> 00:18:36.081
<v Speaker 4>this is going on every day and other </v>
<v Speaker 4>parts of the world and how ain't that </v>

390
00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:37.860
<v Speaker 4>much different men and ate that much </v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

391
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.580
<v Speaker 4>It's people that don't know people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people for their shit,</v>

392
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:44.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what's going on right now and</v>

393
00:18:44.281 --> 00:18:45.450
<v Speaker 4>that's what it was going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>movie.</v>

394
00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.230
<v Speaker 4>It's not that unrealistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

395
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.300
<v Speaker 4>And in fact it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be generous.</v>

396
00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:54.390
<v Speaker 4>The idea that they would go so far as to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make artificial ones,</v>

397
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:59.391
<v Speaker 4>to try to be friends with them really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but more like kill them more like kill </v>

398
00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.070
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what people do mean.</v>

399
00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:06.960
<v Speaker 4>That movie painted a much more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a much brighter picture of humanity than</v>

400
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.000
<v Speaker 4>the real humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real humanity,</v>

401
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:14.001
<v Speaker 4>we're not making like Arab clones and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're operating with remote control to </v>

402
00:19:14.001 --> 00:19:16.170
<v Speaker 4>go in and infiltrate the Taliban and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey guys,</v>

403
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.350
<v Speaker 4>what's wrong with being American?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could,</v>

404
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.160
<v Speaker 4>maybe we can all be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

405
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if the United States government</v>

406
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:29.020
<v Speaker 4>had that kind of insight and innovation </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the human body,</v>

407
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.030
<v Speaker 4>could you imagine that kind of shit that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would do?</v>

408
00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:36.810
<v Speaker 4>They would just make billions and </v>
<v Speaker 4>billions of Republicans that would just </v>

409
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.201
<v Speaker 4>start cloning Republicans and making </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and operating them with a remote </v>

410
00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:44.761
<v Speaker 4>control republican girls fucking all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>important guys getting all their deals </v>

412
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.980
<v Speaker 3>You're just shaking your robot girl.</v>

413
00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:57.790
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an Avatar for the real life if </v>

414
00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:57.790
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they.</v>

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.691
<v Speaker 4>the fuck we're fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to figure out a reason to </v>

419
00:20:09.691 --> 00:20:12.301
<v Speaker 4>convince everybody on this side that </v>
<v Speaker 4>those people are evil and that's what </v>

420
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:16.171
<v Speaker 4>we've always done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those people are evil and then we jack </v>

421
00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:16.171
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

422
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

423
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:22.330
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking amazing that the same game </v>
<v Speaker 4>can go on for so long and in this age of</v>

424
00:20:22.661 --> 00:20:25.470
<v Speaker 4>information it can still be passed off </v>
<v Speaker 4>as like,</v>

425
00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the important thing to do.</v>

426
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:33.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the important thing to do at a certain </v>

427
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.990
<v Speaker 4>point is to try to fucking help </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody try to get all these countries</v>

428
00:20:34.991 --> 00:20:39.640
<v Speaker 4>to chill the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's never gonna happen man,</v>

429
00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.260
<v Speaker 4>because they live in somewhere that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sucks.</v>

430
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.210
<v Speaker 4>And when you live somewhere that really </v>
<v Speaker 4>sucks.</v>

<v Speaker 4>they're living in a part of the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuck hundreds and hundreds of </v>

434
00:20:54.001 --> 00:20:58.621
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got technology but they've got </v>

435
00:20:58.621 --> 00:20:59.610
<v Speaker 4>chaos and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's what these fucking people do in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Middle East.</v>

440
00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:11.410
<v Speaker 4>War has been going on in the Middle East</v>
<v Speaker 4>for so long.</v>

441
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.560
<v Speaker 4>Like you talked to Israelis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like due to a live in Israel already </v>

442
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.820
<v Speaker 4>talks about all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those motherfuckers are hard,</v>

<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

445
00:21:21.511 --> 00:21:24.730

<v Speaker 4>on a daily basis.</v>

446
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:29.731
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like a part of their culture </v>

00:21:29.731 --> 00:21:33.541
<v Speaker 4>it's like this conflict has been going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on for so fucking long over there and </v>

449
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.870
<v Speaker 4>it's almost impossible to see a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>without evolving,</v>

450
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.580
<v Speaker 4>without evolving as a species.</v>

451
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 4>It's almost impossible to see a way it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to end.</v>

452
00:21:41.441 --> 00:21:44.890
<v Speaker 4>It just keeps going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't show any sign of letting up.</v>

453
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:46.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you looked at it as a,</v>

454
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:47.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a wave,</v>

455
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:52.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you see the wave bouncing back and </v>

456
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.950
<v Speaker 4>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

457
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.900
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem like it's gone away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like there's always some </v>

458
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.460
<v Speaker 4>bullshit going down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's always this motherfuckers mad at</v>

461
00:22:01.941 --> 00:22:05.500

<v Speaker 4>and then it bounces right back in.</v>

462
00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:08.040
<v Speaker 4>Palestine wants their land back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>tipped it to an,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I showed Brian the,</v>

703
00:33:36.951 --> 00:33:41.951
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the difference between the rules Brian </v>

704
00:33:41.951 --> 00:33:46.601
<v Speaker 4>was alive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about in my blog where when the </v>

705
00:33:46.601 --> 00:33:46.601
<v Speaker 4>dude tried to stomp the dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he went,</v>

706
00:33:46.601 --> 00:33:46.601
<v Speaker 4>he could do that.</v>

707
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.080
<v Speaker 4>You remember?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

708
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:53.110
<v Speaker 4>I was really stoned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And next thing I know this guy is like </v>

709
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.330
<v Speaker 4>stopping this guy's brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

710
00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:53.800
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

711
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.850
<v Speaker 4>Is he trying to kill the guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucked up.</v>

712
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.400
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you watch those,</v>

713
00:33:58.401 --> 00:33:59.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those pride fights,</v>

714
00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:01.870
<v Speaker 4>like they were pretty fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

715
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:02.930
<v Speaker 4>it's like old school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>UFC.</v>

716
00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:03.940
<v Speaker 4>ECI.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

717
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:07.130
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something about the way they did</v>

718
00:34:07.131 --> 00:34:07.490
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

719
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:12.491
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the fact that they did 10 minute </v>

720
00:34:12.491 --> 00:34:12.491
<v Speaker 4>rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first round was cold.</v>

721
00:34:12.491 --> 00:34:13.400
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how it should be.</v>

722
00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

723
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:19.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everybody says no bullshit because </v>

724
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:20.390
<v Speaker 4>it's too hard in the fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't necessarily know if that's true.</v>

725
00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:25.440
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of times where a momentum </v>

726
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.551
<v Speaker 4>is being established and it's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>established and you would like to see </v>

727
00:34:27.551 --> 00:34:27.551
<v Speaker 4>where it goes.</v>

728
00:34:27.551 --> 00:34:29.810
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to see him like fuel up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and have some water in the corner.</v>

729
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:31.760
<v Speaker 4>I want to see where it goes from there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From there,</v>

730
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:35.090
<v Speaker 4>have a dude works for like four minutes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and finally gets out of the ground.</v>

731
00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:40.180
<v Speaker 4>Or if a guy gets taken out immediately </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a dude finally gets up and there's </v>

732
00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:43.871
<v Speaker 4>only 20 seconds left and then the dude </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts bombing on him and then the guy </v>

733
00:34:43.871 --> 00:34:46.781
<v Speaker 4>who took him down as tired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to see what the fuck is </v>

734
00:34:46.781 --> 00:34:46.781
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep going.</v>

735
00:34:46.781 --> 00:34:46.781
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

736
00:34:46.781 --> 00:34:48.020
<v Speaker 4>that's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the best guys would want.</v>

737
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:53.021
<v Speaker 4>The best guys would want to see that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would want to see a big ass 10 </v>

738
00:34:53.021 --> 00:34:56.321
<v Speaker 4>minute round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he put it in the interest of the </v>

739
00:34:56.321 --> 00:34:59.171
<v Speaker 4>safety of the fighters though they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to take less damage than a five </v>

740
00:34:59.171 --> 00:34:59.171
<v Speaker 4>minute round.</v>

741
00:34:59.171 --> 00:35:02.200
<v Speaker 4>That's why I accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I accepted unified rules because if you </v>

742
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.721
<v Speaker 4>look at it like in terms of like what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going to be the most palatable </v>

743
00:35:04.721 --> 00:35:06.350
<v Speaker 4>for the American people for the American</v>
<v Speaker 4>public.</v>

744
00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:11.351
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the most palatable five minute </v>

745
00:35:11.351 --> 00:35:11.351
<v Speaker 4>rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five rounds for championship fights.</v>

746
00:35:11.351 --> 00:35:15.491
<v Speaker 4>I totally agree with all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing sometimes I think that I </v>

747
00:35:15.491 --> 00:35:17.540
<v Speaker 4>would substitute knees on the ground for</v>
<v Speaker 4>elbows,</v>

748
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:22.780
<v Speaker 4>I think needs from that position when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're holding onto a guy and you can </v>

749
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:23.810
<v Speaker 4>name and the face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>elbows on the ground,</v>

750
00:35:23.811 --> 00:35:27.680
<v Speaker 4>cut that shit out to dudes and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 4>they fuck up fights,</v>

751
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

752
00:35:28.211 --> 00:35:28.720
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

753
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:33.790
<v Speaker 4>they'll end a fight early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was like a really good fight and </v>

754
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:33.790
<v Speaker 4>it's because of a cut and they usually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't happen,</v>

755
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.380
<v Speaker 4>but occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

756
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:37.070
<v Speaker 4>the UFC is so much better about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>than</v>

757
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:38.860
<v Speaker 4>boxing the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any,</v>

758
00:35:38.861 --> 00:35:41.430
<v Speaker 4>any kind of a bad cut and they'll stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fight like right away,</v>

759
00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.690
<v Speaker 4>UFC lit Stephan struve fight and he had </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a hatchet wound in his head.</v>

760
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:51.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was a giant cut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a giant cut and then led the </v>

761
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:54.981
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go and eventually got the dude down and </v>

762
00:35:54.981 --> 00:35:54.981
<v Speaker 4>choked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was an incredible fight.</v>

763
00:35:54.981 --> 00:35:57.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was busted wide open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>covered with blood.</v>

764
00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.670
<v Speaker 4>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And after it was over,</v>

765
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.620
<v Speaker 4>the guy was so dizzy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had lost so much blood,</v>

766
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.070
<v Speaker 4>he could barely talk to me and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to him after the fight.</v>

767
00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:10.120
<v Speaker 4>It was incredible though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would never let that happen in a </v>

768
00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.291
<v Speaker 4>boxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was kind of crazy that that </v>

769
00:36:12.291 --> 00:36:16.401
<v Speaker 4>fight took place in Germany because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germans were kind of reluctant to have </v>

770
00:36:16.501 --> 00:36:17.160
<v Speaker 4>the UFC there.</v>

771
00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.550
<v Speaker 4>And then I was like thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

772
00:36:18.551 --> 00:36:21.330
<v Speaker 4>this is one of the bloodiest fights ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

773
00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:28.770
<v Speaker 4>this is where it's going to take place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that place where they were </v>

774
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:28.770
<v Speaker 4>apprehensive about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

775
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.370
<v Speaker 4>apparently a bunch of German dudes came </v>
<v Speaker 4>down to see the UFC.</v>

776
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.430
<v Speaker 4>And I'm in Vegas and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't like it.</v>

777
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.310
<v Speaker 4>They thought it was horrific and </v>
<v Speaker 4>violent.</v>

778
00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.860
<v Speaker 4>What's kind of like pink spinning with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the water?</v>

779
00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.940
<v Speaker 4>You see that on the grammy's that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that girl is so talented.</v>

780
00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:48.090
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty amazing though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's very talented and she something </v>

781
00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:48.090
<v Speaker 4>about her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her,</v>

782
00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:52.690
<v Speaker 4>her performance charisma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when she walks on stage it's like </v>

783
00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:53.950
<v Speaker 4>you have to like step back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

784
00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.570
<v Speaker 4>she's got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it is,</v>

785
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 4>she's got it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's hot.</v>

786
00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:58.420
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>

787
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:04.260
<v Speaker 4>there's something about just the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that she just walks on stage and sings </v>

788
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.570
<v Speaker 4>so confidently and so commonly like her </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy.</v>

789
00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.600
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's a girl that's like born</v>
<v Speaker 4>to perform.</v>

790
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:13.240
<v Speaker 4>That bitch can perform her fucking ass </v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

791
00:37:13.241 --> 00:37:15.220
<v Speaker 4>And when and then when she goes up in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the air,</v>

792
00:37:15.221 --> 00:37:20.221
<v Speaker 4>you're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well the other ones are going to do </v>

<v Speaker 4>She ain't gonna do shit.</v>

794
00:37:20.221 --> 00:37:21.160
<v Speaker 4>She's just kinda like get lifted up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

795
00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:26.220

<v Speaker 4>looking in this half naked outfit and </v>

796
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.330
<v Speaker 4>she dumped in one arm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's spinning around and then she turns</v>

797
00:37:28.331 --> 00:37:28.610
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

798
00:37:28.611 --> 00:37:32.170
<v Speaker 4>she spinning with her head down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's singing at the same time.</v>

799

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:17.250

<v Speaker 4>I think it's really hard to keep a </v>

833
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:17.250
<v Speaker 4>musical band together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.320
<v Speaker 4>I know Eddie has a hard time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like keeping,</v>

835
00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:25.350
<v Speaker 4>like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does a bunch of different projects </v>

836
00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.421
<v Speaker 4>all at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it doesn't ever has to rely on any </v>

837
00:39:27.421 --> 00:39:27.421
<v Speaker 4>one person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

838
00:39:27.421 --> 00:39:31.710
<v Speaker 4>And he runs all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be super hard to keep a </v>

839
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:34.000
<v Speaker 4>bunch of people who are like wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be stars and you know,</v>

840
00:39:34.001 --> 00:39:39.001
<v Speaker 4>wanting to just can't wait to get rich </v>
<v Speaker 4>and get nutty and fucking lose their </v>

841
00:39:39.001 --> 00:39:40.420
<v Speaker 4>marbles and think that they're the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason why this bands there in the first</v>

842
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:42.730
<v Speaker 4>place and how many arguments like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen in bands,</v>

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all nuts.</v>

<v Speaker 4>outfit.</v>

845
00:39:46.511 --> 00:39:48.940
<v Speaker 4>So very rare that a band like can </v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

846

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>good music so hard.</v>

851
00:40:06.211 --> 00:40:09.690

<v Speaker 4>for most of all the rare few can just </v>

<v Speaker 4>it's not under a recall.</v>

1056
00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.710
<v Speaker 4>This is software.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a bad accelerator pedal.</v>

1057
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:26.630
<v Speaker 4>It's very scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1058
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:32.530
<v Speaker 4>Toyota has had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Toyota has this accelerator problem </v>

1059
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:36.161
<v Speaker 4>we've all heard about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have many models of Prius that got </v>

1060
00:49:36.161 --> 00:49:40.541
<v Speaker 4>recalled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have a new model of didn't get </v>

1061
00:49:40.541 --> 00:49:42.821
<v Speaker 4>recalled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This model has an accelerator that goes </v>

1062
00:49:42.821 --> 00:49:45.371
<v Speaker 4>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but only under certain conditions have </v>

1063
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:47.891
<v Speaker 4>cruise control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I can repeat it over and over again </v>

1064
00:49:47.891 --> 00:49:47.891
<v Speaker 4>safely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1065
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:54.790
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's the greatest thing about </v>

1066
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:57.491
<v Speaker 4>old cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Old Cars are fucking terrible to drive </v>

1067
00:49:57.491 --> 00:49:57.491
<v Speaker 4>like my old 1970 Barracuda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1068
00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:02.650
<v Speaker 4>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something about old cars where </v>

1069
00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:05.531
<v Speaker 4>there's no computer running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing was like a direct experience </v>

1070
00:50:05.531 --> 00:50:06.650
<v Speaker 4>between you and the engine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1071
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:09.620
<v Speaker 4>Like those old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the old sound of the engine,</v>

1072
00:50:09.621 --> 00:50:11.420
<v Speaker 4>everything about it connected to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>

1073
00:50:11.421 --> 00:50:14.440
<v Speaker 4>It was all connected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There ain't no fucking computer is going</v>

1074
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:16.040
<v Speaker 4>to save you bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a car.</v>

1075
00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:18.440
<v Speaker 4>You better not get crazy but better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you can,</v>

1076
00:50:18.441 --> 00:50:23.441
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take that turn to too quick and you </v>

1077
00:50:23.441 --> 00:50:25.871
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wheels will lock up on the outside </v>

1078
00:50:25.871 --> 00:50:25.871
<v Speaker 4>so you'll be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No you're fuck man.</v>

1079
00:50:25.871 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 4>That's not gonna save you one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>many reasons</v>

1080
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.330
<v Speaker 1>not to buy a prius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1081
00:50:29.331 --> 00:50:31.120
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1082
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a prius that they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did this because a priest is a </v>

1083
00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:36.280
<v Speaker 1>hybrid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1084
00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.720
<v Speaker 1>There was a prius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they took a prius.</v>

1086
00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.000
<v Speaker 1>This is what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This on top gear.</v>

1087
00:50:41.001 --> 00:50:44.690
<v Speaker 1>That fucking awesome car show on the BBC</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't seen it.</v>

1088
00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.860
<v Speaker 1>So you can get it on BBC on like do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get direct TV?</v>

1089
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:52.870
<v Speaker 1>They have like BBC America and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an awesome car show and they did </v>

1090
00:50:52.881 --> 00:50:56.900
<v Speaker 1>this test with a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>took a prius and they ran around a track</v>

1091
00:50:56.901 --> 00:51:01.901
<v Speaker 1>as fast as it could go as fast as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could get it to go around the track and </v>

1092
00:51:01.901 --> 00:51:05.921
<v Speaker 1>they followed it with a bmw m three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has a big Vat and they found out </v>

1093
00:51:05.921 --> 00:51:10.571
<v Speaker 1>that all the BMW,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all BMW had to do was to stay at the </v>

1094
00:51:10.571 --> 00:51:10.640
<v Speaker 1>same pace as the Prius.</v>

1095
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Just keep up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it had to do.</v>

1096
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Well when they measure the miles per </v>
<v Speaker 1>gallon,</v>

1097
00:51:14.631 --> 00:51:17.240
<v Speaker 1>the BMW got more miles per gallon in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prius.</v>

1098
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:21.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you drive it fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's a piece of shit.</v>

1099
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your reasoning.</v>

1100
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:25.110
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the long run,</v>

1101
00:51:25.111 --> 00:51:30.111
<v Speaker 1>the price also costs so much more money </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll be spinning on the car that </v>

1102
00:51:30.111 --> 00:51:33.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not even worth the money you save </v>
<v Speaker 1>on their gross look into.</v>

1103
00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:38.560
<v Speaker 1>And it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they said it was like the </v>

1104
00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.631
<v Speaker 1>difference between like the Prius was </v>
<v Speaker 1>only getting like 14 miles to the </v>

1105
00:51:40.631 --> 00:51:41.210
<v Speaker 1>gallon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The BMW got like 17 or 18.</v>

1106
00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:41.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're stoned.</v>

1126
00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this ipad manufacturer that is going </v>

<v Speaker 3>Just got a shipment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every placement bezels for the IPAD.</v>

1129
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:52.280
<v Speaker 3>So if he ever has to replace that and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a spot for a camera in it and that </v>

1130
00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.200
<v Speaker 3>the software has caused to a camera and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all those other things.</v>

1131
00:52:55.201 --> 00:53:00.201
<v Speaker 3>So the IPAD,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might not even be done with the </v>

1132
00:53:00.201 --> 00:53:00.201
<v Speaker 3>Ipad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's going to come in with a camera</v>

1133
00:53:00.201 --> 00:53:01.980
<v Speaker 3>and all these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably that's what it looks like.</v>

1134
00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:07.390
<v Speaker 1>So this is just the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first one is just this plane.</v>

1135
00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.430
<v Speaker 1>The first one was not finished as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are thinking like it was</v>

1136
00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:12.940
<v Speaker 1>like a prototype because that's why it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>two months away and stuff.</v>

1137
00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:16.570
<v Speaker 1>They were still really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all,</v>

1138
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:21.600
<v Speaker 1>this sounds like some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies type marketing shit to </v>

1139
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.510
<v Speaker 1>probably think probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you do that though?</v>

1140
00:53:22.511 --> 00:53:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Why would you release a crappy one or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a crappy ones?</v>

1141
00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:27.240
<v Speaker 1>You were going to be talking about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>every time there's a new rumor,</v>

1142
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1143
00:53:27.811 --> 00:53:32.811
<v Speaker 1>oh now it has a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe they'll hold off for a few </v>

1144
00:53:32.811 --> 00:53:33.360
<v Speaker 1>months and then come up with a version </v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

1145
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if there are any doing anything like</v>

1146
00:53:36.121 --> 00:53:41.121
<v Speaker 1>the iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably once a year down man.</v>

1147
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:46.370
<v Speaker 1>They got people that bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple has more people that are bitches </v>

1148
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:49.361

1150
00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:55.890

<v Speaker 1>thinking how I'm a little bit of an </v>

1151
00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:55.890
<v Speaker 1>apple bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be honest with you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They got me a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get all fucking hyped up when I fly </v>

<v Speaker 4>No idea what I was doing my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a hard time getting laid.</v>

1217

<v Speaker 4>hour and a half away and I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the phone and we're talking dirty and</v>

00:57:15.631 --> 00:57:19.320
<v Speaker 4>she wanted me to drive up to visit her </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was such a fucking long drive and</v>

1220
00:57:19.321 --> 00:57:24.321
<v Speaker 4>it was the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was snowing out and I'm an idiot and </v>

1221
00:57:24.321 --> 00:57:24.321
<v Speaker 4>I went out there and</v>

1222
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:25.790
<v Speaker 4>completely forgot what I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

<v Speaker 4>So we're sitting there and we're sitting</v>

1225
00:57:32.391 --> 00:57:36.680
<v Speaker 4>there in front of the television in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>morning and she goes to the bathroom and</v>

1226
00:57:36.681 --> 00:57:39.860
<v Speaker 4>I turned on the TV and right when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>turned the TV it fucking exploded.</v>

1227
00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:41.750
<v Speaker 4>It was that second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1228
00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:44.150
<v Speaker 4>Right when I turned on the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were showing it and I don't know if</v>

1229
00:57:44.151 --> 00:57:45.980
<v Speaker 4>it was a replay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it was.</v>

1230
00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:51.210
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I remember like very clearly at the </v>

1231
00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:52.790
<v Speaker 4>moment I turned on the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the image of the thing exploding,</v>

1232
00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:57.820
<v Speaker 4>what's happening right there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you were seeing spiral and you're </v>

1233
00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:57.820
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is that?</v>

<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

00:57:58.521 --> 00:58:00.560
<v Speaker 4>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on over there?</v>

1236
00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:06.890
<v Speaker 4>And then people started talking about it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it took a while before they </v>

1237
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:07.620
<v Speaker 4>just flat out admitted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1238
00:58:07.621 --> 00:58:09.510
<v Speaker 4>everybody's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that shit just blew up.</v>

1239
00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:13.260
<v Speaker 4>Like I think for awhile they were like </v>
<v Speaker 4>wondering whether or not the people that</v>

1240
00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:16.110
<v Speaker 4>survived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the capsule it made it to the ground,</v>

1241
00:58:16.111 --> 00:58:17.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're looking for parents,</v>

1242
00:58:17.161 --> 00:58:22.161
<v Speaker 4>shoots and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all sorts of different kinds of </v>

1243
00:58:22.161 --> 00:58:22.161
<v Speaker 4>reports.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I remember thinking,</v>

1244
00:58:22.161 --> 00:58:25.341
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those people just got shot through the </v>

<v Speaker 4>What a crazy way to go.</v>

1246
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.860
<v Speaker 4>What a crazy thing to do.</v>

1247
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so weird.</v>

1248
00:58:32.651 --> 00:58:37.651
<v Speaker 3>When I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw it with a bunch of people and we </v>

1249
00:58:37.651 --> 00:58:40.531
<v Speaker 3>all had to watch tv because we were in </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle school and it happened and to </v>

1250
00:58:40.531 --> 00:58:41.380

<v Speaker 3>And the teachers were all freaking </v>

1252

<v Speaker 3>because you couldn't like just text your</v>
<v Speaker 3>mom like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>do you know what happened?</v>

1254

<v Speaker 3>no communication with friends and family</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you call people and if you've got a </v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1262
00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:15.210
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about having a second </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you were.</v>

1263
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:20.270
<v Speaker 3>When I was a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have sex in public places </v>

1264
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.270
<v Speaker 3>because I went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't allowed to have sex at home,</v>

1265
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:23.090
<v Speaker 3>so I'd go to like behind little Caesar's</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fuck behind beside the dumpster.</v>

1266
00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.580
<v Speaker 3>And one time this guy came out and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like shocked.</v>

1267

<v Speaker 1>They're a bunch of old people living </v>

1495
01:09:25.951 --> 01:09:26.830
<v Speaker 1>with other old people that are dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a fun environment.</v>

1496
01:09:26.831 --> 01:09:31.831
<v Speaker 1>It just goes back to that whole weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about how animals might have </v>

1497
01:09:31.831 --> 01:09:33.730
<v Speaker 1>sensors that we don't even know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and then when that video of the dog</v>

1498
01:09:33.731 --> 01:09:38.731
<v Speaker 1>in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be or it might be these people </v>

1499
01:09:38.731 --> 01:09:40.671
<v Speaker 1>are hanging on by a thread so thin that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tat hops in that last bucket that night.</v>

1500
01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's possible too,</v>

1501
01:09:43.721 --> 01:09:45.430
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotTa admit it's possible.</v>

1502
01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Can you discuss vaporizers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend vaporizers.</v>

1503
01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:55.500
<v Speaker 1>The volcano is a very good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sometimes kind of a pain in the </v>

1504
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:55.870
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean at the end of the day,</v>

1505
01:09:55.871 --> 01:09:59.290
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be that guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking out of a plastic bag.</v>

1506
01:09:59.291 --> 01:10:01.400
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like a junkie move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fan.</v>

1507
01:10:01.401 --> 01:10:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like junky behavior.</v>

1508
01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Do we suck it out of a plastic bag?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something seems wrong,</v>

1509
01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.780
<v Speaker 1>but there's another vaporizer that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy.</v>

1510
01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:10.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like a glass pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1511
01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:15.080
<v Speaker 1>like a glass lip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sort of like a bond with a tube </v>

1512
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:15.670
<v Speaker 1>attached to it and you stick it on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and yeah.</v>

1513
01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:16.960
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool one.</v>

1514
01:10:17.010 --> 01:10:18.730
<v Speaker 1>You know what I like about that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need,</v>

1515
01:10:18.731 --> 01:10:21.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't need like five friends around </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to get high.</v>

1516
01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:22.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when that bag fills up,</v>

1517
01:10:22.721 --> 01:10:24.110
<v Speaker 1>you don't know when to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1518
01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:26.860
<v Speaker 1>You keep sucking it in and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>too high and then you're like,</v>

1519
01:10:26.861 --> 01:10:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I can't even think that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the other vaporizer.</v>

1520
01:10:29.501 --> 01:10:31.840
<v Speaker 1>You can take one hit and Bam and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what's up?</v>

1521
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:34.690
<v Speaker 1>I liked that one better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you got a party,</v>

1522
01:10:34.691 --> 01:10:37.700
<v Speaker 1>you've got a bunch of people hanging </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and you're all medical patients.</v>

1523
01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Many bongs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1524
01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Have you got a bunch of people around </v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

1525
01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.520
<v Speaker 1>The volcanoes to shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's perfect because for all being </v>

1526
01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:47.350
<v Speaker 1>junkies together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1527
01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.500
<v Speaker 1>I suck out of this plastic bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1528
01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1529
01:10:51.491 --> 01:10:53.210
<v Speaker 1>There's some weird about sucking out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a plastic bag.</v>

1530
01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

1531
01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a joint.</v>

1532
01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Just give me a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1533
01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of the joint too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1534
01:10:57.641 --> 01:10:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Well I joined because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1535
01:10:59.831 --> 01:11:01.390
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have to keep lighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1536
01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:03.700
<v Speaker 1>And I hated the taste of lighter fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1537
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:08.790
<v Speaker 1>that shit's nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a glass pipe and you </v>

1538
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.790
<v Speaker 1>keep tasting that lighter fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1539
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:10.390
<v Speaker 1>That shit ain't good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when it's like a Zippo.</v>

1540
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:11.500
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

1541
01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:13.030
<v Speaker 1>You got that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ain't good for you man.</v>

1542
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked</v>

1543
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.930
<v Speaker 4>joints.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm converted joints,</v>

1544
01:11:15.931 --> 01:11:18.000
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked that shit with a match,</v>

1545
01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:23.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I can or if I'm doing it with a </v>

1546
01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.371
<v Speaker 4>lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd get it real quick and I'll let it </v>

1547
01:11:25.371 --> 01:11:25.371
<v Speaker 4>sit for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1548
01:11:25.371 --> 01:11:26.010
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a residue man that gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

1549
01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.920
<v Speaker 4>on the weed with those lighters and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that Shit's bad for you.</v>

1550
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:32.190
<v Speaker 4>It's probably worse for you than smoking</v>
<v Speaker 4>for some people.</v>

1551
01:11:32.230 --> 01:11:34.410
<v Speaker 4>Like for your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be very unhealthy man.</v>

1552
01:11:34.411 --> 01:11:36.930
<v Speaker 4>It's like a toxic fume you're inhaling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1553
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:38.730
<v Speaker 4>that ain't good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1554
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:40.120
<v Speaker 4>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no studies done.</v>

1555
01:11:40.121 --> 01:11:42.570
<v Speaker 4>And you know how many times you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking suck off,</v>

1556
01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:46.230
<v Speaker 4>lighter fluid and breathed into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>lungs and not do permanent damage,</v>

1557
01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:51.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>joint bitches matches and joint stop </v>

1558
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:55.101
<v Speaker 4>fucking around or go with vaporizer if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what the vaporizer is.</v>

1559
01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:56.820
<v Speaker 4>The beautiful thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there's no fire,</v>

1560
01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.690
<v Speaker 4>there's no smoke.</v>

1561
01:11:57.690 --> 01:11:59.030
<v Speaker 4>It's like a mixed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what it is,</v>

1562
01:11:59.031 --> 01:12:03.180
<v Speaker 4>is you pack the product,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the memorable and put into,</v>

1563
01:12:03.181 --> 01:12:08.181
<v Speaker 4>into this little filtered area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you connect that to this </v>

1564
01:12:08.181 --> 01:12:11.091
<v Speaker 4>machine and then it heats up and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you inhale and it's literally like </v>

1565
01:12:11.091 --> 01:12:13.380
<v Speaker 4>missed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that missed is just the pure thc.</v>

1566
01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:16.290
<v Speaker 4>It's a very heady experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very,</v>

1567
01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:21.291
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you'll come up with some of your </v>

1568
01:12:21.291 --> 01:12:21.291
<v Speaker 4>craziest thoughts on vaporized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd,</v>

1569
01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:24.960
<v Speaker 4>except the only thing crazier is eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you eat it.</v>

1570
01:12:24.961 --> 01:12:27.330
<v Speaker 4>That's the craziest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like that anymore.</v>

1571
01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.130
<v Speaker 4>Eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets scary.</v>

1572
01:12:29.131 --> 01:12:31.030
<v Speaker 4>We've talked about that overheard of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutmeg.</v>

1573
01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.360
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your Mama.</v>

1574
01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:35.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh eight,</v>

1575
01:12:35.581 --> 01:12:36.030
<v Speaker 4>nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three.</v>

1576
01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1577
01:12:37.531 --> 01:12:42.531
<v Speaker 4>I heard you can get high off nutmeg </v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another one of the guys are </v>

1578
01:12:42.531 --> 01:12:43.080
<v Speaker 4>message board hr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he did it.</v>

1579
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:45.930
<v Speaker 4>He tried it and documented it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said it was really tripping.</v>

1580
01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.670
<v Speaker 4>It lasted a long time and it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>gross.</v>

1581
01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.800
<v Speaker 4>I think anything that's really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>people would be doing it left and right.</v>

1582
01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.420
<v Speaker 4>And I think there's plenty of shit to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get high on.</v>

1583
01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't.</v>

1584
01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:57.180
<v Speaker 4>But the one thing that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting,</v>

1585
01:12:57.181 --> 01:13:02.181
<v Speaker 4>they came up with a new marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a synthetic marijuana and it gives </v>

1586
01:13:02.181 --> 01:13:02.181
<v Speaker 4>you like the same effects as regular </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana,</v>

1587
01:13:02.181 --> 01:13:04.180
<v Speaker 4>but you don't test positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1588
01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:09.320
<v Speaker 4>And they're trying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're scrambling right now to make it </v>

1589
01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:09.540
<v Speaker 4>illegal and they call it two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called k named after that mountain.</v>

1590
01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:11.430
<v Speaker 4>And it's a synthetic version of </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana.</v>

1591
01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:13.440
<v Speaker 4>So if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a cop,</v>

1592
01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.440
<v Speaker 4>if you have a government job and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to piss tests all the time,</v>

1593
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:17.050
<v Speaker 4>you could smoke.</v>

1594
01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.510

<v Speaker 1>And it was scary when we be keeping pots</v>

1597

<v Speaker 1>You kind of have to get like a bully,</v>

1603
01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:46.090
<v Speaker 1>like stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of guys so became</v>

1604
01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:51.090

<v Speaker 4>because it's good money and they're </v>

1614
01:14:10.241 --> 01:14:15.241
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can get into Boston police </v>

1615
01:14:15.241 --> 01:14:15.241
<v Speaker 4>department</v>

1619
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.340
<v Speaker 1>some detail work on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1620
01:14:18.341 --> 01:14:20.320

<v Speaker 1>You pick up big money,</v>

1621
01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.800
<v Speaker 4>no guardian places and shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's a good job,</v>

1622
01:14:23.801 --> 01:14:26.200
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not all Douche bags,</v>

1623
01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:32.230
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of douchebags that </v>
<v Speaker 1>work for better cops that if they were </v>

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.980
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to do it,</v>

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:45.040
<v Speaker 1>they wanted a male out of the weekend,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's so fucking good.</v>

1651
01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.240
<v Speaker 4>It's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you could take a parody like </v>

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.291
<v Speaker 4>airplane and they'll be funny but </v>

<v Speaker 4>that's supposed to be good but isn't an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny on accident.</v>

1654
01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:59.000

<v Speaker 1>condoms to the Howard.</v>

1678
01:16:54.901 --> 01:16:57.660
<v Speaker 1>The duck was cool when I was a kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was a duck,</v>

1679
01:16:57.661 --> 01:16:59.610
<v Speaker 1>but he was an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would.</v>

1695
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:47.770
<v Speaker 4>but there's a certain amount of movies </v>

<v Speaker 4>You know what's,</v>

1721
01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:57.080
<v Speaker 4>what's the reason for that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not cold in Canada there's a </v>

1722
01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:57.080
<v Speaker 4>tournament is more like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1723
01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.780
<v Speaker 4>George St Pierre type build.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you like to.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's how the gay more like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1725
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:06.440
<v Speaker 4>James Irvin's build that would be a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>corner,</v>

1726
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:09.980
<v Speaker 4>like thick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it looks like an athlete,</v>

1727
01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a Herschel Walker.</v>

1728
01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:14.720
<v Speaker 4>Herschel Walker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that motherfucker?</v>

1729
01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:19.840
<v Speaker 4>Forty seven years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude has his first MMA fight beat to </v>

1730
01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:19.840
<v Speaker 4>shit ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm young boy.</v>

1731
01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.230
<v Speaker 4>Hershel Walker's 40 fucking seven dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he looks like a Goliath.</v>

1732
01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:29.210
<v Speaker 4>He's still just swole as fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>chiseled and just cut and dudes down.</v>

1733
01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:31.190
<v Speaker 4>That guy's a suit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a super athlete.</v>

1734
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:36.370
<v Speaker 4>They should be saving his DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many kids that guys </v>

1735
01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:36.370
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many kids do you have?</v>

1736
01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:38.060
<v Speaker 4>Kids have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he doesn't have kids they need to get</v>

1737
01:19:38.061 --> 01:19:41.180
<v Speaker 4>the guy shoots him loads into some cops </v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1738
01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.260
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't you think?</v>

1739
01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:47.500
<v Speaker 4>Get Him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You imagine if you got Herschel Walker </v>

1740
01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.530
<v Speaker 4>and one of the Williams sisters and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1741
01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:51.970
<v Speaker 4>and they fell in love and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1742
01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:57.010
<v Speaker 4>No disrespect to her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I believe he's married and I don't </v>

1743
01:19:57.010 --> 01:19:57.010
<v Speaker 4>know if the Williams sisters are </v>
<v Speaker 4>married.</v>

1744
01:19:57.010 --> 01:20:00.791
<v Speaker 4>So let's just hypothetically make that </v>
<v Speaker 4>and not in the real world is the fake </v>

1745
01:20:00.791 --> 01:20:00.791
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody got upset,</v>

1746
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:01.850
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1747
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:04.970
<v Speaker 4>you get to super athletes like that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>put their genetics together.</v>

1748
01:20:04.971 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 4>It'd be incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Incredible.</v>

1749
01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:12.210
<v Speaker 4>Like you ever know who Lucy a riker is </v>
<v Speaker 4>lucy a rikers,</v>

1750
01:20:12.211 --> 01:20:17.211
<v Speaker 4>a female boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This chick could punch like harder than </v>

1751
01:20:17.211 --> 01:20:17.211
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was incredible.</v>

1752
01:20:17.211 --> 01:20:22.160
<v Speaker 4>She was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the other female boxers avoided the </v>

1753
01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:22.560
<v Speaker 4>fuck out of her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is back in the Tonya harding days.</v>

1754
01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:26.220
<v Speaker 4>This chip was like leaps and bounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>above other female boxers.</v>

1755
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:28.080
<v Speaker 4>She was just a freak athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1756
01:20:28.150 --> 01:20:30.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what nationality she </v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

1757
01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:34.330
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I want to say something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something Latin American or so,</v>

1758
01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:39.400
<v Speaker 4>but she was from Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't remember what her </v>

1759
01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:41.661
<v Speaker 4>nationality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm totally guessing she was a a dark </v>

1760
01:20:41.661 --> 01:20:44.031
<v Speaker 4>skinned chick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but God damn it was just this fucking </v>

1761
01:20:44.031 --> 01:20:44.031
<v Speaker 4>freak athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just beat the fuck out of church.</v>

1762
01:20:44.031 --> 01:20:46.170
<v Speaker 4>She even fought dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She got flatline though.</v>

1763
01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.050
<v Speaker 4>She fought a dude and the dude </v>
<v Speaker 4>connected.</v>

1764
01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:53.060
<v Speaker 4>Our John just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She went in [inaudible] 99 and it was </v>

1765
01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:53.060
<v Speaker 4>weird to see him because she was at </v>
<v Speaker 4>attacking.</v>

1766
01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:57.520
<v Speaker 4>She was trying to cut this dude down and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do just bang and she just flatline,</v>

1767
01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:02.660
<v Speaker 4>stiffened up and face planted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it looked like before the flat line,</v>

1768
01:21:02.731 --> 01:21:04.350
<v Speaker 4>like she was getting the best of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

1769
01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:08.160
<v Speaker 4>The dude just hit too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a thing about bone structure.</v>

1770
01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:08.910
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1771
01:21:08.911 --> 01:21:10.140
<v Speaker 4>like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things,</v>

1772
01:21:10.141 --> 01:21:11.670
<v Speaker 4>if you meet someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meet a guy like this,</v>

1773
01:21:11.671 --> 01:21:14.460
<v Speaker 4>like a big puncher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I met Michael Moore once.</v>

1774
01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:18.180
<v Speaker 4>Michael Moore was the boxing heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 4>champion of the world.</v>

1775
01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:19.500
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was uh,</v>

1776
01:21:19.501 --> 01:21:21.240
<v Speaker 4>the light heavyweight champion at one </v>
<v Speaker 4>time too,</v>

1777
01:21:21.241 --> 01:21:23.670
<v Speaker 4>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was bad ass as a light heavyweight.</v>

1778
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:26.040
<v Speaker 4>I just couldn't keep cutting the way he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was too big,</v>

1779
01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:27.630
<v Speaker 4>but it was like one of the best light </v>
<v Speaker 4>heavyweights ever.</v>

1780
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:30.800
<v Speaker 4>But he's got like a frame,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1781
01:21:30.801 --> 01:21:32.370
<v Speaker 4>you meet that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like frame.</v>

1782
01:21:32.371 --> 01:21:33.500
<v Speaker 4>It's heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1783
01:21:33.501 --> 01:21:38.501
<v Speaker 4>his fists are heavy shoulders heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the type of dude when he hits </v>

1784
01:21:38.501 --> 01:21:38.501
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

1785
01:21:38.501 --> 01:21:40.560
<v Speaker 4>there's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so much to him,</v>

1786
01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:42.270
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a check.</v>

1787
01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:47.330
<v Speaker 4>Even if a chicken is really talented,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimately they're not built the same </v>

1788
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.790
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1789
01:21:47.791 --> 01:21:50.610
<v Speaker 4>so it just makes you think like a chick </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

1790
01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:51.990
<v Speaker 4>like a Lucier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weicker,</v>

1791
01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:57.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>matching her up with like an Anderson </v>

1792
01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:57.200
<v Speaker 4>Silva,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some other freak athlete,</v>

1793
01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn,</v>

1794
01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:01.500
<v Speaker 4>I sound like some sort of a genetic </v>
<v Speaker 4>engineer.</v>

1795
01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:05.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to make future warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to happen.</v>

1796
01:22:05.810 --> 01:22:07.170
<v Speaker 4>It is going to kind of be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1797
01:22:07.171 --> 01:22:12.171
<v Speaker 4>you know what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to happen in a laboratory </v>

1798
01:22:12.171 --> 01:22:12.171
<v Speaker 4>before it's going to happen with two </v>
<v Speaker 4>people having sex.</v>

1799
01:22:12.171 --> 01:22:15.850
<v Speaker 4>Sex is not going to happen the old </v>
<v Speaker 4>fashioned way with the gladiator meets </v>

1800
01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:15.850
<v Speaker 4>the warrior princess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not gonna happen like that.</v>

1801
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:18.300
<v Speaker 4>The way it's going to happen now is you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know you're going to,</v>

1802
01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:21.150
<v Speaker 4>someone's going to take the attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get some fat,</v>

<v Speaker 4>dumpy dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know who's,</v>

1804
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:25.440

<v Speaker 4>but he's got a lot of money because he's</v>

1805
01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:30.441
<v Speaker 4>crazy and he's invested all of his time </v>
<v Speaker 4>to learning the stock market and </v>

1806
01:22:30.441 --> 01:22:33.801
<v Speaker 4>swindling people and he's going to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>children that are like psychotic warrior</v>

1807
01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:38.070
<v Speaker 4>genius offspring because he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like manipulate all his shitty genes and</v>

1808
01:22:38.071 --> 01:22:43.071
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna create some super offspring </v>
<v Speaker 4>and wanting to fucking his young wife </v>

1809
01:22:43.071 --> 01:22:43.920
<v Speaker 4>and killing him coming in.</v>

1810
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:46.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brock Lesnar is Kona.</v>

1811
01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.090
<v Speaker 4>That would be a real conan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1812
01:22:48.091 --> 01:22:53.091
<v Speaker 4>that's a real cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's exactly what I'm talking </v>

1813
01:22:53.091 --> 01:22:54.831
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Brock Lesner is like somebody put </v>

1814
01:22:54.831 --> 01:22:54.831
<v Speaker 4>that up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoever put that up there,</v>

1815
01:22:54.831 --> 01:22:56.550
<v Speaker 4>we lost her money in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1816
01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:57.390
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Money.</v>

1817
01:22:57.391 --> 01:22:58.950
<v Speaker 4>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's you're correct sir.</v>

1818
01:22:58.951 --> 01:23:00.570
<v Speaker 4>That's the perfect bill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you talking about.</v>

1819
01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:03.600
<v Speaker 4>Just a big giant motherfucker doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>look like a bodybuilder.</v>

1820
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:05.100
<v Speaker 4>Looks like a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll smash you.</v>

1821
01:23:05.290 --> 01:23:06.880
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the best fighters.</v>

1822
01:23:07.490 --> 01:23:10.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most of them don't.</v>

1823
01:23:10.451 --> 01:23:12.490
<v Speaker 4>Look that ripped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1824
01:23:12.491 --> 01:23:14.140
<v Speaker 4>I think when you accept George St </v>
<v Speaker 4>Pierre,</v>

1825
01:23:14.141 --> 01:23:16.000
<v Speaker 4>he's fucking chiseled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like Bj,</v>

1826
01:23:16.001 --> 01:23:20.020
<v Speaker 4>when he is in as best shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he still has like a good layer of fat on</v>

1827
01:23:20.021 --> 01:23:22.360
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Bj I think also has thick skin too.</v>

1828
01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:25.270
<v Speaker 4>I think that's one of the reasons why Bj</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't cut that easy.</v>

1829
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:26.230
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody,</v>

1830
01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:31.500
<v Speaker 4>nobody's got a tougher facing in Bj,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bj and will fight like a fire round </v>

1831
01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:32.830
<v Speaker 4>fucking war and commander,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were a couple of scratches,</v>

1832
01:23:32.831 --> 01:23:34.630
<v Speaker 4>like it's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1833
01:23:34.770 --> 01:23:35.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they just,</v>

1834
01:23:35.501 --> 01:23:37.210
<v Speaker 4>that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fucking awesome.</v>

1835
01:23:37.211 --> 01:23:38.290
<v Speaker 4>Which it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1836
01:23:38.291 --> 01:23:43.291
<v Speaker 4>he is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's something about that dude's </v>

1837
01:23:43.291 --> 01:23:43.291
<v Speaker 4>genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1838
01:23:43.291 --> 01:23:43.330
<v Speaker 4>everybody's there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's got different genetics.</v>

1839
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:48.750
<v Speaker 4>So that's one of the most amazing things</v>
<v Speaker 4>about life is the variation amongst </v>

1840
01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:49.660
<v Speaker 4>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1841
01:23:49.730 --> 01:23:52.030
<v Speaker 4>we vary so much more than any other </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>

1842
01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:57.240
<v Speaker 4>If you look at like the only animal that</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes close is dogs and dogs supposedly </v>

1843
01:23:57.701 --> 01:23:59.680
<v Speaker 4>are like that because we engineered </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1844
01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:04.420
<v Speaker 4>which makes you wonder what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>made so many people so different because</v>

1845
01:24:04.421 --> 01:24:06.540
<v Speaker 4>we vary so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1846
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:07.690
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that,</v>

1847
01:24:07.691 --> 01:24:08.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1848
01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:13.140
<v Speaker 4>Chinese midget could have sex with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Shaquille o'neal and make another baby </v>

1849
01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:18.300
<v Speaker 4>and that baby would look a combination </v>
<v Speaker 4>of those two and there's that much </v>

1850
01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:21.640
<v Speaker 4>variation between pygmies and women from</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iceland,</v>

1851
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:24.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in like a muscle tones,</v>

1852
01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:29.260
<v Speaker 4>ex wife Bridgette Nielsen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that big giant Icelandic Nordic look and</v>

1853
01:24:29.261 --> 01:24:30.640
<v Speaker 4>check,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1854
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:36.010
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that her and flavor flave they can have </v>

1855
01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:36.010
<v Speaker 4>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1856
01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:36.010
<v Speaker 4>and they can.</v>

1857
01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:36.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're so different.</v>

1858
01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:38.920
<v Speaker 4>There's so much diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no other animal like that except</v>

1859
01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:39.970
<v Speaker 4>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1860
01:24:39.971 --> 01:24:42.760
<v Speaker 4>rhinos that looked like rhinos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1861
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:48.270
<v Speaker 4>Some fish look different and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a small mouth bass flux or a </v>

1862
01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:49.120
<v Speaker 4>large mouth bass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get crazy to get freaky with it,</v>

1863
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:51.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you get a hybrid that's possible.</v>

1864
01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:55.540
<v Speaker 4>Tigers and lions make loggers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for the most part,</v>

1865
01:24:55.541 --> 01:24:56.950
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings are.</v>

1866
01:24:56.951 --> 01:24:59.590
<v Speaker 4>We're the most diverse world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird fucking species.</v>

1867
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:04.960
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of incredible to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you think about the fact there's so</v>

1868
01:25:04.961 --> 01:25:07.330
<v Speaker 4>many of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we think there's so many humans.</v>

1869
01:25:07.331 --> 01:25:10.450
<v Speaker 4>You would think by now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd all be a big fucking blurry mess.</v>

1870
01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:15.780
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy when you see like countries </v>
<v Speaker 4>like Asian countries where almost </v>

1871
01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:17.530
<v Speaker 4>everyone has a very similar appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1872
01:25:17.531 --> 01:25:20.140
<v Speaker 4>almost everyone has dark hair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost everyone is,</v>

1873
01:25:20.141 --> 01:25:22.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>within a certain height rates changing.</v>

1874
01:25:22.601 --> 01:25:25.030
<v Speaker 4>Now I get Japan and making big giant </v>
<v Speaker 4>dudes now.</v>

1875
01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:30.320
<v Speaker 4>Big giant athletic dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them are changing their diet </v>

1876
01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:34.171
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it has something to do with </v>

1877
01:25:34.171 --> 01:25:34.171
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you,</v>

1878
01:25:34.171 --> 01:25:34.171
<v Speaker 4>you motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of showing running here,</v>

1879
01:25:34.171 --> 01:25:35.050
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the phone rang and how dare you.</v>

1880
01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:38.140
<v Speaker 4>How dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do you do.</v>

1881
01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:42.460
<v Speaker 4>What does this kind of fish I fuck talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

1882
01:25:42.490 --> 01:25:47.490
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or I shouldn't encourage that guy's </v>

1883
01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:47.490
<v Speaker 4>pocket.</v>

1884
01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:47.740
<v Speaker 4>Not encouraging him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

1885
01:25:47.741 --> 01:25:52.741
<v Speaker 4>talk about Nibiru folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to tell you right now and the </v>

1886
01:25:54.431 --> 01:25:56.770
<v Speaker 4>bureau is not going to save you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1887
01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.060
<v Speaker 4>It's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

1888
01:25:58.370 --> 01:26:00.880
<v Speaker 4>It's a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not In the beer was a mess.</v>

1889
01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:03.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if the bureaus are true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's some.</v>

1890
01:26:03.130 --> 01:26:08.130
<v Speaker 4>This is something that we have in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>head about someone coming down and </v>

1891
01:26:08.130 --> 01:26:08.160
<v Speaker 4>fixing everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1892
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:14.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't think their shit's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're looking for daddy to come </v>

1893
01:26:14.050 --> 01:26:17.411
<v Speaker 4>down and throw down the rescue boat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>pull us out of this mess and I think </v>

1894
01:26:17.411 --> 01:26:19.340
<v Speaker 4>that's why people look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't know what Nibiru this,</v>

1895
01:26:19.341 --> 01:26:21.640
<v Speaker 4>there's people that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people that believe that there's</v>

1896
01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:25.790
<v Speaker 4>a planet that's in an elliptical orbit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and every 3000,</v>

1897
01:26:25.791 --> 01:26:30.050
<v Speaker 4>600 years it travels between Mars and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jupiter travels like very close to earth</v>

1898
01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:31.430
<v Speaker 4>or between us and Mars rather.</v>

1899
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:35.600
<v Speaker 4>And this gigantic huge planet is </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible for many,</v>

1900
01:26:35.601 --> 01:26:38.120
<v Speaker 4>many catastrophic events in Earth's </v>
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>

1901
01:26:38.121 --> 01:26:43.121
<v Speaker 4>And it's also responsible for these </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings called the Annunaki to come from </v>

1902
01:26:43.121 --> 01:26:47.921
<v Speaker 4>this planet and go on earth and create </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings with genetic engineering.</v>

1903
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:51.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's some fascinating shit.</v>

1904
01:26:51.201 --> 01:26:56.201
<v Speaker 4>It's all from the Sumerian text in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sumerian texts is the oldest known </v>

1905
01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:58.460
<v Speaker 4>written language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1906
01:26:58.490 --> 01:27:01.820
<v Speaker 4>it's called uniform and they write it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's like little weird strokes.</v>

1907
01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.440
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1908
01:27:03.441 --> 01:27:05.780
<v Speaker 4>they're one of the oldest civilizations </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we know of.</v>

1909
01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:08.060
<v Speaker 4>They had the first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1910
01:27:08.061 --> 01:27:10.040
<v Speaker 4>astronomy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first astrology,</v>

1911
01:27:10.041 --> 01:27:15.041
<v Speaker 4>including they had detailed depictions </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the solar system with planets in all </v>

1912
01:27:15.831 --> 01:27:20.831
<v Speaker 4>the right orbits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had like Mars and Pluto even had </v>

1913
01:27:20.831 --> 01:27:24.131
<v Speaker 4>pluto,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't know about Pluto until 1970 </v>

1914
01:27:24.131 --> 01:27:27.221
<v Speaker 4>and they had a drawing of Pluto that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>carved into stone or that was rolled </v>

1915
01:27:27.221 --> 01:27:29.000
<v Speaker 4>into a tablet 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>

1916
01:27:29.001 --> 01:27:29.990
<v Speaker 4>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1917
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>

1918
01:27:30.711 --> 01:27:33.900
<v Speaker 4>really crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when this guy,</v>

1919
01:27:33.901 --> 01:27:38.901
<v Speaker 4>Zacharias [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is where it gets controversial </v>

1920
01:27:38.901 --> 01:27:42.220
<v Speaker 4>because some guys who are scholars who </v>
<v Speaker 4>are a language scientists and guys who </v>

1921
01:27:43.401 --> 01:27:48.401
<v Speaker 4>are archaeologists breaking down ancient</v>
<v Speaker 4>languages and trying to figure out the </v>

1922
01:27:48.401 --> 01:27:52.811
<v Speaker 4>roots of the word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't necessarily believe that </v>

1923
01:27:52.811 --> 01:27:52.811
<v Speaker 4>citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1924
01:27:52.811 --> 01:27:56.000
<v Speaker 4>And I think that maybe he's leaped leapt</v>
<v Speaker 4>to some conclusions and his depictions.</v>

1925
01:27:56.001 --> 01:27:56.210
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1926
01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:57.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1927
01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:00.020
<v Speaker 4>I have no knowledge when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>foreign languages.</v>

1928
01:28:00.021 --> 01:28:01.340
<v Speaker 4>So I don't understand the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1929
01:28:01.341 --> 01:28:04.280
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see it back and forth and I.</v>

1930
01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.050
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>

1931
01:28:06.051 --> 01:28:07.520
<v Speaker 4>You can't prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck knows?</v>

1932
01:28:07.521 --> 01:28:11.450
<v Speaker 4>But what is interesting is that culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Samarian culture is crazy.</v>

1933
01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:12.950
<v Speaker 4>They had the first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

1934
01:28:12.951 --> 01:28:16.340
<v Speaker 4>the first mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had the first use of the wheel.</v>

1935
01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:18.650
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shut you shit off man.</v>

1936
01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:24.490
<v Speaker 4>How dare you anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck knows what's more </v>

1937
01:28:24.741 --> 01:28:28.570
<v Speaker 4>fascinating than this idea of a planet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because there's not enough evidence that</v>

1938
01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:33.580
<v Speaker 4>there is another planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is enough evidence that these </v>

1939
01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:33.580
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back then 6,000</v>

1940
01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:36.650
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had some amazing view of the world.</v>

1941
01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.270
<v Speaker 4>They had some amazing technology they </v>
<v Speaker 4>had.</v>

1942
01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:44.320
<v Speaker 4>They knew about the DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the double helix of the DNA that was </v>

1943
01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:44.480
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their signed for medicine.</v>

1944
01:28:44.481 --> 01:28:46.130
<v Speaker 4>They're signed for pharmacy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1945
01:28:46.131 --> 01:28:47.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they drew a caduceus,</v>

1946
01:28:47.541 --> 01:28:50.330
<v Speaker 4>which they still use today as a sign of </v>
<v Speaker 4>medicine.</v>

1947
01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:51.860
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1948
01:28:51.861 --> 01:28:54.430
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had all these depictions of a,</v>

1949
01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:59.560
<v Speaker 4>there was like large people with small </v>
<v Speaker 4>people in their labs and the small </v>

1950
01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:00.890
<v Speaker 4>people had tails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1951
01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that look at these goals,</v>

1952
01:29:02.251 --> 01:29:03.780
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is genetic engineering,</v>

1953
01:29:03.930 --> 01:29:06.550
<v Speaker 4>the giants they made in the monkey to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1954
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:09.930
<v Speaker 4>the DNA of the alien.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They created this hybrid.</v>

1955
01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:15.500
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they're just drawn a fucking big </v>

1956
01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.811
<v Speaker 4>guy with a monkey on his lap and make </v>
<v Speaker 4>the monkey like curious George and </v>

1957
01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:17.811
<v Speaker 4>looked like a person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1958
01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:18.510
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you,</v>

1959
01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.430
<v Speaker 4>how can you tell me that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what that doesn't mean.</v>

1960
01:29:20.431 --> 01:29:23.310
<v Speaker 4>It could be like their cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's their little character.</v>

1961
01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:28.580
<v Speaker 4>This is the crazy monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Looks like a human once asked stupid </v>

1962
01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:29.910
<v Speaker 4>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sit in my lap and that could be it.</v>

1963
01:29:29.911 --> 01:29:30.150
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1964
01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.360
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't bitch.</v>

1965
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:35.220
<v Speaker 3>You don't even pay attention to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1966
01:29:37.050 --> 01:29:39.630
<v Speaker 3>He goes so deep into stuff that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>halfway through I'm like,</v>

1967
01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:44.660
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is my brain is I can't even catch </v>

1968
01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:44.660
<v Speaker 3>up anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To be honest with you.</v>

1969
01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:45.200
<v Speaker 3>Half the time I don't know what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>started talking about.</v>

1970
01:29:45.201 --> 01:29:48.390
<v Speaker 3>By the time I get to the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I found is</v>

1971
01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.300
<v Speaker 4>that I'm a conduit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

1972
01:29:50.301 --> 01:29:55.301
<v Speaker 4>These thoughts come to me and I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>have let a girl that's sort of sounds </v>

1973
01:29:55.301 --> 01:29:56.510
<v Speaker 4>faggy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That sounds completely factored,</v>

1974
01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.050
<v Speaker 4>but that really is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1975
01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:03.760
<v Speaker 4>the better I get at comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more I feel like I'm not really </v>

1976
01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.030
<v Speaker 4>responsible for what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I got to just do the work.</v>

1977
01:30:05.031 --> 01:30:07.460
<v Speaker 4>I got to write and I got to perform </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough,</v>

1978
01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.380
<v Speaker 4>but when I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I nail it,</v>

1979
01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:11.600
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is that when I tuned back </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the frequency,</v>

1980
01:30:11.601 --> 01:30:13.130
<v Speaker 4>whenever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just ride it.</v>

1981
01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:18.450
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like the easiest thing in </v>

1982
01:30:18.450 --> 01:30:18.450
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's difficult to maintain.</v>

1983
01:30:18.450 --> 01:30:22.660
<v Speaker 4>It's you got to maintain your enthusiasm</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maintain your writing and maintain </v>

1984
01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:24.290
<v Speaker 4>your performing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you're in that groove,</v>

1985
01:30:24.291 --> 01:30:26.180
<v Speaker 4>when you lock in and it's the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>

1986
01:30:26.181 --> 01:30:26.810
<v Speaker 4>it's fun.</v>

1987
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:30.020
<v Speaker 4>When that's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just a ride.</v>

1988
01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:31.490
<v Speaker 4>You just ride the ride.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not,</v>

1989
01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:36.760
<v Speaker 4>you're not doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel like it's like if I dig a </v>

1990
01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:36.920
<v Speaker 4>hole in the dirt in the backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I just did something.</v>

1991
01:30:37.210 --> 01:30:38.510
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started at fucking hole.</v>

1992
01:30:38.511 --> 01:30:41.060
<v Speaker 4>It sucked every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I got to the end.</v>

1993
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:44.270
<v Speaker 4>I get this feeling of satisfaction when </v>
<v Speaker 4>I got off stage.</v>

1994
01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:46.160
<v Speaker 4>I never had like a feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 4>satisfaction.</v>

1995
01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:48.380
<v Speaker 4>I always have a feeling of Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was crazy.</v>

1996
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:52.400
<v Speaker 4>Was like our road something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I just got off a crazy ride.</v>

1997
01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:54.400
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know.</v>

1998
01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:55.640
<v Speaker 4>Like I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1999
01:30:55.641 --> 01:30:56.810
<v Speaker 4>that was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or that was,</v>

2000
01:30:56.811 --> 01:30:58.280
<v Speaker 4>that was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was great audience.</v>

2001
01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:00.830
<v Speaker 4>But I never feel like I just did </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

2002
01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:03.380
<v Speaker 4>I always feel like I just wrote a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>ride,</v>

2003
01:31:03.650 --> 01:31:05.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it feels like.</v>

2004
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:10.450
<v Speaker 4>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you have to do it enough so </v>

2005
01:31:10.450 --> 01:31:12.600
<v Speaker 4>that you're comfortable enough so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you get up it's all smooth,</v>

2006
01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:14.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's all fun.</v>

2007
01:31:14.391 --> 01:31:15.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're talking about,</v>

2008
01:31:15.351 --> 01:31:16.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you want to say,</v>

2009
01:31:16.191 --> 01:31:21.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're working on what you want to </v>

2010
01:31:21.191 --> 01:31:21.191
<v Speaker 4>say all the time so that it's always </v>
<v Speaker 4>fresh,</v>

2011
01:31:21.191 --> 01:31:25.330
<v Speaker 4>so it's always relevant in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then who's the asm is there and it </v>

2012
01:31:25.330 --> 01:31:29.131
<v Speaker 4>didn't do zasmine is there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the audiences enthusiastic and </v>

2013
01:31:29.131 --> 01:31:31.040
<v Speaker 4>then you lock to those things together </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you just ride it.</v>

2014
01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:32.360
<v Speaker 4>Once you get the laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>start going,</v>

2015
01:31:32.361 --> 01:31:37.130
<v Speaker 4>you just start writing it so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're skiing downhill.</v>

2016
01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:40.250
<v Speaker 3>I think you're going to get a segway on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your lap.</v>

2017
01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:43.200
<v Speaker 3>If you live in mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be like,</v>

2018
01:31:43.201 --> 01:31:48.070
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've be to jump off right quick.</v>

2019
01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.490
<v Speaker 4>I had a crazy Jaguar dream last night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2020
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:54.520
<v Speaker 4>I had a dream that jaguars big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to break into my house.</v>

2021
01:31:55.090 --> 01:31:58.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm having very strange apocalyptic </v>
<v Speaker 4>dreams lately.</v>

2022
01:31:59.250 --> 01:31:59.760
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

2023
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:02.200
<v Speaker 4>not serious ones because I survived the </v>
<v Speaker 4>apocalypse.</v>

2024
01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:08.370
<v Speaker 4>The retail apocalypse dream who's ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>the end had been having dreams pretty </v>

2025
01:32:08.370 --> 01:32:11.200
<v Speaker 4>much at all lately or ones once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember for some reason.</v>

2026
01:32:11.250 --> 01:32:12.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get every now and then I get these,</v>

2027
01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.730
<v Speaker 4>the system fails dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2028
01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:18.610
<v Speaker 4>every now and then like some mad max </v>
<v Speaker 4>type shit.</v>

2029
01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:21.330
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's just because all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>assholes are screaming,</v>

2030
01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:22.950
<v Speaker 4>the sky is falling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2031
01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:24.550
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting,</v>

2032
01:32:24.551 --> 01:32:29.551
<v Speaker 4>I was listening to some recordings of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunter s Thompson speaking at the </v>

2033
01:32:30.190 --> 01:32:33.670
<v Speaker 4>University of Colorado and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>1974 and he was talking about,</v>

2034
01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:35.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the car,</v>

2035
01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:39.310
<v Speaker 4>which is like supposedly the group of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that control the world,</v>

2036
01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the global bankers,</v>

2037
01:32:41.141 --> 01:32:42.550
<v Speaker 4>the Bilderberg group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that type of shit.</v>

2038
01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.740
<v Speaker 4>And he was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2039
01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2040
01:32:46.121 --> 01:32:51.121
<v Speaker 4>like what's going on overseas and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States is up to and how </v>

2041
01:32:51.121 --> 01:32:52.300
<v Speaker 4>corrupt the political system is and how </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably,</v>

2042
01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:54.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it goes this way much longer,</v>

2043
01:32:54.431 --> 01:32:59.431
<v Speaker 4>the country is going to fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you look at it like 30 years </v>

2044
01:32:59.431 --> 01:33:00.100
<v Speaker 4>later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still the same shit.</v>

2045
01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.320
<v Speaker 4>It's still the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2046
01:33:02.321 --> 01:33:03.550
<v Speaker 4>is it getting any worse?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2047
01:33:03.551 --> 01:33:08.551
<v Speaker 4>there's more people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it seems to accelerate a little bit </v>

2048
01:33:08.551 --> 01:33:08.680
<v Speaker 4>because there's more activity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's more humans,</v>

2049
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:11.170
<v Speaker 4>but it all seems to be going along the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same lines.</v>

2050
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:12.040
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this,</v>

2051
01:33:12.041 --> 01:33:17.041
<v Speaker 4>the sky is falling crazy shit like </v>
<v Speaker 4>really mean what takes something big </v>

2052
01:33:17.041 --> 01:33:18.190
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if it takes something big,</v>

2053
01:33:18.191 --> 01:33:20.720
<v Speaker 4>you're probably going to be dead anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy is really gonna be following.</v>

2054
01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:23.080
<v Speaker 4>It takes like a meteor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need like a volcano,</v>

2055
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:25.030
<v Speaker 4>like yellow stone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>

2056
01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:27.700
<v Speaker 4>ready for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is January 17th.</v>

2057
01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:31.390
<v Speaker 4>There's been over 1,600</v>
<v Speaker 4>earthquakes in yellowstone.</v>

2058
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:36.470
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is common?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't know yellowstone is a giant</v>

2059
01:33:36.471 --> 01:33:37.560
<v Speaker 3>volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2060
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:40.400
<v Speaker 3>nobody ever taught me this in school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They ever teach you this in school.</v>

2061
01:33:40.401 --> 01:33:42.130
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2062
01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:44.620
<v Speaker 3>Do you get the Caldera?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would the.</v>

2063
01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:46.750
<v Speaker 3>The whole volcano thing with then it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to blow up.</v>

2064
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:49.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it's weird when you live there </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

2065
01:33:49.011 --> 01:33:52.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like a lot of people can't live </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it because they're in constant fear</v>

2066
01:33:52.251 --> 01:33:53.020
<v Speaker 3>of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard.</v>

2067
01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:54.650
<v Speaker 3>How could you not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget who it was.</v>

2068
01:33:54.651 --> 01:33:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a Adam Corolla or </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody or was talking about when I was</v>

2069
01:33:58.791 --> 01:33:59.620
<v Speaker 3>in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2070
01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:01.540
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm older than you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old you?</v>

2071
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:03.170
<v Speaker 3>A $30.</v>

2072
01:34:03.210 --> 01:34:05.080
<v Speaker 4>Shh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't tell these people though.</v>

2073
01:34:05.250 --> 01:34:07.630
<v Speaker 4>They're cruel from seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm seven years older than you.</v>

2074
01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:11.490
<v Speaker 4>So you have to think about like if we </v>
<v Speaker 4>were in high school,</v>

2075
01:34:11.491 --> 01:34:13.030
<v Speaker 4>like I was in high school earlier than </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2076
01:34:13.210 --> 01:34:16.060
<v Speaker 4>They probably didn't even know yet </v>
<v Speaker 4>because one of the things they found out</v>

2077
01:34:16.061 --> 01:34:17.480
<v Speaker 4>about with these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2078
01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:22.550
<v Speaker 4>yellowstone is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had satellite images and when they </v>

2079
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.960
<v Speaker 4>took the satellite images,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when they realized that what they</v>

2080
01:34:22.961 --> 01:34:26.020
<v Speaker 4>were dealing with was a called era,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was a volcano.</v>

2081
01:34:26.021 --> 01:34:29.230
<v Speaker 4>That was so explosive that the top </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally disappeared,</v>

2082
01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:34.470
<v Speaker 4>like be like Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Hawaii fucking explodes and it's </v>

2083
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:36.100
<v Speaker 4>just flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's how big this volcano is.</v>

2084
01:34:36.190 --> 01:34:40.570
<v Speaker 4>It's 300 miles across.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

2085
01:34:40.990 --> 01:34:45.990
<v Speaker 4>And when it blows up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you imagine 300 miles of explosion </v>

2086
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.570
<v Speaker 4>straight up into the air.</v>

2087
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:50.730
<v Speaker 3>Everything will be okay here or will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked.</v>

2088
01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:53.540
<v Speaker 3>The whole continent would be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd be fucked.</v>

2089
01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:54.770
<v Speaker 3>But we would have like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a good,</v>

2090
01:34:54.771 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 3>like one hour slow lava or no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't be</v>

2091
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.710
<v Speaker 4>lava.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd be fucked because the ash wood rat</v>

2092
01:35:00.711 --> 01:35:02.960
<v Speaker 4>and fuck everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would kill animals.</v>

2093
01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:05.540
<v Speaker 4>It would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would pollute the water supply.</v>

2094
01:35:05.541 --> 01:35:08.170
<v Speaker 4>So what way would fuck everything you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about it?</v>

2095
01:35:08.171 --> 01:35:10.430
<v Speaker 4>How much it was?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like heavy,</v>

2096
01:35:10.490 --> 01:35:13.880
<v Speaker 4>heavy [inaudible] is like snow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2097
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.120
<v Speaker 4>Except it's much heavier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So rooms would collapse.</v>

2098
01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:18.710
<v Speaker 4>So you would get like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2099
01:35:18.711 --> 01:35:23.711
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three feet of certain that would come </v>

2100
01:35:23.711 --> 01:35:23.711
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even if you stayed inside your house</v>

2101
01:35:23.711 --> 01:35:25.820
<v Speaker 4>and relax,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your house would very likely get crushed</v>

2102
01:35:25.821 --> 01:35:30.821
<v Speaker 4>from this fucking sit because there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly thousands and thousands of </v>

2103
01:35:30.821 --> 01:35:32.060
<v Speaker 4>pounds on your roof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's going to cave your fucking house</v>

2104
01:35:32.061 --> 01:35:37.061
<v Speaker 4>and you can't breathe outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sky is filled with cert you don't </v>

2105
01:35:37.061 --> 01:35:39.410
<v Speaker 4>understand everywhere and it's heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thick shit.</v>

2106
01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:42.090
<v Speaker 4>Volcanic ash,</v>
<v Speaker 4>soot.</v>

2107
01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.450
<v Speaker 4>You're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fucked.</v>

2108
01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:47.010
<v Speaker 4>And it covers the continent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It comes over us.</v>

2109
01:35:47.011 --> 01:35:49.550
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the volcano.</v>

2110
01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.020
<v Speaker 4>How long does it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have any?</v>

2111
01:35:51.021 --> 01:35:52.640
<v Speaker 4>They don't have any idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2112
01:35:52.641 --> 01:35:56.570
<v Speaker 4>they know that there's been smaller ones</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's just killed a lot of things.</v>

2113
01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:01.660
<v Speaker 4>And then there's been these gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth shattering ones every six to </v>

2114
01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:01.660
<v Speaker 4>800,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

2115
01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:04.130
<v Speaker 4>And the last time there was one with </v>
<v Speaker 4>600,000</v>

2116
01:36:04.131 --> 01:36:06.020
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if it was something like,</v>

2117
01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:11.260
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't hit you for like a week and </v>
<v Speaker 4>say you just get out and people will </v>

2118
01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:11.630
<v Speaker 4>segue there going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

2119
01:36:11.631 --> 01:36:14.000
<v Speaker 4>would you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to leave the continent yet.</v>

2120
01:36:14.110 --> 01:36:19.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you could be okay if you could </v>

2121
01:36:19.110 --> 01:36:20.891
<v Speaker 4>get off in North America to Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if you knew that shit was going </v>

2122
01:36:20.891 --> 01:36:23.960
<v Speaker 4>down and you could get on a plane and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fly to England,</v>

2123
01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:29.170
<v Speaker 4>just take your family and a crazy movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A evacuating the whole United States.</v>

2124
01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:30.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2125
01:36:30.291 --> 01:36:32.780
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a rock shelf in Africa,</v>

2126
01:36:33.010 --> 01:36:35.530
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if it breaks off like it's,</v>

2127
01:36:35.690 --> 01:36:38.760
<v Speaker 4>they have these underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2128
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:43.990
<v Speaker 4>these underwater landslides occur with </v>
<v Speaker 4>these big shelves of these mountains </v>

2129
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:46.250
<v Speaker 4>fall off and it's happened thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 4>times throughout history.</v>

2130
01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:49.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this one particular rock flat,</v>

2131
01:36:49.821 --> 01:36:54.821
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole area which they predict one </v>

2132
01:36:54.821 --> 01:36:57.251
<v Speaker 4>day we'll break off and go into the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ocean is one particular side of a </v>

2133
01:36:57.251 --> 01:36:57.350
<v Speaker 4>mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it does that,</v>

2134
01:36:57.470 --> 01:37:02.240
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna repeat a gigantic tsunami </v>
<v Speaker 4>that engulfs the whole east coast of the</v>

2135
01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:03.770
<v Speaker 4>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like miles in.</v>

2136
01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:07.040
<v Speaker 4>It's just going to just miles in water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2137
01:37:07.110 --> 01:37:12.110
<v Speaker 4>just a gigantic chunk of raw pouring </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the ocean and these fucking waves </v>

2138
01:37:12.711 --> 01:37:17.711
<v Speaker 4>that are like a mile high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's going to roll in wreck </v>

2139
01:37:17.711 --> 01:37:17.711
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be insane.</v>

2140
01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:21.200
<v Speaker 4>Or it's just gonna be mildly irritating </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be insane.</v>

2141
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:24.000
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be insane and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably gonna happen.</v>

2142
01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:24.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2143
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:27.080
<v Speaker 4>it might not happen in our lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

2144
01:37:27.610 --> 01:37:32.610
<v Speaker 4>but you can't say it was so against it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So not though they probably are.</v>

2145
01:37:32.721 --> 01:37:35.810
<v Speaker 4>There's so many things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's so many things.</v>

2146
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:38.090
<v Speaker 4>Do there's so many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The odds aren't against it.</v>

2147
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:43.270
<v Speaker 4>If you look at all of them together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the odds aren't against it because if </v>

2148
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.400
<v Speaker 4>you look at like meteors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2149
01:37:43.401 --> 01:37:45.500
<v Speaker 4>they don't know when the fuck those are </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming.</v>

2150
01:37:45.501 --> 01:37:48.170
<v Speaker 4>They have no idea how many asteroids are</v>
<v Speaker 4>out there,</v>

2151
01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:53.290
<v Speaker 4>how many big chunks of fucking rock and </v>
<v Speaker 4>metal and iron are flying through space </v>

2152
01:37:53.290 --> 01:37:56.640
<v Speaker 4>in any one of those Kojak us and they've</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened so many times over history.</v>

2153
01:37:56.641 --> 01:38:01.641
<v Speaker 4>It's been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many planets that are </v>

2154
01:38:01.641 --> 01:38:01.650
<v Speaker 4>scattered with craters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way we can predict it.</v>

2155
01:38:01.770 --> 01:38:06.770
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they could monitor the sky and </v>

2156
01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:09.351
<v Speaker 4>hope they catch most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's always ones that are </v>

2157
01:38:09.351 --> 01:38:10.650
<v Speaker 4>sneaking right bias that we miss and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's happening left and right man.</v>

2158
01:38:10.930 --> 01:38:12.670
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you black,</v>

01:38:49.621 --> 01:38:49.621
<v Speaker 4>raise money to have two good quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2173
01:38:49.621 --> 01:38:51.820
<v Speaker 4>if he listened to that one is money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>

2174
01:38:51.821 --> 01:38:52.630
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

2175
01:38:52.710 --> 01:38:55.630
<v Speaker 4>And if you talked to Eddie about being </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Japan and how cool it was.</v>

2176
01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:57.160
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just got back last night.</v>

2177
01:38:57.161 --> 01:39:00.010
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen him yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love to get to Japan and he,</v>

2178
01:39:00.011 --> 01:39:01.270
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's been to Japan,</v>

2179
01:39:01.271 --> 01:39:03.160
<v Speaker 4>but though he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he used to work for pride,</v>

2180
01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.590
<v Speaker 4>what am I in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2181
01:39:05.591 --> 01:39:07.150
<v Speaker 4>a long time scale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is inevitable.</v>

2182
01:39:07.151 --> 01:39:12.151
<v Speaker 4>That's what people have to realize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we know for sure that human beings </v>

2183
01:39:12.151 --> 01:39:15.361
<v Speaker 4>have a lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to die as much as you plan </v>

2184
01:39:15.361 --> 01:39:15.850
<v Speaker 4>for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's where you're going to die.</v>

2185
01:39:16.210 --> 01:39:19.720
<v Speaker 4>We know that planets have a lifespan as </v>
<v Speaker 4>much as you plan for the future.</v>

2186
01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:22.990
<v Speaker 4>Flagging signs eventually run into </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy am I take billions of years,</v>

2187
01:39:22.991 --> 01:39:27.991
<v Speaker 4>but it's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what we have to worry about is not </v>

2188
01:39:27.991 --> 01:39:29.470
<v Speaker 4>just that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just earthquakes,</v>

2189
01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.320
<v Speaker 4>not just super volcanoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just media.</v>

2190
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:34.840
<v Speaker 4>We have to worry about gamma ray </v>
<v Speaker 4>explosions.</v>

2191
01:39:34.841 --> 01:39:39.841
<v Speaker 4>We have to worry about supernovas that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen out in space that make these </v>

2192
01:39:39.841 --> 01:39:41.890
<v Speaker 4>giant gamma ray bursts and fucking flood</v>
<v Speaker 4>the earth.</v>

2193
01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:45.100
<v Speaker 4>Crushing all our communication systems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crushing off satellites,</v>

2194
01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:48.250
<v Speaker 4>breaking everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No wireless Internet,</v>

2195
01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:51.220
<v Speaker 4>no oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything shuts the fuck down.</v>

2196
01:39:51.250 --> 01:39:52.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Shit's all possible.</v>

2197
01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:54.700
<v Speaker 4>Giant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy solar flares.</v>

2198
01:39:54.850 --> 01:39:56.950
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of shit that could fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings up.</v>

2199
01:39:57.190 --> 01:39:58.480
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of shit,</v>

2200
01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:03.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they say that the polar ice caps </v>

2201
01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:06.220
<v Speaker 4>have shifted more than once in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they also say that 10,000</v>

2202
01:40:06.221 --> 01:40:08.080
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during the last ice age,</v>

2203
01:40:08.110 --> 01:40:12.130
<v Speaker 4>the North American continent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like half of it was under a mile of ice.</v>

2204
01:40:12.490 --> 01:40:14.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>North America was fucked up,</v>

2205
01:40:14.681 --> 01:40:15.940
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all ice,</v>

2206
01:40:15.970 --> 01:40:17.220
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2207
01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:18.820
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's only 10,000</v>

2208
01:40:18.821 --> 01:40:19.540
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2209
01:40:20.110 --> 01:40:25.110
<v Speaker 4>Crazy things can happen if.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How would we stop North America from </v>

2210
01:40:25.110 --> 01:40:26.080
<v Speaker 4>turning all ice again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the earth got that cold again,</v>

2211
01:40:26.081 --> 01:40:27.850
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck would we do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we do?</v>

2212
01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:30.190
<v Speaker 4>Turn on the heat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck would we do?</v>

2213
01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:35.430
<v Speaker 4>What would we do if all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 4>North America started turning into a </v>

2214
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:38.701
<v Speaker 4>fucking mile high sheet wall of ice?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Odds are dinosaurs would come back </v>

2215
01:40:39.401 --> 01:40:40.450
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2216
01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:41.800
<v Speaker 4>Why do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why.</v>

2217
01:40:42.490 --> 01:40:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian,</v>

2218
01:40:43.090 --> 01:40:44.680
<v Speaker 4>you can't give me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is what makes.</v>

2219
01:40:44.681 --> 01:40:47.790
<v Speaker 4>What makes these climate changes is very</v>
<v Speaker 4>mysterious.</v>

2220
01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:50.560
<v Speaker 4>Most likely have nothing to worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>

2221
01:40:50.561 --> 01:40:51.580
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most likely,</v>

2222
01:40:51.730 --> 01:40:55.980
<v Speaker 4>but there's been some gigantic things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that happened to men at times.</v>

2223
01:40:56.020 --> 01:41:01.020
<v Speaker 4>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could freak out about that shit or I </v>

2224
01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:01.020
<v Speaker 4>could just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2225
01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:01.390
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about real things that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>freaking me out.</v>

2226
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:03.750
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta pay my bill tomorrow and do this</v>

2227
01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:06.160
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think people avoided though.</v>

2228
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:11.310
<v Speaker 4>I think people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just the fact that people </v>

2229
01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:13.260
<v Speaker 4>choose not to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they typically avoid it so they </v>

2230
01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:13.260
<v Speaker 4>don't ever have to think about like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2231
01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:15.460
<v Speaker 4>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real big picture.</v>

2232
01:41:15.490 --> 01:41:18.160
<v Speaker 4>The real big picture is very frightening</v>
<v Speaker 4>to a lot of people.</v>

2233
01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:23.250
<v Speaker 4>And now there's the big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what are you gonna do with your </v>

2234
01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:23.250
<v Speaker 4>life and you know you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>married,</v>

2235
01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:23.890
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have kids going to get a</v>
<v Speaker 4>good job,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be Able to put your kids through </v>

2237
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.950
<v Speaker 4>college.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

2238
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:31.680
<v Speaker 4>that's the real picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the big picture and the big </v>

2239
01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:32.080
<v Speaker 4>picture is what the fuck are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2240
01:41:32.081 --> 01:41:35.020
<v Speaker 4>we're involved in two wars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's 2010.</v>

2241
01:41:35.021 --> 01:41:40.021
<v Speaker 4>This is the age of information we see </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere that were being fucked left </v>

2242
01:41:40.021 --> 01:41:40.021
<v Speaker 4>and right.</v>

2243
01:41:40.021 --> 01:41:41.730
<v Speaker 4>You know that your bailout money is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to these corporations,</v>

2244
01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:46.760
<v Speaker 4>the corporation ceos are taking hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 4>of millions of dollars in payouts for </v>

2245
01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.520
<v Speaker 4>bonuses and all this insanity and you're</v>

<v Speaker 4>money to bail out the company and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>they get to get money.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And then part b of that picture is what </v>

2254
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:15.250
<v Speaker 4>that's the crazy one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Part B is we are,</v>

2255
01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:20.280
<v Speaker 4>we are on a planet and this planet is </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of an infinite amount of planets and</v>

2256
01:42:21.211 --> 01:42:26.211
<v Speaker 4>an infinite amount of solar systems and </v>
<v Speaker 4>an infinite amount of galaxies spread </v>

2257
01:42:26.211 --> 01:42:30.601
<v Speaker 4>throughout an infinite amount of space </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that space and the universe itself </v>

2258
01:42:30.881 --> 01:42:33.160
<v Speaker 4>may be some sort of a geometric pattern.</v>

<v Speaker 4>thing in life.</v>

2262
01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:43.600

01:43:37.650 --> 01:43:38.080
<v Speaker 4>country in a time of need to realize </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he has to step up.</v>

2286
01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:41.590
<v Speaker 4>That there are certain times in history </v>
<v Speaker 4>where men have to do things and fuck all</v>

2287
01:43:41.591 --> 01:43:46.591
<v Speaker 4>the glory for being an nfl player.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to do the right thing and </v>

2288
01:43:46.591 --> 01:43:48.190
<v Speaker 4>fight for his country and he goes over </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and gets killed in friendly fire,</v>

2289
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:51.680
<v Speaker 4>accidentally gets Kennedy quick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it work.</v>

2290
01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:57.180
<v Speaker 4>Crazy thing was how quickly he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about how fucked up it is over </v>

2291
01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:00.221
<v Speaker 4>there and how disillusion he is and how </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a mess and his brothers talking </v>

2292
01:44:00.221 --> 01:44:04.151
<v Speaker 4>about it and they completely incompetent</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was talking about how just </v>

2293
01:44:04.151 --> 01:44:04.550
<v Speaker 4>completely unorganized it is over there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2294
01:44:04.670 --> 01:44:08.480
<v Speaker 4>and chaotic and how he didn't believe in</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he,</v>

2295
01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:10.730
<v Speaker 4>what he joined up for the army in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first place.</v>

2296
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:12.290
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was being tracked and that's not what</v>

2297
01:44:12.291 --> 01:44:14.570
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was fascinating,</v>

2298
01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:16.220
<v Speaker 4>fascinating fucking story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2299
01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:18.860
<v Speaker 4>and that represents everything that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>best about America.</v>

2300
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:22.640
<v Speaker 4>Like a guy who is willing to look at it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and say,</v>

2301
01:44:22.641 --> 01:44:24.800
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2303
01:44:26.871 --> 01:44:28.910
<v Speaker 4>I want to make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when he gets there,</v>

2304
01:44:28.970 --> 01:44:30.650
<v Speaker 4>he's man enough to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>

2305
01:44:30.651 --> 01:44:33.220
<v Speaker 4>this is a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is not what I wanted.</v>

01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:35.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to be United States.</v>

2307
01:44:35.031 --> 01:44:36.800
<v Speaker 4>This bitch over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is craziness.</v>

2308
01:44:36.801 --> 01:44:38.600
<v Speaker 4>This is chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then</v>

2309
01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:39.550
<v Speaker 1>he's dead.</v>

2310
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:42.610
<v Speaker 4>Which is what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but it's just at this point in time,</v>

2313
01:44:46.901 --> 01:44:48.040
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I liked.</v>

2331
01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I liked going back to it on occasion.</v>

2333
01:45:37.301 --> 01:45:38.860
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2337
01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.580
<v Speaker 1>This is the song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I travel,</v>

2338
01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:52.720
<v Speaker 1>this is the move he eat a cookie like </v>
<v Speaker 1>right before you get to the airport.</v>

2339
01:45:53.370 --> 01:45:55.420
<v Speaker 1>So then any board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not riding dirty.</v>

2340
01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:56.910
<v Speaker 1>You have to worry about anybody arrested</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2341
01:45:57.390 --> 01:45:59.710
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even kick in until like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour into the flight,</v>

2342
01:45:59.730 --> 01:46:01.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour into the flight,</v>

2343
01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Dan Daniel barbecued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that's the best way to fly.</v>

2344
01:46:05.021 --> 01:46:08.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean suddenly you're operating heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>machinery or you're going to think about</v>

2345
01:46:08.831 --> 01:46:10.210
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to think about life.</v>

2346
01:46:10.211 --> 01:46:15.211
<v Speaker 1>You can think about a lot of deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>important shit when you're high on an </v>

2347
01:46:15.211 --> 01:46:15.211
<v Speaker 1>airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way I travel.</v>

2348
01:46:15.211 --> 01:46:16.600
<v Speaker 1>This is the best way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when I land,</v>

2349
01:46:16.690 --> 01:46:21.310
<v Speaker 1>every time I land Atlanta this song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about yourself.</v>

2350
01:46:21.311 --> 01:46:23.640
<v Speaker 1>You've got to think a little deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>

2351
01:46:23.770 --> 01:46:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Woops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's me.</v>

2352
01:46:24.611 --> 01:46:25.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a delay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to listen to that.</v>

2353
01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:38.340
<v Speaker 2>This hip hop is dead song by now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the best barbecue.</v>

2354
01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Contemplating your role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overseeing all these different </v>

2355
01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:47.460
<v Speaker 2>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walking through the airport,</v>

2356
01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:53.740
<v Speaker 2>Dr Dre headphones on and I get it down </v>
<v Speaker 2>before I don't like this,</v>

2357
01:47:00.930 --> 01:47:03.100
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard it a million times.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's very rare that I walk with boners </v>

2422
01:50:09.511 --> 01:50:10.930
<v Speaker 4>anymore though was when I was a younger </v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2423
01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:13.240
<v Speaker 4>Boners like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2424
01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:14.740

<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

<v Speaker 4>don't get those random boaters anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I get morning loners but I'll get no </v>
<v Speaker 4>random daytime boners.</v>

2427
01:50:21.610 --> 01:50:25.140
<v Speaker 4>Especially if I do a lot of Jujitsu and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's mixed Jujitsu.</v>

2428
01:50:25.150 --> 01:50:28.000
<v Speaker 4>Sound very gay because it kills your </v>
<v Speaker 4>boner I guess I never was.</v>

2429
01:50:29.050 --> 01:50:31.030
<v Speaker 4>There'll be do a lot of Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're tired all the time.</v>

2430
01:50:31.031 --> 01:50:36.031
<v Speaker 4>Your testosterone's down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know you're worn out and if you get </v>

2431
01:50:36.031 --> 01:50:38.410
<v Speaker 4>laid all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do those two things.</v>

2432
01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:40.330
<v Speaker 4>Keep your bonus from just occurring </v>
<v Speaker 4>randomly.</v>

2433
01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:43.000
<v Speaker 4>But if you're not getting laid and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not even working out,</v>

2434
01:50:43.001 --> 01:50:45.750
<v Speaker 4>you're not doing anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your bonus would just start firing away.</v>

2435
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:50.950
<v Speaker 5>It's fuck who fucked bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're not paying attention,</v>

2436
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:54.390
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2437
01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:56.310
<v Speaker 4>given your dick the proper maintenance </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

2438
01:50:56.490 --> 01:51:01.490
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a joke that was in one of my cds </v>

2439
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.490
<v Speaker 4>from way back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember which one,</v>

2440
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:05.690
<v Speaker 4>I think it was shiny happy Jihad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a day you got to jerk off first </v>

2441
01:51:05.690 --> 01:51:06.600
<v Speaker 4>and then think about what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should always do that.</v>

2442
01:51:06.630 --> 01:51:09.120
<v Speaker 4>It's really important because your </v>
<v Speaker 4>biology will trick you.</v>

2443
01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:14.300
<v Speaker 4>Your biology will have you convinced </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you should go file some crazy girl </v>

2444
01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:17.961
<v Speaker 4>home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>live in a bad neighborhood and leave </v>

2445
01:51:17.961 --> 01:51:19.671
<v Speaker 4>your car on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the corner and her cousin's going to </v>

2446
01:51:19.671 --> 01:51:19.671
<v Speaker 4>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2447
01:51:19.671 --> 01:51:19.890
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you're Horny,</v>

2448
01:51:19.891 --> 01:51:21.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll do some dumb shit.</v>

2449
01:51:21.391 --> 01:51:23.280
<v Speaker 4>You'll do some silly shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2450
01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:28.400
<v Speaker 4>And if you jerk off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're much less likely to do any of </v>

2451
01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:28.400
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep every play racquetball.</v>

2452
01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:33.420
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the funny thing you say that </v>

2453
01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:35.001
<v Speaker 4>because I was just at a gym the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>day that had all these racquetball </v>

2454
01:51:35.001 --> 01:51:37.641
<v Speaker 4>courts and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was one of the first times I've </v>

2455
01:51:37.641 --> 01:51:37.641
<v Speaker 4>ever seen racquetball and I was reading </v>
<v Speaker 4>a long time.</v>

2456
01:51:37.641 --> 01:51:37.641
<v Speaker 4>Now</v>

2457
01:51:37.641 --> 01:51:38.830
<v Speaker 5>you would seem like a scary racket ball </v>
<v Speaker 5>partner.</v>

2458
01:51:39.490 --> 01:51:40.190
<v Speaker 5>You'd be one of those,</v>

2459
01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:44.460
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why I don't like my racquetball.</v>

2460
01:51:44.461 --> 01:51:45.920
<v Speaker 4>I've had two knee surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2461
01:51:45.930 --> 01:51:50.930
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet both of my acl reconstructed and </v>

2462
01:51:50.930 --> 01:51:53.160
<v Speaker 4>my had another a meniscus surgery on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>left knee and they work great.</v>

2463
01:51:53.161 --> 01:51:56.120
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no problem doing Jujitsu and it's</v>

2464
01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:59.400
<v Speaker 4>their fun and it's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think if I did stuff like that,</v>

2465
01:51:59.610 --> 01:52:01.620
<v Speaker 4>like cutting back and forth all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

2466
01:52:01.890 --> 01:52:03.990
<v Speaker 4>you run the risk of injuring yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2467
01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:09.500
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can kinda control the movements a </v>

2468
01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:09.500
<v Speaker 4>little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you pulled guard and he,</v>

2469
01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:11.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he control where your legs are going.</v>

2470
01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:13.740
<v Speaker 4>You know when you're going back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>forth like that,</v>

2471
01:52:13.741 --> 01:52:18.741
<v Speaker 4>you're putting a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure on your joints and your </v>

2472
01:52:18.741 --> 01:52:19.170
<v Speaker 4>explosive movement like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>

2473
01:52:19.171 --> 01:52:20.070
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2474

<v Speaker 4>but like for your body eventually that </v>

01:53:57.341 --> 01:53:57.710
<v Speaker 4>who keeps the computer on the computers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep the computers on,</v>

2512
01:53:57.860 --> 01:54:01.270
<v Speaker 4>and then we're part of this new life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this new world that exists inside of Huc</v>

2513
01:54:01.271 --> 01:54:06.271
<v Speaker 4>and machine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then your consciousness exists in a </v>

2514
01:54:06.271 --> 01:54:06.620
<v Speaker 4>machine and what happens to the original</v>
<v Speaker 4>version of your consciousness?</v>

2515
01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:08.930
<v Speaker 4>What does guy I have planned for you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>After you die?</v>

2516
01:54:08.931 --> 01:54:12.070
<v Speaker 4>Do you really go into some great well of</v>
<v Speaker 4>souls and you know,</v>

2517
01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:14.510
<v Speaker 4>and go to the next stage of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that happen?</v>

2518
01:54:14.511 --> 01:54:17.210
<v Speaker 4>And if that does happen and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>already downloaded into the machine,</v>

2519
01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:19.760
<v Speaker 4>does the well of souls except you or the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wellstone goes,</v>

2520
01:54:19.761 --> 01:54:24.761
<v Speaker 4>listen bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't accept software piracy up in </v>

2521
01:54:24.761 --> 01:54:27.731
<v Speaker 4>heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't be copying my shit and put it </v>

2522
01:54:27.731 --> 01:54:27.731
<v Speaker 4>on bit torrent down on earth and have it</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these,</v>

2523

<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>C'Mon man,</v>

<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

2525
01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:30.950
<v Speaker 4>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to move on.</v>

2526
01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:32.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it doesn't accept you if there's a</v>

2527
01:54:32.871 --> 01:54:35.210
<v Speaker 4>version of you running this parallel </v>
<v Speaker 4>dimension,</v>

2528
01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:37.820
<v Speaker 4>maybe having one except you because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>gotta you gotta let go.</v>

2529
01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:41.780
<v Speaker 4>But that's the whole idea of living and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dying is to know that this is a stage.</v>

2530
01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:42.770
<v Speaker 4>Don't be greedy.</v>

2531
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:46.010
<v Speaker 4>Don't try to live for a thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just get the fuck out of here.</v>

2532
01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:47.000
<v Speaker 4>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

2533
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.690
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

2534
01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:50.990
<v Speaker 4>Don't download yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not makes you know,</v>

2535
01:54:51.290 --> 01:54:54.410
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like a kid who wants to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>down the slide and he's holding onto the</v>

2536
01:54:54.411 --> 01:54:59.411
<v Speaker 4>back of the slide and he wants to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>down the slide and hold on at the same </v>

2537
01:54:59.411 --> 01:54:59.411
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you can't.</v>

2538
01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:02.750
<v Speaker 4>Did he go down a slide or you hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd be a bitch.</v>

2539
01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:08.020
<v Speaker 4>So either downloads or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a computer live forever or you see </v>

2540
01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:08.020
<v Speaker 4>what's next.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2541
01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:11.720
<v Speaker 4>like you're supposed to write.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Aubrey de Grey believes we will live </v>

2542
01:55:13.221 --> 01:55:15.260
<v Speaker 4>forever in biological form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2543
01:55:15.261 --> 01:55:20.261
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that professor Aubrey de Grey Day </v>

2544
01:55:20.261 --> 01:55:22.901
<v Speaker 4>sleeper in 1988.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's that crazy English dude with the </v>

2545
01:55:22.901 --> 01:55:23.180
<v Speaker 4>big long crazy beard who drinks a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>beer.</v>

2546
01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:24.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a fascinating guy.</v>

2547
01:55:24.981 --> 01:55:26.010
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2548
01:55:26.230 --> 01:55:27.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some crazy,</v>

2549
01:55:27.231 --> 01:55:32.231
<v Speaker 4>mad scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>genius character who is working on a </v>

2550
01:55:32.231 --> 01:55:33.940
<v Speaker 4>changing human beings at the molecular </v>
<v Speaker 4>level level to,</v>

2551
01:55:33.941 --> 01:55:35.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to prevent aging,</v>

2552
01:55:35.061 --> 01:55:38.900
<v Speaker 4>the change agent and working all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>different science for our anti aging.</v>

2553
01:55:38.930 --> 01:55:42.470
<v Speaker 4>And the idea is that if you can survive </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a few years,</v>

2554
01:55:42.471 --> 01:55:43.720
<v Speaker 4>the next 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 years,</v>

2555
01:55:43.721 --> 01:55:44.060
<v Speaker 4>so you're</v>

2556
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:47.070
<v Speaker 1>likely that you could live forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really crazy.</v>

2557
01:55:47.090 --> 01:55:51.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just insane to think about like so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people as it is right now,</v>

2558
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:54.570
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see Pandora them by the way?</v>

2559
01:55:55.230 --> 01:55:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Unsolicited plug here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>

2560
01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to grab this.</v>

2561
01:56:07.230 --> 01:56:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I watched this the other night on Blu </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray.</v>

2562
01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:14.060
<v Speaker 1>It's called Pandora them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a movie that a con Lee is </v>

2563
01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:14.060
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

2564
01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:15.180
<v Speaker 1>I think how I found out about it the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>

2565
01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:20.540
<v Speaker 1>And then a dude named angry Amadeus on </v>
<v Speaker 1>my message board made a post about it </v>

2566
01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:22.490
<v Speaker 1>and he's a pretty smart guy and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about how great it was.</v>

2567
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2568
01:56:23.011 --> 01:56:23.780
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it a try.</v>

2569
01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2570
01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:26.860
<v Speaker 1>As an intelligent dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

2571
01:56:26.861 --> 01:56:30.350
<v Speaker 1>a space horror film and a Conley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2572
01:56:30.351 --> 01:56:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Quaid is in it and pretty God </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn fucking good movie man.</v>

2573
01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:35.850
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty Fun fucking movie.</v>

2574
01:56:36.090 --> 01:56:41.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a horror movie and space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of surprised that it didn't get </v>

2575
01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:42.210
<v Speaker 1>more people into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>

2576
01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:45.270
<v Speaker 1>What's the rotten tomatoes score?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even look.</v>

2577
01:56:45.271 --> 01:56:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rotten tomatoes score for Pandora.</v>

2578
01:56:48.750 --> 01:56:51.840
<v Speaker 1>I pretty much trust that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rotten tomatoes.</v>

2579
01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty good.</v>

2580
01:56:54.650 --> 01:56:56.070
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually.</v>

2581
01:56:59.230 --> 01:57:02.320
<v Speaker 1>What do I think about the nexus one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's got a lot of problems now,</v>

2582
01:57:02.321 --> 01:57:07.321
<v Speaker 1>but once it comes to verizon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be interesting to see what </v>

2583
01:57:07.321 --> 01:57:07.321
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

2584
01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of more excited about the tour </v>
<v Speaker 1>to now.</v>

2585
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I think what the thing about the tour </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

2586
01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:14.450
<v Speaker 1>which means a lot to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

2587
01:57:14.451 --> 01:57:15.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a world phone.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the UK,</v>

2590
01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Twenty eight percent tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>28 percent damn consensus.</v>

2591
01:57:26.571 --> 01:57:30.230
<v Speaker 1>While my approve somewhat satisfying for</v>
<v Speaker 1>devout Scifi fans.</v>

2592
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Pandora was bloated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Derivative plot an ultimately leaves it </v>

2593
01:57:35.390 --> 01:57:36.410
<v Speaker 1>drifting in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2594
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I completely disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2595
01:57:38.031 --> 01:57:40.220
<v Speaker 1>It was not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor was avatar.</v>

2596
01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking for perfect movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2597
01:57:42.411 --> 01:57:44.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking for an escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking for some fun.</v>

2598
01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:47.360
<v Speaker 1>If I want to be intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulated,</v>

2599
01:57:47.361 --> 01:57:49.370
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be from your gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking movie.</v>

01:57:49.371 --> 01:57:54.371
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be from a documentary is </v>

2601
01:57:54.371 --> 01:57:56.801
<v Speaker 1>going to be from some real life shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be from something on </v>

2602
01:57:56.801 --> 01:57:56.801
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm watching a movie,</v>

2603
01:57:56.801 --> 01:58:00.170
<v Speaker 1>I want crazy shit with monsters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>explosions.</v>

2604
01:58:00.171 --> 01:58:05.171
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to excitement and I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>some tits and that movie had all that </v>

2605
01:58:05.171 --> 01:58:07.040
<v Speaker 1>click on top critics and read some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bitch was kicking everyone's ass.</v>

2606
01:58:07.190 --> 01:58:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Top critics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2607
01:58:08.101 --> 01:58:13.101
<v Speaker 1>And then read some of just little blurbs</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what their reviews are because I'm </v>

2608
01:58:13.101 --> 01:58:13.550
<v Speaker 1>kind of interested to see if.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you'd like it so much,</v>

2609
01:58:13.551 --> 01:58:15.050
<v Speaker 1>what they have to say about it.</v>

2610
01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

2611
01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Throughout some obvious questions pop up</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

2612
01:58:25.971 --> 01:58:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no kidding.</v>

2614
01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:31.610

<v Speaker 1>Perhaps.</v>

2615
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

2616
01:58:33.291 --> 01:58:34.370
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

2617

<v Speaker 4>I know it's been done a thousand times </v>

2624

<v Speaker 4>Wolf men too.</v>

01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:09.610
<v Speaker 4>I loved the old wolf man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd love.</v>

2631
01:59:09.611 --> 01:59:11.740
<v Speaker 4>There's so many different ones that came</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2632
01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:16.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there hasn't been a good one in a long </v>

2633
01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:16.920
<v Speaker 4>time though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those likened movies,</v>

2634
01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:20.050
<v Speaker 4>the vampires and the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are cool looking werewolves.</v>

2635
01:59:20.051 --> 01:59:22.590
<v Speaker 4>They're kind of crazy looking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're so CGI that's.</v>

2636
01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:24.670
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to take them serious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They look dope,</v>

2637
01:59:24.671 --> 01:59:26.770
<v Speaker 4>but they look fake as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2638
01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:32.100
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people felt that movie sucked </v>

2639
01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:32.400
<v Speaker 4>and you might think it sucks to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>huge team wolf fan.</v>

2640
01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:34.660
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I like some science fiction.</v>

<v Speaker 4>songs of all time.</v>

2676
02:00:56.230 --> 02:00:58.030
<v Speaker 4>There was something about the seventies </v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they had a certain sixties and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies.</v>

2678
02:01:00.730 --> 02:01:05.730
<v Speaker 4>They had a certain energy to their music</v>
<v Speaker 4>that like what was representing the </v>

2679
02:01:05.730 --> 02:01:10.411
<v Speaker 4>changes that were going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture that we haven't had in a long </v>

2680
02:01:10.411 --> 02:01:13.681
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the thing about Jimi Hendrix and </v>

2681
02:01:13.681 --> 02:01:14.980
<v Speaker 4>the thing about the doors and the </v>

2683
02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:20.650
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were bursting onto the scene in one</v>

2684
02:01:20.651 --> 02:01:25.651
<v Speaker 4>of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one of the biggest changes and in </v>

2687
02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:32.740
<v Speaker 4>of fucking control and all of a sudden </v>

<v Speaker 4>singing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he was talking shit and singing at </v>

3098
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:33.250
<v Speaker 4>we've intellectualize that not only do </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to survive and all these </v>

3099
02:19:33.250 --> 02:19:33.840
<v Speaker 4>different climates and we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3100
02:19:33.860 --> 02:19:36.560
<v Speaker 4>make sure that we have some stuff to </v>
<v Speaker 4>cover us and keep us warm,</v>

3101
02:19:36.770 --> 02:19:40.580
<v Speaker 4>but we also got to slow the fuck down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make it tougher to fuck.</v>

3102
02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:43.580
<v Speaker 4>It can't just be like right there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can't just be dicks hanging out,</v>

<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

3104
02:19:45.530 --> 02:19:46.880
<v Speaker 4>You could just going to make too many </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3105
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.060
<v Speaker 4>Even in hot weather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's totally unacceptable to walk around</v>

3106
02:19:50.061 --> 02:19:52.980
<v Speaker 4>naked everywhere and just start fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>people at the supermarket that.</v>

3107
02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.760
<v Speaker 4>But that's what would happen if </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody was naked.</v>

3108
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:58.040
<v Speaker 4>If you lived in Florida when it's 110 </v>
<v Speaker 4>degrees,</v>

3109
02:19:58.041 --> 02:19:59.540

<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

3110
02:19:59.750 --> 02:20:01.260
<v Speaker 4>And if there was no laws against wearing</v>
<v Speaker 4>clothes,</v>

3111
02:20:01.310 --> 02:20:02.480
<v Speaker 4>people just started walking around </v>
<v Speaker 4>naked.</v>

3112
02:20:02.690 --> 02:20:07.690
<v Speaker 4>People would fuck everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd be fucking in bushes and trees </v>

3113
02:20:07.690 --> 02:20:08.810
<v Speaker 4>that fuck in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There'd be checks sucking guys.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Dicks while they were driving.</v>

3158
02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:54.081

<v Speaker 4>the fact that girls hair is not sexy,</v>

02:28:01.290 --> 02:28:06.290
<v Speaker 4>the fucking mythbusters got involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know it's a real ass fake tits.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's fake.</v>

3308
02:28:10.151 --> 02:28:15.151
<v Speaker 4>Tits do ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they still do look good sometimes </v>

3309
02:28:15.151 --> 02:28:15.151
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

02:28:15.151 --> 02:28:15.151
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna lie.</v>

3311
02:28:15.151 --> 02:28:19.441
<v Speaker 4>I know as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's completely ludicrous that I </v>

3312
02:28:19.441 --> 02:28:22.741
<v Speaker 4>find a girl more attractive because </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's got these bags and her skin and </v>

3313
02:28:22.741 --> 02:28:22.741
<v Speaker 4>make her tits</v>

3314
02:28:22.741 --> 02:28:23.420
<v Speaker 4>hanging out more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's still,</v>

3315
02:28:23.421 --> 02:28:25.970
<v Speaker 4>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're more attracted to the frame.</v>

3316
02:28:25.971 --> 02:28:29.090
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's something going on in </v>
<v Speaker 4>our bodies.</v>

3317
02:28:29.091 --> 02:28:34.091
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a frequency that we try to hit </v>

3318
02:28:34.091 --> 02:28:35.960
<v Speaker 4>physically that men try to hit and women</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to hit to make themselves attractive</v>

3319
02:28:35.961 --> 02:28:39.170
<v Speaker 4>to the opposite sex and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever the fuck it is.</v>

3320
02:28:39.300 --> 02:28:39.790
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

3321
02:28:39.850 --> 02:28:42.140
<v Speaker 4>we try to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we try to be in and we try to nail it.</v>

3322
02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:47.150
<v Speaker 4>It's being a certain weight and being </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy and smelling good and it's also </v>

3323
02:28:47.150 --> 02:28:51.911
<v Speaker 4>being a certain shape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like women want a certain shape </v>

3324
02:28:51.911 --> 02:28:53.210
<v Speaker 4>to men as guys who get like peck </v>
<v Speaker 4>implants because they can't grow,</v>

3325
02:28:53.230 --> 02:28:55.880
<v Speaker 4>they don't grow muscle very well I </v>
<v Speaker 4>guess,</v>

3326
02:28:55.881 --> 02:28:57.840
<v Speaker 4>and they try to do a lot of bench </v>
<v Speaker 4>precedent.</v>

3327
02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:02.880
<v Speaker 4>They get lazy and so they just stick </v>
<v Speaker 4>these plastic things in their chest and </v>

3328
02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:02.880
<v Speaker 4>make their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

3329
02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:07.210
<v Speaker 4>their own boobs grow out and they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>things for their arms to and for the </v>

3330
02:29:07.210 --> 02:29:08.420
<v Speaker 4>calves to make their bodies look bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3331
02:29:08.421 --> 02:29:10.340
<v Speaker 4>it's all craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all,</v>

3332
02:29:10.420 --> 02:29:12.230
<v Speaker 4>but it's all desire to be loved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3333
02:29:12.231 --> 02:29:14.360
<v Speaker 4>It all comes from some weird thing we </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to be.</v>

3334
02:29:14.570 --> 02:29:17.390
<v Speaker 4>We want to be the desirable shape that </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's looking for.</v>

3335
02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:18.920
<v Speaker 4>Very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
