WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Or live that always sounds so fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was hard to get these things</v>

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:07.920
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's hard to just just start talking.</v>

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Not Hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm learning from you that the way</v>

4
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>you define things in your own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A language.</v>

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Language they use.</v>

6
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way you define things can oftentimes</v>

7
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:25.350
<v Speaker 1>shape exactly how those things manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in real life.</v>

8
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.830
<v Speaker 1>You say more about yourself and what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually know.</v>

10
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Not Swear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mind coaching comes in.</v>

11
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>You say more about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give away a law.</v>

12
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went.</v>

13
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The talking about something and they</v>

14
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>saying that they're really positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>about something and then you think,</v>

15
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:44.210
<v Speaker 1>well that doesn't match up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a bit like I'm a barking peg.</v>

16
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Pigs don't bog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes sense.</v>

17
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>That's how I defined it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A barking when I had to throw through</v>

18
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>the filter more fuckers.</v>

19
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about cheap mushroom</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

20
00:00:57.571 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

21
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very interesting thing we just</v>

22
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just did something called timeline</v>

23
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>therapy that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>were telling me about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Schilling told me about Ian</v>

25
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Mccall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got really interested in it,</v>

26
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what you would use if for folks</v>

27
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>who've never heard of any before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's been on the podcast before</v>

28
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Vinnie's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mental coach and a hypnotist,</v>

29
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>and before our first session,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last time you came on the podcast,</v>

30
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:27.121
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

31
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about all this hypnosis</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

32
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just a bunch of fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and people talk to them and I</v>

33
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you for sure have seen those</v>

34
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 1>televangelists that put their hands on</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and they'd go into spasms and</v>

35
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>they fall down on the floor and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim to be curative.</v>

36
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Illnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hysteria,</v>

37
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:47.900
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that makes the Hallux politics</v>

38
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.463
<v Speaker 1>bullshit?</v>

39
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Or is it something going on with some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those?</v>

40
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Pinkus is a hypnotic state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that it's,</v>

41
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a positive one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a hypnotic state,</v>

42
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.820
<v Speaker 1>they get this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone that does that,</v>

43
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I've been on a couple of podcasts now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went on the two with a cold,</v>

44
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>the dash radio story time with uncle</v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy.</v>

45
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:09.690
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing of that interview is</v>
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>

46
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Obviously a huge tip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

47
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.863
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So looking at,</v>

48
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't be hypnotized,</v>

49
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.750
<v Speaker 1>we'll find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

50
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.571
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

51
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>People love to say that though I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be hypnotized,</v>

52
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come get me Bro.</v>

53
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

54
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we may have discussed this the</v>

55
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>last time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we may not have.</v>

56
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I think stand up comedy is hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

57
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.570
<v Speaker 1>So you know what everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These algae,</v>

58
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 1>you're not in a hypnotic state listening</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>

59
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Nazi state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not listened to.</v>

60
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV,</v>

61
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>having a bath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shower,</v>

62
00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:39.234
<v Speaker 1>rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

63
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.990
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that the term hypnotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>is problematic because people think that</v>

64
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:46.680
<v Speaker 1>it takes away control from you and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts you into this Netherworld or</v>

65
00:02:46.681 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can Do.</v>

66
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.340
<v Speaker 1>But I'll hypnosis itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hypnosis.</v>

67
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>So you do it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only a potion of inflammation as my</v>

68
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:58.560
<v Speaker 1>first teacher said Keith Mayer and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to Liverpool football club.</v>

69
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Great Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

70
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>he said that</v>

71
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 2>we're only post one of information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we just guide the way and show the</v>

72
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Pearson which way to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

73
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It for the ICT said last time,</v>

74
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:10.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't do for all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at him and on,</v>

75
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

76
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's fine if you want to go with</v>
<v Speaker 2>show and you want to getting involved in</v>

77
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 2>that and way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

78
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 2>You won't have sex of the chair or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

79
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 2>That's okay for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

80
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.310
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it for you.</v>

81
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 2>What do you do it for 'em?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do because I liked people succeed and</v>

82
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 2>I know it sounds cliche and very hippy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love it.</v>

83
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 2>I like people doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

84
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I like he section as some sort of weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>noble side of me really.</v>

85
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:40.340
<v Speaker 2>I think when people conquer fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people conquer something,</v>

86
00:03:40.341 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing bad in there.</v>

87
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the things that we talked</v>

88
00:03:43.611 --> 00:03:46.730
<v Speaker 3>about when we were doing a timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about some of my</v>

89
00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:51.020
<v Speaker 3>experiences when I was younger that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinda like clung to me unfortunately or</v>

90
00:03:51.021 --> 00:03:53.150
<v Speaker 3>fortunately in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were,</v>

91
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.500
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about your own and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that when you've had some bad</v>

92
00:03:57.501 --> 00:04:02.210
<v Speaker 3>experiences in your life and when you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>had some things in your mind that stand</v>

93
00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:05.690
<v Speaker 3>out as a very memorable moments and</v>
<v Speaker 3>points in your life,</v>

94
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.730
<v Speaker 3>those things can kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't just define you,</v>

95
00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:13.460
<v Speaker 3>but that also can set you up for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

96
00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Like how you think about other people or</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you think about other things,</v>

97
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.680
<v Speaker 3>shapes your life completely and having</v>
<v Speaker 3>these bad moments and realizing what</v>

98
00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:25.580
<v Speaker 3>they were and how they defined you now</v>
<v Speaker 3>gives you motivation to help other</v>

99
00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:27.860
<v Speaker 3>people get over their bad moments.</v>

100
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just with time line therapy,</v>

101
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:33.470
<v Speaker 2>which is devised by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Tad James and uh,</v>

102
00:04:33.471 --> 00:04:34.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>

103
00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:37.620
<v Speaker 2>very successful guy at Saint James</v>
<v Speaker 2>Company.</v>

104
00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:40.020
<v Speaker 2>My teacher work for them directly</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling MCI.</v>

105
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.950
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a direct descendant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really have that.</v>

106
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 2>The technique is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

107
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:48.780
<v Speaker 2>I love it and I said to you earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe everyone in the world should</v>

108
00:04:48.781 --> 00:04:50.340
<v Speaker 2>do it and that's not a sales pitch by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>

109
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.110
<v Speaker 2>That's just my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

110
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's fabulous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

111
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.690
<v Speaker 2>people have things going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's say you've got an iphone six</v>

112
00:04:57.691 --> 00:05:00.960
<v Speaker 2>or an iphone or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't use the APPS,</v>

113
00:05:00.961 --> 00:05:04.230
<v Speaker 2>keep playing over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's still going on,</v>

114
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.170
<v Speaker 2>they are going to take some sort of toll</v>
<v Speaker 2>on you when you shut them down and</v>

115
00:05:07.171 --> 00:05:09.450
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually she'll sit down and you</v>

116
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:11.760
<v Speaker 2>save your battery and memory and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shapes your life.</v>

117
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been saying that for awhile.</v>

118
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.530
<v Speaker 3>It turns out it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody just.</v>

119
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.710
<v Speaker 3>Some dude just tweeted me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

120
00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:22.250
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a computer where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>computer is constantly has these things</v>

121
00:05:22.251 --> 00:05:25.070
<v Speaker 3>running in the background and it's using</v>
<v Speaker 3>up resources and battery power.</v>

122
00:05:25.071 --> 00:05:26.960
<v Speaker 3>Apparently with phones it does not do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

123
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.490
<v Speaker 2>Malacca d fragmentation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're on an old computer when you do</v>

124
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 2>frog it that then instead that's my app</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

125
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:33.424
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it.</v>

126
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.710
<v Speaker 3>I did too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to use that as an example,</v>

127
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:39.170
<v Speaker 3>but some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some dude who actually knows what he's</v>

128
00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 3>talking about correcting me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is taking over Internet.</v>

129
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.363
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

130
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.620
<v Speaker 3>we cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we must plow for it except our defeats</v>

131
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.670
<v Speaker 3>let's say now it's ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

132
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that,</v>

133
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

134
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own personal experiences is one of</v>

135
00:05:55.341 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 3>the reasons why you've become a coach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a mind coach,</v>

136
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 3>but a martial arts coach and that these</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences of negative moments in your</v>

137
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:06.120
<v Speaker 3>life where you've overcome them and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize I can help someone else who is</v>

138
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.830
<v Speaker 3>in that sort of same situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

139
00:06:07.831 --> 00:06:08.664
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

140
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 2>It's just like he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nice to just say it's a,</v>

141
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 2>it's not that important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

142
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 2>people believe that these sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the got,</v>

143
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 2>there is problems that are massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

144
00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna lie in some things I can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>solve.</v>

145
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm not Moses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

146
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 2>there is the risk things that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 2>if you can help somebody out and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get rid of it or change the way they</v>

148
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:31.590
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ego schilling money did sign my</v>

149
00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His relationship with his dad was miles</v>

150
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 2>better before he passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that pretty powerful?</v>

151
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe talked about it on the podcast.</v>

152
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:43.150
<v Speaker 3>He talked about it just completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed his whole perception of his</v>

153
00:06:43.151 --> 00:06:46.840
<v Speaker 3>relationship with his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who his dad was in his life and he let</v>

154
00:06:46.841 --> 00:06:47.674
<v Speaker 3>it all go.</v>

155
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just helped him tremendously.</v>

156
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.190
<v Speaker 2>What more can you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really as a coach me and had said,</v>

157
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

158
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.360
<v Speaker 2>they didn't get a fight with Justin</v>
<v Speaker 2>scoggins and that because of the weight,</v>

159
00:06:58.361 --> 00:07:02.020
<v Speaker 2>whatever her name was saying that his</v>
<v Speaker 2>life has changed since doing timeline</v>

160
00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:03.570
<v Speaker 2>therapy and doing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

161
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.180
<v Speaker 2>work with me not just timeline therapy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not just hypnosis with my coach and</v>

162
00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:09.520
<v Speaker 2>in general because it's multifaceted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rarely.</v>

163
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.740
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said his lives changed.</v>

164
00:07:11.741 --> 00:07:13.120
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a different person.</v>

165
00:07:13.121 --> 00:07:14.580
<v Speaker 2>People have noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.810
<v Speaker 2>so that's for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great news.</v>

167
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.430
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes it just takes the</v>
<v Speaker 3>realization of what's been fucking with</v>

168
00:07:20.431 --> 00:07:24.960
<v Speaker 3>you that once you realize what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have it in your mind and then</v>

169
00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:28.530
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of look at it for what it</v>
<v Speaker 3>really is instead of this thing that's</v>

170
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:33.060
<v Speaker 3>playing in the background that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite identify or you or you know it</v>

171
00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:35.280
<v Speaker 3>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you ignore it and you just.</v>

172
00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:36.840
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't ever get over it.</v>

173
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

174
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 2>He sees he's interested in either a</v>
<v Speaker 2>client the other week called joy.</v>

175
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:46.241
<v Speaker 2>She's 80 years of age and she was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a wedding in Spain for her grandson</v>

176
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.600
<v Speaker 2>and she was beside herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was terrified,</v>

177
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we did it.</v>

178
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Just a few things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

179
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.450
<v Speaker 2>little things to make you consider</v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways of looking at the anxiety</v>

180
00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:58.320
<v Speaker 2>she was getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anxiety is basically a massive with your</v>

181
00:07:58.321 --> 00:08:01.240
<v Speaker 2>unconscious mind is to focus on what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want because if you're in an anxious</v>

182
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:02.860
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you focus in on what you don't want,</v>

183
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's different levels of it.</v>

184
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she was focusing on what may go</v>

185
00:08:07.301 --> 00:08:09.460
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seller saying all this will go into a</v>

186
00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:12.100
<v Speaker 2>wedding is a celebration of two People's</v>
<v Speaker 2>matrimony,</v>

187
00:08:12.101 --> 00:08:13.980
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to be nice and Dah,</v>

188
00:08:13.981 --> 00:08:14.201
<v Speaker 2>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dah,</v>

189
00:08:14.201 --> 00:08:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Dah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't focused on that.</v>

190
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.480
<v Speaker 2>We've spoken to something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I changed that and like she was happy</v>

191
00:08:19.481 --> 00:08:22.120
<v Speaker 2>and she went to the wedding and so now</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got,</v>

192
00:08:22.121 --> 00:08:23.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's 80 years of age.</v>

193
00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:24.520
<v Speaker 2>You may not be going to Lowe's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>wedding,</v>

194
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.050
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

195
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.000
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the job itself,</v>

196
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.930
<v Speaker 2>what can you say about nice transforms</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

197
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:32.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

198
00:08:32.911 --> 00:08:33.600
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

199
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.640
<v Speaker 3>adora no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you do.</v>

200
00:08:35.641 --> 00:08:37.030
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really,</v>

201
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.260
<v Speaker 3>it comes out of you when you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really do love it.</v>

202
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

203
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that human beings don't</v>

204
00:08:45.121 --> 00:08:49.320
<v Speaker 3>really live long enough to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 3>what this is.</v>

205
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that is one of the major</v>

206
00:08:51.571 --> 00:08:54.030
<v Speaker 3>problems that a lot of us have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a certain amount of momentum</v>

207
00:08:54.031 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 3>that comes from our childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's</v>

208
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 1>good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we followed that momentum into our</v>

209
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.670
<v Speaker 1>adulthood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes trying to hit the break,</v>

210
00:09:03.671 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 1>sometimes trying to correct the course</v>
<v Speaker 1>and oftentimes using things like alcohol</v>

211
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:13.671
<v Speaker 1>or drugs or gambling or anything to</v>
<v Speaker 1>distract us from the pain of whatever,</v>

212
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>the instability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

213
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:18.330
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking with us.</v>

214
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.150
<v Speaker 1>And then you get to be a certain age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize like,</v>

215
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm barely figuring this thing out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost dead.</v>

216
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the last thing.</v>

217
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:30.980
<v Speaker 1>He's signing all the papers on the year</v>
<v Speaker 1>on pass know we should do.</v>

218
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you definitely don't want that.</v>

219
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:35.870
<v Speaker 1>But you also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

220
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.410
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big thing that people always</v>

221
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:42.150
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like living in the moment.</v>

222
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.060
<v Speaker 1>It is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very difficult thing to do for</v>

223
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 1>some strange reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

224
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you worried about Somara yeah.</v>

225
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Like worried about light around or</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's why it Easter.</v>

228
00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna pretend to walk in a</v>

229
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:00.560
<v Speaker 1>cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.430
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to come in with all these</v>

231
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.140
<v Speaker 1>long statements and write these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

232
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.860
<v Speaker 1>it's no one does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's towson.</v>

233
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.820

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

234
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:12.970
<v Speaker 1>With religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To do that,</v>

235
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.130
<v Speaker 1>one of the bigger issues is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are sort of proselytizing or</v>

236
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:21.150
<v Speaker 1>the people that are promoting it there</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways,</v>

237
00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:23.670
<v Speaker 1>many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially priests and things along</v>

238
00:10:23.671 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 1>those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's so disappointing when</v>

239
00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:27.030
<v Speaker 1>you hear about child sex abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monks,</v>

240
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.970
<v Speaker 1>priests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretending to be something holy</v>

241
00:10:29.971 --> 00:10:34.140
<v Speaker 1>and special and above you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why they can bestow this</v>

242
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:37.640
<v Speaker 1>knowledge upon you while they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're talking directly from God</v>

243
00:10:37.641 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were all peasants in this weird</v>

244
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.270
<v Speaker 1>exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

245
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not conduit.</v>

246
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.810
<v Speaker 1>So are they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.730
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think good get delusions have gotten.</v>

248
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

249
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 1>and I've met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met you and I'm a fan of yours and</v>

250
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:54.080
<v Speaker 1>they really enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I,</v>

251
00:10:54.081 --> 00:10:57.210
<v Speaker 1>like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never had Wim Hoff who I love</v>

252
00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Russell Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>

253
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Dr Rhonda,</v>

254
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Patrick and Joe and Ian and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that component and all the fights</v>

255
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.310
<v Speaker 1>companion and I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

256
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.100
<v Speaker 1>I like it the way that normal and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think he,</v>

257
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it gives us the right to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try and walk them.</v>

258
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

259
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:11.831
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

260
00:11:11.831 --> 00:11:12.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

261
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been spot if he ties because of</v>

262
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:16.350
<v Speaker 1>your shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in Thailand and not black,</v>

263
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I still wouldn't be any different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

264
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.010
<v Speaker 1>you especially because you're so aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these traps that the mindsets,</v>

265
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
<v Speaker 1>it is a weird dance that we do in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>life where you're trying to sort of</v>

266
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:35.220
<v Speaker 1>manage the mind and figure out what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that's holding you back or helping</v>

267
00:11:35.221 --> 00:11:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of guide yourself through this</v>

268
00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:41.700
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nine Times out of 10 your unconscious</v>

269
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.700
<v Speaker 1>mind is trying to help you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people decipher it wrongly.</v>

270
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it stays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the language that you mind speaks.</v>

271
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Understand that to move away from chaos.</v>

272
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do a technique if that's</v>

273
00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:53.660
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

274
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 1>You just</v>

275
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.010
<v Speaker 2>want everybody not to be driving when</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this.</v>

276
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.850
<v Speaker 2>All operating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any machinery here.</v>

277
00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:00.590
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do a technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks strapping,</v>

278
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.010
<v Speaker 2>but he relax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:04.710
<v Speaker 2>and I want to share that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

280
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos is not easy,</v>

281
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:09.760
<v Speaker 2>life is easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life isn't easy.</v>

282
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Speaker 2>You got all sorts of cesium bursts in</v>
<v Speaker 2>burst.</v>

283
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

284
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 2>you can be me going along and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden you get sideswiped by something,</v>

285
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.240
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and can,</v>

286
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not if for sex or,</v>

287
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc. So it's about trying to calm the</v>

288
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:23.690
<v Speaker 2>chaos down and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

289
00:12:23.691 --> 00:12:26.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just get your mind to settle and</v>

290
00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:28.390
<v Speaker 2>give yourself even a few moments of</v>
<v Speaker 2>peace.</v>

291
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Even a few momentS of patient the day</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be,</v>

292
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be beneficial to everybody.</v>

293
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:35.884
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

294
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.720
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

295
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.810
<v Speaker 2>my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

296
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for what it's worth,</v>

297
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:41.920
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

298
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.170
<v Speaker 3>I think we could all use some peace and</v>
<v Speaker 3>reflection.</v>

299
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.560
<v Speaker 3>So that's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

300
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:51.860
<v Speaker 3>And I think like many of us are in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of ways are a prisoner of doubt</v>

301
00:12:54.621 --> 00:12:56.300
<v Speaker 3>and fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are,</v>

302
00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:01.330
<v Speaker 3>those are two big factors in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's lives and a lot of people's</v>

303
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.020
<v Speaker 3>response to doubt and fear is to not do</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

304
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.870
<v Speaker 3>to not take any chances to try to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe,</v>

305
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.080
<v Speaker 3>to try to live like very a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>controlled and simple existence,</v>

306
00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:21.110
<v Speaker 3>but then you miss out on experiences to</v>
<v Speaker 3>look back on is that you also miss out</v>

307
00:13:21.111 --> 00:13:26.111
<v Speaker 3>on the the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just living life without fear</v>

308
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:31.040
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean there's not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>moments where you're scared and and</v>

309
00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:34.940
<v Speaker 3>taking chances because those moments</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you do take chances are you do</v>

310
00:13:34.941 --> 00:13:39.020
<v Speaker 3>something new and it could be as simple</v>
<v Speaker 3>as like being a 50 year old man starting</v>

311
00:13:39.021 --> 00:13:41.270
<v Speaker 3>jujitsu or 50 year old woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

312
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.800
<v Speaker 3>starting a martial arts class or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

313
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.210
<v Speaker 3>Something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I'm doing this,</v>

314
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:49.070
<v Speaker 3>but those moments where you put yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>into vulnerable positions can be very</v>

315
00:13:49.071 --> 00:13:52.550
<v Speaker 3>beneficial for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a matter of avoiding</v>

316
00:13:52.551 --> 00:13:56.420
<v Speaker 3>everything that causes you fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a matter of embracing the</v>

317
00:13:56.421 --> 00:14:01.421
<v Speaker 3>uncertainty of life and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience it with as much positivity</v>

318
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:07.460
<v Speaker 3>and as much openness and as much with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the least resistance as possible.</v>

319
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything was new.</v>

320
00:14:08.591 --> 00:14:12.460
<v Speaker 2>Once</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's done something learned</v>

321
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:14.630
<v Speaker 2>something the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time he.</v>

322
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

323
00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.470
<v Speaker 2>and for me so people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a massive,</v>

324
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 2>massive amount of successes you've had</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your life that you thought was</v>

325
00:14:23.981 --> 00:14:28.981
<v Speaker 2>impossible to tie in your life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Riding a bike for me driving that was</v>

326
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:31.600
<v Speaker 2>awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Driving mouth wash.</v>

327
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just one of those things that got</v>

328
00:14:33.661 --> 00:14:38.170
<v Speaker 2>into my head that I was really shy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another car I love rubbish.</v>

329
00:14:38.171 --> 00:14:43.171
<v Speaker 2>I love that expression and the british,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was rubbish at it and I'm so they are</v>

330
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:48.601
<v Speaker 2>to basically do it because I lived far</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from my kids and now I can drive</v>

331
00:14:48.941 --> 00:14:49.950
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

332
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.420
<v Speaker 2>it was something out I to really push</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself to do.</v>

333
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.780
<v Speaker 2>But I think we're all a collection of</v>
<v Speaker 2>successes trying case writing the date.</v>

334
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know all what reed,</v>

335
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling the time,</v>

336
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these loads are thinking what we treat.</v>

337
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 2>So you're busy kicking the shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves about what we've done wrong,</v>

338
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

339
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.140
<v Speaker 2>when I watched holly holm fight last</v>
<v Speaker 2>time when she fought,</v>

340
00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:14.680
<v Speaker 2>she looked shellshocked and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

341
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.000
<v Speaker 2>that's my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She looked shellshocked.</v>

342
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Do you think she was perhaps</v>

343
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.850
<v Speaker 3>shellshocked by the last to misha tate</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then jumping right back into the</v>

344
00:15:21.851 --> 00:15:23.900
<v Speaker 3>octagon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or do you think that was.</v>

345
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.280
<v Speaker 3>She was fighting a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult opponent</v>

346
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.840
<v Speaker 2>both because valentina</v>

347
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.400
<v Speaker 3>is a volunteership genco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The woman who she fought is one of the</v>

348
00:15:33.401 --> 00:15:36.130
<v Speaker 3>most experienced strikers in all of mma.</v>

349
00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the sister was on a infusion season</v>

350
00:15:38.891 --> 00:15:42.020
<v Speaker 2>six with us in Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

351
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.400
<v Speaker 2>So she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's from Peru,</v>

352
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.760
<v Speaker 2>things lives in Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now she,</v>

353
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.050
<v Speaker 2>she's russian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>

354
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.360
<v Speaker 2>But she still looked shellshocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

355
00:15:49.361 --> 00:15:49.710
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

356
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:54.280
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the process.</v>

357
00:15:54.281 --> 00:15:58.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think a lot of gems because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's macho because it's fight in a year</v>

358
00:15:58.061 --> 00:15:59.770
<v Speaker 2>you'd be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And pat on thE back bar.</v>

359
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.250
<v Speaker 2>You did great today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a demon like this,</v>

360
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:08.000
<v Speaker 2>it's like you do know whitewash and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>put all your white in and then you your.</v>

361
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.290
<v Speaker 2>I served almost conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh right.</v>

362
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.270
<v Speaker 2>I have got my diet right amman point for</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a weight,</v>

363
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:13.751
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

364
00:16:13.751 --> 00:16:15.790
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My coach says mma bjj is great or</v>

365
00:16:15.791 --> 00:16:17.680
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or boxing or whatever the sport may be,</v>

366
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.380
<v Speaker 2>or even if it's not sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know your boss or whatever,</v>

367
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.230
<v Speaker 2>and then all of a sudden you put one red</v>
<v Speaker 2>sock in your wash.</v>

368
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Everything goes pink so that little</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that can infect you.</v>

369
00:16:27.761 --> 00:16:28.594
<v Speaker 2>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

370
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.680
<v Speaker 2>you might sit there and the loneliest</v>
<v Speaker 2>places I think find someone and lost it</v>

371
00:16:32.681 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 2>in the changing rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's my opinion of fighters</v>

372
00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.040
<v Speaker 2>did lose in the changing rooms to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>one sort of negative thought.</v>

373
00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:41.800
<v Speaker 2>The mind whispers something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a shower and all of a sudden</v>

374
00:16:41.801 --> 00:16:42.970
<v Speaker 2>you drag it with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

375
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.860
<v Speaker 2>fighter fights can be lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no matter how positive you are</v>

376
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.410
<v Speaker 2>fighting anderson silva and you pee in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his prime.</v>

377
00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably,</v>

378
00:16:51.431 --> 00:16:52.690
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is that.</v>

379
00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.800
<v Speaker 2>That's why I said he's not a guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Using a mind coach isn't a guarantee</v>

380
00:16:56.801 --> 00:16:58.570
<v Speaker 2>you're going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

381
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.260
<v Speaker 2>it's more help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Astronomer condition is not going to</v>

382
00:17:02.261 --> 00:17:04.350
<v Speaker 2>make you win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a massive help you.</v>

383
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

384
00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

385
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I know the benefit of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the benefit of it because you</v>

386
00:17:08.981 --> 00:17:12.430
<v Speaker 2>did a little bit of hypnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>josie and the benefit of it in his life</v>

387
00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:13.820
<v Speaker 2>as well as any fight in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

388
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:17.050
<v Speaker 2>liam harrison is a good friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jordan watson,</v>

389
00:17:17.051 --> 00:17:19.240
<v Speaker 2>the other people that have worked with</v>
<v Speaker 2>another people that will work in the</v>

390
00:17:19.241 --> 00:17:22.780
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does give you a of nerves and self</v>

391
00:17:22.781 --> 00:17:26.270
<v Speaker 2>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it massive hole in your boat if</v>

392
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.900
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do something where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to have confidence for everything</v>

393
00:17:28.901 --> 00:17:29.740
<v Speaker 2>in life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes indeed.</v>

394
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:34.210
<v Speaker 3>This one of the things that I like about</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting is that it's so condensed.</v>

395
00:17:34.211 --> 00:17:37.180
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very extreme situation.</v>

396
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.910
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like problem solving,</v>

397
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:44.440
<v Speaker 3>condensed to like one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>intense versions of it that we possibly</v>

398
00:17:44.441 --> 00:17:47.440
<v Speaker 3>can experience other than war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>war,</v>

399
00:17:47.441 --> 00:17:50.400
<v Speaker 3>probably being the most intense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem solving,</v>

400
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.980
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're presenting with all these</v>

401
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.540
<v Speaker 3>incredibly difficult challenges and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to figure your way through it and</v>

402
00:17:57.541 --> 00:18:00.960
<v Speaker 3>with a poor mindset or a faulty mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're,</v>

403
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:01.670
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

404
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.270
<v Speaker 3>it's like having a flat tire or having</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad breaks.</v>

405
00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:09.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're traveling in a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>precarious way.</v>

406
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.450
<v Speaker 3>It's you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a lot of holes in whatever</v>

407
00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:17.030
<v Speaker 3>method of distribution that your</v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts and your actions are,</v>

408
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.690
<v Speaker 3>are passing through your system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your system of life,</v>

409
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.850
<v Speaker 3>like who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you think about things.</v>

410
00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:26.010
<v Speaker 3>When you think about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you would think about other people</v>

411
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:31.440
<v Speaker 3>like that shapes all the results,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the interactions that you have with</v>

412
00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:33.720
<v Speaker 3>people are shaped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things that I've always</v>

413
00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 3>said about like a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>interactIons that police officers have</v>

414
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.573
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

415
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:43.580
<v Speaker 3>with people like how many of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>interactions would be completely</v>

416
00:18:43.591 --> 00:18:45.930
<v Speaker 3>different with a more calm police</v>
<v Speaker 3>officer,</v>

417
00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:50.520
<v Speaker 3>a better person who's better at handling</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and how many of them are shaped</v>

418
00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:55.521
<v Speaker 3>by someone who's just not that smart or</v>
<v Speaker 3>too authoritarian or doesn't know how to</v>

419
00:18:56.071 --> 00:19:00.130
<v Speaker 3>read people well or doesn't know how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>broach a conversation well.</v>

420
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes back dealing with something in</v>

421
00:19:02.301 --> 00:19:03.440
<v Speaker 2>their own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

422
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Dating me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something in narrow mind,</v>

423
00:19:05.541 --> 00:19:07.120
<v Speaker 2>like we talked about limitless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't we?</v>

424
00:19:07.121 --> 00:19:10.400
<v Speaker 2>The movie bradley cooper first takes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pill and he saw,</v>

425
00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.320
<v Speaker 2>he said the chinese lady on the top of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stairs,</v>

426
00:19:12.321 --> 00:19:14.180
<v Speaker 2>I think she's his lung lady ladies show</v>
<v Speaker 2>you or something.</v>

427
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:15.890
<v Speaker 2>She's going bananas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

428
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Just going bananas are him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

429
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.440
<v Speaker 2>talking rubbish and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tcc has given him lots of grief and</v>

430
00:19:21.441 --> 00:19:22.071
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

431
00:19:22.071 --> 00:19:25.610
<v Speaker 2>But it went beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all is something that was upsetting</v>

432
00:19:25.611 --> 00:19:26.444
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

433
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.570
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you come across a lot in</v>

434
00:19:29.571 --> 00:19:32.570
<v Speaker 2>timeline already in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rarely is there.</v>

435
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.170
<v Speaker 2>They're actually taught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're Not really taught,</v>

436
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.710
<v Speaker 2>people are not theIr behaviors as</v>
<v Speaker 2>cliched nlp,</v>

437
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.610
<v Speaker 2>nlp chat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if people are not happy in neuro</v>

438
00:19:40.611 --> 00:19:43.190
<v Speaker 2>linguistic programming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that about?</v>

439
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.620
<v Speaker 2>A maker engineer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robin's right.</v>

440
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.200
<v Speaker 2>YeAh.</v>

441
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Anthony robbins and john grinder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard bandler were the first people to</v>

442
00:19:51.111 --> 00:19:53.440
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They modeled a hypnotherapist called</v>

443
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.110
<v Speaker 2>milton erickson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>milton erickson language.</v>

444
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Milton erickson was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good hypnotherapists and very,</v>

445
00:20:01.881 --> 00:20:04.070
<v Speaker 2>very clever on indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

446
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.200
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of that I used some of that,</v>

447
00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

448
00:20:08.511 --> 00:20:09.270
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

449
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.970
<v Speaker 2>as you get anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand this,</v>

450
00:20:10.971 --> 00:20:11.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

451
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.180
<v Speaker 2>you do your podcast energy as you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more into it,</v>

452
00:20:14.181 --> 00:20:16.490
<v Speaker 2>you get a feel of fur and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do with my job,</v>

453
00:20:16.491 --> 00:20:18.180
<v Speaker 2>wIth the mind coaches they get afraid</v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

454
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:20.600
<v Speaker 2>But I don't always use hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do use it and it was his,</v>

455
00:20:20.601 --> 00:20:22.710
<v Speaker 2>but not always because it's not always</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

456
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.370
<v Speaker 2>It's getting people thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reframIng something.</v>

457
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.800
<v Speaker 2>So maybe thought of it like that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>move that out the way.</v>

458
00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:30.610
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that changes people's opinions and,</v>

459
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.270
<v Speaker 2>and come out massive effects on them.</v>

460
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.820
<v Speaker 3>So the more people you interact with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more people you apply these</v>

461
00:20:36.821 --> 00:20:38.740
<v Speaker 3>techniques to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better your understanding of how</v>

462
00:20:38.741 --> 00:20:39.700
<v Speaker 3>these techniques work.</v>

463
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rolled a better understanding of</v>

464
00:20:41.261 --> 00:20:43.230
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you've got to be out at sorts of</v>

465
00:20:43.231 --> 00:20:46.370
<v Speaker 2>people as well doing this gel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think you've got to be at a church</v>

466
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not saying I'm massively,</v>

467
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.680
<v Speaker 1>no loads of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know little bits about</v>

468
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

469
00:20:51.761 --> 00:20:54.310
<v Speaker 1>and I don't pretend to know about a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things,</v>

470
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.600
<v Speaker 1>but he's just about just being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with people and actually get</v>

471
00:20:58.601 --> 00:20:59.630
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

472
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.380
<v Speaker 1>actually getting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People pretty much want the same thing.</v>

473
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.890
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wants to live life as,</v>

474
00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.940
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as exciting or as easy as possible.</v>

475
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:11.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

476
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.650
<v Speaker 1>like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just about language.</v>

477
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:16.870
<v Speaker 1>It's just about deciphering the</v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

478
00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:21.871
<v Speaker 1>what they're actually talking and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even really as easy as possible because</v>

479
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.820
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people want a life full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure,</v>

480
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.580
<v Speaker 1>but what they don't want to do is trip</v>
<v Speaker 1>over themselves.</v>

481
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a difficulty and Saved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to climb a mountain.</v>

482
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that climbing a mountain is</v>

483
00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:36.010
<v Speaker 1>difficult enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

484
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:36.760
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

485
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.020
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out what way to grip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have strong hands and strong</v>

486
00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:44.080
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have an overall awareness of</v>

487
00:21:44.081 --> 00:21:48.930
<v Speaker 1>your body and balance and you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically fit enough to build a pool</v>

488
00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:53.940
<v Speaker 1>yourself and climb up this mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're paralyzed with fear,</v>

489
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.770
<v Speaker 1>if you are consumed with self doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were overrun with guilt,</v>

490
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:04.390
<v Speaker 1>if your body is just dealing with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds,</v>

491
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:10.240
<v Speaker 1>all the haunts of your past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the compounds.</v>

492
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Whatever difficultY and it makes it way</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

493
00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.500
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

494
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.070
<v Speaker 1>people come to me after fights and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

495
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 1>they talk about the last fight is still</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in it.</v>

496
00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't tAke the positive from it and</v>

497
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I'd say take the ponds and new blah blah</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

498
00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.330
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hard to say,</v>

499
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to do rather than to out</v>

500
00:22:31.231 --> 00:22:32.064
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

501
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

502
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

503
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.580
<v Speaker 1>So you just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

504
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:42.030
<v Speaker 1>he's like just just getting the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to sometimes forget something,</v>

505
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.040
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just move on and write.</v>

506
00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something.</v>

507
00:22:45.911 --> 00:22:47.650
<v Speaker 1>What did you learn this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and this.</v>

508
00:22:47.651 --> 00:22:48.484
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the point.</v>

509
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what we know when we was doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>timeline therapy,</v>

510
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was things you learn from that</v>

511
00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:58.110
<v Speaker 1>situation that got you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got you.</v>

512
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.060
<v Speaker 1>The ufc come and say successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up on a lot.</v>

513
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.030
<v Speaker 1>He's got your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got because of them things that</v>

514
00:23:04.031 --> 00:23:05.320
<v Speaker 1>molded you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

515
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.680
<v Speaker 1>some people do get consumed by fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why I.</v>

516
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.800
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like to change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

517
00:23:11.801 --> 00:23:13.120
<v Speaker 1>I like to change the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

518
00:23:13.121 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big problem that a lot of</v>

519
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:18.730
<v Speaker 1>people have where they define themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>by their past.</v>

520
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.040
<v Speaker 1>They look at their past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't think they could ever grow</v>

521
00:23:21.041 --> 00:23:22.850
<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that is who I am.</v>

522
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not losers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy who crashed his car on that</v>

523
00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:26.910
<v Speaker 1>guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

524
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.500
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was that moment that never</v>
<v Speaker 1>did it.</v>

525
00:23:29.501 --> 00:23:30.730
<v Speaker 1>So therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

526
00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:35.190
<v Speaker 1>like money is the root of all evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have money or they saw your</v>

527
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.160
<v Speaker 1>keynote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to tread on people to be a</v>

528
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:41.350
<v Speaker 1>success as cliched saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pop up from nowhere.</v>

529
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.720
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real weird one that comes up a</v>

530
00:23:43.721 --> 00:23:46.330
<v Speaker 1>lot that almost like it's impossible to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be successful</v>

531
00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:51.330
<v Speaker 3>in altruistic that year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That money is acquired only by stepping</v>

532
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:54.470
<v Speaker 3>on other people and fucking over people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and anybody that's really big in</v>

533
00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:57.590
<v Speaker 3>business get like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read that once from someone who</v>

534
00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.950
<v Speaker 3>actually a very smart person and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>show me someone who's really good in</v>

535
00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:02.930
<v Speaker 3>business and I guarantee you they fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone over,</v>

536
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.050
<v Speaker 3>and I like that as everyday that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's as a scapegoat.</v>

537
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.900
<v Speaker 3>The scapegoat for your own financial</v>
<v Speaker 3>failure.</v>

538
00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Closest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more money you get,</v>

539
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.500
<v Speaker 2>the more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more people you can help.</v>

540
00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.920
<v Speaker 3>There's that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more opportunity.</v>

541
00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I believe and I'm believing</v>

542
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.380
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's cliched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing about money is to just</v>

543
00:24:22.381 --> 00:24:25.920
<v Speaker 2>to keep people down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's that existed.</v>

544
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.940
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His language to keep people down,</v>

545
00:24:27.941 --> 00:24:31.260
<v Speaker 2>to keep people just there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep them in the place.</v>

546
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also self self prescribe to a lot</v>

547
00:24:35.671 --> 00:24:38.040
<v Speaker 3>of people do it to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's doing it to you.</v>

548
00:24:38.041 --> 00:24:40.140
<v Speaker 3>You just want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to give yourself a little</v>

549
00:24:40.141 --> 00:24:45.141
<v Speaker 3>excuse for not going after whatever your</v>
<v Speaker 3>goals are or not pursuing whatever</v>

550
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.030
<v Speaker 3>interest you actually have and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing it safe.</v>

551
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.840
<v Speaker 3>That playing it safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a big part of that is what we</v>

552
00:24:51.841 --> 00:24:53.190
<v Speaker 3>were talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>

553
00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:57.180
<v Speaker 3>this need to avoid any further pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

554
00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing wanting to Japan is like</v>

555
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.970
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to like yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

556
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:07.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to be not fun.</v>

557
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta have fun and laugh at yourself</v>

558
00:25:10.961 --> 00:25:12.960
<v Speaker 2>and not take yourself massively tissues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

559
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.900
<v Speaker 2>the things that you want to be serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be supporting yourself less</v>

560
00:25:16.901 --> 00:25:18.610
<v Speaker 2>than 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Support is sabotage,</v>

561
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.470
<v Speaker 2>which has a say in which I believe it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

562
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:21.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not supporting yourself,</v>

563
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:23.920
<v Speaker 2>aesop mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only you but you sabotage and</v>

564
00:25:23.921 --> 00:25:27.400
<v Speaker 2>everybody else around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think people struggle with that be</v>

565
00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.680
<v Speaker 2>in being all right to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

566
00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:34.770
<v Speaker 2>the so easy to shit and stupid and fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so easily swallowed that you,</v>

567
00:25:37.321 --> 00:25:40.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people be become used to it and then</v>

568
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.210
<v Speaker 2>they want to be a success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense.</v>

569
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Now I recently the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

570
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:50.270
<v Speaker 2>these people that want to fight and then</v>

571
00:25:50.561 --> 00:25:53.710
<v Speaker 2>And then you find out what they did onto</v>
<v Speaker 2>the runup or what did you do?</v>

577
00:26:05.951 --> 00:26:08.200
<v Speaker 2>yourself and in the way that you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

578
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.430
<v Speaker 2>What do you expect your mind not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to support you if you don't support it.</v>

579
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.120
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the things that I felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>when jon jones tested positive for</v>

580
00:26:17.121 --> 00:26:19.670
<v Speaker 3>cocaine three weeks out of his fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>with daniel cormier,</v>

581
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:20.504
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ooh.</v>

582
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.740
<v Speaker 3>Like he's not even as I look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only was anything wrong with doing.</v>

583
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if there's anything wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>with doing cocaine.</v>

584
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.660
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a positive drug put.</v>

585
00:26:29.661 --> 00:26:32.630
<v Speaker 3>Some people enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people enjoy drinking.</v>

586
00:26:32.631 --> 00:26:34.610
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's a positive drug</v>

587
00:26:34.611 --> 00:26:36.800
<v Speaker 3>necessarily either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know because I don't have</v>

588
00:26:36.801 --> 00:26:39.800
<v Speaker 3>experience with cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not something you're supposed</v>

589
00:26:39.801 --> 00:26:42.830
<v Speaker 3>to be doing three weeks outside of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>world title fight with one of the best</v>

590
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 3>wrestlers in the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the most difficult challenges</v>

591
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:50.640
<v Speaker 3>you've ever faced in your professional</v>
<v Speaker 3>career and you're out doing blow just 21</v>

592
00:26:50.641 --> 00:26:52.050
<v Speaker 3>days before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

593
00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the most talented take the</v>

594
00:26:54.521 --> 00:26:57.970
<v Speaker 2>gifts that they've been given and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>abused them in a way.</v>

595
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:59.830
<v Speaker 2>I met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met jon jones.</v>

596
00:26:59.831 --> 00:27:00.664
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

597
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.610
<v Speaker 2>it's different to say the least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In what way?</v>

598
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.510
<v Speaker 2>She's just a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a dot.</v>

599
00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of only met him briefly.</v>

600
00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:15.620
<v Speaker 2>Why was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might been Russia at the legend that</v>

601
00:27:15.621 --> 00:27:17.080
<v Speaker 2>is a show there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

602
00:27:17.081 --> 00:27:17.914
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just,</v>

603
00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.560
<v Speaker 2>he was very sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all over the place bouncing</v>

604
00:27:20.561 --> 00:27:23.710
<v Speaker 2>around and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't expect him to be like</v>

605
00:27:23.711 --> 00:27:25.720
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by all over the place?</v>

606
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Bouncing just a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just said to me,</v>

607
00:27:27.761 --> 00:27:29.800
<v Speaker 2>hi blue eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like hello.</v>

608
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.450
<v Speaker 2>He's massive from dangerous and I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

609
00:27:34.451 --> 00:27:37.180
<v Speaker 2>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just found it a bit strange.</v>

610
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.730
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I read it with you.</v>

611
00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:43.900
<v Speaker 2>I just found him different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say that I just found him</v>

612
00:27:43.901 --> 00:27:47.430
<v Speaker 2>different and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to read into this and I'm</v>

613
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:52.430
<v Speaker 2>trying to avoid it badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know him,</v>

614
00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:53.830
<v Speaker 2>but I met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

615
00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.330
<v Speaker 2>it was different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's put it that way,</v>

616
00:27:55.331 --> 00:27:56.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

617
00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.150
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>

618
00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.480
<v Speaker 2>if someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

619
00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.890
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what's gone on in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>life and uh,</v>

620
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what's going on in his</v>

621
00:28:04.211 --> 00:28:06.700
<v Speaker 2>life and you could say that about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone could say that about a serial</v>

622
00:28:06.701 --> 00:28:07.420
<v Speaker 2>killer couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

623
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.950
<v Speaker 2>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on in his life?</v>

624
00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:10.560
<v Speaker 2>It's not useful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

625
00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.100
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there is some things that you</v>

626
00:28:12.101 --> 00:28:13.630
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't do and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he shouldn't be doing it,</v>

627
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.150
<v Speaker 2>but these reason,</v>

628
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:19.160
<v Speaker 3>if you listen to john's coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will tell you that john surrounds</v>

629
00:28:19.161 --> 00:28:24.161
<v Speaker 3>himself with the wrong people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And john is an extremely talented guy,</v>

630
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.980
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only like maybe one of the most</v>

631
00:28:27.981 --> 00:28:32.630
<v Speaker 3>talented guys to ever compete in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sport and incredibly strong mentally</v>

632
00:28:32.631 --> 00:28:36.530
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because despite all of his issues with</v>

633
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.970
<v Speaker 3>maybe not preparing as well as you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the chips are down,</v>

634
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.460
<v Speaker 3>that guy gets through things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He overcomes.</v>

635
00:28:43.461 --> 00:28:46.130
<v Speaker 3>Adversity is not a front runner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the one that broke his toe,</v>

636
00:28:46.131 --> 00:28:47.480
<v Speaker 3>isn't a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was terrific.</v>

637
00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.850
<v Speaker 3>So he's coming and he didn't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that was happening,</v>

638
00:28:49.851 --> 00:28:54.230
<v Speaker 3>that that happened actually in the final</v>
<v Speaker 3>flurry where you stopped shale son and a</v>

639
00:28:54.231 --> 00:28:57.620
<v Speaker 3>more impressive performances when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought vito belfort,</v>

640
00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.380
<v Speaker 3>vito,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or completely hyperextended his arm and</v>

641
00:29:00.381 --> 00:29:03.400
<v Speaker 3>he would not tap you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was for his title vii tour.</v>

642
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:05.630
<v Speaker 3>Came that close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it for the title?</v>

643
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.700
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might've been non title fight,</v>

644
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.510
<v Speaker 3>but vetoer came find out that was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>title fight or non title fight.</v>

645
00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Either way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vidor came that close to legitimately</v>

646
00:29:15.111 --> 00:29:20.010
<v Speaker 3>beating John Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That close god fully locked in armbar.</v>

647
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:23.000
<v Speaker 3>That would have made 90 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>professional fighters in the world tap.</v>

648
00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what makes him who he is.</v>

649
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:26.930
<v Speaker 2>But he put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you couldn't say no to.</v>

650
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:28.280
<v Speaker 2>It was a title fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

651
00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.100
<v Speaker 2>Jamie just looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't say no to some below.</v>

652
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Well he could say no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want.</v>

653
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Didn't want us to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of.</v>

654
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

655
00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.120
<v Speaker 2>There's some sort of weakness but isn't</v>

656
00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:43.400
<v Speaker 3>say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't know if it is a.</v>

657
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be something you should be</v>

658
00:29:45.161 --> 00:29:47.800
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also indulgence.</v>

659
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>he likes to party,</v>

660
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.230
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then there's.</v>

661
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.900
<v Speaker 3>Isn't there also the issue that fighters</v>
<v Speaker 3>in particular,</v>

662
00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:01.210
<v Speaker 3>especially guys that have a lot of hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>gym sessions and a lot of hard fights,</v>

663
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:06.010
<v Speaker 3>they have impulse control problems and</v>
<v Speaker 3>those impulse control problems.</v>

664
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm obviously not a scientist or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor,</v>

665
00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:11.500
<v Speaker 3>but when you talk to neurologists and</v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroscientists,</v>

666
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:16.660
<v Speaker 3>they will tell you that there are direct</v>
<v Speaker 3>correlations between head impacts and</v>

667
00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:21.661
<v Speaker 3>poor impulse control is absolutely a</v>
<v Speaker 3>direct impact and I'm not looking for a</v>

668
00:30:22.421 --> 00:30:26.770
<v Speaker 3>scapegoat in my own life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've looked back at some of the poor</v>

669
00:30:26.771 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 3>decision making that I've done in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

670
00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 3>particularly in my fighting times like</v>
<v Speaker 3>back then and I was like,</v>

671
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.170
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if a lot of that was getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit in the head a lot.</v>

672
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it can't be good to get kicked in</v>

673
00:30:39.491 --> 00:30:41.050
<v Speaker 3>the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just never good.</v>

674
00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:45.310
<v Speaker 3>Not the best is not good and so if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been kicked in the head or</v>

675
00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:47.800
<v Speaker 3>punched in the face or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any kind of impact.</v>

676
00:30:47.801 --> 00:30:49.790
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing about football</v>
<v Speaker 3>players.</v>

677
00:30:49.791 --> 00:30:53.470
<v Speaker 3>They're saying now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it even a shot to the chest even</v>

678
00:30:53.471 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 3>getting tackled like someone rams at you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and slams their shoulders into your</v>

679
00:30:57.011 --> 00:31:00.250
<v Speaker 3>chest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The brain gets jostled around.</v>

680
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:02.950
<v Speaker 3>You might not have a bruise on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>face,</v>

681
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:07.300
<v Speaker 3>but your brain is receiving essentially</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same impact as a punch.</v>

682
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.110
<v Speaker 3>Just kinda crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

683
00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.750
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people might not like they</v>
<v Speaker 3>split.</v>

684
00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:17.020
<v Speaker 3>It is a shame that jon jones is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

685
00:31:17.021 --> 00:31:18.840
<v Speaker 3>Because he's got to look back on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

686
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.950
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got to look back on him and they</v>

687
00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.240
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

688
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:25.590
<v Speaker 3>he's also got to figure out what it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he took no data.</v>

689
00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:26.950
<v Speaker 3>They don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

690
00:31:26.951 --> 00:31:31.930
<v Speaker 3>They have an isolated what he took,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the whole lifestyle,</v>

691
00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:36.820
<v Speaker 3>it's most certainly an issue and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like one of those things where</v>

692
00:31:36.821 --> 00:31:38.950
<v Speaker 3>you say you don't know what you got</v>
<v Speaker 3>until it's gone.</v>

693
00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of gone for a little while,</v>

694
00:31:41.351 --> 00:31:44.590
<v Speaker 3>but not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was always still in the mix and there</v>

695
00:31:44.591 --> 00:31:48.710
<v Speaker 3>was always multimillion dollar fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a waiting and then he fought over in st</v>

696
00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Speaker 3>prue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's back in the mix and everything's</v>

697
00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:55.600
<v Speaker 3>looking good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's slated to fight at ufc 200 against</v>

698
00:31:55.601 --> 00:31:58.240
<v Speaker 3>daniel cormier is going to make 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>million bucks.</v>

699
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.480
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be giant and then whoosh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gone for something that if you talk</v>

700
00:32:04.521 --> 00:32:09.220
<v Speaker 3>to people that are experts in</v>
<v Speaker 3>performance enhancing drugs,</v>

701
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:12.310
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell you that this clomiphene is</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he got popped for,</v>

702
00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:17.170
<v Speaker 3>which is an anti estrogen supplement</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not even beneficial.</v>

703
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:21.040
<v Speaker 3>The only time that stuff's beneficial is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a set of essentially when you're coming</v>

704
00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:23.760
<v Speaker 3>off of steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet he didn't test positive for</v>

705
00:32:23.761 --> 00:32:27.670
<v Speaker 3>steroids before or after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it could have been a tainted</v>

706
00:32:27.671 --> 00:32:29.530
<v Speaker 3>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could have been a mistake.</v>

707
00:32:29.531 --> 00:32:33.070
<v Speaker 3>It could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what wacky shit he was taken.</v>

708
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:33.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

709
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.200
<v Speaker 3>I just think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

710
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.310
<v Speaker 3>people forget that they lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you still to have guidance,</v>

711
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still go have a guide and you know,</v>

712
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:43.460
<v Speaker 3>to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

713
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:44.840
<v Speaker 3>is that the best thing you should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing?</v>

714
00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.640
<v Speaker 3>Also wants to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know what I mean?</v>

715
00:32:46.641 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 3>It's that that's not going to be high</v>
<v Speaker 3>five and you cause you're going to stick</v>

716
00:32:50.631 --> 00:32:53.350
<v Speaker 3>a load of bugle you nose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it harder though?</v>

717
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.440
<v Speaker 3>I think for champions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because once they like dominate someone</v>

718
00:32:57.441 --> 00:33:00.530
<v Speaker 3>to kick someone's ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you find the most difficult</v>

719
00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:01.820
<v Speaker 3>fight of your career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fight,</v>

720
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:03.223
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

721
00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:05.450
<v Speaker 3>whether there's daniel cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever it is,</v>

722
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:09.080
<v Speaker 3>you dominate them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you win and beautiful fashion and then</v>

723
00:33:09.081 --> 00:33:09.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like,</v>

724
00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:11.690
<v Speaker 3>god damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am the fucking man,</v>

725
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.830
<v Speaker 3>and then you just want to do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to do after that and indulgence</v>

726
00:33:15.831 --> 00:33:18.200
<v Speaker 3>and chaos and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did it,</v>

727
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.740
<v Speaker 3>but it comes to bite you on the ass all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

728
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.510
<v Speaker 3>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but god dammit,</v>

729
00:33:23.511 --> 00:33:28.511
<v Speaker 3>it is a fucking story that plays itself</v>
<v Speaker 3>out over and over and over and over and</v>

730
00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.790
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a bunch of these</v>

731
00:33:31.791 --> 00:33:35.630
<v Speaker 3>distractions stories like the ronda</v>
<v Speaker 3>rousey story is ultimately a story of</v>

732
00:33:35.631 --> 00:33:37.310
<v Speaker 3>distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

733
00:33:37.311 --> 00:33:41.690
<v Speaker 3>here's this woman who is just a freak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

734
00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:47.130
<v Speaker 3>A completely dominant female ass kicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something that we've never had before.</v>

735
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:50.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had like female fighters before,</v>

736
00:33:50.931 --> 00:33:52.850
<v Speaker 3>like you remember christy martin was</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a.</v>

737
00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:55.100
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there was like a little bit of it</v>

738
00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:57.410
<v Speaker 3>with laila ali.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were kind of paying attention to</v>

739
00:33:57.411 --> 00:33:59.450
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one was paying attention to</v>

740
00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:02.420
<v Speaker 3>anyone even remotely on the scale of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ronda rousey.</v>

741
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.610
<v Speaker 3>But what happens then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

742
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.760
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden hollywood opens up</v>
<v Speaker 3>doors.</v>

743
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.760
<v Speaker 3>You start doing movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get all these offers,</v>

744
00:34:10.761 --> 00:34:13.940
<v Speaker 3>you the darling of talk shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in fucking commercials all the</v>

745
00:34:13.941 --> 00:34:14.774
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

746
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.840
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants to kiss your ass and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people that are coming up all</v>

747
00:34:20.211 --> 00:34:25.211
<v Speaker 3>around you that are assassins and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not getting all this attention.</v>

748
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.910
<v Speaker 3>They're just hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not like holly holm.</v>

749
00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:31.010
<v Speaker 3>When she fought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ronda was a massive underdog.</v>

750
00:34:31.011 --> 00:34:32.060
<v Speaker 3>Meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meanwhile,</v>

751
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:36.080
<v Speaker 3>she was a 19 time world boxing champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was a far more accomplished striker</v>

752
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:41.140
<v Speaker 3>than ronda and ronda fought the exact</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong fight when you're fighting a 19</v>

753
00:34:41.301 --> 00:34:45.080
<v Speaker 3>time world boxing champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas misha tate fought the exact</v>

754
00:34:45.081 --> 00:34:47.180
<v Speaker 3>right fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing outside,</v>

755
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.340
<v Speaker 3>barely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>barely engage her with strikes.</v>

756
00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:50.780
<v Speaker 3>Just push her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>push her,</v>

757
00:34:50.781 --> 00:34:52.810
<v Speaker 3>but backdrop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pusher and backup pusher.</v>

758
00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.510
<v Speaker 3>Constantly move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly vary your approach and then</v>

759
00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:59.990
<v Speaker 3>when you get ahold of her account and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she did that in the second round and</v>

760
00:34:59.991 --> 00:35:02.990
<v Speaker 3>then ultimately she did it in the fifth</v>
<v Speaker 3>round and submitted her and that's what</v>

761
00:35:02.991 --> 00:35:06.380
<v Speaker 3>one or the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between someone who has</v>

762
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.440
<v Speaker 3>everything to gain like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone who is hungry and then the</v>

763
00:35:12.681 --> 00:35:16.130
<v Speaker 3>fucking mindset of someone who becomes</v>
<v Speaker 3>super successful.</v>

764
00:35:16.131 --> 00:35:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Like a Mike Tyson in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

765
00:35:17.731 --> 00:35:19.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just.</v>

766
00:35:19.131 --> 00:35:21.560
<v Speaker 3>You've just started fucking off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start believing that no one's going</v>

767
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:24.770
<v Speaker 3>to beat your ass and then you fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>buster douglas with very little training</v>

768
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:29.570
<v Speaker 3>and he fucking puts that leather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your face and reality hits you.</v>

769
00:35:29.571 --> 00:35:31.730
<v Speaker 3>When that referee standing over you</v>
<v Speaker 3>counting,</v>

770
00:35:31.731 --> 00:35:32.750
<v Speaker 3>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this is happening to me now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must be difficult.</v>

772
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.070

<v Speaker 2>You have to have someone who helps you.</v>

796
00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I think every fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I shouldn't say every fighter</v>

797
00:36:41.861 --> 00:36:43.480
<v Speaker 3>because some kind of figured out on</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own.</v>

<v Speaker 3>fall into those traps,</v>

799
00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.960
<v Speaker 3>but most fighters can use some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>guidelines and there's also these</v>

800
00:36:51.971 --> 00:36:54.640
<v Speaker 3>facilitators that manifest themselves in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>

802
00:36:58.961 --> 00:37:01.450
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

803
00:37:01.451 --> 00:37:05.020
<v Speaker 3>They want to bring over booze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to get you into the club.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And when they're doing is these guys</v>

808
00:37:12.131 --> 00:37:15.670
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get into your life and the way they</v>

809
00:37:15.671 --> 00:37:19.570
<v Speaker 3>get into your life as by making things</v>
<v Speaker 3>easier for you so they can be a part of</v>

810
00:37:19.571 --> 00:37:20.350
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

811

<v Speaker 3>Mike Tyson camp or whatever it is.</v>

812
00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:25.030
<v Speaker 3>And then next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got this entourage of 20 people</v>

813
00:37:25.031 --> 00:37:28.320
<v Speaker 3>hanging around you and most of them are</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fucking idiots and don't know who</v>

814
00:37:28.321 --> 00:37:30.910
<v Speaker 3>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're paying for their existence.</v>

815
00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:35.200
<v Speaker 3>You are funding their existence and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do is they hold doors open for you</v>

816
00:37:35.201 --> 00:37:38.170
<v Speaker 3>and they check you into hotel rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do all these things that you could</v>

817
00:37:38.171 --> 00:37:40.960
<v Speaker 3>do on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sort of make it easier and in</v>

818
00:37:40.961 --> 00:37:45.961
<v Speaker 3>making it easier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sort of defined what is okay and</v>

819
00:37:46.601 --> 00:37:47.291
<v Speaker 3>then like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

820
00:37:47.291 --> 00:37:48.370
<v Speaker 3>no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just going to go party.</v>

821
00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.810
<v Speaker 3>You gonna fuck this guy up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway man,</v>

822
00:37:49.811 --> 00:37:52.900
<v Speaker 3>let's go hit the club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then next thing you know you're out</v>

823
00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.490
<v Speaker 3>late at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not getting rest.</v>

824
00:37:54.491 --> 00:37:58.830
<v Speaker 3>Your coach is texting you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you in bed and you're not because</v>

825
00:37:58.831 --> 00:38:01.020
<v Speaker 3>you're hanging around with these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>cling on</v>

826
00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.560
<v Speaker 2>and then when you've lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they vanish,</v>

827
00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:05.990
<v Speaker 2>they vanish and then you've lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You vanish.</v>

828
00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.340
<v Speaker 2>And then you've got to pick up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces.</v>

829
00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:12.810
<v Speaker 2>That's as one interesting more I'd like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do is I'd like to people for me to be</v>

830
00:38:13.641 --> 00:38:17.690
<v Speaker 2>able to hire me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously to be able to talk soon,</v>

831
00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:19.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just use it now.</v>

832
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.110
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is on my mind.</v>

833
00:38:21.111 --> 00:38:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Well this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and this.</v>

834
00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Not to potter a block on before they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's fucking stupid.</v>

835
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to do that and I think you'll</v>

836
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.600
<v Speaker 2>do that anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

837
00:38:32.601 --> 00:38:34.490
<v Speaker 2>But I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult.</v>

838
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult</v>

839
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.440
<v Speaker 3>to make it stick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

840
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.120
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have a good idea in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>head about like,</v>

841
00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:42.520
<v Speaker 3>you know what I need to do with my life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to eat healthy,</v>

842
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.040
<v Speaker 3>I need to exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to follow my dreams.</v>

843
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.173
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

844
00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 3>Right now that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thought right now,</v>

845
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:50.890
<v Speaker 3>but how do you keep that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you make it stick?</v>

846
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.980
<v Speaker 3>and that's a big issue with people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>go up and they go down.</v>

847
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean how ridiculous our new year's</v>
<v Speaker 3>resolutions.</v>

848
00:38:56.471 --> 00:38:59.800
<v Speaker 3>How many people have come to you after</v>
<v Speaker 3>new years in there that are going to</v>

849
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:01.850
<v Speaker 3>lose 50 pounds?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to stop smoking,</v>

850
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:05.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to eat any unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you see them like a couple of</v>

851
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.700
<v Speaker 3>weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look great.</v>

852
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Well you're sticking to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome man.</v>

853
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:10.180
<v Speaker 3>Congratulations by the money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

854
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:12.820
<v Speaker 3>And then five months later they're fat</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

855
00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:16.180
<v Speaker 3>And looking stupid and it's so normal,</v>

856

863
00:39:35.991 --> 00:39:38.510
<v Speaker 2>can't be asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or I was listening to this type of least</v>

864
00:39:38.511 --> 00:39:39.170
<v Speaker 2>resistance.</v>

865
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.840
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to a ted talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a ted podcast.</v>

866
00:39:41.841 --> 00:39:42.471
<v Speaker 3>And in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

867
00:39:42.471 --> 00:39:45.440
<v Speaker 3>it was also a ted talk with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about time in the way</v>

868
00:39:45.441 --> 00:39:49.610
<v Speaker 3>people perceive time and the way people</v>
<v Speaker 3>perceive time.</v>

869
00:39:49.611 --> 00:39:53.630
<v Speaker 3>They always perceive that they are now a</v>
<v Speaker 3>finished product.</v>

870
00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.490
<v Speaker 3>This is like a big thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to do.</v>

871
00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.380
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at themselves like,</v>

872
00:39:57.381 --> 00:39:57.891
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

873
00:39:57.891 --> 00:40:01.910
<v Speaker 3>when I was 20 I didn't know shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now that I'm 30 I got it together.</v>

874
00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:03.110
<v Speaker 3>And then when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do they go,</v>

875
00:40:03.111 --> 00:40:04.790
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was 30 I thought I knew</v>

876
00:40:04.791 --> 00:40:08.480
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now I know things and they always</v>

877
00:40:08.481 --> 00:40:10.940
<v Speaker 3>want to thank that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're done growing,</v>

878
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.150
<v Speaker 3>but what this podcast is sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>emphasizing is that people are in a</v>

879
00:40:14.151 --> 00:40:18.740
<v Speaker 3>constant state of change and evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're thinking about things,</v>

880
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.230
<v Speaker 3>you know the expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's perfect.</v>

881
00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.180
<v Speaker 3>This true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one is perfect,</v>

882
00:40:23.181 --> 00:40:27.860
<v Speaker 3>so if in fact you're not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means you're considering whatever</v>

883
00:40:27.861 --> 00:40:31.190
<v Speaker 3>you've done that maybe you could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>done better or maybe we could have</v>

884
00:40:31.191 --> 00:40:34.460
<v Speaker 3>handled better or maybe could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought about in a better way or a more</v>

885
00:40:34.461 --> 00:40:37.160
<v Speaker 3>beneficial way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you grow and learn from that.</v>

886
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it comes to the state of flux.</v>

887
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.731
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

888
00:40:40.731 --> 00:40:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm a different person as it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there nearly spot on a year and</v>

889
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.310
<v Speaker 2>I've learned more and changed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>different opinions.</v>

890
00:40:48.311 --> 00:40:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Nothing if you read anything or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

919
00:42:02.391 --> 00:42:04.220
<v Speaker 2>then they said they think about golden</v>

<v Speaker 2>which is tumor at black pepper and</v>

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:13.060
<v Speaker 2>make a paste of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean look on facebook,</v>

923
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.230
<v Speaker 2>use a grave and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

924
00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.450
<v Speaker 2>you basically take that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been taking it regularly and</v>

925
00:42:19.451 --> 00:42:21.980
<v Speaker 2>there's no pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no pain whatsoever.</v>

926
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 2>So it's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same information as you grind</v>

927
00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:26.440
<v Speaker 2>up the tumeric?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

928
00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.720
<v Speaker 2>You're making it in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a supplement form or you're getting</v>

929
00:42:29.721 --> 00:42:33.150
<v Speaker 2>it from a route you get cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get tumeric?</v>

930
00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:33.641
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

931
00:42:33.641 --> 00:42:34.720
<v Speaker 2>the powder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

932
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:35.471
<v Speaker 2>So you're not getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

933
00:42:35.471 --> 00:42:37.850
<v Speaker 2>you could buy the root.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The root is real common now.</v>

934
00:42:37.851 --> 00:42:40.230
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting little pool</v>
<v Speaker 2>miracle.</v>

935
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:41.103
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

936
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.370
<v Speaker 2>not really shitty supermarket over</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

937
00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:49.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to slack off or anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a supermarket is another one.</v>

938
00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Lakh it off talking rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>

939
00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.470
<v Speaker 2>the powder works and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you Just don't know the actual</v>

940
00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:02.030
<v Speaker 2>measurements of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But say it's a cup of water,</v>

941
00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:05.210
<v Speaker 2>half a cup of tumeric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cook it for seven minutes on a low</v>

942
00:43:05.211 --> 00:43:07.160
<v Speaker 2>heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it starts getting into a paste.</v>

943
00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.690
<v Speaker 2>You add black pepper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe two teaspoons of it because</v>

944
00:43:11.691 --> 00:43:15.860
<v Speaker 2>it's an active ingredient that makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes it 400 times more absorbable and</v>

945
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.910
<v Speaker 2>nobody really.</v>

946
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

947
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:20.270
<v Speaker 2>Black pepper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pepper green.</v>

948
00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

949
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Why does it have to be cooked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

950
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:26.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good with send to do.</v>

952
00:43:27.201 --> 00:43:29.320

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

953
00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:33.110
<v Speaker 2>the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is just like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>bloodstream and then it would be toxic.</v>

1011
00:46:05.371 --> 00:46:07.170
<v Speaker 1>sort of a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be psychological.</v>

1020
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:35.160
<v Speaker 1>relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will they say that most of the issues</v>

1021
00:46:35.161 --> 00:46:37.800
<v Speaker 1>that people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether even lIke a lot of diseases,</v>

1022
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:42.980
<v Speaker 1>the stem from inflammation and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation is caused by diet.</v>

1023
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:44.850
<v Speaker 1>It's caused by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1024
00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:49.200
<v Speaker 1>just eating bad food and not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy into your body has this reaction</v>

1025
00:46:49.201 --> 00:46:51.840
<v Speaker 1>to this food and it's inflammatory</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>

1026

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what gives you inflammation and what</v>

1028
00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.550
<v Speaker 1>doesn't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1029
00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I think most vary from person to person</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most things and you know,</v>

1030
00:47:04.831 --> 00:47:07.380
<v Speaker 1>an allergy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the golden pace,</v>

1031
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:09.300
<v Speaker 1>the tumeric thinkers were brilliant for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1032
00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't praise that enough.</v>

1033
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:14.310
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how quickly did it take,</v>

1034
00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:19.170
<v Speaker 1>like how long did it take before it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were really rock solid with it.</v>

1035
00:47:19.171 --> 00:47:22.950
<v Speaker 1>We realized that this was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial for about two days.</v>

1036
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

1037
00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.640
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>

1038
00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I was really working for the american</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

1039
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.680
<v Speaker 1>I was young and you can buy this now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really pissed off because the docs</v>

1040
00:47:34.071 --> 00:47:34.751
<v Speaker 1>are went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1041
00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:37.780
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you say to the doctor,</v>

1042
00:47:37.781 --> 00:47:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I think I've got this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and the other one because they</v>

1043
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:41.800
<v Speaker 1>think that you're self diagnose</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1044
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:42.693
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1045
00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of like a,</v>

1046
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:45.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just start.</v>

1047
00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:47.140
<v Speaker 1>And I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1048
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she said,</v>

1049
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's arthritis,</v>

1050
00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:53.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just paracetamal and I think one</v>

1051
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:56.140
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I put on facebook,</v>

1052
00:47:56.141 --> 00:48:00.430
<v Speaker 1>which is a good tool for sometimes for</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting information like the internet</v>

1053
00:48:00.431 --> 00:48:02.860
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he worked a treat and then he got</v>

1054
00:48:02.861 --> 00:48:05.320
<v Speaker 1>into this group and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was brilliant and it's worked for me</v>

1055
00:48:05.321 --> 00:48:06.250
<v Speaker 1>fantastically well.</v>

1056
00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to sort of separate the</v>

1057
00:48:08.201 --> 00:48:10.990
<v Speaker 1>bullshit from the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you can do that,</v>

1058
00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:12.790
<v Speaker 1>you can definitely find a lot of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

1059
00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:17.791
<v Speaker 1>And it's confusing to me when doctors</v>
<v Speaker 1>dismiss dietary solutions because very</v>

1060
00:48:21.161 --> 00:48:24.400
<v Speaker 1>few doctors are really well educated in</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition,</v>

1061
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:30.180
<v Speaker 1>especially educated in the understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the mechanisms involved in absorbing</v>

1062
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:36.390
<v Speaker 1>nutrients and what compounds or</v>
<v Speaker 1>accentuates nutrition absorption and</v>

1063
00:48:37.421 --> 00:48:39.410
<v Speaker 1>what's beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so,</v>

1064
00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:41.270
<v Speaker 1>so many doctors are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1065
00:48:41.271 --> 00:48:43.300
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they poo poo it because they don't</v>

1066
00:48:43.301 --> 00:48:45.190
<v Speaker 1>understand that they have no knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

1067
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Well my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>

1068
00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:50.140
<v Speaker 1>when when he taught tumor tumeric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it went to the doctor's and the doctor</v>

1069
00:48:50.141 --> 00:48:50.801
<v Speaker 1>was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1070
00:48:50.801 --> 00:48:54.540
<v Speaker 1>you can take these whatever I think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1071
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:56.500
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saved my destiny,</v>

1072
00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:59.110
<v Speaker 1>destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any always have stopped having the.</v>

1073
00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.720
<v Speaker 1>because he had a regular checkup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had gout really badly.</v>

1074
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.100
<v Speaker 1>And he went in and then.</v>

1075
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.570
<v Speaker 1>And then the doctor said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1076
00:49:04.571 --> 00:49:06.760
<v Speaker 1>I've been taking tumeric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said to me,</v>

1077
00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:07.860
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the doctor said,</v>

1078
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.680
<v Speaker 1>well our third of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not been tested tumeric.</v>

1079
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:11.800
<v Speaker 1>And said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1080
00:49:11.801 --> 00:49:12.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it works,</v>

1081
00:49:12.881 --> 00:49:15.880
<v Speaker 1>but it's not been tested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're aware I think.</v>

1082
00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:19.750
<v Speaker 1>I think there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to piss on docsis double</v>

1083
00:49:19.751 --> 00:49:21.880
<v Speaker 1>blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>placebo controlled studies from any</v>

1084
00:49:21.881 --> 00:49:25.210
<v Speaker 1>major university that shows the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial effects of turmeric or is it</v>

1085
00:49:25.211 --> 00:49:27.550
<v Speaker 1>just probably make any money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it tumeric?</v>

1086
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.380
<v Speaker 1>What should you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1087
00:49:29.381 --> 00:49:30.790
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1088
00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't there a massive industry and</v>

1089
00:49:33.491 --> 00:49:36.460
<v Speaker 1>helping people with inflamed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflamed tendons?</v>

1090
00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:38.770
<v Speaker 1>The problem with those things is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't control it.</v>

1091
00:49:38.771 --> 00:49:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Like if you do a Study on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1092
00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:43.000
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank of tylenol or</v>

1093
00:49:43.001 --> 00:49:44.950
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone created tylenol,</v>

1094
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:45.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1095
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:48.550
<v Speaker 1>So if you do a study on tylenol and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it shows its efficacy,</v>

1096
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:51.970
<v Speaker 1>then you could sell more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you do a study on turmeric,</v>

1097
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:52.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

1098
00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:54.280
<v Speaker 1>glad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for funding this study.</v>

1099
00:49:54.281 --> 00:49:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go sell it now and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to point to your study and I'm</v>

1100
00:49:57.131 --> 00:50:00.160
<v Speaker 1>going to make a ton of money off of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>study and I can just grow it in my</v>

1101
00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.600
<v Speaker 1>backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

1102
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:05.290
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem with marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plan is a problem with any sort of</v>

1103
00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:06.970
<v Speaker 1>spin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a survey.</v>

1104
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like 100 people surveyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been asked about,</v>

1105
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:15.520
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about surveys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about double blind placebo</v>

1106
00:50:15.521 --> 00:50:18.820
<v Speaker 1>controlled studies on information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they did something along those lines,</v>

1107
00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:24.210
<v Speaker 1>like one of the big issues that's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on with medical marijuana is the</v>

1108
00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 1>pushback from pharmaceutical companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are trying to stop medical</v>

1109
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:33.220
<v Speaker 3>marijuana from becoming legal nationwide</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they they've halted at least delayed</v>

1110
00:50:33.921 --> 00:50:38.750
<v Speaker 3>this supreme court's changing of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>designation from a schedule one to</v>

1111
00:50:38.751 --> 00:50:42.590
<v Speaker 3>schedule two in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Schedule one shows no medicinal value</v>

1112
00:50:42.591 --> 00:50:44.270
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where marijuana is.</v>

1113
00:50:44.271 --> 00:50:47.610
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana is passed as a medical</v>

1114
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:50.570
<v Speaker 3>supplement in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many states now.</v>

1115
00:50:50.571 --> 00:50:54.320
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like 20 and it's legal in</v>
<v Speaker 3>four or five states now.</v>

1116
00:50:54.321 --> 00:50:56.870
<v Speaker 3>It's legal in Washington dc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's legal in Colorado.</v>

1117
00:50:56.871 --> 00:51:01.100
<v Speaker 3>It's legal in Washington state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's legal in Oregon just</v>

1118
00:51:01.101 --> 00:51:04.730
<v Speaker 3>recreationally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's obviously there is some benefit</v>

1119
00:51:04.731 --> 00:51:08.540
<v Speaker 3>of it medically if all these doctors are</v>
<v Speaker 3>prescribing and it shows massive</v>

1120
00:51:08.541 --> 00:51:13.541
<v Speaker 3>reduction in tumors with the use of cbd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it helps control pain simpson oil.</v>

1121
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:15.111
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1122
00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:18.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible how much benefit there</v>

1123
00:51:18.261 --> 00:51:21.260
<v Speaker 3>is in this one plant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet the pushback from the</v>

1124
00:51:21.261 --> 00:51:25.100
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical industry is still</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly strong because they don't.</v>

1125
00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:29.030
<v Speaker 3>I posted something really recently how</v>
<v Speaker 3>much money.</v>

1126
00:51:29.031 --> 00:51:32.030
<v Speaker 3>The pharmaceutical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a chart that showed how much</v>

1127
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:35.720
<v Speaker 3>money the pharmaceutical industry stands</v>
<v Speaker 3>to lose.</v>

1128
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:40.160
<v Speaker 3>If medical cannabis is made legal</v>
<v Speaker 3>nationwide and readily available,</v>

1129
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 3>it's billions of dollars every year</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to lose because all these</v>

1130
00:51:43.911 --> 00:51:46.460
<v Speaker 3>solutions that they offer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's better,</v>

1131
00:51:46.461 --> 00:51:50.330
<v Speaker 3>simpler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>simpler and far cheaper solutions with</v>

1132
00:51:50.331 --> 00:51:52.640
<v Speaker 3>cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially because it's one of the</v>

1133
00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:55.580
<v Speaker 3>easiest things to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of people grow their own</v>

1134
00:51:55.581 --> 00:51:57.410
<v Speaker 3>tomatoes in their backyard and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1135
00:51:57.411 --> 00:51:59.570
<v Speaker 3>Like pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you do is plant it,</v>

1136
00:51:59.571 --> 00:52:00.980
<v Speaker 3>throw some water on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's done.</v>

1137
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Not in england.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In england,</v>

1138
00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:05.430
<v Speaker 1>they won't grow unless you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1139
00:52:05.431 --> 00:52:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the best weather of way.</v>

1140
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:12.330
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you we'd will grow in</v>

1141
00:52:12.331 --> 00:52:17.331
<v Speaker 1>england to try and some some lights and</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try it and film it live and let</v>

1142
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:24.010
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How illegal illegal is.</v>

1143
00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Pot and in england you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get arrested.</v>

1144
00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:29.220
<v Speaker 1>He can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1145
00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not very good with it being</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

1146
00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's drunk and I've never seen more</v>

1147
00:52:34.141 --> 00:52:35.610
<v Speaker 1>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>

1148
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.620
<v Speaker 1>god damn you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love to drink.</v>

1149
00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're good at it.</v>

1150
00:52:39.751 --> 00:52:44.100
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm looking for.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the usual stuff that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

00:53:05.491 --> 00:53:07.920
<v Speaker 1>but I mean to see what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think belief,</v>

1161
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I believe that there's a cure for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything on the planet.</v>

1162
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I think we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we these loads of stuff that we haven't</v>

1163
00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:19.530
<v Speaker 1>explored that the mind as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just stuff to explore yet the mind is a</v>

1164
00:53:19.531 --> 00:53:24.330
<v Speaker 1>fascinating solution to a lot of issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people have and sinking positive or</v>

1165
00:53:24.331 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>thinking negative or worry</v>

1166
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.140
<v Speaker 3>and the stress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we were talking earlier about</v>

1167
00:53:28.141 --> 00:53:33.141
<v Speaker 3>cortisol and the stress response to</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally thinking about something</v>

1168
00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:37.710
<v Speaker 3>affects your physical health and</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about things in the wrong way.</v>

1169
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Affects your physical health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1170
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.080
<v Speaker 2>and when we got we got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we got more things to worry</v>

1171
00:53:43.081 --> 00:53:45.240
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've got more things to worry</v>

1172
00:53:45.241 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 2>about now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're actually not anything to</v>

1173
00:53:47.011 --> 00:53:48.960
<v Speaker 2>worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

1174
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:51.070
<v Speaker 2>When you look at facebook and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>model,</v>

1175
00:53:51.071 --> 00:53:55.280
<v Speaker 2>the someone's fucking idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump supporter healthier,</v>

1176
00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:58.440
<v Speaker 2>you don't know anything about that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start typing something while I'm</v>

1177
00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:00.090
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get involved in something or</v>

1178
00:54:00.091 --> 00:54:02.130
<v Speaker 2>you get angry about something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do it,</v>

1179
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to lie and they,</v>

1180
00:54:03.571 --> 00:54:08.400
<v Speaker 2>you think to yourself fucking medu in</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago when you and the caveman was</v>

1181
00:54:08.401 --> 00:54:11.960
<v Speaker 2>only worried about if they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get somethings going to eat them all,</v>

1182
00:54:11.961 --> 00:54:15.180
<v Speaker 2>they've got something and I think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>might have been easier.</v>

1183
00:54:15.181 --> 00:54:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Of course he died of diseases and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>died,</v>

1184
00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 2>may have died younger to whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean they lived the mall and</v>

<v Speaker 2>So didn't even,</v>

1186
00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:28.230
<v Speaker 2>didn't have anything to look and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have comments on youtube.</v>

1187
00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Like John Wayne Powell was saying he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay.</v>

1188
00:54:30.681 --> 00:54:31.770
<v Speaker 2>He gets mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1189
00:54:31.771 --> 00:54:34.440
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call it the same.</v>

1190
00:54:34.441 --> 00:54:37.530
<v Speaker 2>I got almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was cold virus all for game of</v>

1191
00:54:37.531 --> 00:54:40.710
<v Speaker 2>thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I was quite pleased about it.</v>

1192
00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:41.521
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1194
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.211
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1195
00:54:45.211 --> 00:54:46.320
<v Speaker 2>but I just think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1196
00:54:46.321 --> 00:54:50.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things don't guys don't get haters.</v>

1197
00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:51.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand them,</v>

1198
00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:54.790
<v Speaker 3>but don't you though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because when we were talking about all</v>

1199
00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:58.390
<v Speaker 3>these different things that happen in</v>
<v Speaker 3>life that sort of set you up for the</v>

1200
00:54:58.391 --> 00:55:03.391
<v Speaker 3>next stages of life and define you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of alter and affect your decision</v>

1201
00:55:04.931 --> 00:55:07.420
<v Speaker 3>making process and your behavior</v>
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>

1202
00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:12.920
<v Speaker 3>don't you think that a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people just live very unfortunate</v>

1203
00:55:12.921 --> 00:55:17.921
<v Speaker 3>existences and whether it's by chance or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's by bad decision making that</v>

1204
00:55:19.841 --> 00:55:22.240
<v Speaker 3>has just compounded itself over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1205
00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:25.150
<v Speaker 3>When you see some of the hateful things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people posted about,</v>

<v Speaker 3>hitting pads here.</v>

1322
01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:34.630
<v Speaker 3>If I was coaching the garlic that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>would tell him,</v>

1323
01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.680
<v Speaker 3>all I want you to do is touch these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things over five years old,</v>

1324
01:00:37.681 --> 01:00:39.560
<v Speaker 3>five years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's gotten better.</v>

1325
01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1326
01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:46.090

<v Speaker 3>Then if that's five years ago and he's</v>

1327
01:00:46.091 --> 01:00:49.870
<v Speaker 3>been steady at it since then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really good because he's got some</v>

1328
01:00:49.871 --> 01:00:53.080
<v Speaker 3>basic movements down the waste,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing his weight into things.</v>

1329
01:00:53.081 --> 01:00:54.690
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1330
01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:57.280
<v Speaker 3>tried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys tried to hit things hard before</v>

1331
01:00:57.281 --> 01:00:58.114
<v Speaker 3>they learn how to hit,</v>

1332
01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1333
01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because his friend who was in it in</v>

1334
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:05.990
<v Speaker 2>luther,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the other detective was warren</v>

1335

<v Speaker 2>brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's my mate,</v>

1336
01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.590
<v Speaker 2>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants two world titles in thai</v>

1337
01:01:09.591 --> 01:01:12.410

<v Speaker 2>so I think they'd been talking about in</v>

1338
01:01:12.411 --> 01:01:14.240
<v Speaker 2>warren's been helping him and karen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Karen's been helping him,</v>

1339
01:01:14.241 --> 01:01:17.510
<v Speaker 2>but it should be a good show because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see all of them seem train in and</v>

1340
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:21.360
<v Speaker 2>between movies like is made when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>spielberg the dark tower or something</v>

1341
01:01:21.361 --> 01:01:23.480
<v Speaker 2>with where's he going to fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1342
01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:29.030
<v Speaker 2>Maybe in Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thailand and I think going deep.</v>

1343
01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.610
<v Speaker 2>I know you got to give him respect</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

1344
01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:35.370
<v Speaker 2>The whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's fighting k one rules which</v>

1345
01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:40.410
<v Speaker 2>dumps are easier to get elbowed in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>face and of clench and all.</v>

1346
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.920
<v Speaker 2>I saw business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've got to give.</v>

1347
01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:45.200
<v Speaker 2>Given respect to like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the way he's testing</v>

1348
01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:49.160
<v Speaker 2>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he did a video on youtube about life</v>

1349
01:01:49.161 --> 01:01:51.780
<v Speaker 2>and that now he envisioned himself doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>this something new.</v>

1350
01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.200

1380
01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:20.610
<v Speaker 1>He didn't get a word that I could tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spelled it out slowly.</v>

1381
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:25.910
<v Speaker 1>J a r a y a versus bevmo b e n m o hate.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>

1390
01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:51.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did it get abandoned?</v>

1391
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Sydney to industry to keep up like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be some disconnect between some</v>

1392
01:03:55.141 --> 01:03:57.720
<v Speaker 1>of the words like tires you guys use or</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1393
01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:02.370
<v Speaker 1>And color with no view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we uncover what the fuck is that</v>

1397
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:11.850

<v Speaker 1>I think we did.</v>

1398
01:04:11.851 --> 01:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>So you might want to fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>One of the best kickboxing fights I've</v>

1404
01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.000

<v Speaker 1>out of each other.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll check it out.</v>

1420
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm a obviously a big fan of kickboxing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>

1421
01:05:16.081 --> 01:05:18.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm super psyched that gloria is going</v>

1422
01:05:18.141 --> 01:05:22.510
<v Speaker 1>to put on badr hari versus rico</v>
<v Speaker 1>verhoeven if bought her heart,</v>

<v Speaker 1>gets out of jail in jail.</v>

1424
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:26.840
<v Speaker 1>He's not in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least not right now.</v>

1425
01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>But there's a long time between now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>december.</v>

1426
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>We'll see a cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes.</v>

1427
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>He makes John Jones look like a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>choirboy true.</v>

1428
01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean we here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just say,</v>

1429
01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting fight.</v>

1430
01:05:41.621 --> 01:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure barter can win,</v>

1431
01:05:43.211 --> 01:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rico can win.</v>

1432
01:05:44.351 --> 01:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Rico's been much more active reach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ricoh has incredible cardio.</v>

1433
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:51.400
<v Speaker 1>If you go to the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurry that beat alistair overeem in the</v>

1434
01:05:51.401 --> 01:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1435
01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>you go to that bot or the bot or who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his peak mean bought her was a</v>

1436
01:05:56.621 --> 01:05:59.710
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's been a long time and he's not</v>

1437
01:05:59.711 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 1>been very active over the last few</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1438
01:06:01.601 --> 01:06:03.940
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

1439
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Switch on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's which wateR turns up.</v>

1440
01:06:06.101 --> 01:06:09.910
<v Speaker 1>But it's also like all of the legal</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues that he's gone through.</v>

1441
01:06:09.911 --> 01:06:10.740
<v Speaker 1>All the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1442
01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the behavioral issues.</v>

1443
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's had a lot of problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly broke some guy's leg and a</v>

1444
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:19.210
<v Speaker 1>nightclub.</v>

1445
01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:23.140
<v Speaker 1>They say it held the guy down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stomped his shin and smashed his leg.</v>

1446
01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:26.680
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who knows?</v>

1447
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what the fuck is going on with</v>

1448
01:06:28.691 --> 01:06:32.470
<v Speaker 1>that dude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm know his mom and dad and that real</v>

1449
01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:34.390
<v Speaker 1>nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice guy and still full.</v>

1450
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:37.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fathers probably the most exciting</v>

1451
01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:39.550
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's a wild man.</v>

1452
01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.270
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking wild man and he's legit</v>
<v Speaker 1>knockout power.</v>

1453
01:06:43.271 --> 01:06:47.050
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is he throws caution</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally to the wind.</v>

1454
01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1455
01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:51.610
<v Speaker 1>he unloads with full power shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wade's forward,</v>

1456
01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:52.900
<v Speaker 1>throws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs,</v>

1457
01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:57.460
<v Speaker 1>like he throws out all ideas of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>being technical and being,</v>

1458
01:06:57.830 --> 01:07:01.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being really cautious and like setting</v>

1459
01:07:01.361 --> 01:07:03.100
<v Speaker 1>traps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not setting traps.</v>

1460
01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:05.990
<v Speaker 1>He's dropping missiles on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets to them and say,</v>

1461
01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:09.490
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that if a froze up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he'd get nervous that he</v>

1462
01:07:09.491 --> 01:07:11.710
<v Speaker 1>throws up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throws up for the fight,</v>

1463
01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:12.450
<v Speaker 1>gets ready.</v>

1464
01:07:12.450 --> 01:07:16.180
<v Speaker 1>so none of this makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you see the way he fights fights,</v>

1465
01:07:16.181 --> 01:07:18.770
<v Speaker 1>like it's fucking case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

1466
01:07:18.830 --> 01:07:20.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody killed somebody he loves,</v>

1467
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.530
<v Speaker 1>that's fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fights like a wilD man,</v>

1468
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But rico is a different kind of fighter.</v>

1469
01:07:26.651 --> 01:07:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Rico is a very athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big heavyweight who is a amazing cardio</v>

1470
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:34.780
<v Speaker 1>outstanding technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His boxing is outstanding.</v>

1471
01:07:34.781 --> 01:07:37.060
<v Speaker 1>His kickboxing was outstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge,</v>

1472
01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:42.040
<v Speaker 1>huge guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a natural to 30 to 50 plus and he's</v>

1473
01:07:42.041 --> 01:07:44.540
<v Speaker 1>in incredible shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's bought her.</v>

1474
01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:49.890
<v Speaker 1>The thing about this is the glory of</v>
<v Speaker 1>preview videos to highlight that they're</v>

1475
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:53.230
<v Speaker 1>putting on pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about rico is that ricoh has</v>

1476
01:07:53.231 --> 01:07:56.800
<v Speaker 1>been super active while bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been dealing with all these problems</v>

1477
01:07:56.801 --> 01:08:00.820
<v Speaker 1>and rico's has been getting better and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rico's been beating guys that,</v>

1478
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:03.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had some problems with some guys in</v>

1479
01:08:03.611 --> 01:08:08.140
<v Speaker 1>the past and you see him now and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a much better fighter in every</v>

1480
01:08:08.141 --> 01:08:09.460
<v Speaker 1>shape way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

1481
01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:10.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he fell out,</v>

1482
01:08:10.511 --> 01:08:12.280
<v Speaker 1>benjamIn accountability fall numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1483
01:08:12.281 --> 01:08:14.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean you spent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was sparring with ties and fuel or it</v>

1484
01:08:14.501 --> 01:08:18.610
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a good an old decent heavyweights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and beat and daniel geeta who's good.</v>

1485
01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Daniel geeta farts a good example</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they had fought before and it</v>

1486
01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:24.500
<v Speaker 1>was a very close fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the rematch it was not close at</v>

1487
01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.060
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ricoh kinda ran away with it.</v>

1488
01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Rico's on another level right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thIng about baader is like when</v>

1489
01:08:31.251 --> 01:08:35.750
<v Speaker 1>he was at his best and you kind of got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to assume that it's possible that he</v>

1490
01:08:35.751 --> 01:08:38.750
<v Speaker 1>could go back to how he was when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>at his best.</v>

1491
01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.950
<v Speaker 1>When he went bought or was at his best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a fucking hurricane in there.</v>

1492
01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.720

<v Speaker 1>smart on his part.</v>

1505
01:09:19.641 --> 01:09:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Like listen to the fights over if I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay here for the moment.</v>

1506
01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seemed a little like this guy</v>

1507
01:09:26.751 --> 01:09:29.470
<v Speaker 1>who's been beaten up his entire career</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1508
01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:33.650
<v Speaker 1>taking amazing shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden one kick when he's down</v>

1509
01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:36.050
<v Speaker 1>and he just decided like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it is right here.</v>

1510
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:40.150
<v Speaker 1>That one kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

1511
01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.800
<v Speaker 1>It can't go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No way.</v>

1512
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.903
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1513
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:47.540
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a nice thing that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly is grounds for</v>

1514
01:09:47.541 --> 01:09:52.310
<v Speaker 1>disqualification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to see him rolling around on the</v>

1515
01:09:52.311 --> 01:09:53.360
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he can't,</v>

1516
01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:56.300
<v Speaker 1>he can't function anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1517
01:09:56.301 --> 01:09:57.050
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1518
01:09:57.050 --> 01:10:00.340
<v Speaker 1>It has to get swelling was worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did when he was on the floor.</v>

1519
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking crazy.</v>

1520
01:10:02.091 --> 01:10:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Why is he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is he like that?</v>

1521
01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Does anybody know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know.</v>

1522
01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:06.390
<v Speaker 1>I just think he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1523
01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.130
<v Speaker 1>nice if me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>

1524
01:10:10.131 --> 01:10:11.600
<v Speaker 1>really nice with me and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1525
01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:14.650
<v Speaker 1>he's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We make out of cross date.</v>

1526
01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just the wrong guy.</v>

1527
01:10:15.991 --> 01:10:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Of course you don't want to fuck wIth</v>
<v Speaker 1>badr.</v>

1528
01:10:17.571 --> 01:10:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Hari is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a dangerous,</v>

1529
01:10:20.481 --> 01:10:22.400
<v Speaker 1>dangerous man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to do this technique,</v>

1530
01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.630
<v Speaker 1>so what is it you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically eight sites,</v>

1531
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:27.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a calming technique.</v>

1532
01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:28.491
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1533
01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:31.370
<v Speaker 1>we were about to do this earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got so distracted to carry on.</v>

1534
01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.380
<v Speaker 1>You're going to tell people in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars to be careful.</v>

1535
01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Don't please don't do this while you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving.</v>

1536
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:40.640
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're using a machinery or anything</v>

1537
01:10:40.641 --> 01:10:43.090
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wAs still just unsure.</v>

1538
01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:48.160
<v Speaker 1>A basic technique is a submodality move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you sort of sub modalities.</v>

1539
01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's go with something that's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the background.</v>

1540
01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it just,</v>

1541
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:55.100
<v Speaker 1>it just calms you down so people can use</v>
<v Speaker 1>it for,</v>

1542
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:59.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before training or stressful day or</v>

1543
01:10:59.181 --> 01:11:00.170
<v Speaker 1>whatever they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1544
01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:01.350
<v Speaker 1>after a stressful day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lunches,</v>

1545
01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:04.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some time to sleep or whatever.</v>

1546
01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:09.450
<v Speaker 1>So self hypnosis technique correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not allowed to share with you.</v>

1547

1548
01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm trying to step back a bit.</v>

1549
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:14.110
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1550
01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:14.943
<v Speaker 2>sit back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1551
01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:20.040
<v Speaker 2>What I want you to do is find a</v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable chair or you can on your bed</v>

1552
01:11:20.041 --> 01:11:21.330
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you while you listen to this,</v>

1553
01:11:21.331 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 2>and I want you to yourself just close</v>
<v Speaker 2>your eyes a moment.</v>

1554
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:27.450
<v Speaker 2>I want you to imagine that your in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

1555
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:34.310
<v Speaker 2>this room can be an equally you wish and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of you as a window,</v>

1556
01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:38.610
<v Speaker 2>the window was slightly open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to move towards that window</v>

1557
01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:43.050
<v Speaker 2>as you go towards that window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to imagine outside that is</v>

1558
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:46.890
<v Speaker 2>traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bumper to bumper cars,</v>

1559
01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:49.660
<v Speaker 2>traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we know what traffic causes,</v>

1560
01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:50.850
<v Speaker 2>when you're in a traffic jam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1561
01:11:50.851 --> 01:11:54.540
<v Speaker 2>in them situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also want you imagine that there's a</v>

1562
01:11:54.541 --> 01:11:59.190
<v Speaker 2>dog running around and barking a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>big dog and making lots of noise.</v>

1563
01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:05.040
<v Speaker 2>There's also a modern woman arguing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the street and I've been a blazing raul</v>

1564
01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:09.160
<v Speaker 2>the window next door of the house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 11.</v>

1565
01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:14.410
<v Speaker 2>They're blaring out really loud music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also a group of schoolchildren</v>

1566
01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:17.940
<v Speaker 2>coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from school I'm making noise.</v>

1567
01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I want you to notice what you notice</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1568
01:12:21.511 --> 01:12:23.400
<v Speaker 2>what you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and feel what you feel about the</v>

1569
01:12:23.401 --> 01:12:25.350
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the window open.</v>

1570
01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Now I want you to start moving Backwards</v>
<v Speaker 2>further and further away from the window</v>

1571
01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:36.890
<v Speaker 2>so the window gets smaller and smaller</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you move really,</v>

1572
01:12:37.381 --> 01:12:42.381
<v Speaker 2>really bad from the window I went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow that window's smaller and smaller</v>

1573
01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.860
<v Speaker 2>as you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really wary away from the window,</v>

1574
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.780
<v Speaker 2>so wIndows really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really small.</v>

1575
01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I want you to walk out that room and</v>
<v Speaker 2>closed the door</v>

1576
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:54.763
<v Speaker 7>and just be.</v>

1577
01:12:58.190 --> 01:13:01.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it?</v>

1578
01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1579
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Skin away from the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get away from that window so that she</v>

1580
01:13:04.801 --> 01:13:06.640
<v Speaker 1>could make a bumper sticker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get away from the window.</v>

1581
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:10.580
<v Speaker 1>He's just so you just so you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>withdraw it away from the window all the</v>

1582
01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.150
<v Speaker 1>way from chaos and just quIet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself down.</v>

1583
01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:16.690
<v Speaker 1>So now using that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tool,</v>

1584
01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:19.840
<v Speaker 1>like how would want implement that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life like that sort of a.</v>

1585
01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:22.250
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these loads of different ways of,</v>

1586
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:27.430
<v Speaker 2>of induction into hypnosis is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is zillow two different ways with that.</v>

1587
01:13:28.861 --> 01:13:30.710
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like it personally,</v>

1588
01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:36.190
<v Speaker 2>learn off a lady called dolores ashcroft</v>
<v Speaker 2>whiskey and just move away from things</v>

1589
01:13:37.101 --> 01:13:39.890
<v Speaker 2>that are going on and just give yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just even a few minutes of just</v>

1590
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:41.030
<v Speaker 2>quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you,</v>

1591
01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:43.610
<v Speaker 2>when you shut down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shut the door and he'd just be,</v>

1592
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:46.820
<v Speaker 2>you can just imagine yourself sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can start using your</v>

1593
01:13:46.821 --> 01:13:51.620
<v Speaker 2>breathing techniques or just allowing</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself to just sit just for a few</v>

1594
01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:53.570
<v Speaker 2>minutes and see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what comes up for you.</v>

1595
01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:55.060
<v Speaker 2>See how calm he can.</v>

1596
01:13:56.530 --> 01:14:00.340
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about something before</v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast that I wanted to talk to you</v>

1597
01:14:00.341 --> 01:14:01.174
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1598
01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1599
01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:04.180
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to archery.</v>

1600
01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:09.310
<v Speaker 1>and that there is a thing that happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>in archery called target panic.</v>

1601
01:14:09.610 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 1>And what target panic is people</v>

1602
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:17.010
<v Speaker 3>that in the moment they start freaking</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and they can't stay calm and they</v>

1603
01:14:17.441 --> 01:14:19.270
<v Speaker 3>can't they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they do is they.</v>

1604
01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:23.200
<v Speaker 3>They try to get that pin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when when you're shooting a bow</v>

1605
01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:28.630
<v Speaker 3>that you have a site and on that site</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a pin and the pin is it's.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's set up to where whatever yardage</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to shoot at and your boat</v>

1607
01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:37.660
<v Speaker 3>gets cited in and once your boa is cited</v>
<v Speaker 3>In,</v>

1608
01:14:37.661 --> 01:14:42.661
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of dial your scope to or</v>
<v Speaker 3>your your site to like 20 yards,</v>

1609
01:14:42.851 --> 01:14:43.990
<v Speaker 3>30 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 yards.</v>

1610
01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:48.880
<v Speaker 3>And what happens is people put that pin</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the target,</v>

1611
01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:51.630
<v Speaker 3>whether it's at a competition or whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's bowhunting,</v>

1612
01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:54.940
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put that pin on a target and the</v>

1613
01:14:54.941 --> 01:14:58.140
<v Speaker 3>moment that's on the target,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start freaking out because the,</v>

1614
01:14:58.170 --> 01:15:02.290
<v Speaker 3>the moment that this all is going down</v>
<v Speaker 3>is happening soon.</v>

1615
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:05.500
<v Speaker 3>And people hammer that trigger on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hammer that trigger,</v>

1616
01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:09.130
<v Speaker 3>they jerked the pin offline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't stay still.</v>

1617
01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.150
<v Speaker 3>They panic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this target panic causes bad shots.</v>

1618
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:18.340
<v Speaker 3>And you introduced me to this idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>called hakalau.</v>

1619
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Hakalau explained to me,</v>

1620
01:15:21.330 --> 01:15:22.750
<v Speaker 2>hello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I always.</v>

1621
01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm from a belief system from Hawaii</v>
<v Speaker 2>called huna eisa.</v>

1622
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:31.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a hypnotic state and I'm nauseous</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time in driving,</v>

1623
01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.760
<v Speaker 2>watching tv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we said earlier,</v>

1624
01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:36.300
<v Speaker 3>when you drive and you don't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize how you got home,</v>

1625
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:38.010
<v Speaker 3>you just on autopilot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1626
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just kept no goget.</v>

1627
01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:40.931
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the word.</v>

1628
01:15:40.931 --> 01:15:42.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1629
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:45.310
<v Speaker 2>he's driving it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's basically so huck allow spelling,</v>

1630
01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.840
<v Speaker 2>hakalau,</v>
<v Speaker 2>h a,</v>

1632
01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:52.610
<v Speaker 3>these motherfuckers and there</v>
<v Speaker 3>brutalization of our god given language.</v>

1633
01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:52.970
<v Speaker 3>How</v>

<v Speaker 2>You've got my dad's gone.</v>

1636
01:15:59.111 --> 01:16:01.050
<v Speaker 2>The hackle hello?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>

1637
01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Kate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>J k l a,</v>

1638
01:16:04.511 --> 01:16:06.330
<v Speaker 2>u l a u?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1639
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.670
<v Speaker 2>So he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a hypnotic state and the,</v>

1640
01:16:08.671 --> 01:16:10.710
<v Speaker 2>it's quite easy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1641
01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.900
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done it with a lot of people and it</v>

1642
01:16:13.901 --> 01:16:16.420
<v Speaker 2>works very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well to use to calm yourself down a</v>

1643
01:16:16.421 --> 01:16:18.370
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as I said before,</v>

1644
01:16:18.371 --> 01:16:20.590
<v Speaker 2>what you do is I'll just sit down and do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1645
01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:23.980
<v Speaker 2>So you're basically using lots of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways of doing it.</v>

1646
01:16:23.981 --> 01:16:27.400
<v Speaker 2>You can find a spot on the wall that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher than your eye line,</v>

1647
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:30.900
<v Speaker 2>so you kind of look it up on a diagonal</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you imagine that you can,</v>

1648
01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:34.840
<v Speaker 2>you're looking for your third eye</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for the middle of your eyebrows</v>

1649
01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:38.680
<v Speaker 2>and what you do is you focus on a spot</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the wall and why are you focusing all</v>

1650
01:16:38.681 --> 01:16:43.540
<v Speaker 2>your energy on that spot you imagined</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can see all the way to the left</v>

1651
01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:47.780
<v Speaker 2>and all the way to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that you can see really high</v>

1652
01:16:47.781 --> 01:16:50.710
<v Speaker 2>above self and below yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you imagine while you're</v>

1653
01:16:50.711 --> 01:16:52.390
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can imagine you can use your</v>

1654
01:16:52.391 --> 01:16:56.140
<v Speaker 2>awareness to touch everything in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>room so you can see behind yourself,</v>

1655
01:16:56.141 --> 01:16:58.960
<v Speaker 2>very rarely above yourself and below</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and around yourself.</v>

1656
01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.500
<v Speaker 2>And what that does is it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it calms you down and gives you a bigger</v>

1657
01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.810
<v Speaker 2>periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's peripheral vision is increasing</v>

1658
01:17:04.811 --> 01:17:08.010
<v Speaker 2>your peripheral vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is extremely good for combat</v>

1659
01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:09.590
<v Speaker 2>combat athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

1660
01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:10.150
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1661
01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:12.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being calm and just putting</v>

1662
01:17:12.381 --> 01:17:14.630
<v Speaker 1>yourself in a common situatIon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we talked about,</v>

1663
01:17:14.890 --> 01:17:18.770
<v Speaker 1>bossy allometry young girl didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier ease and hair color all the</v>

1664
01:17:18.771 --> 01:17:19.990
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

1665
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:21.440
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a pretty bad ass.</v>

1666
01:17:21.441 --> 01:17:24.710
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So explain to me why increasing your</v>

1667
01:17:24.711 --> 01:17:27.980
<v Speaker 1>peripheral benefits you like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it do?</v>

1668
01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:28.873
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you,</v>

1669
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.240
<v Speaker 1>when people say have tunnel vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1670
01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.101
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that.</v>

1671
01:17:31.101 --> 01:17:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you write some of asians like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1672
01:17:33.291 --> 01:17:36.590
<v Speaker 1>you don't see anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that in street fights,</v>

1673
01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:37.481
<v Speaker 1>you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1674
01:17:37.481 --> 01:17:39.230
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this one street fight</v>

1675
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:40.211
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1676
01:17:40.211 --> 01:17:45.050
<v Speaker 1>I watched in front of the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These two guys were arguing and uh,</v>

1677
01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:50.170
<v Speaker 1>this one guy had zero idea how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like literally zero.</v>

1678
01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:54.440
<v Speaker 1>And he's standing in front of this other</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy and they start throwing Blows.</v>

1679
01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:57.050
<v Speaker 1>And this guy literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's wIncing,</v>

1680
01:17:57.170 --> 01:18:01.610
<v Speaker 1>his eyes are almost closed and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this because it may,</v>

1681
01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:05.720
<v Speaker 1>it standing square in front of this guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is literally like throwing his</v>

1682
01:18:05.721 --> 01:18:06.554
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

1683
01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:09.350
<v Speaker 1>A bus moves in front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see what happens.</v>

1684
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:11.720
<v Speaker 1>The bus pulls forth and the guy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>flattened,</v>

1685
01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.330
<v Speaker 1>just laying flat out and the other guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>were running away,</v>

1686
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:17.810
<v Speaker 1>so this guy cracked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other guy didn't know what the fuck</v>

1687
01:18:17.811 --> 01:18:20.810
<v Speaker 1>he was doing either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was lucky that the first guy over by</v>

1688
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:22.060
<v Speaker 1>the bus then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1689
01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:22.501
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1690
01:18:22.501 --> 01:18:22.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1691
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:23.031
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1692
01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:23.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1693
01:18:23.301 --> 01:18:25.940
<v Speaker 1>He just got knocked out on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were in this treat when this</v>

1694
01:18:25.941 --> 01:18:29.420
<v Speaker 1>happened though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my point is that you could tell that</v>

1695
01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:34.280
<v Speaker 1>this guy was frozen in this moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't aware of this guy throwing his</v>

1696
01:18:34.281 --> 01:18:38.510
<v Speaker 1>hands on them and moving his head out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way and being completely aware most</v>

1697
01:18:38.511 --> 01:18:41.750
<v Speaker 1>of the time in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in really incredibly stressful</v>

1698
01:18:41.751 --> 01:18:43.190
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

1699
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:46.700
<v Speaker 1>your point of vision closes and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>tense up.</v>

1700
01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by expanding your peripheral vision,</v>

1701
01:18:50.690 --> 01:18:52.430
<v Speaker 1>you think you can relax.</v>

1702
01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:56.260
<v Speaker 1>It could be come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come extra law.</v>

1703
01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:00.500
<v Speaker 1>What is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're expanding your peripheral</v>

1704
01:19:00.501 --> 01:19:01.730
<v Speaker 1>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting your unconscious.</v>

1705
01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:07.160
<v Speaker 1>So say you're opening your unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>via just like just seeing more than you</v>

1706
01:19:07.161 --> 01:19:10.190
<v Speaker 1>can actually say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So say if you were in a an archery</v>

1707
01:19:10.191 --> 01:19:12.320
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're shooting at this target.</v>

1708
01:19:12.321 --> 01:19:16.160
<v Speaker 1>That's like 70 meters away and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>really have to concentrate and you're</v>

1709
01:19:16.161 --> 01:19:19.400
<v Speaker 1>looking at that spot and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's all these nerves and</v>

1710
01:19:19.401 --> 01:19:21.860
<v Speaker 1>everything like that and you're drawing</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bow back and you're constantly on</v>

1711
01:19:21.861 --> 01:19:24.680
<v Speaker 1>that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would one implement that then?</v>

1712
01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do hunkeler.</v>

1713
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:28.670
<v Speaker 1>You do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do that first.</v>

1714
01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:32.090
<v Speaker 1>explain that so you find a spot and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a spot that's higher than the</v>

1715
01:19:32.091 --> 01:19:32.990
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>FoR instance,</v>

1716
01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.790
<v Speaker 1>say the sockets here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd find it's august.</v>

1717
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:36.870
<v Speaker 1>That's just above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>SaY elvis.</v>

1718
01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.740
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you look for a few feet above the</v>

1719
01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:40.150
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>

1720
01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Just find a spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Concentrate on.</v>

1721
01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Just allow yourself to spread your</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness.</v>

1722
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:46.520
<v Speaker 1>There's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another way of they get wet.</v>

1723
01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.050
<v Speaker 1>You can have your palms out like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1724
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:52.120
<v Speaker 1>And then when you bring your palms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can see out,</v>

1725
01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:54.240
<v Speaker 1>so you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see it on palm,</v>

1726
01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:56.140
<v Speaker 1>you dRop your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

1727
01:19:56.150 --> 01:19:58.570
<v Speaker 1>You'd also put your hand over your hat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when you,</v>

1728
01:19:58.571 --> 01:20:00.200
<v Speaker 1>when you can see your fingers over your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

1729
01:20:00.201 --> 01:20:04.040
<v Speaker 1>you drop that to so spread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You spread your arms out,</v>

1730
01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:07.470
<v Speaker 1>you can't see your arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you start bringing them and the</v>

1731
01:20:07.471 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 1>moment you</v>

1732
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.140
<v Speaker 3>see your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you drop your hands,</v>

1733
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:14.400
<v Speaker 3>but you keep your eyes forward so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep your eyes focused on wherever that</v>

1734
01:20:14.401 --> 01:20:19.401
<v Speaker 3>spot is over your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you let your hands down and why is</v>

1735
01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.110
<v Speaker 3>what is going on when I'm doing that</v>

1736
01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:21.931
<v Speaker 2>based?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1737
01:20:21.931 --> 01:20:24.310
<v Speaker 2>The focus point it just banged awareness</v>
<v Speaker 2>picker.</v>

1738
01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:26.790
<v Speaker 2>Just make sure your site bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>

1739
01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:27.990
<v Speaker 2>when you're in the periphery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1740
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Have a calmness about you.</v>

1741
01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:32.660
<v Speaker 3>And what is the philosophy when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about hakalau in w?</v>

1742
01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.530
<v Speaker 3>What did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The name of the luna.</v>

1743
01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:37.560
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the thought process about</v>

1744
01:20:37.561 --> 01:20:38.400
<v Speaker 3>hakalau?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

1745
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:41.860
<v Speaker 3>is that a part of their practice as part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that practice?</v>

1746
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.080
<v Speaker 3>You do this thing with their arms.</v>

1747
01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no.</v>

1748
01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.230
<v Speaker 2>These loads of different ways of doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware of.</v>

1749
01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.380
<v Speaker 2>They do it with the hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1750
01:20:47.650 --> 01:20:49.810
<v Speaker 2>I just know techniques you've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>taught or whatever,</v>

1751
01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:53.380
<v Speaker 2>but I know that you know the staring at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spot on the wall and allowing your</v>

1752
01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:55.000
<v Speaker 2>periphery just to spread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1753
01:20:55.190 --> 01:20:56.920
<v Speaker 2>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what is,</v>

1754
01:20:56.921 --> 01:20:58.240
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it work?</v>

1755
01:20:58.241 --> 01:21:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Like what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It calms your mind.</v>

1756
01:21:01.121 --> 01:21:04.690
<v Speaker 2>And if you're focusing on something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're focusing on,</v>

1757
01:21:04.691 --> 01:21:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you're shooting,</v>

1758
01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're looking at law and yet you've</v>

1759
01:21:08.591 --> 01:21:10.690
<v Speaker 2>got this background shit going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1760
01:21:10.691 --> 01:21:11.170
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

1761
01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:13.450
<v Speaker 2>More than likely that ski focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1762
01:21:13.451 --> 01:21:14.510
<v Speaker 2>that's not your focus guys,</v>

1763
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:17.340
<v Speaker 3>the one you're pointing to your head</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to listen to and you're saying</v>

1764
01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:17.671
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1765
01:21:17.671 --> 01:21:20.390
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean like the inner dialogue,</v>

1766
01:21:20.391 --> 01:21:21.750
<v Speaker 3>the chuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't fuck this up,</v>

1767
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:24.290
<v Speaker 3>don't miss miss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Breathe properly,</v>

1768
01:21:24.291 --> 01:21:25.124
<v Speaker 3>braised properly.</v>

1769
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:26.950
<v Speaker 2>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

1770
01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:31.330
<v Speaker 2>when you get control of yourself by just</v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing your awareness,</v>

1771
01:21:31.810 --> 01:21:32.850
<v Speaker 2>which is your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1772
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:35.500
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your area said,</v>

1773
01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:37.240
<v Speaker 2>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you start.</v>

1774
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Then you just get yourself into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>composition.</v>

1775
01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:41.940
<v Speaker 3>So say if someone was in a hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

1776
01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:45.530
<v Speaker 3>there was a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>the deer is moving to 30 yards away and</v>

1777
01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.990
<v Speaker 3>it's moving right into what you would</v>
<v Speaker 3>call it,</v>

1778
01:21:47.991 --> 01:21:52.991
<v Speaker 3>a shooting lane in between two trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How would you try to initiate haka loud?</v>

1779
01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Because you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before you Started,</v>

1780
01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:59.140
<v Speaker 2>are you to keep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Practice it all the time.</v>

1781
01:21:59.170 --> 01:22:00.190
<v Speaker 2>When did you participate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1782
01:22:00.370 --> 01:22:02.320
<v Speaker 2>when you brought it all the time it</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes a part of.</v>

1783
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like anything mind coaching or</v>

1784
01:22:04.901 --> 01:22:09.901
<v Speaker 2>being been using the techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I teach people these you got practice,</v>

1785
01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.400
<v Speaker 2>you can't just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just go,</v>

1786
01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:13.360
<v Speaker 2>hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

1787
01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:16.240
<v Speaker 2>And you have to practice it and practice</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and practice it and it becomes,</v>

1788
01:22:16.690 --> 01:22:17.760
<v Speaker 2>it becomes more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1789
01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:22.730
<v Speaker 3>So this seems like such a simple</v>
<v Speaker 3>solution to a very complex issue.</v>

1790
01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:27.680
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of what is going on with</v>
<v Speaker 3>archery is what's called a.</v>

1791
01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:31.190
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of different theories are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the theories is w recoil bracing,</v>

1792
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:34.370
<v Speaker 3>like you know that something's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen so you're preparing for this</v>

1793
01:22:34.371 --> 01:22:37.730
<v Speaker 3>thing to happen and then in preparing</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that thing to happen that is</v>

1794
01:22:37.731 --> 01:22:41.660
<v Speaker 3>becoming more of your focus then</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually making it work correctly.</v>

1795
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it.</v>

1796
01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:46.030
<v Speaker 2>But it does calm me down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even in the aspects of shooting,</v>

1797
01:22:46.031 --> 01:22:48.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm surely that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1798
01:22:48.361 --> 01:22:51.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean surely it's calming down that</v>

1799
01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:54.250
<v Speaker 2>you're aiming for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for aiming at something.</v>

1800
01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1801
01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:59.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's also being focused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely focused on the result and not</v>

1802
01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:01.180
<v Speaker 2>negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just focus your awareness.</v>

1803
01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1804
01:23:02.411 --> 01:23:05.380
<v Speaker 2>the more that you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more people do inspiring as they get</v>

1805
01:23:05.381 --> 01:23:07.290
<v Speaker 2>less hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got,</v>

1806
01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:10.820
<v Speaker 2>they get less hit inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know where there's a weight lifter</v>

1807
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:12.270
<v Speaker 2>called Emma James,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1808
01:23:12.510 --> 01:23:17.510
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a 20 old time will have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting lady person and um,</v>

1809
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:21.210
<v Speaker 2>she uses alcohol and it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what does she do?</v>

1810
01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.900
<v Speaker 2>She just basically same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smokers.</v>

1811
01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:27.320
<v Speaker 3>And are there other methods other than</v>
<v Speaker 3>those straight straightening your arms</v>

1812
01:23:27.321 --> 01:23:28.080
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1813
01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.880
<v Speaker 2>looking forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best one,</v>

1814
01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.550
<v Speaker 2>my personal opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1815
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:33.150
<v Speaker 2>people may argue it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1816
01:23:33.450 --> 01:23:38.040
<v Speaker 2>my personal opinion is you say you folks</v>
<v Speaker 2>find a spot on the wall and allow your</v>

1817
01:23:38.041 --> 01:23:40.650
<v Speaker 2>awareness just a spread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you imagine you can see all the way</v>

1818
01:23:40.651 --> 01:23:42.510
<v Speaker 2>to the left and all the way to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1819
01:23:42.570 --> 01:23:44.790
<v Speaker 2>So you're out in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pick a spot on a tree.</v>

1820
01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you keep practicing and keep doing</v>

1821
01:23:47.611 --> 01:23:50.820
<v Speaker 2>it and you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will eventually be embedded.</v>

1822
01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:55.410
<v Speaker 2>So why is expandIng your peripheral</v>
<v Speaker 2>vision calming?</v>

1823
01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

1824
01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:00.800
<v Speaker 2>it just seems to calm the whole body</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1825
01:24:00.810 --> 01:24:01.680
<v Speaker 2>He sees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1826
01:24:01.681 --> 01:24:04.050
<v Speaker 2>you're not full.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You focusing on spreading your</v>

1827
01:24:04.051 --> 01:24:05.820
<v Speaker 2>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not focusing on panic.</v>

1828
01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:10.620
<v Speaker 2>Are you focusing on anything else so</v>
<v Speaker 2>surely if you're just focusing on seeing</v>

1829
01:24:10.621 --> 01:24:14.280
<v Speaker 2>and just moving out and so allowing</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself just to spread.</v>

1830
01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:16.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you can just.</v>

1831
01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:19.170
<v Speaker 2>You can just feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>WHen I do seminars,</v>

1832
01:24:19.171 --> 01:24:23.090
<v Speaker 2>which you do a lot of you doing seminar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking to people and this,</v>

1833
01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:25.350
<v Speaker 2>this and this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can spot people tHat are wondering</v>

1834
01:24:25.351 --> 01:24:28.080
<v Speaker 2>mentally so you can see them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you just turn it until you</v>

1835
01:24:28.081 --> 01:24:29.540
<v Speaker 2>understand and then just go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1836
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:30.540
<v Speaker 2>because you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>

1837
01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:34.170
<v Speaker 2>You have to guide the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knows certainly when you're doing</v>

1838
01:24:34.171 --> 01:24:36.180
<v Speaker 2>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you do anyway.</v>

1839
01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:38.040
<v Speaker 2>I think you'll be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll do it in comedy.</v>

1840
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:41.790
<v Speaker 2>I think when you're on the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll do it in comedy anyway because</v>

1841
01:24:41.791 --> 01:24:44.970
<v Speaker 2>you can become a ladder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody sort of.</v>

1842
01:24:45.810 --> 01:24:50.550
<v Speaker 2>You definitely go into a state of hello</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it induces a state.</v>

1843
01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:53.020
<v Speaker 3>When you're doing comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in the moment,</v>

1844
01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:57.250
<v Speaker 3>but you're also a passenger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1845
01:24:57.260 --> 01:25:00.310
<v Speaker 3>to do comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you almost have to get out of your own</v>

1846
01:25:00.311 --> 01:25:03.070
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you also have to have prepared the</v>

1847
01:25:03.071 --> 01:25:05.530
<v Speaker 3>material enough to where you know where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going with it</v>

1848
01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:07.820
<v Speaker 2>so you can relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about thinking about archery.</v>

1849
01:25:07.821 --> 01:25:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Then you know you have to go your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>way because the only person that's</v>

1850
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:12.303
<v Speaker 2>panicking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ego,</v>

1851
01:25:12.450 --> 01:25:13.230
<v Speaker 2>the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that,</v>

1852
01:25:13.230 --> 01:25:16.640
<v Speaker 2>whatever you shoot and exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's exactly the same.</v>

1853
01:25:16.641 --> 01:25:20.200
<v Speaker 2>You're moving yourself out of the way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get yourself into the zone way you're</v>

1854
01:25:20.201 --> 01:25:21.320
<v Speaker 2>going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

1855
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Just just try it and if you know</v>

1856
01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:28.030
<v Speaker 3>definitely well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting solution to a</v>

1857
01:25:28.031 --> 01:25:32.440
<v Speaker 3>really common issue with archers like</v>
<v Speaker 3>tournament archers,</v>

1858
01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:37.860
<v Speaker 3>they panic so much that they've come up</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a method of allowing this boat to</v>

1859
01:25:38.411 --> 01:25:43.411
<v Speaker 3>go off without them doing it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a surprise release hypnosis.</v>

1860
01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:46.390
<v Speaker 3>that's a hypnotic state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1861
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.140
<v Speaker 3>They have this thing called a hinge</v>
<v Speaker 3>release and what a hinge release as you</v>

1862
01:25:50.141 --> 01:25:52.840
<v Speaker 3>clip it onto your bow and as you pull it</v>
<v Speaker 3>back,</v>

1863
01:25:52.841 --> 01:25:56.650
<v Speaker 3>instead of hitting a trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're slowly moving your hand and you</v>

1864
01:25:56.651 --> 01:26:00.310
<v Speaker 3>never know when it's going to go off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just slowly curling your finger and</v>

1865
01:26:00.311 --> 01:26:03.350
<v Speaker 3>there's a little hinge inside of it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>once it gets past a certain point,</v>

1866
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:06.620
<v Speaker 3>it just goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead of like hammering the trigger</v>

1867
01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.300
<v Speaker 3>goes off completely by surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they figured out a solution to</v>

1868
01:26:11.301 --> 01:26:15.450
<v Speaker 3>whatever this thing is that fucks with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's heads.</v>

1869
01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:19.220
<v Speaker 3>But what you think is that if you can do</v>
<v Speaker 3>It in practice,</v>

1870
01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:23.560
<v Speaker 3>you can do It in a real life situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you expand</v>

1871
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:25.550
<v Speaker 2>your peripheral vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1872
01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1873
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:30.580
<v Speaker 2>like we talked the last time it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>unable to talk about golovkin.</v>

1874
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:34.510
<v Speaker 2>He talks about feeling innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how he says about about punches,</v>

1875
01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:37.780
<v Speaker 2>but I feel this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it says feel all the time</v>

1876
01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:39.940
<v Speaker 2>and he feels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he feels,</v>

1877
01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:41.470
<v Speaker 2>I feel this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know him.</v>

1878
01:26:41.471 --> 01:26:45.070
<v Speaker 2>I feel he is an awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The spansion of awareness.</v>

1879
01:26:45.370 --> 01:26:46.151
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in english.</v>

1880
01:26:46.151 --> 01:26:50.050
<v Speaker 2>You know that when you flip the bird in</v>
<v Speaker 2>english is that it's two fingers,</v>

1881
01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:53.380
<v Speaker 2>you know what it's from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's from when we had was with the</v>

1882
01:26:53.381 --> 01:26:55.450
<v Speaker 2>french or the french,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the capture,</v>

1883
01:26:55.490 --> 01:27:00.490
<v Speaker 2>the arches that cut the fingers off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's just to say this before.</v>

1884
01:27:00.791 --> 01:27:01.451
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1885
01:27:01.451 --> 01:27:03.400
<v Speaker 2>But that's to do with the to say fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

1886
01:27:03.401 --> 01:27:05.590
<v Speaker 2>I've got my two fingers and that's from</v>
<v Speaker 2>archer.</v>

1887
01:27:06.210 --> 01:27:08.410
<v Speaker 2>That makeS sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not a state.</v>

1888
01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Do you know the mongols didn't use it</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

1889
01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.350
<v Speaker 3>They use their thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hook it with their thumb and then</v>

1890
01:27:14.351 --> 01:27:16.240
<v Speaker 3>they grabbed their finger like this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pull it back.</v>

1891
01:27:16.241 --> 01:27:20.500
<v Speaker 3>That way they had their own little weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have a release in your hand.</v>

1892
01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.980
<v Speaker 3>You do it this way because you can get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistent anchor point.</v>

1893
01:27:24.010 --> 01:27:24.970
<v Speaker 3>So it's running your chin.</v>

1894
01:27:26.370 --> 01:27:28.560
<v Speaker 2>If you drop the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you drop the boat,</v>

1895
01:27:28.650 --> 01:27:30.280
<v Speaker 2>the arrow drops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1896
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1897
01:27:31.831 --> 01:27:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that one year you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay completely still.</v>

1898
01:27:34.441 --> 01:27:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Is the arrow releases coming from robin</v>
<v Speaker 2>hood country as a natural thing?</v>

1899
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:39.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1900
01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:40.880
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1901
01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:42.480
<v Speaker 3>But there's a bunch of different kinds</v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

1902
01:27:42.481 --> 01:27:44.610
<v Speaker 3>Bose is a bunch of different ways of</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting,</v>

1903
01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:48.090
<v Speaker 3>like when you're shooting with a recurve</v>
<v Speaker 3>bow or a traditional bow,</v>

1904
01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:51.030
<v Speaker 3>you're pulling it back and just letting</v>
<v Speaker 3>it go really quickly,</v>

1905
01:27:51.090 --> 01:27:53.310
<v Speaker 3>bang with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a compound bow,</v>

1906
01:27:53.311 --> 01:27:57.510
<v Speaker 3>you're settling in and relaxing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to stay calm and keep the pin</v>

1907
01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:01.230
<v Speaker 3>relatively close to the area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but concentrating on the spot and then</v>

1908
01:28:01.231 --> 01:28:05.790
<v Speaker 3>you release and as you release,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be in one smooth motion with</v>

1909
01:28:05.791 --> 01:28:09.790
<v Speaker 3>your hand pulls back as you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no yanking this way of</v>

1910
01:28:09.810 --> 01:28:13.440
<v Speaker 3>pulling that way or there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's gonna affect the travel of the</v>

1911
01:28:13.441 --> 01:28:14.274
<v Speaker 3>arrow</v>

1912
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:18.070
<v Speaker 2>level that there's a lot of minDset</v>
<v Speaker 2>going into a level of self trust.</v>

1913
01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Isn't aware that there's a big level of</v>
<v Speaker 2>self trust and not saying anything small</v>

1914
01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.530
<v Speaker 2>or anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1915
01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:26.680
<v Speaker 2>learning to trust yourself and trusting</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1916
01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:28.480
<v Speaker 2>trusting your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1917
01:28:28.481 --> 01:28:29.800
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just think that with,</v>

1918
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:33.540
<v Speaker 2>with mine coaching stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with techniques that you know,</v>

1919
01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:37.390
<v Speaker 2>that you get to learn and get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to having your locker,</v>

1920
01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I think it's massively beneficial as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're alive.</v>

1921
01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:41.620
<v Speaker 2>You will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you,</v>

1922
01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:44.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can always record something and send</v>

1923
01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:48.850
<v Speaker 2>you it before you go to this thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing and see what happens.</v>

1924
01:28:48.851 --> 01:28:51.340
<v Speaker 2>I'd be interesting for me to see what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens because I've never worked with</v>

1925
01:28:51.341 --> 01:28:53.620
<v Speaker 2>anyone in the zone archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1926
01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:56.530
<v Speaker 2>It is a lot of preparation for one</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

1927
01:28:56.740 --> 01:29:01.200
<v Speaker 3>Might happen once a year and that's one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the big things about it is like when</v>

1928
01:29:01.201 --> 01:29:03.590
<v Speaker 3>someone prepares for like a bow hunt in</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>

1929
01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.910
<v Speaker 3>the lease a tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have multiple shots,</v>

1930
01:29:05.911 --> 01:29:08.070
<v Speaker 3>you can shoot many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times you get more relaxed,</v>

1931
01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:12.660
<v Speaker 3>but when someone prepares for a hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are preparing year round.</v>

1932
01:29:12.661 --> 01:29:14.220
<v Speaker 3>You're shooting arrows constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1933
01:29:14.221 --> 01:29:15.054
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an.</v>

1934
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:18.950
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe how hard it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when I first started doing and I</v>

1935
01:29:18.951 --> 01:29:19.741
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the big deal?</v>

1936
01:29:19.741 --> 01:29:21.450
<v Speaker 3>You stand there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you keep your arms straight,</v>

1937
01:29:21.451 --> 01:29:23.370
<v Speaker 3>you pull the bow back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1938
01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:26.760
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot going on and there's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much to consider.</v>

1939
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.800
<v Speaker 3>The position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the placement of your feet,</v>

1940
01:29:28.801 --> 01:29:31.830
<v Speaker 3>the position of your front shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you're gripping the bow,</v>

1941
01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:34.530
<v Speaker 3>pulling back to the same consistent</v>
<v Speaker 3>anchor point,</v>

1942
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:38.040
<v Speaker 3>looking through the peep site correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make sure you send her the peep site</v>

1943
01:29:38.041 --> 01:29:41.620
<v Speaker 3>with the site housing on the bow</v>
<v Speaker 3>releasing with no movement whatsoever,</v>

1944
01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:44.430
<v Speaker 3>making sure that everything is done</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly and keeping the mind</v>

1945
01:29:44.431 --> 01:29:48.510
<v Speaker 3>concentrating specifically on a spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to look where you want to hit.</v>

1946
01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:52.080
<v Speaker 3>You can't look in the vague area and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't hope you're going to hit</v>

1947
01:29:52.081 --> 01:29:54.690
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be absolutely convinced</v>

1948
01:29:54.691 --> 01:29:55.410
<v Speaker 3>you're going to hit something.</v>

1949
01:29:55.410 --> 01:29:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you will.</v>

1950
01:29:57.770 --> 01:30:00.190
<v Speaker 1>You will look at you positive thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will.</v>

1951
01:30:00.370 --> 01:30:01.910
<v Speaker 1>You will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the intention.</v>

1952
01:30:01.911 --> 01:30:05.210
<v Speaker 1>So if your intention set your intention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set your site,</v>

1953
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:08.030
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the same as it not set</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sight on right,</v>

1954
01:30:08.031 --> 01:30:11.900
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I'm going to do set you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say on your intention where you go and</v>

1955
01:30:11.901 --> 01:30:12.980
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm going to do.</v>

1956
01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Set your intention and that is a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of why people fuck up.</v>

1957
01:30:17.690 --> 01:30:19.100
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope this works.</v>

1958
01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:22.760
<v Speaker 1>This works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The even said that strikes part,</v>

1959
01:30:22.761 --> 01:30:23.900
<v Speaker 1>do or do not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no try.</v>

1960
01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:25.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you set your intention.</v>

1961
01:30:25.371 --> 01:30:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I know it's cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1962
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:30.800
<v Speaker 1>we set your intention will a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times cliches are there for a reason,</v>

1963
01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.260
<v Speaker 1>but they're the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're real.</v>

1964
01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:35.030
<v Speaker 1>They represent reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1965
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:36.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think in this one it does.</v>

1966
01:30:37.150 --> 01:30:40.790
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just an extreme thing and it's also</v>

1967
01:30:40.791 --> 01:30:44.570
<v Speaker 3>a thing of this archery thing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bowhunting in particular where a lot of</v>

1968
01:30:44.571 --> 01:30:47.870
<v Speaker 3>people who are engaging in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might not have a lot of experience</v>

1969
01:30:47.871 --> 01:30:50.480
<v Speaker 3>in performing under extreme pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1970
01:30:51.170 --> 01:30:54.710
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have a lot of opportunities</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're performing under extreme</v>

1971
01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:58.820
<v Speaker 3>extreme pressure and then you have an</v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly intense moment where it's</v>

1972
01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:01.550
<v Speaker 3>literally life or death to this animal.</v>

1973
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1974
01:31:02.850 --> 01:31:07.650
<v Speaker 1>But at least we'll talk and we'll talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they want you to change the</v>

1975
01:31:07.651 --> 01:31:10.780
<v Speaker 1>language around it to give you a motor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the motor.</v>

1976
01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Because it is complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get la please.</v>

1977
01:31:14.130 --> 01:31:16.500
<v Speaker 1>We got to make it as less complicated as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can.</v>

1978
01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a smooth thing.</v>

1979
01:31:18.991 --> 01:31:20.850
<v Speaker 1>You said it's complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not complicated like the</v>

1980
01:31:20.851 --> 01:31:23.370
<v Speaker 1>english language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the english language is unbelievably</v>

1981
01:31:23.371 --> 01:31:25.560
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of letters and I mean</v>

1982
01:31:25.561 --> 01:31:29.280
<v Speaker 1>thousands of words and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're using them all in different ways</v>

1983
01:31:29.281 --> 01:31:31.620
<v Speaker 1>and inflection and we all do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort.</v>

1984
01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:33.910
<v Speaker 1>So think I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can,</v>

1985
01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:36.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing the techniques and helping</v>

1986
01:31:36.091 --> 01:31:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My certainly.</v>

1987
01:31:37.111 --> 01:31:37.944
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

1988
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:40.740
<v Speaker 1>you're a very nice man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you credit for sure.</v>

1989
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:42.850
<v Speaker 1>I want you to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

1990
01:31:43.050 --> 01:31:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted to talk to you about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this because I've seen all these</v>

1991
01:31:46.171 --> 01:31:51.171
<v Speaker 1>different methods that people use to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to overcome target panic and one of them</v>

1992
01:31:51.841 --> 01:31:56.280
<v Speaker 1>is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a positive affirmation or positive,</v>

1993
01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:57.780
<v Speaker 1>a way of looking at it.</v>

1994
01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Like my friend shane dorian was here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about his friend and his</v>

1995
01:32:03.731 --> 01:32:06.970
<v Speaker 1>friend right before he goes to shoot the</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrow.</v>

1996
01:32:06.971 --> 01:32:08.290
<v Speaker 1>And he said his friends are really nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1997
01:32:08.530 --> 01:32:11.020
<v Speaker 1>His friend says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fucking kill you.</v>

1998
01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:14.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what he says in his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fucking kill you.</v>

1999
01:32:14.630 --> 01:32:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Like he says that in his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's absolutely convinced this is what</v>

2000
01:32:18.221 --> 01:32:19.630
<v Speaker 1>he's going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2001
01:32:19.631 --> 01:32:23.350
<v Speaker 1>I hope this arrow lands perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I make a great shot.</v>

2002
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:27.040
<v Speaker 1>He affirms in in his head where there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no wishy washiness about it.</v>

2003
01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.900
<v Speaker 1>When I send intention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2004
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>full and you said you,</v>

2005
01:32:34.061 --> 01:32:34.810
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2006
01:32:34.810 --> 01:32:36.640
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you change the language around,</v>

2007
01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:38.110
<v Speaker 1>when he changed the language around</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

2008
01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.740
<v Speaker 1>it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes more useful to you.</v>

2009
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:44.050
<v Speaker 1>You know Lisa Dennis that I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2010
01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:45.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an affirmation,</v>

2011
01:32:45.131 --> 01:32:47.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's also setting your intention in</v>
<v Speaker 1>every way.</v>

2012
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:49.510
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did not.</v>

2013
01:32:49.511 --> 01:32:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Bow is setting your intention and every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single light,</v>

2014
01:32:51.611 --> 01:32:53.950
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because yOur intention is the beast,</v>

2015
01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:56.920
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're setting your intention so</v>

2016
01:32:56.921 --> 01:32:59.210
<v Speaker 1>you've got a calm this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2017
01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:00.800
<v Speaker 1>we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2018
01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:01.840
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get it.</v>

2019
01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.480
<v Speaker 1>We'll get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get it.</v>

2020
01:33:04.570 --> 01:33:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would really like to see if this is</v>

2021
01:33:07.841 --> 01:33:12.841
<v Speaker 1>effective or if it helps other archers</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's one of the things that me</v>

2022
01:33:12.911 --> 01:33:16.930
<v Speaker 1>getting involved in bow hunting or been</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed to this common problem that</v>

2023
01:33:16.931 --> 01:33:19.810
<v Speaker 1>people talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm absolutely fascinated by common</v>

2024
01:33:19.811 --> 01:33:23.680
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problems that seem to represent a</v>

2025
01:33:23.681 --> 01:33:27.880
<v Speaker 1>pattern of thinking that's really almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural,</v>

2026
01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:30.520
<v Speaker 1>but obviously should be avoided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2027
01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:31.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2028
01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:35.680
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just about you focusing your</v>

2029
01:33:35.681 --> 01:33:37.970
<v Speaker 1>attention on what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds.</v>

2030
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:40.600
<v Speaker 1>That'S how you get things in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You focus on what you want,</v>

2031
01:33:40.601 --> 01:33:41.500
<v Speaker 1>not what you don't want.</v>

2032
01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:45.280
<v Speaker 1>You focused on totally on up and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will get things that will trip you.</v>

2033
01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Don't live on a cloud and never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

2034
01:33:47.410 --> 01:33:49.720
<v Speaker 1>never say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you focus on what you</v>

2035
01:33:49.721 --> 01:33:53.260
<v Speaker 1>want and you keep focusing on what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want and to deal with things that get in</v>

2036
01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:54.670
<v Speaker 1>your way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but keep focusing on what you want.</v>

2037
01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:56.020
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>

2038
01:33:56.021 --> 01:33:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't focus on the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Focus on what you want.</v>

2039
01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Focus on how difficult is this problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how difficult it says,</v>

2040
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:05.320
<v Speaker 1>because all of you telling you you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all you're doing,</v>

2041
01:34:05.321 --> 01:34:07.110
<v Speaker 1>you're young conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you only formation.</v>

2042
01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:10.030
<v Speaker 1>You've given it some harder it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then what does it become?</v>

2043
01:34:10.031 --> 01:34:12.370
<v Speaker 1>It become something that becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>something huge,</v>

2044
01:34:12.610 --> 01:34:14.140
<v Speaker 1>and this comes back to what we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

2045
01:34:14.141 --> 01:34:18.040
<v Speaker 1>the very beginning of this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The language that you use in your own</v>

2046
01:34:18.041 --> 01:34:23.041
<v Speaker 1>mind can be very self-defining and can</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of really not just define you,</v>

2047
01:34:24.461 --> 01:34:29.461
<v Speaker 1>but define your future and how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you interact with life and I didn't</v>

2048
01:34:29.921 --> 01:34:34.390
<v Speaker 1>tell people I interview are you get you</v>
<v Speaker 1>come across a now you perceive yourself</v>

2049
01:34:34.391 --> 01:34:37.120
<v Speaker 1>in order to projects everything into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into what happens,</v>

2050
01:34:37.121 --> 01:34:40.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's the idea if it's,</v>

2051
01:34:40.890 --> 01:34:43.870
<v Speaker 1>is just changing the language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you speak to yourself.</v>

2052
01:34:44.570 --> 01:34:47.260
<v Speaker 1>if you can change the language ways you</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech of your life will change</v>

2053
01:34:47.261 --> 01:34:49.910
<v Speaker 1>exponentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my change.</v>

2054
01:34:49.911 --> 01:34:54.130
<v Speaker 1>The language folks change the language</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously this is also,</v>

2055
01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not an instantaneous process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2056
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:58.583
<v Speaker 1>He's practice.</v>

2057
01:34:59.730 --> 01:35:02.850
<v Speaker 2>The first time you did spend in bucket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't land on the target and was</v>

2058
01:35:03.150 --> 01:35:05.270
<v Speaker 2>brilliant like a senior wiley and now</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2062
01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:18.840
<v Speaker 2>it's just the slang term for kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very welli when you kick,</v>

2063
01:35:18.930 --> 01:35:20.790
<v Speaker 2>when your well eat something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kick in it because you know</v>

2064
01:35:20.791 --> 01:35:22.530
<v Speaker 2>wellington boots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2065
01:35:22.531 --> 01:35:23.370
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2066
01:35:23.371 --> 01:35:24.580
<v Speaker 2>but when i'Ve seen you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2067
01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:26.770
<v Speaker 2>the senior that spinning back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick it out,</v>

2068
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:29.270
<v Speaker 2>usually showing john same per judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>St louis.</v>

2069
01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:30.900
<v Speaker 2>That was right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2070
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:32.780
<v Speaker 2>so first time you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't do correctly.</v>

2071
01:35:33.230 --> 01:35:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about practice in mind.</v>

2072
01:35:35.710 --> 01:35:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Coaching isn't an instantaneous thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>for phobias.</v>

2073
01:35:37.891 --> 01:35:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Works.</v>

2074
01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean for,</v>

2075
01:35:42.630 --> 01:35:44.640
<v Speaker 2>for certain things in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to,</v>

2076
01:35:44.641 --> 01:35:47.850
<v Speaker 2>you've got to keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just nice thing is practice,</v>

2077
01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:49.480
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2078
01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:52.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the case with everything,</v>

2079
01:35:52.091 --> 01:35:55.540
<v Speaker 3>including thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking is a skill.</v>

2080
01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking of something that you have</v>

2081
01:35:57.581 --> 01:36:02.581
<v Speaker 3>to develop and develop proper technique</v>
<v Speaker 3>and adhere to these proper techniques.</v>

2082
01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:05.190
<v Speaker 3>Always.</v>

2083
01:36:05.190 --> 01:36:06.900
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I don't do one offs.</v>

2084
01:36:07.170 --> 01:36:11.040
<v Speaker 2>I used to do one off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he used to be one off sessions for</v>

2085
01:36:11.041 --> 01:36:13.560
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one to ones and do a session one</v>

2086
01:36:13.561 --> 01:36:15.510
<v Speaker 2>session.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do one anymore.</v>

2087
01:36:15.570 --> 01:36:19.920
<v Speaker 2>I do more do thinG called four weeks to</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom on our people that sign up for a</v>

2088
01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:23.040
<v Speaker 2>year with me as well because he seeks it</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ongoing process.</v>

2089
01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:24.290
<v Speaker 2>I sTill love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

2090
01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:25.650
<v Speaker 2>my teacher column,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mci,</v>

2091
01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:29.820
<v Speaker 2>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still pull up ruminate things and he</v>

2092
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:32.330
<v Speaker 2>puts my thinking on the right path or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever east.</v>

2093
01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.530
<v Speaker 2>No one's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not a finished products.</v>

2094
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:36.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not a finished product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2095
01:36:36.151 --> 01:36:38.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's just about practice.</v>

2096
01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:41.630
<v Speaker 3>That's really what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people would try to point out</v>

2097
01:36:41.670 --> 01:36:46.670
<v Speaker 3>inconsistencies in someone's behavior as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sign that maybe that person shouldn't</v>

2098
01:36:48.141 --> 01:36:51.890
<v Speaker 3>be the one that's being a mental coach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like yourself or someone who is maybe</v>

2099
01:36:51.891 --> 01:36:53.720
<v Speaker 3>not succeeded in everything they've ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried.</v>

2100
01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:57.350
<v Speaker 3>How could this person possibly be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental coach when they're not even</v>

2101
01:36:57.351 --> 01:37:01.070
<v Speaker 3>capable of running their own light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but know that every human being is</v>

2102
01:37:01.071 --> 01:37:04.580
<v Speaker 3>essentially the same in that regard is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that no matter where you are,</v>

2103
01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:07.250
<v Speaker 3>you could probably do better and no</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter who you are,</v>

2104
01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:11.300
<v Speaker 3>you have learned along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it by failure.</v>

2105
01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:14.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going back as well because I'm</v>

2106
01:37:15.450 --> 01:37:19.230
<v Speaker 2>fumbling because he does things that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think you'll change the face of parks</v>

2107
01:37:19.231 --> 01:37:20.580
<v Speaker 2>and I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that?</v>

2108
01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:23.280
<v Speaker 2>I've seen what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does like the short test.</v>

2109
01:37:23.281 --> 01:37:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that or he does the</v>
<v Speaker 2>different numbers.</v>

2110
01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:27.900
<v Speaker 2>What he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a short test way.</v>

2111
01:37:27.901 --> 01:37:32.730
<v Speaker 2>You wanted 25 and they're all in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>square and then they see this.</v>

2112
01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:35.610
<v Speaker 2>All the numbers are in squares as well</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he has to touch them and.</v>

2113
01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

2114
01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:39.870
<v Speaker 2>It just loads of different mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stuffy reaction drill.</v>

2115
01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's.</v>

2116
01:37:40.570 --> 01:37:43.590
<v Speaker 2>He's building his awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's building his intelligence.</v>

2117
01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:46.530
<v Speaker 2>That's why he's called himself hightech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's building his intelligence.</v>

2118
01:37:46.531 --> 01:37:48.720
<v Speaker 2>He's building his awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2119
01:37:48.721 --> 01:37:50.400
<v Speaker 2>then these next fight he's not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get here,</v>

2120
01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:53.370
<v Speaker 2>is not to get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>

2121
01:37:53.371 --> 01:37:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Was he his head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a pull thing.</v>

2122
01:37:56.490 --> 01:37:57.870
<v Speaker 2>He's got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a mind coach,</v>

2123
01:37:58.230 --> 01:38:00.300
<v Speaker 2>he's got a mind coach and when he lost</v>
<v Speaker 2>the salito,</v>

2124
01:38:00.710 --> 01:38:03.900
<v Speaker 2>nobody got like where the weight was</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong and he got punched in the balls</v>

2125
01:38:03.901 --> 01:38:06.770
<v Speaker 2>and all that sort of stuff in salita</v>
<v Speaker 2>just out of our program.</v>

2126
01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Rarely I guess he's too heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2127
01:38:08.791 --> 01:38:10.990
<v Speaker 2>this and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't dwell on that.</v>

2128
01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:13.140
<v Speaker 2>He went back straight away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beat Gary Russell.</v>

2129
01:38:13.141 --> 01:38:15.690
<v Speaker 2>He's a great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so under each because he didn't</v>

2130
01:38:15.691 --> 01:38:17.340
<v Speaker 2>dwell on it because he had a mind coach</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

2131
01:38:17.341 --> 01:38:19.520
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>control your emotions mean brian tolbert</v>

2132
01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:20.580
<v Speaker 2>of consuMer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about.</v>

2133
01:38:20.581 --> 01:38:23.820
<v Speaker 2>I read about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was saying that his Mind coAch got</v>

2134
01:38:23.821 --> 01:38:26.820
<v Speaker 2>him to not focus just to control his</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions and that's what it's about is</v>

2135
01:38:26.821 --> 01:38:28.620
<v Speaker 2>controlling your emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>controlling your,</v>

2136
01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:31.800
<v Speaker 2>controlling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you are your emotions after all</v>

2137
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:37.110
<v Speaker 2>and just getting free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What other People wouldn't and he isn't.</v>

2138
01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:39.230
<v Speaker 2>He fighting salito in a rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that?</v>

2139
01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I think it's muted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>

2140
01:38:42.301 --> 01:38:44.760
<v Speaker 2>I've heard also that you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>move up to lightweight and fight.</v>

2141
01:38:44.761 --> 01:38:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Manchester's a sonny terry flanagan for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Wbl title,</v>

2142
01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:50.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next year.</v>

2143
01:38:50.710 --> 01:38:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's amazing.</v>

2144
01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.870
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anyone do what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting out,</v>

2145
01:38:54.890 --> 01:38:56.910
<v Speaker 2>which was very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roy jones was very good,</v>

2146
01:38:56.911 --> 01:39:00.360
<v Speaker 2>but he just seems to glide around people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just,</v>

2147
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:02.780
<v Speaker 2>it just seems to know what you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do before you do it.</v>

2148
01:39:02.781 --> 01:39:03.840
<v Speaker 2>He's exceptional.</v>

2149
01:39:03.930 --> 01:39:07.020
<v Speaker 1>What's exceptional about him is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not outside.</v>

2150
01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:09.250
<v Speaker 1>He's inside and he's not getting hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2151
01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:13.470
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the most impressive things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about him is that he stays in the pocket</v>

2152
01:39:14.230 --> 01:39:19.230
<v Speaker 1>in any somehow is so slick and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so well schooled by his father as well.</v>

2153
01:39:20.851 --> 01:39:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2154
01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were disappointed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

2156
01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:27.480
<v Speaker 1>I think the opponent had a lot to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

2157
01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>goes to hit him.</v>

2164
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:48.480
<v Speaker 1>So he's insane how good he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so aware though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Mind coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them maybe even the russians</v>

2175
01:40:17.161 --> 01:40:19.350
<v Speaker 1>used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were the first people to start using,</v>

2176
01:40:19.730 --> 01:40:21.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental couches and stuff.</v>

2177
01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:24.890
<v Speaker 1>This footwork is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2178
01:40:24.891 --> 01:40:29.700
<v Speaker 1>like what's insane about it is he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in front of the guy and yet he's</v>

2179
01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:34.050
<v Speaker 1>so elusive with his footwork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who that step to the right upper cut</v>

2180
01:40:34.051 --> 01:40:35.640
<v Speaker 1>step to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upper cut.</v>

2181
01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Just god damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's good.</v>

2182
01:40:37.710 --> 01:40:40.510
<v Speaker 1>And he pulls the hands as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pose the hands down and frozen.</v>

2183
01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2184
01:40:41.730 --> 01:40:42.720
<v Speaker 1>He's really good at that.</v>

2185
01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:44.580
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a freak.</v>

2186
01:40:44.670 --> 01:40:48.750
<v Speaker 1>He's a real freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these russians,</v>

2187
01:40:49.170 --> 01:40:50.520
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way they school.</v>

2188
01:40:50.530 --> 01:40:51.510
<v Speaker 1>They're amateurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2189
01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:53.470
<v Speaker 1>they give them a lot of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2190
01:40:53.471 --> 01:40:56.590
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And launch uncle also was doing</v>

2191
01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:00.020
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics and ballet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ballet,</v>

2192
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:01.840
<v Speaker 1>ballet is coming up again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2193
01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:03.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tumeric,</v>

2194
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:06.200
<v Speaker 1>tumeric and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2195
01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I would think that that would help</v>
<v Speaker 1>because just the ability to control your</v>

2196
01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:12.160
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gymnastics in particular is fantastic</v>

2197
01:41:12.161 --> 01:41:13.420
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to,</v>

2198
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:18.430
<v Speaker 1>like hixon gracie famously was into yoga</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was into this very specific type</v>

2199
01:41:21.251 --> 01:41:25.180
<v Speaker 1>of yoga that's very gymnastics oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gymnastic on natural.</v>

2200
01:41:25.690 --> 01:41:26.231
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2201
01:41:26.231 --> 01:41:28.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of flexibility and</v>
<v Speaker 1>movemenT.</v>

2202
01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:31.300
<v Speaker 1>It's more of like a flowing type of yoga</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2203
01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:36.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's just the movements and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>flowing type movements are one of the</v>

2204
01:41:37.001 --> 01:41:42.001
<v Speaker 1>reasons why he was so good at jujitsu is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because his ability to control his body</v>

2205
01:41:42.911 --> 01:41:47.800
<v Speaker 1>was truly exceptional and he had very</v>
<v Speaker 1>unusual ability to control his body</v>

2206
01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.790
<v Speaker 1>awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2207
01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:54.970
<v Speaker 1>It's also strength in weird motions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoga is a big part of that too.</v>

2208
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.100
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was also a yogi and let,</v>

2209
01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:00.510
<v Speaker 1>not just gymnastic and natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like regular yoga he could do just</v>

2210
01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:03.280
<v Speaker 1>to had incredible flexibility standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a balance beam,</v>

2211
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:05.920
<v Speaker 1>standing in a full split,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding his foot above his head,</v>

2212
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:08.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's 200 pounds and he's fighting</v>

2213

2216
01:42:19.871 --> 01:42:22.870
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's not the most,</v>

2236
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:17.780
<v Speaker 1>the most sparkling personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

2240
01:43:24.881 --> 01:43:28.960
<v Speaker 1>that he's so boyish and cute looking,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Big drama show.</v>

2245
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:40.310
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a very,</v>

2246
01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.480
<v Speaker 1>very special.</v>

<v Speaker 1>becomes so,</v>

2250
01:43:46.421 --> 01:43:48.790
<v Speaker 1>so intriguing because if he fights the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2251
01:43:48.791 --> 01:43:51.010
<v Speaker 1>if andre ward fights away,</v>

<v Speaker 1>last fight against chill amber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't look all that.</v>

01:43:56.871 --> 01:43:58.150
<v Speaker 1>But she'll amber again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2255
01:43:58.230 --> 01:44:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it was fighting in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of pressure on him as</v>

2256
01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2263
01:44:17.241 --> 01:44:21.440
<v Speaker 1>round seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think world will fight on the inside.</v>

2264
01:44:21.710 --> 01:44:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you'll find on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

2265
01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll find similar to the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>for french.</v>

2266
01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:28.160

<v Speaker 1>Decent human being.</v>

2291
01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:27.260
<v Speaker 1>When he fought the last time when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>fought on a second.</v>

2292
01:45:27.261 --> 01:45:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I know his first name is [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second name was barrera.</v>

2293
01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:34.080
<v Speaker 1>He won't play where he caught it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He caught the jap chap coat the job for</v>

2294
01:45:34.081 --> 01:45:35.900
<v Speaker 1>a right anD left talk slips on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2295
01:45:35.901 --> 01:45:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just like,</v>

2296
01:45:37.710 --> 01:45:38.930
<v Speaker 1>he's dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's liking to.</v>

2297
01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Hearst is fabulous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawk,</v>

2298
01:45:40.930 --> 01:45:42.470
<v Speaker 1>alo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kakao indeed.</v>

2299
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Are there any other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2300
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:49.760
<v Speaker 1>methods of trying to expand your</v>
<v Speaker 1>peripheral?</v>

2301
01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically practice,</v>

2302
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:55.790
<v Speaker 1>just practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just something that you have to</v>

2303
01:45:55.791 --> 01:45:59.780
<v Speaker 1>be aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The closing of the peripheral is also a</v>

2304
01:45:59.781 --> 01:46:04.430
<v Speaker 1>tightening of you and not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say so.</v>

2305
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:09.710
<v Speaker 1>But you could still focus even with</v>
<v Speaker 1>expanded peripheral yet you could still</v>

2306
01:46:09.711 --> 01:46:13.880
<v Speaker 1>focus on the task at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do focus on the task at hand,</v>

2307
01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:18.110
<v Speaker 1>he still is still focusing on the task</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hand stride drive is the same,</v>

2308
01:46:18.111 --> 01:46:20.420
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if he was just driving and just</v>

2309
01:46:20.421 --> 01:46:22.120
<v Speaker 1>look forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2310
01:46:22.130 --> 01:46:24.290
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't see anything coming from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>junctIonal.</v>

2311
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.110
<v Speaker 1>You still look in the rear view mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you?</v>

2312
01:46:27.250 --> 01:46:29.030
<v Speaker 1>even though you're not really going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

2313
01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.790
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna get more often than</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

2314
01:46:31.791 --> 01:46:33.530
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to hit behind unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stopped,</v>

2315
01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:34.580
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>YeAh.</v>

2316
01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:37.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stereotype about asians being bad</v>

2317
01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:39.740
<v Speaker 1>drivers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine who's asian tried to</v>

2318
01:46:39.741 --> 01:46:44.480
<v Speaker 1>tell me the reason for that is their</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture when they're in asia,</v>

2319
01:46:44.481 --> 01:46:45.241
<v Speaker 1>especially in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2320
01:46:45.241 --> 01:46:46.250
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in China.</v>

2321
01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Nobody looks to the left and look to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2322
01:46:48.681 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like traditional to</v>

2323
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:53.130
<v Speaker 3>look straight ahead and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you mind your own business?</v>

2324
01:46:53.131 --> 01:46:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Don't be staring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't look off to the left.</v>

2325
01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:57.900
<v Speaker 3>And so and also they run Into each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2326
01:46:57.901 --> 01:46:59.700
<v Speaker 3>have you ever been on the streets of</v>
<v Speaker 3>China?</v>

2327
01:46:59.701 --> 01:47:01.680
<v Speaker 3>Apparently according to ari,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

2328
01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:04.560
<v Speaker 3>people just bumping into everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just bump into each other.</v>

2329
01:47:04.561 --> 01:47:06.630
<v Speaker 3>They're just so used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a rudeness thing.</v>

2330
01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:08.400
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's normal to them.</v>

2331
01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:11.190
<v Speaker 3>So when they get in their cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of do the same thing.</v>

2332
01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:13.110
<v Speaker 3>It looks straight ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't look to the left,</v>

2333
01:47:13.111 --> 01:47:14.610
<v Speaker 3>don't look to the right and just plow</v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead.</v>

2334
01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:16.380
<v Speaker 3>Was not good for driving.</v>

2335
01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:18.870
<v Speaker 2>I was hustling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Hong Kong and I was trying to</v>

2336
01:47:18.871 --> 01:47:21.180
<v Speaker 2>get a flight service with k one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a disaster,</v>

2337
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:25.320
<v Speaker 2>but I was trying to get the flight from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong to grandchild this place and</v>

2338
01:47:25.321 --> 01:47:28.800
<v Speaker 2>they almost took the they desk</v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining the answers,</v>

2339
01:47:28.801 --> 01:47:30.210
<v Speaker 2>get this flight quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was running through the,</v>

2340
01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:33.260
<v Speaker 2>I felt like it was intake and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>wondering about approach and the journey</v>

2341
01:47:33.261 --> 01:47:35.370
<v Speaker 2>is just people's barging in front of you</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2343
01:47:37.570 --> 01:47:40.740
<v Speaker 2>And then Jeremy Melendez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid who I know from a lives in Hong</v>

2344
01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:42.360

<v Speaker 2>You have a different sort of,</v>

<v Speaker 2>different sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2350

<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong was a british empire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2351
01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Well still 1999 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

2352

<v Speaker 2>english people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll say somethIng and you ask a</v>

<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing great,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I noticed you used to do that a lot.</v>

2361
01:48:13.081 --> 01:48:14.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still do in commentary,</v>

2362
01:48:14.581 --> 01:48:16.590
<v Speaker 2>you'll say something very complImentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you say,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2364
01:48:17.671 --> 01:48:20.100
<v Speaker 2>I see it isn't even that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's just get an agreement.</v>

2365
01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Unless it's we have julie kitchen over</v>
<v Speaker 2>compensate with a lot or garbage</v>

2366
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:27.260
<v Speaker 2>starrett who would take common site with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your cow that,</v>

2367
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:28.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am asking them for.</v>

2368
01:48:28.941 --> 01:48:30.750
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't need reassurance because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>insecure.</v>

2369
01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Insecure thing is a blanket that I need</v>
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>

2370
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:37.430
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going back to what we talked about,</v>

2371
01:48:37.431 --> 01:48:40.730
<v Speaker 3>like language defining things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're defining the fact that</v>

2372
01:48:40.731 --> 01:48:44.020
<v Speaker 3>even though you are observing things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>

2373
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:47.690
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're being conversational about it and</v>

2374
01:48:47.691 --> 01:48:49.110
<v Speaker 3>you're not being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2375
01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:53.600
<v Speaker 3>you're not like the authoritarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not like the authority of all</v>

2376
01:48:53.601 --> 01:48:56.120
<v Speaker 3>information is being passed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you saying you're looking for a</v>

2377
01:48:56.121 --> 01:48:56.780
<v Speaker 3>consensus?</v>

2378
01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:57.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

2379
01:48:57.890 --> 01:48:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Because when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you come and say it,</v>

2380
01:48:59.181 --> 01:49:00.750
<v Speaker 2>and I know in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2381
01:49:00.751 --> 01:49:03.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll come commentary is you've got to be</v>

2382
01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:05.360
<v Speaker 2>careful with your language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to,</v>

2383
01:49:05.361 --> 01:49:09.890
<v Speaker 2>you've got to engage that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engage the audience to drag them into</v>

2384
01:49:09.891 --> 01:49:12.530
<v Speaker 2>something just in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2385
01:49:12.770 --> 01:49:14.330
<v Speaker 2>you've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to it.</v>

2386
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:17.670
<v Speaker 2>While I'm bit more spectacular anyway</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm a bit high for,</v>

2387
01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:18.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm based off,</v>

2388
01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:19.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit squeaky,</v>

2389
01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:24.710
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like baker off of violet beaker</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the moffitt,</v>

2390
01:49:25.010 --> 01:49:25.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2391
01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:30.260
<v Speaker 2>you often drug the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience in and I think it's nice.</v>

2392
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:31.640
<v Speaker 2>Chavela is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Attack.</v>

2393
01:49:31.690 --> 01:49:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Chavela was gray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2394
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:35.060
<v Speaker 2>he's a fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2395
01:49:35.290 --> 01:49:38.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like a whole litany of phrases that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he loves to use.</v>

2396
01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Makes you jump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2397
01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:41.090
<v Speaker 2>So you see it makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you,</v>

2398
01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:44.450
<v Speaker 2>makes you jump as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he'll say stuff that's on his mind,</v>

2399
01:49:44.451 --> 01:49:46.830
<v Speaker 2>like swearing and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2400

<v Speaker 2>For to know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He does lion fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the premier organization in the</v>

2404
01:49:56.471 --> 01:49:59.440

2410
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:18.280
<v Speaker 1>more popular worldwide,</v>

2411
01:50:18.281 --> 01:50:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Thai is so much more exciting than</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>

2412
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:22.630
<v Speaker 1>There's so many more variables.</v>

2413
01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:27.130
<v Speaker 1>so many more ways to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so much more effective and it's</v>

2414
01:50:27.131 --> 01:50:31.400
<v Speaker 1>just brilliant to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you watch a guy like sam chai or</v>

<v Speaker 1>the excitement of more tie.</v>

2418
01:50:44.591 --> 01:50:46.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just so spectAcular.</v>

01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is,</v>

2474
01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:02.820
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that they chose those</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>

2475
01:53:02.821 --> 01:53:04.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big fan of that.</v>

2476
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:07.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of the organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like elbows.</v>

2477
01:53:07.950 --> 01:53:09.040
<v Speaker 1>I think elbows are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2478
01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:10.430
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can kick some in the head why?</v>

2479
01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Album,</v>

2480
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:14.270
<v Speaker 1>it's very effective when we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about moitai.</v>

2481
01:53:14.590 --> 01:53:15.421
<v Speaker 1>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

2482
01:53:15.421 --> 01:53:17.030
<v Speaker 1>why limit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2483
01:53:17.031 --> 01:53:19.970
<v Speaker 1>why allow like leg kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knees the head,</v>

2484
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:22.070
<v Speaker 1>head kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't allow elbows.</v>

2485
01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:25.790
<v Speaker 1>That seems to me to be a little weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that one thing that keeps keeps</v>

2486
01:53:25.791 --> 01:53:29.570
<v Speaker 1>more tie back is the traditional side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2487
01:53:29.630 --> 01:53:32.190
<v Speaker 1>which I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my crew,</v>

2488
01:53:32.290 --> 01:53:36.700
<v Speaker 1>my crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the can on the hand hold it back though</v>

2489
01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:38.700
<v Speaker 1>because people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my opinion.</v>

2490
01:53:38.701 --> 01:53:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I may be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

2491
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:41.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will sit there and they get the</v>

2492
01:53:41.691 --> 01:53:44.390
<v Speaker 1>bear or whatever and they come in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they watch the fights and then they just</v>

2493
01:53:44.391 --> 01:53:44.950
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well on.</v>

2494
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:47.660
<v Speaker 1>He said we are a funder of martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're not going to really see what</v>

2495
01:53:47.661 --> 01:53:49.190
<v Speaker 1>they see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can see it from a,</v>

2496
01:53:49.410 --> 01:53:49.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

2497
01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:52.010
<v Speaker 1>It's got a nice head for and what's up</v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

2498
01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Why they done seen was odd and also the</v>
<v Speaker 1>music while they're actually fighting is</v>

2499
01:53:56.991 --> 01:53:59.060
<v Speaker 1>a little odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you watched it you wouldn't hear</v>

2500
01:53:59.061 --> 01:53:59.330
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2501

2513
01:54:30.741 --> 01:54:35.240
<v Speaker 1>there's so few organizations that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing high level more tiny United</v>

01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:43.610
<v Speaker 1>there's some good fight as a gust on</v>
<v Speaker 1>bolinas.</v>

2518
01:54:43.670 --> 01:54:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Very gOod.</v>

01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's great.</v>

2520
01:54:45.411 --> 01:54:48.250
<v Speaker 1>He's only other fee for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's rock hard and he think he's six,</v>

2521
01:54:48.290 --> 01:54:51.290
<v Speaker 1>six and won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost one fight and it was a very</v>

2522
01:54:51.291 --> 01:54:54.380
<v Speaker 1>highly disputed decision law against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tie content,</v>

2523
01:54:55.300 --> 01:54:59.270
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult.</v>

2524
01:54:59.271 --> 01:55:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I've watched it once and it's close</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to watch it again to really</v>

2525
01:55:03.981 --> 01:55:05.870
<v Speaker 1>solve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze it by like his style.</v>

2526
01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comes for his fight and he's only had a</v>

2527
01:55:08.841 --> 01:55:10.480
<v Speaker 1>few fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You'll find in england and soon enough.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's still a little bit more tight.</v>

2536
01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:34.120
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to fight that style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will obviously is.</v>

2537
01:55:34.130 --> 01:55:37.010
<v Speaker 1>We have a good gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the transition not transition.</v>

2538
01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny that the two most people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it looks like the same thing.</v>

2539
01:55:40.250 --> 01:55:41.870
<v Speaker 1>They'll look at it like whAt's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference?</v>

2540
01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And you know the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clench is a big factor in the elbows</v>

2541
01:55:45.451 --> 01:55:46.980
<v Speaker 1>are a big fan of the stance as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2542
01:55:46.981 --> 01:55:48.240
<v Speaker 1>the pace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stands,</v>

2543
01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:52.650
<v Speaker 1>you know giorgio petrosyan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could find some way tie style,</v>

2544
01:55:53.020 --> 01:55:56.970
<v Speaker 1>but he can eat adopted the rules very</v>
<v Speaker 1>well because of his boxing skill.</v>

2545

<v Speaker 1>what does Georgia up to now he's</v>

<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

2547

<v Speaker 1>because he had that one devastating loss</v>
<v Speaker 1>to devastate you and diversity is</v>

2548
01:56:06.211 --> 01:56:08.220
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>production up close.</v>

2549
01:56:08.670 --> 01:56:13.110
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anybody like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just slips shots and just luns and when</v>

2550
01:56:13.111 --> 01:56:14.660
<v Speaker 1>he hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he lands with these countless,</v>

2551
01:56:14.670 --> 01:56:16.800
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not soft delight,</v>

2552
01:56:16.850 --> 01:56:19.230
<v Speaker 1>whack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're in a position where you</v>

2553
01:56:19.231 --> 01:56:20.580
<v Speaker 1>can't hit him and he can hit you.</v>

2554
01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:24.270
<v Speaker 1>He's just poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emotion is absolutely super interesting</v>

2555
01:56:24.271 --> 01:56:27.930
<v Speaker 1>too because it is not like some physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>specimen or anything like that.</v>

2556
01:56:27.931 --> 01:56:31.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just an average guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's a very intelligent approach to</v>

2557
01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:36.660
<v Speaker 1>finding how color</v>
<v Speaker 1>is eyesight.</v>

2558
01:56:36.710 --> 01:56:40.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean these nobody's high site is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's so focused on what he does</v>

2559
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:44.220
<v Speaker 1>and even what you're trained in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is specific is a south pole</v>

2560
01:56:44.221 --> 01:56:46.510
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you kind of limit the shots or</v>

2561
01:56:46.511 --> 01:56:49.740
<v Speaker 1>what you can at the south pole with you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know our sap or connect you with an</v>

2562
01:56:49.741 --> 01:56:51.390
<v Speaker 1>east.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just got that down to a fine art and</v>

2563
01:56:51.391 --> 01:56:54.660
<v Speaker 1>so's marciel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says they've got that to a fine art</v>

2564
01:56:54.661 --> 01:56:56.040
<v Speaker 1>that the account was at yoga and for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2565
01:56:56.041 --> 01:56:58.200
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've seen it lots and lots of times.</v>

2566
01:56:58.201 --> 01:57:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you haven't spotted lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>samples and spent time with them than it</v>

2567
01:57:02.371 --> 01:57:04.540
<v Speaker 1>is difficult for you to adjust to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2568
01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:08.230
<v Speaker 1>white cubans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have so many pass because of the</v>

2569
01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:09.900
<v Speaker 1>styles.</v>

2570
01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Difficult to contend with sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2571
01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:15.420
<v Speaker 1>It is funny that more people don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2572
01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:19.320
<v Speaker 1>They don't compete as a southpaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of teachers that are</v>

2573
01:57:19.321 --> 01:57:21.660
<v Speaker 1>starting to teach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like emmanuel steward was doing that</v>

2574
01:57:21.661 --> 01:57:26.220
<v Speaker 1>towards the end days was a teaching guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight with their strong hand forward.</v>

2575
01:57:26.221 --> 01:57:28.680
<v Speaker 1>So he's taking right handers and having</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight southpaws.</v>

2576
01:57:29.370 --> 01:57:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the cutouts are left handed or left</v>

2577
01:57:33.650 --> 01:57:36.780
<v Speaker 1>handed off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A duck's Delaware is lefthanded fight in</v>

2578
01:57:36.781 --> 01:57:39.120
<v Speaker 1>an orthodox stance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he'd have his left arm,</v>

2579
01:57:39.121 --> 01:57:41.340
<v Speaker 1>which is his dominant hand forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andre ward.</v>

2580
01:57:41.770 --> 01:57:44.790
<v Speaker 1>He's lefthanded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know whether</v>

2581
01:57:46.290 --> 01:57:47.880
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting though,</v>

2582
01:57:47.881 --> 01:57:49.740
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make that decision to use your</v>

2583
01:57:49.741 --> 01:57:53.100
<v Speaker 1>dominant hand as your front hand when</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else uses it as the power hand</v>

2584
01:57:53.101 --> 01:57:54.420
<v Speaker 1>the backhand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2585
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2586
01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:59.520
<v Speaker 1>it feels a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then again it would feel weird if</v>

2587
01:57:59.521 --> 01:58:00.150
<v Speaker 1>you don't do it.</v>

2588
01:58:00.150 --> 01:58:02.000
<v Speaker 1>This is like anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's everything feels weird.</v>

2589
01:58:02.010 --> 01:58:03.690
<v Speaker 1>ReMember the first time you tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw a left hook,</v>

2590
01:58:03.770 --> 01:58:04.510
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2591
01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm lefthanded anyway.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's always been so always been a right</v>

2594
01:58:11.001 --> 01:58:13.710
<v Speaker 1>hook first year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember first time throwing a</v>

2595
01:58:13.711 --> 01:58:16.080
<v Speaker 1>hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking like what a bizarre way to</v>

2596
01:58:16.081 --> 01:58:19.290
<v Speaker 1>generate power and now it's second</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

2597
01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Now it just feels like you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it.</v>

2598
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Your body just moves that way.</v>

2663
02:01:13.361 --> 02:01:16.870
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a lot of politics involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

2664
02:01:16.871 --> 02:01:19.570
<v Speaker 1>they're not getting the smokers have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a band,</v>

2665
02:01:19.870 --> 02:01:20.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2667
02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:22.373
<v Speaker 1>qualified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2668
02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:24.940
<v Speaker 1>we call them into clips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're banned everywhere.</v>

2669
02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:27.070
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think California,</v>

2670
02:01:27.071 --> 02:01:30.970
<v Speaker 1>which is unfortunate because our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get experience.</v>

2671
02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:32.470
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also,</v>

2672
02:01:32.471 --> 02:01:35.680
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all people were worried about was</v>

2673
02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:38.170
<v Speaker 1>some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people were being unethical and</v>

2674
02:01:38.171 --> 02:01:43.171
<v Speaker 1>they're smokers or they didn't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper medical staff on think someone</v>

2675
02:01:43.281 --> 02:01:47.840
<v Speaker 1>got hurt and an mma smoker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that they kind of polluted</v>

2676
02:01:47.841 --> 02:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>everything a bit loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get hurt in the gym,</v>

2677
02:01:50.630 --> 02:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>the gym in the washing machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'd love it to have a chance.</v>

2678
02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be bigger in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States and they need to</v>

2679
02:01:57.220 --> 02:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>compensate from england by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree,</v>

2680
02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:03.110
<v Speaker 1>I really do think that it should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger than the United States and I do</v>

2681
02:02:03.111 --> 02:02:05.900
<v Speaker 1>think that it's not something that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like cricket,</v>

2682
02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:09.470

<v Speaker 1>but it's something that's universally</v>

<v Speaker 1>exciting.</v>
