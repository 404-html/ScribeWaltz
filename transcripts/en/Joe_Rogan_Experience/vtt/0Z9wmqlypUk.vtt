<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:10.810
<v Speaker 1>we always have these things where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours.</v>

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>

7
00:00:13.101 --> 00:00:14.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.820
<v Speaker 1>at least you don't have a 30 or 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes show.</v>

9
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:19.340
<v Speaker 1>They have to put your commercials in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle and everything.</v>

10
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give a plug for legal zoom that </v>

11
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.610
<v Speaker 1>when I first came to California it took </v>
<v Speaker 1>me two days in a law library to get up </v>

12
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>to speed so I could write my will and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I was glad to see that there's still a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discount with Rogan cause that's my </v>

14
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>project this month is to Redo my will </v>
<v Speaker 1>and leave,</v>

15
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

16
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.690
<v Speaker 1>I've known about legal zoom for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and is a really good group.</v>

17
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that I think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet sort of made a lot easier </v>

18
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.860
<v Speaker 1>finding out what your rights are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding out how the law of lawyers </v>

19
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 1>mainly know how to use the library and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have their secretaries type of things,</v>

20
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:54.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they gotta go by so and so legal</v>

21
00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>zoom can take care of probably 95 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of all your stuff.</v>

22
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Did you go from being a lawyer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>running a computer company?</v>

23
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

24
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:05.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was practicing law in Houston and uh,</v>

25
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>we had primarily a business law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

26
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:10.670
<v Speaker 1>my partner and I owned a title insurance</v>
<v Speaker 1>company and we're doing,</v>

27
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.630
<v Speaker 1>it was in the heyday in Houston when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>savings and loan thing was going on,</v>

28
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.760
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.070
<v Speaker 1>one day our main client came in and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a big construction company and he </v>

30
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.970
<v Speaker 1>wanted to sue one of his subcontractors </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

31
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at all and I said,</v>

32
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy,</v>

33
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:30.191
<v Speaker 1>I know you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can file a lawsuit but you're not </v>

34
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:30.191
<v Speaker 1>going to win because he's in the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

35
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:30.191
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

36
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:31.490
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to hurt him.</v>

37
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me just a minute.</v>

38
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I walked around to the next office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my partner.</v>

39
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what my share of the south is</v>

40
00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:38.570
<v Speaker 1>worth.</v>

41
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going home.</v>

42
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.960
<v Speaker 1>And that was when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

43
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd been building up to that because </v>

44
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.131
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing stuff that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a lawyer to hurt people and do </v>

45
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:48.131
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

46
00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:49.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just walked away from it and uh,</v>

47
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.630
<v Speaker 1>had gotten locked involved in multilevel</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing.</v>

48
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

49
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.400
<v Speaker 1>what I found out is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you say,</v>

51
00:01:58.401 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a lawyer and I'm doing this,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And because you're a lawyer doing well,</v>

54
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.200
<v Speaker 1>if a lawyer is doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:08.870
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is it like a pyramid scheme?</v>

57
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Pyramid come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

58
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.980
<v Speaker 1>we're selling a do it yourself at home </v>
<v Speaker 1>facelifts.</v>

59
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.010
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was before anybody knew about aloe.</v>

60
00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Vera was one of the first aloe companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was really easy to sell.</v>

61
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:25.070
<v Speaker 1>We do a meeting and a bunch of people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be there and you'd paint half their face</v>

62
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:28.070
<v Speaker 1>with this stuff and leave it on for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes and take it off.</v>

63
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 1>And it looked like there to patient one </v>
<v Speaker 1>side's a little higher.</v>

64
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:36.071
<v Speaker 1>And yet sort of like putting a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that hemorrhoid medicine in your </v>

65
00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>face or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's hemorrhoid preparation?</v>

66
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Preparation H,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

67
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.630
<v Speaker 1>it happens when you put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just tightens you up.</v>

68
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.300
<v Speaker 1>It tightens your skin up for an hour or </v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

69
00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:46.960
<v Speaker 1>When you put aloe Vera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a whole bunch of it.</v>

70
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.970
<v Speaker 1>It actually did work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did tighten up your skin and get rid </v>

71
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.970
<v Speaker 1>of some wrinkles for the evening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It worked for the evening.</v>

73
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 1>For the evening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:54.800
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

75
00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we sold a whole variety of things.</v>

76
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Why don't like actors do that before </v>
<v Speaker 1>they make movies,</v>

77
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I think get this stuff and you can't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hold of era anymore.</v>

78
00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>You can get elevated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this was,</v>

79
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>this had some powders and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You use a chemical thing.</v>

80
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.280
<v Speaker 1>What happened to the surface now people </v>
<v Speaker 1>say no,</v>

81
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.560
<v Speaker 1>the company went out of business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

82
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

83
00:03:11.121 --> 00:03:12.750
<v Speaker 1>there's all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot about these multilevel </v>

85
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.760
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

86
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>they all spring from a vitamin company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a neutral light,</v>

87
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the,</v>

88
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:27.031
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>device and Van Andel it started a amway </v>

89
00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:27.031
<v Speaker 1>came true light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I think amway finally bought them or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

91
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.220
<v Speaker 1>But what's that big one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one with the leaves that.</v>

92
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a uh,</v>

93
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>I'll think of it in huge company.</v>

94
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

95
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>herbalife,</v>

96
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>herbalife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

97
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>one of the first vice president came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this company.</v>

98
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:49.771
<v Speaker 1>I was in a ideal incorporated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a dare to be great and </v>

99
00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 1>cause caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

100
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>one that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 1>the California governor campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>

102
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to know a whole lot about this </v>

103
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 1>and they all sprung from the same core </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people at one time.</v>

104
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:05.071
<v Speaker 1>They all knew each other and I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in that for awhile and we were </v>

105
00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:08.280
<v Speaker 1>selling all kinds of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then my partner and I started a </v>

106
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>jewelry company and we kind of fell out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was into computers.</v>

107
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 1>So I started a computer company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a pyramid company and uh,</v>

108
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

109
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.250
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

110
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:16.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I finally lost the faith because for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile I really believed that you could </v>

112
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>do these things.</v>

113
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a,</v>

114
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>a woman who was a German refugee that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wound up making $20,000</v>

115
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>a month and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those things did happen,</v>

116
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>but they were so rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

117
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

118
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I was able to see the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

119
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:40.801
<v Speaker 1>it happened after I started taking Mtma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I got out of the </v>

120
00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 1>motivational business and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the motivational business,</v>

121
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>that's a slippery business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating to me.</v>

122
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:51.001
<v Speaker 1>People that have never been successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>at business but give motivational </v>

123
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>seminars on how to be successful at </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

124
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>After my computer company crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I got into.</v>

125
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a fascinating thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

126
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>That people would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like,</v>

127
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:03.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's comedy classes that are </v>

128
00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:06.181
<v Speaker 1>taught by extremely unfunny people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe people that have never had a </v>

129
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:09.661
<v Speaker 1>career as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they decided to start teaching </v>

130
00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>comedy and then they started making more</v>
<v Speaker 1>money teaching comedy than they ever did</v>

131
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 1>doing comedy itself.</v>

132
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a lot of that.</v>

133
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Back in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy that was terrible </v>

134
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.840
<v Speaker 1>comedian who was teaching the local </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy class.</v>

135
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any.</v>

136
00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was going on here?</v>

137
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't get a real comedian to </v>
<v Speaker 1>teach a comedy class.</v>

138
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:29.341
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to have any part of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd be surprised how many </v>

139
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>motivational speakers are great </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression all the time.</v>

140
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:30.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd,</v>

141
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 1>we'd go back after the thing would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

142
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:33.860
<v Speaker 1>We'd get off stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh gee,</v>

143
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 1>my wife is leaving me and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these.</v>

144
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>We had more problems than our audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>combined probably.</v>

145
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>But you had some good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just had to figure it out.</v>

146
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

147
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>they were all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 1>from 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.020
<v Speaker 1>there's not much new in that field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

150
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Robbins is another one.</v>

151
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Robbins,</v>

152
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 1>he's a super successful at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what else has he done?</v>

153
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:57.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he like,</v>

154
00:05:57.471 --> 00:05:59.590
<v Speaker 1>had like a successful real business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

155
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.600
<v Speaker 1>when he first came in the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just started kicking myself because I </v>

156
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.600
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>

157
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I was doing that and I'm better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

158
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.360
<v Speaker 1>He's very handsome or beautiful teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

159
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 1>He's in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got.</v>

160
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 1>He has a lot more confident than I was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>booming voice.</v>

161
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Throws karate kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

162
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:21.041
<v Speaker 1>eventually you kind of push yourself to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he started doing all the </v>

163
00:06:21.041 --> 00:06:21.960
<v Speaker 1>firewalking and stuff like that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

164
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.180
<v Speaker 1>that's firewalk hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife did it and did not get burned </v>

165
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>the first time you could do it and knock</v>
<v Speaker 1>it burn to.</v>

166
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh well no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Walk Quick.</v>

167
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I could not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to walk on fire barefoot,</v>

168
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.150
<v Speaker 1>but if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be all right.</v>

169
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.520
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea is getting through </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

170
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 1>If I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'd get through all right because</v>

171
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do it unless I was sure I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get through.</v>

172
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

173
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.000
<v Speaker 1>you could think that you are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right and not be all right.</v>

174
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>But that's what happened the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

175
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.440
<v Speaker 1>How far did she walk longer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second time I think was probably the</v>

176
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real?</v>

177
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I didn't know her then.</v>

179
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I probably shouldn't be talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

180
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.720
<v Speaker 1>I get it symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

181
00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unless it's fuckery.</v>

182
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Like we all know fire burns are wise </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding out brand because I don't </v>

183
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.980
<v Speaker 1>believe it's going to burn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

184
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you might be playing games here.</v>

185
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 1>the three laws of taking psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

187
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars are real.</v>

188
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire burns,</v>

189
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.840
<v Speaker 1>and number three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity is still a law.</v>

190
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 1>If you lift as those three things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't go wrong.</v>

191
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.750
<v Speaker 1>That's like the bill Hicks joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever the bill Hicks choke on </v>

192
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:28.750
<v Speaker 1>acid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thought he could fly,</v>

193
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.080
<v Speaker 1>jumped off the building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

194
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 1>if he thought he could fly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did he take off from the ground?</v>

195
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear the last a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

196
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:38.270
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so logical.</v>

197
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 1>It is logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

198
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy was an asshole.</v>

199
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.400
<v Speaker 1>He was a Houston Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

200
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See I,</v>

201
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 1>I left Houston by then when I was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to law school in Houston.</v>

202
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only celebrity I saw that wasn't a </v>

203
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.800
<v Speaker 1>celebrity then was Glen Campbell was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was singing for tips in this bar.</v>

204
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:56.660
<v Speaker 1>I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

205
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to hang out and lightning hopkins</v>

206
00:07:58.941 --> 00:07:59.930
<v Speaker 1>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a black,</v>

207
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:03.650
<v Speaker 1>a blues guy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of us would go down to Houston.</v>

208
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

209
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 1>He was that down in the fifth ward </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

210
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to go into a little group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we went regularly enough that we got</v>

211
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:13.940
<v Speaker 1>known were the only white kids in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:15.370
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

213
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.280
<v Speaker 1>one and he'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>he'd wrapped with us and stuff and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

215
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:20.870
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can play the spoons.</v>

216
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give the boys some spoons,</v>

217
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:27.701
<v Speaker 1>get up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I started playing the spoons </v>

218
00:08:27.701 --> 00:08:27.701
<v Speaker 1>while he's playing guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:08:27.701 --> 00:08:30.290
<v Speaker 1>and he stops and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in law school right now?</v>

220
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.800
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

221
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to law school.</v>

222
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:35.240
<v Speaker 1>You'll never make it as a musician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What an asshole.</v>

223
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

224
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.910
<v Speaker 1>He did it in a funny way and I know he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

225
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 1>he was actually right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't keep a beat.</v>

226
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:45.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Houston had two of the greatest </v>

227
00:08:45.881 --> 00:08:46.750
<v Speaker 1>comedians of all time come out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam kinison and building it in.</v>

228
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

229
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.780
<v Speaker 1>They had that whole Houston annex down </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and then they had like a real </v>

230
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.230
<v Speaker 1>creative group of young up and coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians and they,</v>

231
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started this thing that</v>

232
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Houston comedy outlaws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was Hicks and Kennison and a </v>

233
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 2>bunch of other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating sort of a development.</v>

234
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:08.350
<v Speaker 2>I went to law school there in Houston </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I taught sailing at Houston Yacht </v>

235

237
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.840
<v Speaker 2>that's very aggressive in your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thoughtful style of,</v>

238
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.690
<v Speaker 2>of breaking things down in a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>logical way,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>amazing Kennis and stories.</v>

246
00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:38.541
<v Speaker 2>When he was on his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about doing coke with </v>

247
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:41.481
<v Speaker 2>Kennison and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he was hearing voices for like a </v>

248
00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:42.090
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did someone who was a young kid.</v>

249
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:43.440
<v Speaker 2>Then when you're with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

250
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>

251
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 2>He was hearing voices for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa man.</v>

252

<v Speaker 2>Holy break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your Brain Batman.</v>

253
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 2>I was lucky I never cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

254
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.540
<v Speaker 2>you've never tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

255
00:09:56.541 --> 00:09:57.240
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

256
00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.360
<v Speaker 2>the same woman that gave me Mtma for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first time.</v>

257
00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 2>I gave me my first line of coke and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

258
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.860
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is awful man.</v>

259
00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:06.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like being a dentist's office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>

260
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always like that and beginning,</v>

261
00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:09.390
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>

262
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 2>after you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

263
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:11.240
<v Speaker 2>12 times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll,</v>

264
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.270
<v Speaker 2>you'll get to like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

265
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went through that with Scotch and it's</v>

266
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 2>cheap and legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go through that again.</v>

267
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's weird things like caviar,</v>

268
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 2>it's an acquired taste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you acquire it?</v>

269
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Why would you acquire something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>costs $10,000</v>

270
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tastes like shit.</v>

271
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.810
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't like it to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why acquire it?</v>

272
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.940
<v Speaker 2>Why acquire that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems really silly.</v>

273
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never did the cocaine,</v>

274
00:10:35.191 --> 00:10:40.191
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a bunch of people near me that </v>

275
00:10:40.191 --> 00:10:41.010
<v Speaker 2>had problems with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always associate cocaine with a lot of</v>

276
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 2>negative things that I'd seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the biggest ones was,</v>

277
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:46.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was driving with some friends.</v>

278
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:52.070
<v Speaker 2>We were in revere Massachusetts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this two lane road that we're </v>

279
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.630
<v Speaker 2>leaving this area that was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this famous place.</v>

280
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 2>We'd go to Kelly's roast beef and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody would go there and get clams.</v>

281
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:00.600
<v Speaker 2>They had like fried clams there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a famous spot.</v>

282
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.120
<v Speaker 2>People travel from far and wide to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kelly's.</v>

283
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.290
<v Speaker 2>So we were driving back from that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people behind us,</v>

284
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.710
<v Speaker 2>people beside us in this car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing coke and there was a girl in</v>

285
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:14.520
<v Speaker 2>the backseat and they had the light that</v>
<v Speaker 2>dome light on and she was doing coke and</v>

286
00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:16.590
<v Speaker 2>she looks over and sees us looking in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and she goes like this,</v>

287
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.470
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

288
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.930
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they're driving by just looks at me </v>

289
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.440
<v Speaker 2>like anger and craziness and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 2>I view coke.</v>

290
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Have you is like that lady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

291
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing coke.</v>

292
00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:32.760
<v Speaker 2>You have the Dome light on and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at you and you're mad at me.</v>

293
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

294
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.390
<v Speaker 2>I've had a few friends that got into it </v>
<v Speaker 2>too far and it's.</v>

295
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.970
<v Speaker 2>It's devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

296
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:44.270
<v Speaker 2>So another thing that's another one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things that your body connects to </v>

297
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.320
<v Speaker 2>chemicals and become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a massive part of your life </v>

298
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.830
<v Speaker 2>or some really strange reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only done meth twice.</v>

299
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird thing to say.</v>

300
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.290
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

301
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.330
<v Speaker 1>the reason I would never do it again is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the one drug that could hit</v>

302
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 1>hook me is wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time I did,</v>

303
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:05.971
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a crewing for racing sailboats </v>

304
00:12:05.971 --> 00:12:09.541
<v Speaker 1>over New Orleans at Mardi gras regatta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a guy that owned the boat was from </v>

305
00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Houston and I was in law school there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wanted me to drive his boat back.</v>

306
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Trail is on a trailer that dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

307
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't go back.</v>

308
00:12:16.961 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sleepy,</v>

309
00:12:18.191 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 1>I haven't slept in two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

310
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:20.410
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take this.</v>

311
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.370
<v Speaker 1>He gave me this and I drove straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>through from New Orleans to Houston.</v>

312
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.870
<v Speaker 1>I was wired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.110
<v Speaker 1>and it was about a year later I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

314
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I want one more of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he gave it to me and I thought,</v>

315
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could get really hooked on this stuff,</v>

316
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:36.940
<v Speaker 1>but I never drive her mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What truck?</v>

317
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Driver math?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

318
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the real math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

319
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never came near it again after </v>

320
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:44.220
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had some people got in real trouble</v>

321
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 1>with that to some friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the comedown light?</v>

322
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crash.</v>

323
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a total crash.</v>

324
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I finally came down,</v>

325
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to class for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

326
00:12:54.071 --> 00:12:54.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

327
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.560
<v Speaker 2>when you were taking pure Mtma you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>no crash at all?</v>

328
00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I didn't not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

329
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.390
<v Speaker 1>because nobody knew that you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

330
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I think that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing is I was working at the </v>

331
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:06.630
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe I was just so busy.</v>

332
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

333
00:13:07.671 --> 00:13:09.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never had to come down crash.</v>

334
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:10.090
<v Speaker 1>When I was in Dallas,</v>

335
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.900
<v Speaker 2>I had a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll read it once.</v>

336
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:16.910
<v Speaker 2>The next day I had to perform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to do a standup set and I went to </v>

337
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.990
<v Speaker 2>a coffee shop in the morning and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading a magazine I couldn't read.</v>

338
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.370
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't read.</v>

339
00:13:20.371 --> 00:13:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't stay focused long enough to get</v>

340
00:13:23.641 --> 00:13:25.800
<v Speaker 2>through a sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get through a paragraph.</v>

341
00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:26.660
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

342
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:27.780
<v Speaker 2>I did have it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

343
00:13:27.781 --> 00:13:29.490
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am stupid as fuck.</v>

344
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.560
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with my brain?</v>

345
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about five htp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about supplementing </v>

346
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.771
<v Speaker 2>afterwards to try to re re re kickstart </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain's ability to produce </v>

347
00:13:39.771 --> 00:13:41.790
<v Speaker 2>serotonin and dopamine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

348
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:47.390
<v Speaker 2>it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't sit me while I enjoyed the </v>

349
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:47.390
<v Speaker 2>experience as far as like what I got out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

350
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.350
<v Speaker 2>But I also thought this would be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous because that reality of the </v>

351
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:56.450
<v Speaker 2>loving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>warm ecstasy feeling when you're locked </v>

352
00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:58.050
<v Speaker 2>into it is very appealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could want to do that a lot.</v>

353
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:03.380
<v Speaker 2>And then if you wanted to do that a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would experience that more or enjoy </v>

354
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.190
<v Speaker 2>it more than you would enjoy regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

355
00:14:05.191 --> 00:14:06.100
<v Speaker 2>And then it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

356
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.160
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of like a point of diminishing</v>
<v Speaker 2>returns,</v>

357
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.780
<v Speaker 1>build up a tolerance to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

358
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:15.781
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did more Mtma then is sensible and </v>

359
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.630
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't know what I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

360
00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.310
<v Speaker 1>that was the problem back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knew anything about it in Dallas,</v>

361
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:23.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we know it's safe,</v>

362
00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:25.720
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was just no literature.</v>

363
00:14:25.721 --> 00:14:27.670
<v Speaker 1>There was no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did it get started?</v>

364
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

365
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the story ever really </v>

366
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:34.820
<v Speaker 1>got out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy,</v>

367
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.140
<v Speaker 1>what he went by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name Thomas Crown,</v>

368
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:36.490
<v Speaker 1>he was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

369
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.640
<v Speaker 1>he was really the mainstay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although,</v>

370
00:14:38.641 --> 00:14:39.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

371
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.220
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

372
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I'll think of his name in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thought was the number one guy</v>

373
00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:49.321
<v Speaker 1>in Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a good friend of Tim leary </v>

374
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:49.321
<v Speaker 1>and he's out here in La and Tim leary </v>
<v Speaker 1>says here,</v>

375
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:50.860
<v Speaker 1>try this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when he found him.</v>

376
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is great.</v>

377
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

378
00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.590
<v Speaker 1>he lit up Dallas with this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

379
00:14:55.591 --> 00:14:56.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

380
00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

381
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I actually did a motivational speech and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mtma one time about two hours after I'd </v>

382
00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:07.001
<v Speaker 1>taken it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was still pretty much up there and </v>

383
00:15:07.001 --> 00:15:09.260
<v Speaker 1>they'd pay me to do a 30 minute keynote </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech at this big corporate thing.</v>

384
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I was an hour into it when they finally </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught me off the stage,</v>

385
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I had people on their feet is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best talks I ever gave.</v>

386
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Why they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cut you off,</v>

387
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:20.750
<v Speaker 1>but it was only supposed to talk 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and after an hour they said,</v>

388
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really enough.</v>

389
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's A.</v>

390
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was only one person in the room </v>
<v Speaker 1>that knew I was an Mtma.</v>

391
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.010
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the women there that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

392
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.690
<v Speaker 1>actually she was one of my distributors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what did she think?</v>

393
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:38.090
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't believe I was going to go </v>

394
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.090
<v Speaker 1>on first of all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

395
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.890
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of stupid stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

396
00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:44.891
<v Speaker 1>Well that sounds like nobody really knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell was going on with that </v>

397
00:15:44.891 --> 00:15:44.891
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chances.</v>

398
00:15:44.891 --> 00:15:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Human Guinea pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

399
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.690
<v Speaker 1>And in that little interview I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told about the time that uh,</v>

400
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.740
<v Speaker 1>well I took an way excessive dose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

401
00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 1>What's the way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excessive 1500 milligrams.</v>

402
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:56.850
<v Speaker 1>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's an average one?</v>

403
00:15:56.851 --> 00:15:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Hundred and 20 is what is that what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should take?</v>

404
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.820
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should 120.</v>

405
00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:06.821
<v Speaker 1>So you took 10 times and I still have </v>
<v Speaker 1>these two cassette to 90 minute cassette</v>

406
00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:09.830
<v Speaker 1>tapes that I filled up talking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole time.</v>

407
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.590
<v Speaker 1>I've never had the courage to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them again.</v>

408
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.860
<v Speaker 1>But from that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for another seven years,</v>

409
00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I'd tried Mtma about five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not long after nothing happened.</v>

410
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Five years after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happened.</v>

411
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.310
<v Speaker 1>About seven years after I finally got </v>
<v Speaker 1>MDM aid work again,</v>

412
00:16:25.311 --> 00:16:26.840
<v Speaker 1>only did it once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year after that.</v>

413
00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.820
<v Speaker 1>And I haven't done it now and I guess </v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

414
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:29.630
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years.</v>

415
00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:30.530
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

416
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.360
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really fried my brain.</v>

417
00:16:32.361 --> 00:16:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Oprah put this bad news information out </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the holes in the brain thing.</v>

419
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.940
<v Speaker 1>And the night before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple days for that show aired,</v>

420
00:16:40.941 --> 00:16:45.290
<v Speaker 1>her producer was informed by maps that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a totally bogus.</v>

421
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:46.640
<v Speaker 1>It was alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put out there,</v>

422
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:51.850
<v Speaker 1>there's no holes in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a blood flow Mri or something </v>

423
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:53.270
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

424
00:16:53.271 --> 00:16:58.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I would be a genius today if I </v>

425
00:16:58.271 --> 00:16:58.271
<v Speaker 1>hadn't done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

426
00:16:58.271 --> 00:17:01.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't really fry my brain now.</v>

427
00:17:01.161 --> 00:17:06.161
<v Speaker 1>It was so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a monster headache for three or </v>

428
00:17:06.161 --> 00:17:09.830
<v Speaker 1>four days and a did not work again for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

429
00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:12.620
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't kill me and it didn't,</v>

430
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't think put holes in my brain.</v>

431
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.090
<v Speaker 1>The holes in the brain things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what everybody said.</v>

432
00:17:17.091 --> 00:17:18.470
<v Speaker 1>That was one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Oprah,</v>

433
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Oprah did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

434
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:24.491
<v Speaker 1>she had this Mri at this woman and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman knew that it wasn't a hole in her </v>

435
00:17:24.491 --> 00:17:28.451
<v Speaker 1>brain maps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got ahold of it and they really </v>

436
00:17:28.451 --> 00:17:29.470
<v Speaker 1>gave her all the information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What this is,</v>

437
00:17:29.471 --> 00:17:31.850
<v Speaker 1>is about blood flow or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

438
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.910
<v Speaker 1>but it was not a hole in her brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Oprah's producer knew that going in </v>

439
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:41.261
<v Speaker 1>and she still let that hit the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like the Ben Gazi thing only </v>

440
00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:41.300
<v Speaker 1>didn't get busted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so silly.</v>

441
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

442
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:43.970
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

443
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.480
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

444
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I think they probably were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>save people.</v>

445
00:17:47.391 --> 00:17:52.391
<v Speaker 1>They're probably trying to like scare </v>
<v Speaker 1>people off doing and maybe in this day </v>

446
00:17:52.391 --> 00:17:53.740
<v Speaker 1>and age when you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's ultimately,</v>

447
00:17:53.741 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut with a bunch of other shit.</v>

448
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Now I went up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never take something that,</v>

449
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:03.290
<v Speaker 1>that I got at a rave or a party or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that that you just can't </v>

450
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:03.290
<v Speaker 1>trust this stuff.</v>

451
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:03.780
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

452
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't know who's making it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we at least had good sources,</v>

453
00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:08.940
<v Speaker 1>good supplies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We knew who the chemist was,</v>

454
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:10.710
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

455
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.240
<v Speaker 1>today it's really not safe unless you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chemist or friend of,</v>

456
00:18:14.241 --> 00:18:15.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>

457
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

458
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.340
<v Speaker 1>all could be fixed in a way you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to.</v>

459
00:18:20.341 --> 00:18:24.210
<v Speaker 1>You've got pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cannabis is really the miracle drug.</v>

460
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:24.640
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

461
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.140
<v Speaker 1>the plant does so much things for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hemp plant does that.</v>

462
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Cannabis is really a medicinal plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly is.</v>

463
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.810
<v Speaker 1>But for ptsd there's nothing like MDM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mdm a,</v>

464
00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:40.220
<v Speaker 1>but see that would be used with a doctor</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows his fly and stuff like that.</v>

465
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not saying there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with dancing.</v>

466
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I've danced all night on it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good,</v>

467
00:18:43.951 --> 00:18:44.850
<v Speaker 1>but there you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

468
00:18:44.851 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 1>that's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old were you when you were dancing?</v>

469
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.040
<v Speaker 1>All night on MDM and I was in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties.</v>

470
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.230
<v Speaker 1>You were just learning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

471
00:18:51.231 --> 00:18:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just catching up.</v>

472
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kids got ahead of me.</v>

473
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're ahead of us.</v>

474
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Data you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're ahead of me.</v>

475
00:18:56.641 --> 00:18:58.110
<v Speaker 1>The kids of today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they?</v>

476
00:18:58.111 --> 00:19:00.030
<v Speaker 1>They're starting from the jump of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

477
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.610
<v Speaker 1>They just need to be cautious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't have to be crazy about these.</v>

478
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just so unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we have so many dangerous drugs </v>

479
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 1>that are labeled their prescription </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>

480
00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:10.570
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

481
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.960
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their dosages clearly marked.</v>

482
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:18.260
<v Speaker 1>We know about them and yet there's these</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal ones that are just floating </v>

483
00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.980
<v Speaker 1>around out there and they're there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>commerce or in connection.</v>

484
00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:24.981
<v Speaker 1>There's money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Money's being exchanged back and forth </v>

485
00:19:24.981 --> 00:19:27.120
<v Speaker 1>for taking him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can ever regulate </v>

486
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:27.120
<v Speaker 1>that unless you make it illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

487
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.881
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is legal and then you get some kind </v>

488
00:19:31.881 --> 00:19:31.881
<v Speaker 1>of a structure to take care of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>

489
00:19:31.881 --> 00:19:33.380
<v Speaker 1>the argument is logo that's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>

490
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.690
<v Speaker 1>going to make meth illegal to like start</v>
<v Speaker 1>with cannabis.</v>

491
00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

492
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.240
<v Speaker 1>And see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that uh,</v>

493
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you down for legal truck or math?</v>

494
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Math was legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

495
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you could regulate it.</v>

496
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But still you regulate it and say,</v>

497
00:19:47.821 --> 00:19:48.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who needs it?</v>

498
00:19:48.871 --> 00:19:53.871
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But still people would use it like </v>

499
00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:53.880
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be way fucked up on it.</v>

500
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.650
<v Speaker 1>They will go to the truck stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

501
00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I really don't ever give much thought to</v>
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of things because,</v>

502
00:19:58.351 --> 00:20:03.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an activist and drug policy or </v>

503
00:20:03.351 --> 00:20:03.351
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

504
00:20:03.351 --> 00:20:03.351
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

505
00:20:03.351 --> 00:20:03.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms you can,</v>

506
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
<v Speaker 1>you can grow at home now there's a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>method to chrome and hydrogen peroxide </v>

507
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.000
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to worry about all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

508
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:14.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanitation stuff and grow mushrooms and </v>

509
00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:14.700
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen peroxide as a bunch of youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos about it.</v>

510
00:20:14.701 --> 00:20:19.701
<v Speaker 1>Been out about two years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty five hours every second goes up </v>

511
00:20:19.701 --> 00:20:21.020
<v Speaker 1>there or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least.</v>

512
00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

513
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just amazing.</v>

514
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to try.</v>

515
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Not that it's not dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

516
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:33.270
<v Speaker 1>when I first moved to Florida at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little after several years after I moved</v>

517
00:20:33.271 --> 00:20:34.920
<v Speaker 1>there and I lost all my connections and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

518
00:20:34.921 --> 00:20:39.921
<v Speaker 1>So the word on the street was that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutmeg was very similar to MDM and a,</v>

519
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:46.040
<v Speaker 1>and you could take some nutmeg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got one of those little mccormick </v>

520
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:50.601
<v Speaker 1>tins of nutmeg and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all and I took me and not the big </v>

521
00:20:50.601 --> 00:20:50.601
<v Speaker 1>tin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

522
00:20:50.601 --> 00:20:51.460
<v Speaker 1>that me and putting them in capsules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

523
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.130
<v Speaker 1>And I took the whole thing at one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

524
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I got real sweaty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a horrible headache.</v>

525
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.090
<v Speaker 1>And today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

526
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Christmas time I can't get near the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eggnog if it's got nutmeg on it because </v>

527
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll throw up to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>

528
00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:08.470
<v Speaker 1>nutmeg will make me sick.</v>

529
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.420
<v Speaker 1>But I have heard of people getting high </v>
<v Speaker 1>from nutmeg.</v>

530
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:11.890
<v Speaker 1>So what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard too.</v>

531
00:21:11.891 --> 00:21:12.480
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

532
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:18.090
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have to get the big tin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the little tune a big tin of nutmeg </v>

533
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.460
<v Speaker 1>and we'll just get you sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a big team will get you high.</v>

534
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

535
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.080
<v Speaker 1>I would not try it myself because a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little tin convinced me not to try it.</v>

536
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:31.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some guys in my message board </v>

537
00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:31.081
<v Speaker 1>that we're experimenting with getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>high on that.</v>

538
00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:31.330
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't believe it.</v>

539
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Is that on the airway they have trip </v>
<v Speaker 1>reports and getting high on nutmeg.</v>

540
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

541
00:21:36.401 --> 00:21:41.401
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know earth and fire are friends of </v>

542
00:21:41.401 --> 00:21:42.961
<v Speaker 1>mine and it's a release or erowid.org.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first place to go if you're </v>

543
00:21:42.961 --> 00:21:43.540
<v Speaker 1>going to do a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

544
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>widow and spend a lot more time there </v>

545
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:48.570
<v Speaker 1>than you spend doing the drug.</v>

546
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrowhead.</v>

547
00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Nutmeg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's.</v>

548
00:21:49.331 --> 00:21:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Find out if they have some horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about,</v>

549
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:53.420
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

550
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:54.840
<v Speaker 1>basketball sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

551
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.070
<v Speaker 1>When somebody asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's this like?</v>

552
00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Should I try this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

553
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:03.420
<v Speaker 1>go to arrowhead and read the bad trip </v>
<v Speaker 1>reports and if you can't handle a bad </v>

554
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.950
<v Speaker 1>trip then don't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't read the good trip reports.</v>

555
00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can handle a good trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

556
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.080
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there's a page on Arrow </v>

557
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.080
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about nutmeg.</v>

558
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:18.630
<v Speaker 1>If I love this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrowhead provides information about </v>

559
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.931
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive drugs to educate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reduce harms and to support and much </v>

560
00:22:21.931 --> 00:22:23.930
<v Speaker 1>needed policy change that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

561
00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:29.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of their big customers or not </v>

562
00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:29.180
<v Speaker 1>customers or readers or dea agent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>police agents,</v>

563
00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:34.380
<v Speaker 1>they have a whole separate section for </v>
<v Speaker 1>law enforcement and for parents and see </v>

564
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.251
<v Speaker 1>they started out as just a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>database for their friends and now it's </v>

565
00:22:38.251 --> 00:22:39.460
<v Speaker 1>one of the most visited websites on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the net.</v>

566
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did the ages go there for?</v>

567
00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Education is to find out more about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

568
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:48.830
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new drug will hit the streets and </v>

569
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.830
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the first places they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to find out what it's about.</v>

570
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:53.520
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's how they found out </v>

571
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:53.520
<v Speaker 1>about bath salts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

572
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd find out about it on the street,</v>

573
00:22:55.301 --> 00:22:57.480
<v Speaker 1>but to find out trip reports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you know?</v>

574
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.160
<v Speaker 1>How do we know what these kids are on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it doing to them?</v>

575
00:23:00.161 --> 00:23:05.161
<v Speaker 1>And what do we do to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take them to hospital or put them in </v>

576
00:23:05.161 --> 00:23:07.651
<v Speaker 1>jail and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna come a day when people </v>

577
00:23:07.651 --> 00:23:07.651
<v Speaker 1>look back at this day and age and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

578
00:23:07.651 --> 00:23:10.240
<v Speaker 1>they were so nutty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they just made it.</v>

579
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Well we're just going to add oxygen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in front of them,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you 38 years,</v>

582
00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.500
<v Speaker 1>30 years in jail for one ounce.</v>

583
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:22.770
<v Speaker 1>This however is exactly the same effects</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus this other weird thing that it </v>

584
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:27.721
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can just buy it as bad as </v>

585
00:23:27.721 --> 00:23:27.721
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

586
00:23:27.721 --> 00:23:31.201
<v Speaker 1>why didn't they fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they let that go on for years </v>

587
00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:31.201
<v Speaker 1>and years and years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

588
00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:31.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

589
00:23:31.211 --> 00:23:33.680
<v Speaker 1>People and poly drugging is a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with holly.</v>

590
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Dragging a bunch of things together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Candy flipping,</v>

591
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them are,</v>

592
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:43.210
<v Speaker 1>are safer than others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the poly drugging is going </v>

593
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.781
<v Speaker 1>on with the prescription drugs now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really fucking well prescription </v>

594
00:23:45.781 --> 00:23:47.470
<v Speaker 1>drugs just with the alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a scary one.</v>

595
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.500
<v Speaker 1>In the original hearing for cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're going to make it illegal in</v>

596
00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:56.501
<v Speaker 1>37,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only medical testimony was from the </v>

597
00:23:56.501 --> 00:24:00.311
<v Speaker 1>Ama and that was in favor of cannabis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they cut the guy off and throw them </v>

598
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:02.900
<v Speaker 1>out of the hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only medical,</v>

599
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.920
<v Speaker 1>a testimony in scheduling it or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxing it at the time was in favor.</v>

600
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in some weird time still.</v>

601
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.170
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that 1937 work,</v>

602
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1930,</v>

603

<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they made cannabis legal was a 37 to</v>

604
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.770
<v Speaker 1>this day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It still affected me a massive amount of</v>

605
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.360
<v Speaker 1>couple of generations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>get to tell their kids and they're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell their kids and everyone's going </v>

608
00:24:32.281 --> 00:24:34.441
<v Speaker 1>to be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now there's a huge movement in </v>

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

<v Speaker 1>of older people in nursing homes and all</v>

635
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.810
<v Speaker 1>And actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just don't pay attention to it.</v>

640
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the mechanism is about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ufo shows.</v>

641
00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had any experience that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

642
00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.230
<v Speaker 1>when you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

643
00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:05.290
<v Speaker 1>on any sort of a psychedelic that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt was like some sort of a paranormal </v>

644
00:26:05.781 --> 00:26:10.781
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Ufo experience or like being in </v>

645
00:26:10.781 --> 00:26:12.590
<v Speaker 1>contact with something or seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you,</v>

646
00:26:12.591 --> 00:26:17.591
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you experienced where it felt like it </v>

647
00:26:17.591 --> 00:26:17.591
<v Speaker 1>was a real thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

648
00:26:17.591 --> 00:26:18.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several times.</v>

649
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly on Iowasca.</v>

650
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:21.320
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

651
00:26:21.321 --> 00:26:26.321
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one time that you still is </v>

652
00:26:26.321 --> 00:26:26.870
<v Speaker 1>just crystal clear to me where there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

653
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.150
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting in darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

654
00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:34.151
<v Speaker 1>and it appeared like there was a black </v>
<v Speaker 1>curtain in front of me was just a really</v>

655
00:26:35.061 --> 00:26:39.770
<v Speaker 1>bright light coming out from the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>and from back behind me,</v>

656
00:26:39.771 --> 00:26:42.410
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this female kind of entity,</v>

657
00:26:42.411 --> 00:26:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just very dark and shadowy.</v>

658
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

659
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.430
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

660
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 1>this could be going on in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

661
00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I admit that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me it was real and this entity,</v>

662
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.740
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

663
00:26:55.741 --> 00:26:58.890
<v Speaker 1>that's what you are really made of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your core,</v>

664
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.920
<v Speaker 1>do you want to see it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she reaches down and start to pull </v>

665
00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.320
<v Speaker 1>this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it started getting so bright.</v>

666
00:27:04.321 --> 00:27:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

667
00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

668
00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.040
<v Speaker 1>I got scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

669
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.960
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of my friends said,</v>

670
00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you didn't let her pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>it up,</v>

671
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

672
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.230
<v Speaker 1>it was like a message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you are this bright,</v>

673
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:21.231
<v Speaker 1>shining spirit behind this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me that was a real entity and counter</v>

674
00:27:21.541 --> 00:27:23.470
<v Speaker 1>of some kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think that that was like an inter</v>

675
00:27:23.471 --> 00:27:26.670
<v Speaker 1>dimensional thing that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with or could have been or</v>

676
00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:28.460
<v Speaker 1>could have been a figment of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

677
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:28.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

678
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've not tried to distinguish between it</v>

679
00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:36.921
<v Speaker 1>because the emotional impact of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>went on and what I was thinking and </v>

680
00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:40.050
<v Speaker 1>saying and frayed to look at my own core</v>
<v Speaker 1>was kind of fascinating,</v>

681
00:27:40.051 --> 00:27:40.290
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

682
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also what is the source of the </v>

683
00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.321
<v Speaker 2>imagination and why is the imagination </v>
<v Speaker 2>so obviously affected by different </v>

684
00:27:48.321 --> 00:27:49.980
<v Speaker 2>chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And where's the imagination come from?</v>

685
00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Exactly what the imagination is clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>affected by cannabis,</v>

686
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.450
<v Speaker 2>clearly also affected by caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly also affected by alcohol,</v>

687
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:00.450
<v Speaker 2>definitely affected by Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely affected by many,</v>

688
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:01.560
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many other things.</v>

689
00:28:01.561 --> 00:28:06.561
<v Speaker 2>Airplane Glue will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have ideas that are different than </v>

690
00:28:06.561 --> 00:28:07.260
<v Speaker 2>the ideas that you have if you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>baseline sober consciousness,</v>

691
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:12.470
<v Speaker 2>and the real question then becomes what </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly is imagination?</v>

692
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Is Imagination just a series of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemicals interacting with neurons,</v>

693
00:28:16.681 --> 00:28:19.650
<v Speaker 2>interacting with thoughts and ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned experiences.</v>

694
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Because out of the imagination comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that everyone ever used on </v>

695
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:27.780
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that wasn't here already,</v>

696
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Speaker 2>anything we made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a phone or a television set</v>

697
00:28:30.811 --> 00:28:34.350
<v Speaker 2>or a curtain that all came out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>

698
00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.600
<v Speaker 2>So the imagination isn't just something </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you think things up and they.</v>

699
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

700
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.450
<v Speaker 2>maybe I just imagined it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happens without imagination.</v>

701
00:28:42.451 --> 00:28:47.451
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The imagination is the source of every </v>

702
00:28:47.451 --> 00:28:50.001
<v Speaker 2>single creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing when you look at it </v>

703
00:28:50.001 --> 00:28:52.851
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't look at it as something </v>

704
00:28:52.851 --> 00:28:52.851
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

705
00:28:52.851 --> 00:28:52.851
<v Speaker 2>you're just imagining things that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really there.</v>

706
00:28:52.851 --> 00:28:52.851
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

707
00:28:52.851 --> 00:28:57.830
<v Speaker 2>you're also imagining the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're also imagining Internet </v>

708
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.830
<v Speaker 2>connections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're also imagining airplanes.</v>

709
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody had to imagine all of those,</v>

710
00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:00.930
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without that,</v>

711
00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:04.110
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without the human imagination,</v>

712
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.540
<v Speaker 2>the world would look radically </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

713
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:09.150
<v Speaker 2>It would be 100 percent natural and we'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>be animals.</v>

714
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:14.600
<v Speaker 2>The imagination is the one step that </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes us from animal into animal that </v>

715
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.330
<v Speaker 2>changes its environment radically and </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts to transcend itself,</v>

716
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.870
<v Speaker 2>starts to symbiotically attach itself to</v>
<v Speaker 2>its own creations,</v>

717
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.810
<v Speaker 2>which coincidentally came out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>

718
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:29.930
<v Speaker 2>The imagination created technology that </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the glasses you're wearing or the </v>

719
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:34.311
<v Speaker 2>watch I'm wearing or any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of the things we're talking through </v>

720
00:29:34.311 --> 00:29:37.071
<v Speaker 2>these microphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of that is technology created </v>

721
00:29:37.071 --> 00:29:37.071
<v Speaker 2>through the imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

722
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Shoes or tech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

723
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.770
<v Speaker 2>so when you see something and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

724
00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was my imagination.</v>

725
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

726
00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't really care whether it's my </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination or some other </v>

727
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.640
<v Speaker 1>multidimensional entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I focus on,</v>

728
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.010
<v Speaker 1>what am I learning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I feeling?</v>

729
00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:59.011
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's my emotional state and then what </v>

730
00:29:59.011 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 1>am I going to take away from this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to learn?</v>

731
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.210
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

732
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.140
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

733
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:06.180
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put out Mckenna says something to the </v>

734
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.990
<v Speaker 1>effect of what makes us think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the entire cosmos can be understood</v>

735
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 1>using the neural network of a primate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

736
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:14.130
<v Speaker 1>we're here to observe and appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like that,</v>

737
00:30:14.131 --> 00:30:17.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than try to figure out black or a</v>

738
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.270
<v Speaker 1>dark matter and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

739
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:24.271
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad people are working on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not gonna worry about it too </v>

740
00:30:24.271 --> 00:30:24.271
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

741
00:30:24.271 --> 00:30:24.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm going gonna appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

742
00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:24.990
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

743
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the wonder of the world.</v>

744
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Just look at nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing.</v>

745
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Mengele known just looked at all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different varieties of insects.</v>

746
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.280
<v Speaker 1>They're just freaky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

747
00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:41.610
<v Speaker 1>alien creatures that we just take for </v>
<v Speaker 1>granted because they've always been </v>

748
00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:41.610
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

749
00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 1>spiders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't live without spiders,</v>

750
00:30:43.991 --> 00:30:45.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or bees or bees.</v>

751
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's getting to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly is.</v>

752
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.690
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of theories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

753
00:30:49.691 --> 00:30:53.260
<v Speaker 1>But one of the more fascinating ones to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me is that they are absolutely convinced</v>

754
00:30:53.261 --> 00:30:55.270
<v Speaker 1>that whether or not they can survive it </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>

755
00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.570
<v Speaker 1>cell phone signals are damaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>B's got to be.</v>

756
00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:03.620
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking with the way they end </v>

757
00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:03.620
<v Speaker 1>people powered lines and cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>towers.</v>

758
00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:03.790
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to live near any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

759
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that a high power lines has</v>

760
00:31:07.661 --> 00:31:12.661
<v Speaker 1>there been a direct correlation ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>established between them and sicknesses </v>

761
00:31:12.661 --> 00:31:16.021
<v Speaker 1>between some high powered lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the real super high frequency power </v>

762
00:31:16.511 --> 00:31:17.060
<v Speaker 1>lines you had.</v>

763
00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.490
<v Speaker 1>There had been in effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

764
00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:23.560
<v Speaker 1>I know somebody who died of cancer quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>young who lived under those for a long </v>

765
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.880
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now that was anecdotal,</v>

766
00:31:24.881 --> 00:31:27.880
<v Speaker 1>but I think there has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been some studies now showing</v>

767
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 1>because people in certain neighborhoods </v>
<v Speaker 1>have sued and things like that.</v>

768
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I've been around him before where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel them.</v>

769
00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And can feel that weird fee here.</v>

770
00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.180
<v Speaker 1>You're sanding necks and you kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel a buzz around you.</v>

771
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:48.300
<v Speaker 1>We just realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is enough energy to kill everyone </v>

772
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.481
<v Speaker 1>you've ever met ever instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just shooting through these </v>

773
00:31:51.481 --> 00:31:51.550
<v Speaker 1>wire lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

774
00:31:51.551 --> 00:31:56.551
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what we're doing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves with all these electronic </v>

775
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:56.551
<v Speaker 1>signals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

776
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:57.820
<v Speaker 1>you can't get away from it when there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wifi everywhere now.</v>

777
00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:00.220
<v Speaker 1>There's no cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's TV,</v>

778
00:32:00.221 --> 00:32:05.221
<v Speaker 1>there's radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of the information that's just in </v>

779
00:32:05.221 --> 00:32:05.260
<v Speaker 1>this room that we can't see.</v>

780
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.570
<v Speaker 1>But with the right equipment we can tune</v>
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

781
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it's going to be really </v>

782
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:12.900
<v Speaker 1>weird when that equipment is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside your brain itself.</v>

783
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be very,</v>

784
00:32:13.301 --> 00:32:14.080
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

785
00:32:14.081 --> 00:32:16.200
<v Speaker 1>very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting there to us.</v>

786
00:32:16.201 --> 00:32:18.060
<v Speaker 1>So close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

787
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:21.100
<v Speaker 1>they gave the person that first ticket </v>
<v Speaker 1>for wearing google glass.</v>

788
00:32:21.101 --> 00:32:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that,</v>

789
00:32:22.691 --> 00:32:27.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that was a valid issue of a </v>

790
00:32:27.691 --> 00:32:30.481
<v Speaker 1>ticket to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people driving and looking </v>

791
00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:32.431
<v Speaker 1>at Google at the same time or I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like people talking on their cell phone </v>

792
00:32:32.431 --> 00:32:36.511
<v Speaker 1>unless they have hands free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My question is how can they prove that </v>

793
00:32:36.511 --> 00:32:39.001
<v Speaker 1>it's active?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you just have that thing on </v>

794
00:32:39.001 --> 00:32:39.001
<v Speaker 1>your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

795
00:32:39.001 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the beat that ticket.</v>

796
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

797
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it sends a message.</v>

798
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cops don't like technology.</v>

799
00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they liked the technology they have.</v>

800
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.930
<v Speaker 2>It's also the other messages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like writing tickets.</v>

801
00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to write as many as they can </v>

802
00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:58.070
<v Speaker 2>and they have to fill quotas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feeling quote as one of the most </v>

803
00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:02.051
<v Speaker 2>disgusting things anybody ever got away </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the idea that there has to be a </v>

804
00:33:02.051 --> 00:33:03.710
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of crimes that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>committed in a month.</v>

805
00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Like what if everybody agreed to only go</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speed limit for like a year.</v>

806
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.270
<v Speaker 2>What would happen with the police </v>
<v Speaker 2>officers just explode?</v>

807
00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would they do if we all agreed that</v>

808
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.550
<v Speaker 2>that would be an interesting project and</v>
<v Speaker 2>some small town.</v>

809
00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:21.551
<v Speaker 2>If you could get everybody to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then nobody has any money that's coming </v>

810
00:33:21.551 --> 00:33:21.551
<v Speaker 2>in from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From speeding tickets.</v>

811
00:33:21.551 --> 00:33:22.730
<v Speaker 2>What do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they rely on it,</v>

812
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they rely on it for a source of income.</v>

813
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.110
<v Speaker 2>It's those couple of little towns on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to burning man.</v>

814
00:33:27.111 --> 00:33:29.570
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's most of their income is insane.</v>

815
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

816
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.770
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing if you want to tickets </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone because you want to give them an</v>

817
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:35.960
<v Speaker 2>incentive to slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make people safer.</v>

818
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.350
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you start developing like</v>

819
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:44.590
<v Speaker 2>you have a standard amount of money you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to make every month from you just </v>

820
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:48.701
<v Speaker 2>saying that people never improve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just saying that people will </v>

821
00:33:48.701 --> 00:33:51.290
<v Speaker 2>never get better at following the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never get better at being safer and just</v>

822
00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:54.500
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you bank on that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a quota that's disgusting,</v>

823
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:59.640
<v Speaker 2>but they were known speed traps and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas you know that you wouldn't go </v>

824
00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.101
<v Speaker 2>through this town because it was 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour and 16 and get you a </v>

825
00:34:03.101 --> 00:34:03.101
<v Speaker 2>ticket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut's horrible.</v>

826
00:34:03.101 --> 00:34:04.610
<v Speaker 2>As Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Between Connecticut and Boston,</v>

827
00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.640
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of stretches where it's 55</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking miles an hour and 56 and there </v>

828
00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 2>is nothing there.</v>

829
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:14.090
<v Speaker 2>It's just straight line and you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>want a gun it,</v>

830
00:34:14.091 --> 00:34:19.091
<v Speaker 2>you want to get the New York between New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York and Boston's like three and a half </v>

831
00:34:19.091 --> 00:34:22.690
<v Speaker 2>hours at 55 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just going cheese a scrape right </v>

832
00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.720
<v Speaker 2>everywhere you looked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some asshole disguises a tree pointing a</v>

833
00:34:25.721 --> 00:34:30.721
<v Speaker 2>radar Acha so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now Jamie put up a picture just a </v>

834
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:32.830
<v Speaker 2>moment ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now in,</v>

835
00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Colorado,</v>

836
00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.870
<v Speaker 2>they're developing this new technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell if someone's smoking pot and not</v>

837
00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:43.871
<v Speaker 2>look at these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell if someone's smoking pot enough </v>

838
00:34:43.871 --> 00:34:46.520
<v Speaker 2>inside of a building for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the smell to leak outside.</v>

839
00:34:46.521 --> 00:34:51.521
<v Speaker 2>So they've developed this instrument </v>
<v Speaker 2>that measures the amount of cannabis </v>

840
00:34:51.521 --> 00:34:55.211
<v Speaker 2>smell in the air on the street and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to start to give people </v>

841
00:34:55.211 --> 00:34:55.211
<v Speaker 2>tickets for these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

842
00:34:55.211 --> 00:34:58.940
<v Speaker 2>that'll help vaporizer sales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this is in Colorado pot legal,</v>

843
00:34:58.941 --> 00:35:00.260
<v Speaker 2>this is so fucking stupid.</v>

844
00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Those are the 40 percent that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>vote for it.</v>

845
00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:07.420
<v Speaker 2>It may be that or it may just be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that people are just floating out </v>

846
00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 2>of control and just weeds blowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

847
00:35:08.571 --> 00:35:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

848
00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:14.210
<v Speaker 2>like tumbleweed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the smell of weed just wafting </v>

849
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:17.261
<v Speaker 2>through entire communities and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are catching contact ties and they've </v>

850
00:35:17.261 --> 00:35:17.261
<v Speaker 2>had enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're not used to be.</v>

851
00:35:17.261 --> 00:35:21.531
<v Speaker 2>You'd put your pot in coffee and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs couldn't smell it for now they've </v>

852
00:35:21.531 --> 00:35:23.360
<v Speaker 2>trained the dogs to look for the coffee </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

853
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:26.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a friend of mine told me that,</v>

854
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:31.510
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's been doing is buying a bear </v>

855
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:34.391
<v Speaker 2>pis and wolf pis and sprinkling it </v>
<v Speaker 2>around his tire tires and in his trunk </v>

856
00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.850
<v Speaker 2>because he says when the drug dog smells</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and they go crazy,</v>

857
00:35:38.851 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 2>they forget about drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

858
00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:41.520
<v Speaker 2>And they want to go attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tackle bear,</v>

859
00:35:41.521 --> 00:35:43.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the cops do.</v>

860
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know at this.</v>

861
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Probably is made up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a great story.</v>

862
00:35:47.581 --> 00:35:49.950
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't think it would be made up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

863
00:35:49.951 --> 00:35:52.080
<v Speaker 2>dogs instinctively freak out and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>smell wolves.</v>

864
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so a pete's coffee.</v>

865
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to make sense.</v>

866
00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

867
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.800
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they can get in trouble for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like pasting wolf piss on your tires.</v>

868
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:05.460
<v Speaker 2>How do they prove that they have a wolf </v>
<v Speaker 2>piss knows.</v>

869
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Then they put it on and bring in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolf dog.</v>

870
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:14.240
<v Speaker 2>They have a wolf piss detecting device </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like they have a cannabis smell </v>

871
00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:14.240
<v Speaker 2>detecting device,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some,</v>

872
00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:19.010
<v Speaker 2>some sense that a dog can't resist that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the one cent that supposedly </v>

873
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:22.731
<v Speaker 2>universally applies to all animals that </v>
<v Speaker 2>brings in here brings an lps and Moose </v>

874
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.020
<v Speaker 2>beavers piss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

875
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:26.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beaver smell or beaver,</v>

876
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 2>beaver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>estrogen,</v>

877
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.910
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beaver sent.</v>

878
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of young men to go after.</v>

879
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is interesting that term be </v>

880
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.950
<v Speaker 2>because they don't look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

881
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:37.730
<v Speaker 2>if you're a woman's vagina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like a beaver.</v>

882
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Take her to a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something wrong.</v>

883
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:42.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not supposed to look like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you call into the beaver,</v>

884
00:36:42.481 --> 00:36:45.720
<v Speaker 2>why are you calling it a beaver?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because somebody else did before because</v>

885
00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:50.730
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then the other idea is that it was </v>

886
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:50.730
<v Speaker 2>created back when they were really </v>
<v Speaker 2>hairy,</v>

887
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.850
<v Speaker 2>mean we don't know about the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>for porn before an Internet porn.</v>

888
00:36:53.851 --> 00:36:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

889
00:36:54.331 --> 00:36:56.910
<v Speaker 2>Porn in the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think porn got women to trim it down a</v>

890
00:36:56.911 --> 00:36:59.340
<v Speaker 2>little bit and the imminent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet came along and it was just,</v>

891
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:03.200
<v Speaker 2>it was just fire through bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the cube.</v>

892
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:09.360
<v Speaker 2>But apparently the scent from the glands</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Beavers is,</v>

893
00:37:09.361 --> 00:37:14.361
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best sexual attractant for other </v>

894
00:37:14.361 --> 00:37:14.550
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never go figure.</v>

895
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that's about.</v>

896
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:21.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who thought that the beavers were the </v>

897
00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.571
<v Speaker 2>studs of the animal world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly a weird fucking </v>

898
00:37:23.571 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning if you see one in real life.</v>

899
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

900
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:30.020
<v Speaker 2>and you see their crazy houses that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>built next to the lakes were these </v>

901
00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.970
<v Speaker 2>giants in little lake in a canoe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>paddle out there and there was a big </v>

902
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:33.660
<v Speaker 2>beaver dam there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could watch them.</v>

903
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:36.300
<v Speaker 2>Then they were busy as beavers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Busy as beavers.</v>

904
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.730
<v Speaker 2>Otters around there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people eat them,</v>

905
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.030
<v Speaker 2>delete them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they own tastes bad.</v>

906
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:47.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess when people are starving to </v>

907
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:47.840
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

908
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:48.360
<v Speaker 2>I watch a lot of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

909
00:37:48.361 --> 00:37:53.361
<v Speaker 2>Alaska shows where people live in Alaska</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eat whatever they can get ahold of </v>

910
00:37:53.361 --> 00:37:53.820
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people eat beaver up there.</v>

911
00:37:53.821 --> 00:37:56.940
<v Speaker 2>They eat beaver tails that cook the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beavertail.</v>

912
00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:58.950
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like it'd be pretty tough.</v>

913
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Cld eat a lot of seal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marinade it.</v>

914
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seal and beaver and you know,</v>

915
00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:09.570
<v Speaker 2>gotta what you got to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell you can get ahold of </v>

916
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:09.570
<v Speaker 2>up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

917
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:10.350
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd say,</v>

918
00:38:10.351 --> 00:38:11.570
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of interesting.</v>

919
00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:16.940
<v Speaker 2>It can't be picky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just need a source of calories and </v>

920
00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:16.940
<v Speaker 2>protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Protein.</v>

921
00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right there.</v>

922
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:18.660
<v Speaker 2>Take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

923
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:23.661
<v Speaker 2>and apparently seal oil is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important for them because it's very </v>

924
00:38:23.661 --> 00:38:25.680
<v Speaker 2>high in calories and the cold you deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with apparently that's one of the best.</v>

925
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:30.710
<v Speaker 2>The worst losses of caloric or of </v>
<v Speaker 2>calories is your body burning off </v>

926
00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:37.070
<v Speaker 2>calories to keep itself warm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the best they say to </v>

927
00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:40.951
<v Speaker 2>lose weight is to actually to walk </v>
<v Speaker 2>around with like less jacket or less </v>

928
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:46.020
<v Speaker 2>coats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you would feel comfortable with </v>

929
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:46.150
<v Speaker 2>because your body in order to keep warm </v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually burning off and on.</v>

930
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:51.270
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are you going to go hunting in </v>

931
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Alaska?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

932
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm going in Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

933
00:38:51.431 --> 00:38:53.260
<v Speaker 2>I said this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

934
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go in Alaska too though.</v>

935
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.110
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to after dear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

936
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy who's got a farm.</v>

937
00:39:00.701 --> 00:39:03.730
<v Speaker 2>It's overrun with deer and he brings in </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to hunt them,</v>

938
00:39:03.731 --> 00:39:06.280
<v Speaker 2>to manage them every year because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

939
00:39:06.281 --> 00:39:07.690
<v Speaker 2>the reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

940
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:12.750
<v Speaker 2>especially in Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are going to die by </v>

941
00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.061
<v Speaker 2>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are going to get hit by </v>

942
00:39:15.061 --> 00:39:16.591
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are going to freeze to </v>

943
00:39:16.591 --> 00:39:17.821
<v Speaker 2>death and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to keep the herd healthy </v>

944
00:39:17.821 --> 00:39:20.810
<v Speaker 2>managed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta you gotta finish and you've </v>

945
00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:23.020
<v Speaker 2>got to be the wolf and I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to try to live this entire year.</v>

946
00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:28.050
<v Speaker 2>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to pick a time like after the </v>

947
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 2>first of the year and tried to live the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire year on game meat.</v>

948
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible.</v>

949
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I think if you're going to be a meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>eater,</v>

950
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know the exact source of your meat.</v>

951
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:42.150
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most ethical and sort of sane way to do </v>

952
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:44.590
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The disconnect between us and our food,</v>

953
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.290
<v Speaker 2>whether they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love growing food in a garden and then</v>

954
00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:49.420
<v Speaker 2>cooking and eating the vegetables that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you grow.</v>

955
00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a beautiful thing.</v>

956
00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:56.041
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting connection that you </v>

957
00:39:56.041 --> 00:39:56.041
<v Speaker 2>have between where your food actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from.</v>

958
00:39:56.041 --> 00:40:00.391
<v Speaker 2>I have chickens now and I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get fresh eggs from the chickens and </v>

959
00:40:00.391 --> 00:40:01.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get closer and closer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>my food,</v>

960
00:40:01.211 --> 00:40:02.080
<v Speaker 2>if that makes any sense.</v>

961
00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we mainly organic or almost all organic,</v>

962
00:40:05.341 --> 00:40:10.341
<v Speaker 1>but mainly vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We eat chicken maybe twice a month and </v>

963
00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:10.570
<v Speaker 1>we have a friend that slaughters his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

964
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.220
<v Speaker 1>his pig once a year and we know how it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>grown and raised and everything.</v>

965
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.200
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly vegetarians,</v>

966
00:40:16.201 --> 00:40:17.580
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all our food,</v>

967
00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:20.850
<v Speaker 1>most of it comes within a 25 to 40 miles</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our house,</v>

968
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

969
00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:24.810
<v Speaker 1>We belong to a CSA community supported </v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture and,</v>

970
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.630
<v Speaker 1>and I do most of the cooking and so it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fun.</v>

971
00:40:27.631 --> 00:40:32.631
<v Speaker 1>You get this box each week and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to figure out what you're going to </v>

972
00:40:32.631 --> 00:40:32.631
<v Speaker 1>do with stuff and that's really cool.</v>

973
00:40:32.631 --> 00:40:33.860
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love that.</v>

974
00:40:33.861 --> 00:40:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I think I've talked to my friends about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that with everyone.</v>

975
00:40:36.321 --> 00:40:38.030
<v Speaker 2>So God damn busy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd never get anything done.</v>

976
00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:43.300
<v Speaker 2>But the idea of getting together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody buying in on a plot of land </v>

977
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:48.310
<v Speaker 2>and then hiring someone to run that plot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of land and produce food for this group </v>

978
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.450
<v Speaker 2>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say get 20 people together and say,</v>

979
00:40:50.451 --> 00:40:52.100
<v Speaker 2>well this is our grocery bill for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

980
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:56.150
<v Speaker 2>If we can manage a plot of land and buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>a plot of land together,</v>

981
00:40:56.151 --> 00:40:58.430
<v Speaker 2>everybody pay for one slash 20th of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>

982
00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:02.250
<v Speaker 2>and then hire someone to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and hire a few people.</v>

983
00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I'd be some CSA is up here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There must be,</v>

984
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:10.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's several of them in San Diego </v>

985
00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.890
<v Speaker 1>County and we belonged to to this one </v>
<v Speaker 1>for quite a few years now and they </v>

986
00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:15.551
<v Speaker 1>supply most of the local organic stores </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what we're getting are the </v>

987
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.430
<v Speaker 1>tomatoes that are other heirloom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not perfect.</v>

988
00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:21.860
<v Speaker 1>They're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting food from a farm.</v>

989
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Like it'd become a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everything's the same size and shape</v>

990
00:41:24.591 --> 00:41:25.590
<v Speaker 1>and all like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

991
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:29.900
<v Speaker 1>It's real food is picked that day or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the afternoon before and it's real</v>

992
00:41:29.901 --> 00:41:34.901
<v Speaker 1>good fresh food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that way we don't have to get our </v>

993
00:41:34.901 --> 00:41:34.901
<v Speaker 1>group together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're,</v>

994
00:41:34.901 --> 00:41:39.460
<v Speaker 1>we've gotten a bunch of people involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this and some people don't like </v>

995
00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.460
<v Speaker 1>pomegranates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>persimmons or whatever comes sometimes </v>

996
00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.470
<v Speaker 1>in the basket and so we swapped around </v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other and stuff and uh,</v>

997
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:47.050
<v Speaker 1>so we usually eat everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I get all the throwaways idea,</v>

998
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.350
<v Speaker 1>had a bit of doomsday to it.</v>

999
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.690
<v Speaker 1>My idea was like if the shit hits the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fan,</v>

1000
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.970
<v Speaker 1>you're in the survival stuff and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1001
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:57.971
<v Speaker 1>you read all that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I was younger I was into that </v>

1002
00:41:57.971 --> 00:41:57.971
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now that I,</v>

1003
00:41:57.971 --> 00:41:58.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad,</v>

1004
00:41:58.521 --> 00:42:03.521
<v Speaker 1>my brother and my mentor all died at 63,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm eight years past my expiration </v>

1005
00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:04.960
<v Speaker 1>dates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like it's all free time.</v>

1006
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat well,</v>

1007
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:09.140
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1008
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:10.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not stressed about that.</v>

1009
00:42:10.851 --> 00:42:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I see the Google kids are working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>longevity,</v>

1010
00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:14.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things now.</v>

1011
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:16.760
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just commented a friend yesterday,</v>

1012
00:42:16.761 --> 00:42:21.761
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever noticed that all of this at </v>

1013
00:42:21.761 --> 00:42:21.920
<v Speaker 1>longevity work is done by people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their thirties and forties,</v>

1014
00:42:21.921 --> 00:42:23.630
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm here seventies or eighties.</v>

1015
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:24.650
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1016
00:42:24.651 --> 00:42:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't really need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a lot of fun.</v>

1017
00:42:26.601 --> 00:42:28.880
<v Speaker 1>I want to have a little bit more fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1018
00:42:28.881 --> 00:42:30.600
<v Speaker 1>if you gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said here's a pill,</v>

1019
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:31.850
<v Speaker 1>give you another 100 years.</v>

1020
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to think long and hard about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1021
00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1022
00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you would worry about </v>

1023
00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:40.460
<v Speaker 1>deterioration or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not having fun.</v>

1024
00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1025
00:42:41.331 --> 00:42:46.331
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of pain and watching your </v>

1026
00:42:46.331 --> 00:42:46.331
<v Speaker 1>friends go through what they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go through.</v>

1027
00:42:46.331 --> 00:42:51.011
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's going to go through love </v>
<v Speaker 1>affairs that are broken and tragedies </v>

1028
00:42:51.011 --> 00:42:52.390
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to watch anymore that,</v>

1029
00:42:52.391 --> 00:42:52.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1030
00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.740
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love affairs.</v>

1031
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:57.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the big push over the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1032
00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.430
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of my grandkids now.</v>

1033
00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting their hearts broken and </v>

1034
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.150
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about the radio lab </v>

1035
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.161
<v Speaker 1>thing earlier about the guy who went </v>
<v Speaker 1>through this horrible circumcision </v>

1036
00:43:09.161 --> 00:43:11.270
<v Speaker 1>process of becoming a runner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't want a son to go through it.</v>

1037
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want your kids to grow through</v>

1038
00:43:14.121 --> 00:43:19.121
<v Speaker 1>heartbreak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My children who've already gone through </v>

1039
00:43:19.121 --> 00:43:22.060
<v Speaker 1>heartbreak now it's my grandkids and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>pour it and I told one of my </v>

1040
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:22.060
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren.</v>

1041
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1042
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.490
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not around when some young man </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks your heart,</v>

1043
00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I will come back and haunt him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She remembers that the guys,</v>

1044
00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:36.940
<v Speaker 1>why is it his fault?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to be around her </v>

1045
00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:36.940
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1046
00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:36.940
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1047
00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have four,</v>

1048
00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:37.910
<v Speaker 1>five grandchildren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four girls.</v>

1049
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.700
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have a little problem with women,</v>

1050
00:43:40.701 --> 00:43:43.530
<v Speaker 1>but I have a new sensitivity to women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1051
00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I have a very good sensitivity to women </v>
<v Speaker 1>too and I have three daughters,</v>

1052
00:43:46.281 --> 00:43:51.281
<v Speaker 1>but my point is that a lot of heartbreak</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from the fact that people just </v>

1053
00:43:51.281 --> 00:43:52.760
<v Speaker 1>decide they don't want to be with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore and it doesn't work out right.</v>

1054
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.620
<v Speaker 1>And people think that when someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves them,</v>

1055
00:43:54.621 --> 00:43:56.090
<v Speaker 1>that they're taking something away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1056
00:43:56.091 --> 00:43:59.450
<v Speaker 1>they feel this deep sense of loss and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're connected to the idea.</v>

1057
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Part of growing as a person is realizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be okay and here's where</v>

1058
00:44:03.531 --> 00:44:06.230
<v Speaker 1>mtma would be really cool if it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal.</v>

1059
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Because when you and your partner gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>points say,</v>

1060
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:10.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's bad for one person,</v>

1061
00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:12.980
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be bad for both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're not talking about it,</v>

1062
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.560
<v Speaker 1>so if you sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got together one evening,</v>

1063
00:44:15.561 --> 00:44:18.440
<v Speaker 1>just the two of you did Mtma and talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>

1064
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Now I know from personal experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1065
00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:26.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my marriage with my previous marriage </v>

1066
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:28.841
<v Speaker 1>was really getting rocky when I found </v>
<v Speaker 1>the MTMA and we stayed together another </v>

1067
00:44:28.841 --> 00:44:29.440
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years.</v>

1068
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:30.650
<v Speaker 1>That good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:44:30.651 --> 00:44:31.720
<v Speaker 1>It really worked out good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it died after that.</v>

1071
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids were grown with.</v>

1072
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:37.750
<v Speaker 1>A lot of things happened after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1073
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:42.690
<v Speaker 1>But it did extend our marriage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>extended it and a really good way.</v>

1074
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

1075
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:48.320
<v Speaker 1>And we were married 21 years and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're good friends now who was a rocky </v>

1076
00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.851
<v Speaker 1>period for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've worked ourselves through that </v>

1077
00:44:52.851 --> 00:44:52.851
<v Speaker 1>to where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1078
00:44:52.851 --> 00:44:56.960
<v Speaker 1>we both respect each other and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized that it was not a one way </v>

1079
00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:56.960
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1080
00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:01.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that Mbma would be great for </v>

1081
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:01.590
<v Speaker 1>couples therapy of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1082
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.570
<v Speaker 1>when they hit that seven year mark or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

1083
00:45:03.571 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1084
00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1085
00:45:05.191 --> 00:45:10.191
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people hold in depressing relationships </v>

1086
00:45:10.191 --> 00:45:14.350
<v Speaker 2>and don't communicate about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then sometimes the psychedelic </v>

1087
00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:16.821
<v Speaker 2>journey together can open those ideas up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you start talking about things and </v>

1088
00:45:16.821 --> 00:45:19.671
<v Speaker 2>you find out that there's been a </v>
<v Speaker 2>misunderstanding all along or that it </v>

1089
00:45:19.671 --> 00:45:22.851
<v Speaker 2>could a bit of lack of communication </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could have worked things out </v>

1090
00:45:22.851 --> 00:45:25.341
<v Speaker 2>much better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much easier a long time ago or that </v>

1091
00:45:25.341 --> 00:45:25.580
<v Speaker 2>you're both feeling the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both want to move on,</v>

1092
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.400
<v Speaker 2>you just don't know how to do it.</v>

1093
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:31.520
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had one experience where I went on </v>

1094
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.931
<v Speaker 1>for months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something was building up and finally </v>

1095
00:45:34.931 --> 00:45:34.931
<v Speaker 1>got it out and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1096
00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:40.180
<v Speaker 1>that's no big deal and it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had been a big deal to me for a </v>

1097
00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.751
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out if I had just been </v>

1098
00:45:43.751 --> 00:45:45.491
<v Speaker 1>talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've had a month of bliss instead </v>

1099
00:45:45.491 --> 00:45:45.491
<v Speaker 1>of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1100
00:45:45.491 --> 00:45:49.241
<v Speaker 1>So communication is the key and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are some things that help you </v>

1101
00:45:49.241 --> 00:45:49.670
<v Speaker 1>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pot helps you communicate.</v>

1102
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that those things and </v>

1103
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:54.800
<v Speaker 2>those heartaches and those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of what makes you a person.</v>

1104
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.850
<v Speaker 2>It's information you have to get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

1105
00:45:56.851 --> 00:45:57.600
<v Speaker 2>It's feedback</v>

1106
00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:02.680
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to not have any of my </v>

1107
00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:02.680
<v Speaker 1>heartbreaks and stuff.</v>

1108
00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:06.760
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see it happen to </v>

1109
00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.551
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand and I agree to a certain </v>

1110
00:46:08.551 --> 00:46:11.671
<v Speaker 2>extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's very important that </v>

1111
00:46:11.671 --> 00:46:13.411
<v Speaker 2>everybody goes through a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it just to understand what it's </v>

1112
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:13.411
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have a choice.</v>

1113
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:17.460
<v Speaker 2>You're going to look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had friends that have gone through </v>

1114
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.350
<v Speaker 2>it where I know they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They became better people because of it.</v>

1115
00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A friend who went through a devastating </v>

1116
00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.520
<v Speaker 2>breakup and now he laughs about the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being stuck with that woman.</v>

1117
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:29.880
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back then he thought there was no way </v>

1118
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:29.880
<v Speaker 2>you could live without her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

1119
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:29.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

1120
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:29.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1121
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.950
<v Speaker 1>No matter what happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how big the tragedy is that after some </v>

1122
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:38.230
<v Speaker 1>time passes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually that becomes one of your </v>

1123
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.230
<v Speaker 1>funniest stories.</v>

1124
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I doubt it.</v>

1125
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1126
00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of these things that were did was </v>

1127
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.060
<v Speaker 2>eaten by a wolf on talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I'm thinking about,</v>

1128
00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.120
<v Speaker 2>fucking saw your family die in a plane </v>
<v Speaker 2>crash.</v>

1129
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:49.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of things happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking crazy.</v>

1130
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:51.970
<v Speaker 2>If you think about some things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

1131
00:46:51.971 --> 00:46:56.250
<v Speaker 2>seemed to be a tragedy at the time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>usually between people carve brands just</v>

1132
00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:59.620
<v Speaker 2>talking about like breakups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about like getting fired.</v>

1133
00:46:59.621 --> 00:47:01.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about things that are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>really devastated.</v>

1134
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:05.050
<v Speaker 2>Getting fired is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had that happen sometimes that that</v>

1135
00:47:05.051 --> 00:47:10.051
<v Speaker 2>can turn into a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be a changing experience and </v>

1136
00:47:10.051 --> 00:47:11.060
<v Speaker 2>change I think oftentimes opens up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>door for good.</v>

1137
00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:11.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1138
00:47:11.801 --> 00:47:15.070
<v Speaker 2>change opened up the door for good </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it gives you a new found focus.</v>

1139
00:47:15.071 --> 00:47:16.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you survive it,</v>

1140
00:47:16.061 --> 00:47:17.380
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1141
00:47:17.381 --> 00:47:22.381
<v Speaker 2>Every time I've like had something </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to me where I had to rethink </v>

1142
00:47:22.381 --> 00:47:22.510
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always been a good thing.</v>

1143
00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you get fired,</v>

1144
00:47:23.771 --> 00:47:24.970
<v Speaker 2>you all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing here?</v>

1145
00:47:24.971 --> 00:47:26.320
<v Speaker 2>And you all of a sudden you get this new</v>
<v Speaker 2>motor.</v>

1146
00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I realized subjectively this would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing for grandkids</v>

1147
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.020
<v Speaker 2>when it happens to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to go through.</v>

1148
00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.240
<v Speaker 2>That's part of being a GRANDPA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1149
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:39.480
<v Speaker 2>isn't that what they always say that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>strictest parents were always like the </v>

1150
00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:39.890
<v Speaker 2>most lenient grandparents?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't a strict parenthood.</v>

1151
00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Even more so than even more lenient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1152
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:48.750
<v Speaker 2>the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're an older person </v>

1153
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:51.601
<v Speaker 2>and you've experienced so much pain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardship and you see the innocence of </v>

1154
00:47:51.601 --> 00:47:53.770
<v Speaker 2>children whose how beautiful it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know any racism yet.</v>

1155
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:58.800
<v Speaker 2>They don't know any homophobia yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know any blind objective </v>

1156
00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.670
<v Speaker 2>hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know they.</v>

1157
00:47:59.671 --> 00:48:01.810
<v Speaker 2>They don't know the disillusion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

1158
00:48:01.811 --> 00:48:02.890
<v Speaker 2>They don't know all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1159
00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:08.070
<v Speaker 2>They don't know any of this yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know like they don't read </v>

1160
00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:12.090
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rebellion against taxing and it's </v>

1161
00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:12.370
<v Speaker 2>like all the different aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 2>society that,</v>

1162
00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:17.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring people to this hysterical freakout</v>

1163
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.930
<v Speaker 2>point where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking thing is I'm mad as hell.</v>

1164
00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:21.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to take it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1165
00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:24.040
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1166
00:48:24.041 --> 00:48:25.570
<v Speaker 2>They don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

1167
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you stepped on my toe,</v>

1168
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.750
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my toy,</v>

1169
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:30.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively speaking,</v>

1170
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:35.491
<v Speaker 2>these are big problems for them to all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the little kid problems that we just </v>

1171
00:48:35.491 --> 00:48:36.100
<v Speaker 2>have to learn how to work our way </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

1172
00:48:36.101 --> 00:48:40.840
<v Speaker 2>And my three year old has a way bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with my five year old taking one</v>

1173
00:48:40.841 --> 00:48:43.450
<v Speaker 2>of her toys than I have with anything in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1174
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:49.330
<v Speaker 2>My five-year-old takes her toy and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she screams tiers are flying out of her </v>

1175
00:48:50.561 --> 00:48:52.360
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That never happens to me.</v>

1176
00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:55.030
<v Speaker 2>So for her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a devastating apocalypse.</v>

1177
00:48:55.031 --> 00:48:57.060
<v Speaker 2>A huge groups of toys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1178
00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.500
<v Speaker 2>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's relative,</v>

1179
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:02.110
<v Speaker 2>relatively speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to address it that way.</v>

1180
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:07.440
<v Speaker 2>You have to sort of respect the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they actually are freaking out and </v>

1181
00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.910
<v Speaker 2>although it doesn't seem normal to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are grown adults.</v>

1182
00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for a three year old this you've to </v>

1183
00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:15.280
<v Speaker 2>that this is a real serious thing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1184
00:49:15.281 --> 00:49:20.281
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you got to treat them like </v>

1185
00:49:20.281 --> 00:49:20.281
<v Speaker 2>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents didn't shut up,</v>

1186
00:49:20.281 --> 00:49:20.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I grew up.</v>

1187
00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shut your mouth.</v>

1188
00:49:21.881 --> 00:49:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I'll break both your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the type of shit I heard.</v>

1189
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.450
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really lucky.</v>

1190
00:49:25.451 --> 00:49:27.700
<v Speaker 2>I grew up liking an ozzie and Harriet </v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

1191
00:49:27.701 --> 00:49:29.050
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was my problem.</v>

1192
00:49:29.051 --> 00:49:34.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I couldn't have asked for better </v>

1193
00:49:34.051 --> 00:49:34.370
<v Speaker 2>parents and we were looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turned out ecstasy dealer.</v>

1194
00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Dallas drug dealer sends him to college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He deals well hosting a drug podcast.</v>

1195
00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

1196
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:45.400
<v Speaker 2>What is this book that you wrote?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The spirit of the Internet.</v>

1197
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1198
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:46.470
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1199
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:51.480
<v Speaker 2>I wrote that in 2000 actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the first books that </v>

1200
00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.361
<v Speaker 2>compares the Internet to a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug speculations on the evolution of </v>

1201
00:49:54.361 --> 00:49:54.361
<v Speaker 2>growth.</v>

1202
00:49:54.361 --> 00:49:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Global consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1203
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at you.</v>

1204
00:49:56.471 --> 00:49:58.110
<v Speaker 2>You fresh faced little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1205
00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:01.540
<v Speaker 2>That's a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 2000 when you wrote this in 2000,</v>

1206
00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.680
<v Speaker 2>13 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1207
00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:07.660
<v Speaker 2>That was the last nonfiction I wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a fiction book up now.</v>

1208
00:50:07.661 --> 00:50:09.960
<v Speaker 2>That's a first of a quartet I'm writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1209
00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:15.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to fiction because it's so much </v>

1210
00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:15.440
<v Speaker 2>more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember sort of Graham Hancock?</v>

1211
00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember when people thought that</v>

1212
00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.900
<v Speaker 2>the world was gonna end in 2000?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1213
00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Y Two k,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that was a big deal,</v>

1214
00:50:22.511 --> 00:50:27.511
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See I got involved in y two K in about </v>

1215
00:50:27.511 --> 00:50:27.920
<v Speaker 2>1995 because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've</v>

1216
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:33.100
<v Speaker 1>set aside millions of dollars to fix all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those problems and most of the software </v>

1217
00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:37.931
<v Speaker 1>industry did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a huge thing and the </v>

1218
00:50:37.931 --> 00:50:41.471
<v Speaker 1>press only picked up on in the last nine</v>
<v Speaker 1>months or something and we'd already </v>

1219
00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:43.160
<v Speaker 1>spent millions of dollars and years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of work.</v>

1220
00:50:43.161 --> 00:50:47.060
<v Speaker 1>There's specialized companies working on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and so I really didn't think anything</v>

1221
00:50:47.061 --> 00:50:52.061
<v Speaker 1>bad was gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to be somewhere on an </v>

1222
00:50:52.061 --> 00:50:53.390
<v Speaker 1>airplane right then because there were a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few glitches.</v>

1223
00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

1224
00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:57.710
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think the airplane would crash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I could get stranded somewhere</v>

1225
00:50:57.711 --> 00:50:59.780
<v Speaker 1>and they couldn't get my reservations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>

1226
00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't worry about the plane itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a fear though.</v>

1227
00:51:02.391 --> 00:51:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Like air traffic controllers that their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their computer systems,</v>

1228
00:51:05.211 --> 00:51:07.400
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a potential for that,</v>

1229
00:51:07.401 --> 00:51:12.401
<v Speaker 1>but it was nothing like the press made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck did they do for air </v>

1230
00:51:12.401 --> 00:51:12.680
<v Speaker 1>traffic controllers before there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>

1231
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:18.370
<v Speaker 1>eyeball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess radio and I will look in the 19 </v>

1232
00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:18.370
<v Speaker 1>sixties.</v>

1233
00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:18.370
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did they describe by cow?</v>

1234
00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:20.810
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was like a coming in at </v>
<v Speaker 1>30,000</v>

1235
00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:23.540
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five degrees north.</v>

1236
00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I got to talk them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1237
00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:27.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm a commercial pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vital I've got.</v>

1238
00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Are you really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's restricted to hot air balloons,</v>

1239
00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:35.090
<v Speaker 1>commercial commercial pilot and it says </v>
<v Speaker 1>restricted to lighter than air aircraft.</v>

1240
00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Lighter than air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1241
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a balloon anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I used to fly balloons.</v>

1242
00:51:40.431 --> 00:51:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1243
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:42.840
<v Speaker 1>that's got to be spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1244
00:51:42.841 --> 00:51:45.970
<v Speaker 1>they're great fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you in a basket near space.</v>

1245
00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.220
<v Speaker 1>It's just awesome because now it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>loud when you burn,</v>

1246
00:51:49.221 --> 00:51:51.260
<v Speaker 1>but then when you're not burning you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just floating.</v>

1247
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:53.860
<v Speaker 1>It's quiet and you could hear the sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1248
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:58.870
<v Speaker 1>there's no obstruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can hear people talking on the </v>

1249
00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:01.361
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in Dallas there's this one track </v>

1250
00:52:01.361 --> 00:52:04.151
<v Speaker 1>that we had taken Sunday morning because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a woman who would lay out in </v>

1251
00:52:04.151 --> 00:52:04.310
<v Speaker 1>her backyard but naked.</v>

1252
00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we would come in,</v>

1253
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:07.520
<v Speaker 1>we'd burn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we'd,</v>

1254
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.480
<v Speaker 1>we'd come up high so that we coast down </v>
<v Speaker 1>in low and come over the lake and just.</v>

1255
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:15.160
<v Speaker 1>And then we'd say good morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she jumped in.</v>

1256
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:16.700
<v Speaker 1>How rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1257
00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:21.740
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could hear everything in Texas cars </v>

1258
00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:24.581
<v Speaker 1>you'd fly or and Sunday morning and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickup trucks with people passed out in </v>

1259
00:52:24.581 --> 00:52:24.710
<v Speaker 1>the back of them and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1260
00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.660
<v Speaker 1>With yell at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dangerous is it though?</v>

1261
00:52:26.661 --> 00:52:31.661
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's pretty dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I quit is because I wasn't </v>

1262
00:52:31.661 --> 00:52:35.171
<v Speaker 1>paying close enough attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost hit a power line and it scared </v>

1263
00:52:35.171 --> 00:52:37.010
<v Speaker 1>me so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was flying people for money and stuff,</v>

1264
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:37.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>

1265
00:52:37.611 --> 00:52:42.611
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got wrapped up in the conversation </v>

1266
00:52:42.611 --> 00:52:42.980
<v Speaker 1>these guys are having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my problem in paying attention to</v>

1267
00:52:42.981 --> 00:52:44.150
<v Speaker 1>them more than the flying.</v>

1268
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:46.430
<v Speaker 1>And they didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a close call.</v>

1269
00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:48.320
<v Speaker 1>I knew we had close calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How close?</v>

1270
00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Not that close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Close enough.</v>

1271
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:54.530
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was coming down and I didn't burn soon</v>

1272
00:52:54.531 --> 00:52:59.531
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it takes a while to get your </v>

1273
00:52:59.531 --> 00:52:59.531
<v Speaker 1>momentum backup and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1274
00:52:59.531 --> 00:53:01.550
<v Speaker 1>I cleared it by 50 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1275
00:53:01.551 --> 00:53:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I should have cleared it by 500 feet or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1276
00:53:03.621 --> 00:53:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1277
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.240
<v Speaker 1>I was coming in for a landing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1278
00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it scared the hell out of me.</v>

1279
00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:07.960
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1280
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people had died hitting power </v>

1281
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:13.000
<v Speaker 1>lines?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's mainly,</v>

1282
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:13.000
<v Speaker 1>it was just happened to people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>balloons.</v>

1283
00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

1284
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:17.270
<v Speaker 1>not all that many compared to the number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people flying,</v>

1285
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:22.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's safer than regular aircraft or you </v>

1286
00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:22.300
<v Speaker 1>harnessed in when you're up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

1287
00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to sit on the edge of the basket,</v>

1288
00:53:24.051 --> 00:53:25.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and burn.</v>

1289
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1290
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Fucking a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if a crazy rebel wind came along </v>

1291
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:31.490
<v Speaker 1>and knocked you off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1292
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:34.320
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have launched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's over 10 miles an hour,</v>

1293
00:53:34.321 --> 00:53:36.460
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't launch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot of trouble for her.</v>

1294
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Look so spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd curling my toes.</v>

1295
00:53:39.031 --> 00:53:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Just sitting there looking at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

1296
00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.830
<v Speaker 1>We'd go to these airshows where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring in biplanes and stuff like that.</v>

1297
00:53:43.831 --> 00:53:48.831
<v Speaker 1>And for the balloons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would put up a pole in the middle </v>

1298
00:53:48.831 --> 00:53:52.940
<v Speaker 1>of the airfield with the keys to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cadillac or something on it and you had </v>

1299
00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:56.691
<v Speaker 1>to go five miles away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere in the radius of five miles </v>

1300
00:53:56.691 --> 00:53:56.730
<v Speaker 1>away and launch and whoever could grab </v>
<v Speaker 1>the keys,</v>

1301
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:58.480
<v Speaker 1>got the balloon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1302
00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:01.830
<v Speaker 1>What if they collide into each other?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of bounce off.</v>

1303
00:54:01.831 --> 00:54:04.410
<v Speaker 1>But if you're at the same altitude at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least,</v>

1304
00:54:04.411 --> 00:54:06.720
<v Speaker 1>but you the rules the road so you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do that.</v>

1305
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:10.860
<v Speaker 1>But nobody in things I ever flew in ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>got the keys.</v>

1306
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.050
<v Speaker 1>But you have a beanbag too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you throw that in.</v>

1307
00:54:13.051 --> 00:54:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Whoever got closest would win money or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1308
00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:16.740
<v Speaker 1>But wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great fun.</v>

1309
00:54:16.741 --> 00:54:19.680
<v Speaker 1>You know that my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my ex wife took me on a balloon ride for</v>

1310
00:54:19.681 --> 00:54:22.380
<v Speaker 1>my 40th birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the way back I said,</v>

1311
00:54:22.381 --> 00:54:24.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much do these things cost?</v>

1312
00:54:24.211 --> 00:54:25.860
<v Speaker 1>How did he get started in the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning?</v>

1313
00:54:25.861 --> 00:54:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I was taking lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of money.</v>

1314
00:54:27.691 --> 00:54:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much does it cost to get a balloon?</v>

1315
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:32.720
<v Speaker 1>A balloon is about $35,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't back when I bought it.</v>

1316
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do you fold that bitch up once </v>

1317
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.940
<v Speaker 1>you've done flying or they pack into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>basket that's a.</v>

1318
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh maybe a third of the size of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>

1319
00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1320
00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.870
<v Speaker 1>but then you have your basket too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a trailer behind your.</v>

1321
00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a parachute up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There ain't shit hits the fan will know </v>

1322
00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:51.090
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No dude,</v>

1323
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I had balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one guy wanted to pay me to take </v>

1324
00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:56.480
<v Speaker 1>them up in a parachute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to jump out,</v>

1325
00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.280
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to do it because once </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1326
00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:02.300
<v Speaker 1>once a guy jumps out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get so much lighter and if you're </v>

1327
00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:02.300
<v Speaker 1>not careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shoot up too fast.</v>

1328
00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:04.740
<v Speaker 1>You collapse the envelope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't happen very often,</v>

1329
00:55:04.741 --> 00:55:06.720
<v Speaker 1>but they're really safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really safe.</v>

1330
00:55:06.721 --> 00:55:10.350
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of fun and wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds scary.</v>

1331
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:12.930
<v Speaker 1>That you lower yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to lower it?</v>

1332
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Naturally the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a hole in the top and you have a</v>

1333
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:20.130
<v Speaker 1>line that goes through it and a rope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull it and bleed air out of the top and</v>

1334
00:55:20.131 --> 00:55:21.710
<v Speaker 1>let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you're,</v>

1335
00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:26.740
<v Speaker 1>when you're actually landing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top is held in by Velcro and so </v>

1336
00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.950
<v Speaker 1>except for the little flap that's open </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're just very land,</v>

1337
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:34.190
<v Speaker 1>you rip that called pull the top out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pull the top out and then it will </v>

1338
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:34.190
<v Speaker 1>deflate and land down.</v>

1339
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes your landings are a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>rough.</v>

1340
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:40.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had landings are dragged for 50 </v>

1341
00:55:40.461 --> 00:55:42.581
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred yards were bounced up and </v>

1342
00:55:42.581 --> 00:55:45.561
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that the conditions sometimes </v>

1343
00:55:45.561 --> 00:55:45.561
<v Speaker 1>make it tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in,</v>

1344
00:55:45.561 --> 00:55:47.310
<v Speaker 1>in North Texas at the time you had to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1345
00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:48.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1346
00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.280
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to land anywhere when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're landing,</v>

1347
00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Faa let you because you,</v>

1348
00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:53.850
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you out of fuel.</v>

1349
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:58.950
<v Speaker 1>And there was this one farm up in north </v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas up by Cisco I think it was.</v>

1350
00:55:58.951 --> 00:56:01.350
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whenever the balloons would come and</v>

1351
00:56:01.351 --> 00:56:06.351
<v Speaker 1>landing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see dust coming on these gravel </v>

1352
00:56:06.351 --> 00:56:06.351
<v Speaker 1>roads from two directions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One would be this farmer with his pickup</v>

1353
00:56:06.351 --> 00:56:11.301
<v Speaker 1>and his shotgun and the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be the sheriff to come to protect </v>

1354
00:56:11.301 --> 00:56:11.301
<v Speaker 1>you because the farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1355
00:56:11.301 --> 00:56:13.230
<v Speaker 1>did you landing on their lawn when </v>
<v Speaker 1>ballooning started?</v>

1356
00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:18.231
<v Speaker 1>In France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would carry a bottle of champagne </v>

1357
00:56:18.231 --> 00:56:19.020
<v Speaker 1>to give to the farmer when they landed </v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

1358
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:20.340
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you for letting us land here.</v>

1359
00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Here's the champagne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When ballooning started in the United </v>

1360
00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:28.620
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the balloon has never gave it to the </v>

1361
00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:28.620
<v Speaker 1>landowners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They drank it themselves,</v>

1362
00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:28.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>champagne and propane.</v>

1363
00:56:28.961 --> 00:56:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The balloon is how rude.</v>

1364
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:33.690
<v Speaker 1>That's why they ruined the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

1365
00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:35.200
<v Speaker 1>That looks like Albuquerque.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1366
00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:37.510
<v Speaker 1>There's one in Colorado too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Colorado Springs.</v>

1367
00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.760
<v Speaker 1>We went to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman that taught me the balloon,</v>

1368
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:42.040
<v Speaker 1>moved to Colorado Springs to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1369
00:56:42.041 --> 00:56:47.041
<v Speaker 1>we went there to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was bad weather so they'd </v>

1370
00:56:47.041 --> 00:56:47.041
<v Speaker 1>never launched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got to do it,</v>

1371
00:56:47.041 --> 00:56:51.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at sunrise and sunset the a couple of </v>

1372
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:53.290
<v Speaker 1>hours until after sunrise and a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours for sunset.</v>

1373
00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.300
<v Speaker 1>That's the only time that the air is </v>
<v Speaker 1>stable enough.</v>

1374
00:56:55.301 --> 00:56:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever met anybody that was up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a balloon and saw a Ufo?</v>

1375
00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.850
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1376
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's too early in the day or plus</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at other things.</v>

1377
00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:05.410
<v Speaker 1>How convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what most people like to do on their</v>

1378
00:57:05.411 --> 00:57:08.380
<v Speaker 1>first balloon ride is picked leaves from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of a tree.</v>

1379
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some reason that's a big thrill,</v>

1380
00:57:10.271 --> 00:57:15.271
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'd go and skim the trees and they </v>

1381
00:57:15.271 --> 00:57:15.271
<v Speaker 1>can pick leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1382
00:57:15.271 --> 00:57:19.680
<v Speaker 1>That's Weird Grief Fund.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that we figured out how to </v>

1383
00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.220
<v Speaker 1>float float around in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1384
00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:26.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of time before we </v>

1385
00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:27.721
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to do it with suits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some jet packs are coming around pretty </v>

1386
00:57:27.721 --> 00:57:31.510
<v Speaker 1>good and well they've got guys that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>those wings suits that jump off cliffs.</v>

1387
00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Psychopaths some nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1388
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:38.710
<v Speaker 1>I can hardly watched those videos for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to watch.</v>

1389
00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:40.660
<v Speaker 1>And there's one word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy crashes.</v>

1390
00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:43.000
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to watch that one I </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't seen,</v>

1391
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:48.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a matter of time before </v>
<v Speaker 1>they figure out something with like a </v>

1392
00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:50.260
<v Speaker 1>wing wings on that technology is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to grow.</v>

1393
00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:52.780
<v Speaker 1>I think everything's going to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1394
00:57:52.781 --> 00:57:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they have a jet pack now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

1395
00:57:54.611 --> 00:57:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1396
00:57:55.390 --> 00:58:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I watched one when I was in Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was my friend willy has a Klg.</v>

1397
00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:01.380
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kale,</v>

1398
00:58:01.381 --> 00:58:02.750
<v Speaker 1>PJ Klp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>j,</v>

1399
00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:05.470
<v Speaker 1>the radio station had a guy come in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1400
00:58:05.471 --> 00:58:09.130
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a that had a jet pack guy come in and he</v>

1401
00:58:09.131 --> 00:58:14.131
<v Speaker 1>launched a jet pack in the parking lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>and flew through the air for like 10 </v>

1402
00:58:14.131 --> 00:58:16.981
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only do it for like 10 seconds </v>

1403
00:58:16.981 --> 00:58:19.380
<v Speaker 1>and it was like within x amount of years</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be able to do five minutes </v>

1404
00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:19.380
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1405
00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.760
<v Speaker 1>x amount of years after that they think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to figure out some sort of</v>

1406
00:58:21.761 --> 00:58:26.440
<v Speaker 1>power source that's going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it a viable mode of transportation.</v>

1407
00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:31.560
<v Speaker 1>But it was very complicated as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the controlling the yard and what </v>

1408
00:58:31.751 --> 00:58:32.260
<v Speaker 1>is it called?</v>

1409
00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:34.180
<v Speaker 1>There's like to pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pitch and Yaw.</v>

1410
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it's like it's not a simple </v>

1411
00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.851
<v Speaker 1>thing to figure out how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have to learn that to get a </v>

1412
00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:44.641
<v Speaker 1>license for balloons because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just up and down and he had literally </v>

1413
00:58:44.641 --> 00:58:47.770
<v Speaker 1>have to learn whether cloud's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had learned about procedures with </v>

1414
00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:49.210
<v Speaker 1>the FAA because you have to call the FAA</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

1415
00:58:49.211 --> 00:58:54.211
<v Speaker 1>get a weather report and all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you tell them where you're going to </v>

1416
00:58:54.211 --> 00:58:54.211
<v Speaker 1>launch and so they'd know some balloons </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be in the area.</v>

1417
00:58:54.211 --> 00:58:56.260
<v Speaker 1>How much different is that than a blimp?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you,</v>

1418
00:58:56.350 --> 00:58:58.510
<v Speaker 1>can you target a blimp?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been in a blimp.</v>

1419
00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.520
<v Speaker 1>But pilot one with your license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1420
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:01.650
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's lighter than air.</v>

1421
00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody crazy enough to let</v>

1422
00:59:05.261 --> 00:59:07.420
<v Speaker 1>me do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I guess I guess that would be legal.</v>

1423
00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:09.670
<v Speaker 1>It's lighter than aircraft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1424
00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to renew that license or is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that once you get it,</v>

1425
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:13.840
<v Speaker 1>you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy thing.</v>

1426
00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:16.690
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't ever have to renew it,</v>

1427
00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:22.020
<v Speaker 1>but you have to have a check flight </v>
<v Speaker 1>every year I think with somebody else </v>

1428
00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:22.250
<v Speaker 1>who's a commercial pilot.</v>

1429
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:27.520
<v Speaker 2>So all you have to do is get a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out and take a ride with you in your </v>

1430
00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:27.520
<v Speaker 2>current.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1431
00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:27.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not current.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>

1432
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:32.651
<v Speaker 2>When you just put up Jamie got an </v>
<v Speaker 2>address that flies and lady Gaga the </v>

1433
00:59:32.651 --> 00:59:34.310
<v Speaker 2>actual lady Gaga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like remote controlled.</v>

1434
00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:37.850
<v Speaker 2>And uh oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is it lady Gaga or is it a toy?</v>

1435
00:59:37.851 --> 00:59:41.390
<v Speaker 2>That's lady Gaga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lady Gaga is in a jet pack.</v>

1436
00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here she is.</v>

1437
00:59:42.261 --> 00:59:46.130
<v Speaker 2>She's got a helmet on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see this.</v>

1438
00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

1439
00:59:46.481 --> 00:59:51.481
<v Speaker 2>We just want us after it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she climbs into this fucking thing </v>

1440
00:59:51.481 --> 00:59:51.940
<v Speaker 2>and flies around.</v>

1441
00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think jetpacks could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>annoying.</v>

1442
00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Book is Lady Gaga and Jetpack Yeomans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ruin everything.</v>

1443
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.410
<v Speaker 2>This is so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's connected by wires.</v>

1444
01:00:06.411 --> 01:00:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Shut this off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a fucking charade.</v>

1445
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Sunday really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A jetpack.</v>

1446
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.730
<v Speaker 2>She's all wired up and everything like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1447
01:00:11.731 --> 01:00:13.160
<v Speaker 2>It's more like a little helicopter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1448
01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:14.600
<v Speaker 2>that's horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that is.</v>

1449
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:19.630
<v Speaker 2>It's wired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know there have been guys go </v>

1450
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:19.630
<v Speaker 2>into the stadium football stadiums and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those jet packs.</v>

1451
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's that one guy that landed,</v>

1452
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:26.200
<v Speaker 2>he was in the middle of a boxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evander Holyfield was fighting Riddick </v>

1453
01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.441
<v Speaker 2>bowe and the guy landed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had like a parachute connected to </v>

1454
01:00:29.441 --> 01:00:32.060
<v Speaker 2>fans and he called himself like the fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

1455
01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:37.350
<v Speaker 2>And they landed in delayed the fight for</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a half an hour while they had to </v>

1456
01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:40.991
<v Speaker 2>arrest this guy bringing police and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat the guy up and everything like </v>

1457
01:00:40.991 --> 01:00:41.270
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it sort of changed the,</v>

1458
01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:46.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the atmosphere of the fight because </v>

1459
01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:46.330
<v Speaker 2>there was a big break and blow the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1460
01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Anybody cool off and then had to go at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it again.</v>

1461
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.210
<v Speaker 2>But that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw on,</v>

1462
01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:51.410
<v Speaker 2>I used to walk on the bluffs down by del</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mar,</v>

1463
01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.440
<v Speaker 2>which are maybe 30 feet or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one day a guy came by and one of </v>

1464
01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:56.440
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a parachute,</v>

1465
01:00:56.450 --> 01:01:01.450
<v Speaker 2>had a big fan on the back and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was at eye level with me and he </v>

1466
01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:01.450
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hello,</v>

1467
01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:03.590
<v Speaker 2>hello.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's moving very slowly.</v>

1468
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the video riddick bowe and </v>

1469
01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:09.010
<v Speaker 2>evander holyfield fight and look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stop and they're like,</v>

1470
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:12.290
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're looking at is boom.</v>

1471
01:01:12.291 --> 01:01:17.291
<v Speaker 2>The guy lands ringside in the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should've turned hola holyfield </v>

1472
01:01:17.291 --> 01:01:21.400
<v Speaker 2>onto them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let them while they were in the middle </v>

1473
01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.420
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has other more important things to </v>

1474
01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.901
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just beat the shit out of this guy </v>

1475
01:01:25.901 --> 01:01:27.401
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see why you think that guys </v>

1476
01:01:27.401 --> 01:01:27.620
<v Speaker 2>probably still in jail or I'm surprised </v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't just reschedule the fight.</v>

1477
01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.670
<v Speaker 2>That's not really fair to do that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1478
01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.640
<v Speaker 2>I think people wanted to conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1479
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:36.670
<v Speaker 2>it was all going on and all the money </v>
<v Speaker 2>there in all the money on paper view as </v>

1480
01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:36.790
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor fighters.</v>

1481
01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:38.570
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

1482
01:01:38.571 --> 01:01:40.850
<v Speaker 2>they should have just started it up </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

1483
01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:44.090
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't have waited a half an hour to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give it a little five minute break,</v>

1484
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:45.200
<v Speaker 2>cut the cords,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1485
01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:47.400
<v Speaker 2>let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as I think it was a quite a,</v>

1486
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:50.000
<v Speaker 2>quite a break while they arrested this </v>
<v Speaker 2>dummy,</v>

1487
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:53.140
<v Speaker 2>she needed pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1488
01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:58.170
<v Speaker 2>That's an example of a needy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they should have those fights </v>

1489
01:01:58.170 --> 01:01:58.170
<v Speaker 2>indoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1490
01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:01.250
<v Speaker 2>I think they probably mostly do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I very rarely hear about fights out.</v>

1491
01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Do I know they do a few occasionally </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside and Vegas is a big one,</v>

1492
01:02:05.481 --> 01:02:08.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back in Africa or something.</v>

1493
01:02:08.331 --> 01:02:13.331
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The two Moitai ones they do do more </v>

1494
01:02:14.061 --> 01:02:16.400
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ones in Vegas outside.</v>

1495
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 3>Well didn't get quite</v>

1496
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>as loud I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1497
01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:22.740
<v Speaker 2>But it's also your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1498
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:27.750
<v Speaker 2>the environment is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with outside rain and </v>

1499
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.750
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1500
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:28.360
<v Speaker 2>I went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1501
01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:31.690
<v Speaker 2>a king of the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Used to have these fights outside.</v>

1502
01:02:31.691 --> 01:02:36.691
<v Speaker 2>I went to a couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they used to have them in an Indian </v>

1503
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:39.130
<v Speaker 2>casino in California back when mixed </v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts was illegal in California,</v>

1504
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:42.760
<v Speaker 2>so they would hold them in this outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>casino and one time they uh,</v>

1505
01:02:42.761 --> 01:02:45.490
<v Speaker 2>it started raining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pouring rain out and instead they</v>

1506
01:02:45.491 --> 01:02:48.700
<v Speaker 2>decided to let the fights continue in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pouring rain.</v>

1507
01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:51.150
<v Speaker 2>So these people are fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're slipping,</v>

1508
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:55.000
<v Speaker 2>they try to throw kicks that fallen on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ass and people are climbing on top</v>

1509
01:02:55.001 --> 01:02:56.440
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're soaking wet.</v>

1510
01:02:56.441 --> 01:02:59.230
<v Speaker 2>It was the craziest and they released it</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a DVD,</v>

1511
01:02:59.231 --> 01:03:01.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called King of the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wet and wild,</v>

1512
01:03:01.421 --> 01:03:05.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's a really insane series of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights where people were trying to fight</v>

1513
01:03:05.951 --> 01:03:06.710
<v Speaker 2>in a torrential</v>

1514
01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:11.040
<v Speaker 1>rainstorm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just,</v>

1515
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:16.160
<v Speaker 1>just so nutty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever hear of an old long time </v>

1516
01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:16.160
<v Speaker 1>ago wrestler name Gorgeous George?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1517
01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a gorgeous George Wrestle.</v>

1518
01:03:18.070 --> 01:03:22.720
<v Speaker 1>My Dad took me to see them in the Elgin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Highschool Gymnasium and the big deal,</v>

1519
01:03:22.721 --> 01:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>he had long hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1520
01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>it was maybe almost down to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders,</v>

1521
01:03:26.081 --> 01:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>but not quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at that time I was huge in his.</v>

1522
01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>When he come out in the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning,</v>

1523
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hair would be up and he'd take bobby</v>

1524
01:03:33.791 --> 01:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>pins out of his hair and throw them out </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the audience.</v>

1525
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>I was so disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't catch you on.</v>

1526
01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gorgeous.</v>

1527
01:03:40.511 --> 01:03:45.511
<v Speaker 1>George's George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's another thing that people would </v>

1528
01:03:45.511 --> 01:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>come if they came here from another </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet?</v>

1529
01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:46.560
<v Speaker 1>The biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is going on?</v>

1530
01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are really hitting each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1531
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:50.890
<v Speaker 2>why are you watching?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was fun.</v>

1532
01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:54.300
<v Speaker 2>We had to find out who's gonna win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the champion of the world</v>

1533
01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.440

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1534
01:03:56.770 --> 01:04:01.770
<v Speaker 1>We were strange for strange floating </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and balloons pretending to hit </v>

1535
01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:02.730
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Erase.</v>

1536
01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1537
01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:05.970

<v Speaker 1>It's been great.</v>

1538
01:04:05.971 --> 01:04:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Fun is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really glad to get to meet you.</v>

1539
01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you realize what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

1540
01:04:12.271 --> 01:04:17.271
<v Speaker 1>but you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're filling in a role here for a lot </v>

1541
01:04:17.271 --> 01:04:19.650
<v Speaker 1>of young people that you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know how smart you are.</v>

1542
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're.</v>

1543
01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:26.030
<v Speaker 1>You're extremely well read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know so much your time at Graham </v>

1544
01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Hancock about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read the headlines and you know,</v>

1545
01:04:27.091 --> 01:04:29.760
<v Speaker 1>all these terms about the skull and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that,</v>

1546
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:32.470
<v Speaker 1>but what you're doing is you're taking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1547
01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:36.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high level intellectual product to the</v>

1548
01:04:36.181 --> 01:04:39.690
<v Speaker 1>masses into especially young people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe hadn't had the advantage.</v>

1549
01:04:39.691 --> 01:04:41.490
<v Speaker 1>You go to college or something and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out,</v>

1550
01:04:41.491 --> 01:04:43.110
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're as smart as anybody that went to</v>

1551
01:04:43.111 --> 01:04:46.230
<v Speaker 1>college and you're really doing a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>good service with these products.</v>

1552
01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Well thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not trying and I'm working.</v>

1553
01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:52.690
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm extremely uneducated.</v>

1554
01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.340
<v Speaker 2>You're very well read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1555
01:04:54.341 --> 01:04:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot of things but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what is education?</v>

1556
01:04:57.101 --> 01:05:02.101
<v Speaker 2>They are not reading but as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 2>formal education and it is also as far </v>

1557
01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:02.230
<v Speaker 2>as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1558
01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:07.290
<v Speaker 2>I just liked what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in certain things and I </v>

1559
01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:10.741
<v Speaker 2>find that there's a lot of things out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there that are fascinating that people </v>

1560
01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:13.711
<v Speaker 2>just aren't paying attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think what would I see in what we </v>

1561
01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:18.720
<v Speaker 2>talk about on the podcast is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflected by what I see on and when I </v>

1562
01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.000
<v Speaker 2>see on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I see,</v>

1563
01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:21.790
<v Speaker 2>when I go to the various websites that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>visit for information,</v>

1564
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:26.800
<v Speaker 2>I see just a massive new upsurge and </v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity.</v>

1565
01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:30.280
<v Speaker 2>I think the people were way more curious</v>
<v Speaker 2>than they ever have been before,</v>

1566
01:05:30.281 --> 01:05:35.281
<v Speaker 2>just by virtue of the fact they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting more information than they've </v>

1567
01:05:35.281 --> 01:05:35.281
<v Speaker 2>ever done.</v>

1568
01:05:35.281 --> 01:05:35.281
<v Speaker 2>They can get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1569
01:05:35.281 --> 01:05:36.490
<v Speaker 2>they're not being held back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think what this podcast is,</v>

1570
01:05:36.491 --> 01:05:41.491
<v Speaker 2>we came along in the right place at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right time and it was the right type of </v>

1571
01:05:41.491 --> 01:05:43.090
<v Speaker 2>person in me that kind of can bridge a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few different worlds.</v>

1572
01:05:43.091 --> 01:05:48.091
<v Speaker 2>Exactly that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're bridging quite a few </v>

1573
01:05:48.091 --> 01:05:50.281
<v Speaker 2>different worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really important in the </v>

1574
01:05:50.281 --> 01:05:52.140
<v Speaker 2>potheads exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the bridge between the meat heads </v>

1575
01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:52.140
<v Speaker 2>and the beds were not all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

1576
01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:52.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might look different,</v>

1577
01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.960
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's prejudice against people who </v>

1578
01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:00.040
<v Speaker 2>engage in martial arts and exercise just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this prejudice against people smoke</v>

1579
01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:01.630
<v Speaker 2>pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of it's justified.</v>

1580
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:02.670
<v Speaker 2>And some of it's not.</v>

1581
01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's assholes in every.</v>

1582
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to define people because of</v>

1583
01:06:08.551 --> 01:06:09.660
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1584
01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1585
01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>in conversations like this and podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it kind of gives everybody a better </v>

1586
01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:21.351
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting into people's heads </v>

1587
01:06:21.351 --> 01:06:21.351
<v Speaker 1>because you're writing their ears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1588
01:06:21.351 --> 01:06:25.641
<v Speaker 1>they got the earphones on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're listening is theater of the </v>

1589
01:06:25.641 --> 01:06:25.641
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1590
01:06:25.641 --> 01:06:25.641
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1591
01:06:25.641 --> 01:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1592
01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:29.650
<v Speaker 1>the old voice in the back of the mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you hear that,</v>

1593
01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:34.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard so many of your podcasts </v>

1594
01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:34.890
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1595
01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I've known you all my life.</v>

1596
01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I feel I've known you a long time to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've listened to you on many road trips,</v>

1597
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:40.400
<v Speaker 2>give the introductions to all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different various psychedelic talks.</v>

1598
01:06:40.401 --> 01:06:41.510
<v Speaker 2>How many episodes do you have?</v>

1599
01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:44.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just last night did three 78.</v>

1600
01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1601
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.570
<v Speaker 2>You are on episode four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen.</v>

1602
01:06:47.571 --> 01:06:52.571
<v Speaker 2>You almost ran for 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were going to do a special for 20 </v>

1603
01:06:52.571 --> 01:06:53.120
<v Speaker 2>episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now I'm like,</v>

1604
01:06:53.121 --> 01:06:54.380

<v Speaker 2>That's so stupid.</v>
