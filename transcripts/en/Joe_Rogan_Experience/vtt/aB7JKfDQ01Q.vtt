00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>freak bitches.</v>

3
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.043
<v Speaker 1>That stink.</v>

4
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom smells so bad.</v>

6
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>The bathroom smells so bad from pollution.</v>

7
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I think just from the polluted water,</v>

8
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.830
<v Speaker 1>just polluted water makes it smell man.</v>

9
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.763
<v Speaker 1>And also they don't.</v>

10
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.283
<v Speaker 1>They don't want,</v>

11
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.230
<v Speaker 1>you can't even say it died.</v>

12
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.263
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about it,</v>

13
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.670
<v Speaker 1>they have a lot of toilets.</v>

14
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Was just no toilet.</v>

15
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.700
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

16
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.050
<v Speaker 1>it's just a porcelain hole.</v>

17
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.980
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

18
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Squat is a squat.</v>

19
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.141
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly.</v>

20
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>It's better for your bowels.</v>

21
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly.</v>

22
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly I was in the Forbidden City.</v>

23
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I was walking around there with the emperor's palace.</v>

24
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>And I got bad diarrhea.</v>

26
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.631
<v Speaker 1>It was bad.</v>

27
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:46.201
<v Speaker 1>Like sweating,</v>

28
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>like I gotTa Fuck Fuck.</v>

29
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.100
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a picture toilet and you go in there and you fucking run and</v>

30
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.501
<v Speaker 1>smells.</v>

31
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:56.420
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you cross the threshold of the smells and you open up the first toy,</v>

32
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>the stall door and your mind can't even register it first.</v>

33
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

34
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>this must be under construction because there's no toilet here.</v>

35
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's the only explanation.</v>

36
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>And then you go to the next one and you're like,</v>

37
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

38
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

39
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.343
<v Speaker 1>zero papers.</v>

40
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

41
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>there's no paper.</v>

42
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.311
<v Speaker 1>first I just said,</v>

44
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:15.144
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing this.</v>

45
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

46
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.763
<v Speaker 1>I walked away.</v>

47
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

48
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:18.081
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

49
00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:19.760
<v Speaker 1>I took like two steps out of the bathroom,</v>

50
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.221
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

51
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:20.461
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

52
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:20.941
<v Speaker 1>diarrhea,</v>

53
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:21.810
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean I'm not doing it?</v>

54
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.823
<v Speaker 1>Of course I'm doing it.</v>

55
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.030
<v Speaker 1>So you went back in and wash your butt.</v>

56
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.193
<v Speaker 1>You have to do.</v>

57
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>So this guy who owned the bar,</v>

58
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>the club was in Shanghai,</v>

59
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>gave me this,</v>

60
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.730
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

61
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 1>this tissue packet,</v>

62
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.531
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

63
00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>you'll need it.</v>

64
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was for pollution,</v>

65
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.251
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

66
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>you'll need this.</v>

67
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.770
<v Speaker 1>And I just had.</v>

68
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>And then it was like,</v>

70
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

71
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>you got to pull your pants all the way down.</v>

72
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Squat over it,</v>

73
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>but also try to shit into your pants.</v>

74
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>You can't go over the balls of your feet.</v>

75
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

76
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>there's probably a better way.</v>

77
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with explosive diarrhea though?</v>

78
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you're going to miss lasted into that hole.</v>

79
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

80
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

81
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.580
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

82
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>you're like half a foot over the hole.</v>

83
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Is that good for your quads?</v>

84
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>It's good for your core.</v>

85
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.543
<v Speaker 1>That definitely.</v>

86
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I would feel like that would really work your core a lot and there's no air</v>

87
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:11.431
<v Speaker 1>conditioning.</v>

88
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:13.620
<v Speaker 1>It's so hot that would work here.</v>

89
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Resolve.</v>

90
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>That's why the is a thing.</v>

92
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not the low sugar diet shit.</v>

93
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.540
<v Speaker 1>You hate your ankles.</v>

94
00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:21.480
<v Speaker 1>So because I'm going to have explosive diarrhea feels was like.</v>

95
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to hit my picture.</v>

96
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:23.191
<v Speaker 1>This picture,</v>

97
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>this I'm down,</v>

98
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm squatting right now.</v>

99
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>So like your,</v>

100
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.620
<v Speaker 1>your ass is right over the whole filling the hole essentially.</v>

101
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.891
<v Speaker 1>Feet.</v>

102
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>If you're moved to far enough away,</v>

103
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>what do you do if you have bad knees,</v>

104
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you do after that.</v>

105
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>But I sit like that all the time.</v>

106
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>That's how it usually just squat,</v>

107
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>eat all the time.</v>

108
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I do that sometimes.</v>

109
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like that.</v>

110
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:45.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

111
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

112
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Once in a while back,</v>

113
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.753
<v Speaker 1>it's just</v>

114
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 1>in one of those toilets,</v>

115
00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>somebody dropped their brand new phone in the toilet and so the husband went to</v>

116
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>go in there and grab it passed down because of the fumes.</v>

117
00:02:58.141 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>And the woman tried to grab</v>

118
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.250
<v Speaker 2>the guy out.</v>

119
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.101
<v Speaker 2>Two people died.</v>

120
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:03.934

150
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's.</v>

151
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's there.</v>

152
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.911
<v Speaker 2>It's diluted.</v>

153
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Youtube.</v>

154
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 2>It's because it's you're,</v>

155
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

156
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 2>You're commenting on a photo or a video instead of like a twitter where you're</v>

157
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 2>just talking about words for it.</v>

158
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 2>I honestly think anything worth anything should be comments,</v>

159
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.254
<v Speaker 2>deleted,</v>

160
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 2>comments,</v>

161
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 2>disabled,</v>

162
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 2>because the problem is they very rarely,</v>

163
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.470
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

164
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 2>It's rare that you.</v>

165
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 2>It generates a really fascinating conversation in the comments.</v>

166
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 2>It's super common that it just country shitheads.</v>

167
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the subject matter.</v>

168
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Like in,</v>

169
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.591
<v Speaker 2>in my case,</v>

170
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I do get relevant discussion in the comments,</v>

171
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.480
<v Speaker 2>a tech discussion,</v>

172
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 2>like did it pretty respectful,</v>

173
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 2>but you do get this weird fanboys and stuff that gets a militant surprisingly is</v>

174
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.550
<v Speaker 2>like a more way.</v>

175
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:33.743
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

176
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.580
<v Speaker 2>I have this theory like,</v>

177
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

178
00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:38.940
<v Speaker 2>when you go to a coffee shop and you look around you at starbucks,</v>

179
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.740
<v Speaker 2>everyone has their phones on the table.</v>

180
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.910
<v Speaker 2>You notice that like,</v>

181
00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:42.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

182
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.140
<v Speaker 2>like it's in a public space,</v>

183
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like representative of you in some way.</v>

184
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.070
<v Speaker 2>And I have this feeling that this is for a lot of people,</v>

185
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:51.300
<v Speaker 2>this is a major investment,</v>

186
00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

187
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.920
<v Speaker 2>outside of their car or whatever.</v>

188
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.701
<v Speaker 2>It's really close to you.</v>

189
00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:54.780
<v Speaker 2>It's in your pocket all the time.</v>

190
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.890
<v Speaker 2>And so I think people are really concerned with making the wrong decision.</v>

191
00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.311
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

192
00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:01.830
<v Speaker 2>they're really concerned that their thing is not the best.</v>

193
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.000
<v Speaker 2>And so in my case what will happen is I'll put up a video within,</v>

194
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:06.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

195
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.280
<v Speaker 2>they haven't even had time to finish watching it and apple socs or android sucks</v>

196
00:05:11.281 --> 00:05:11.820
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

197
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.870
<v Speaker 2>And really it's fear.</v>

198
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.250
<v Speaker 2>It's fear that you made the wrong decision and so it,</v>

199
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.521
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

200
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:18.660
<v Speaker 2>like many places in life,</v>

201
00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:20.970
<v Speaker 2>you get angry when you're afraid and so,</v>

202
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.960
<v Speaker 2>God forbid a new product comes out that obsoletes yours and you don't have the</v>

203
00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:25.890
<v Speaker 2>money to replace it.</v>

204
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.660
<v Speaker 2>So you take this position of defending the other thing because that's easier</v>

205
00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:32.310
<v Speaker 2>than justifying the cost of the new one.</v>

206
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

207
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

208
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

209
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I've actually,</v>

210
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

211
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.400
<v Speaker 2>there were a couple of really cool articles on Fanboy ism that I was interviewed</v>

212
00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 2>for and you know,</v>

213
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.170
<v Speaker 2>we went,</v>

214
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.520
<v Speaker 2>we went deep into how,</v>

215
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

216
00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:43.380
<v Speaker 2>how people sort of figured that out.</v>

217
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.401
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

218
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:49.401
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely this undercurrent below the tech space,</v>

219
00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:53.430
<v Speaker 2>the consumer product space where these are becoming more and more like fashion</v>

220
00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:53.941
<v Speaker 2>symbols,</v>

221
00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:54.770
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

222
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.603
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

223
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

224
00:05:55.891 --> 00:05:57.060
<v Speaker 2>rep representative of your,</v>

225
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 2>maybe more so than this then as a tool,</v>

226
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:00.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 2>less,</v>

228
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 2>less of a hammer and more like a piece of jewelry,</v>

229
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:04.671
<v Speaker 2>like a watch or something.</v>

230
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it also that people just love being on teams,</v>

231
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:08.280
<v Speaker 2>whether it's team.</v>

232
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.113
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

233
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Publican team shelly most,</v>

234
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.531
<v Speaker 2>most definitely.</v>

235
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:12.910
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

236
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 2>and I've done some rants on this in the past.</v>

237
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel the need to tell people like I'm a fan of technology when I was</v>

238
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:19.131
<v Speaker 2>coming up as a kid,</v>

239
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 2>like if anybody brought me any of this stuff,</v>

240
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 2>I would be super excited of course.</v>

241
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 2>And I'm cool with saying that,</v>

242
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

243
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

244
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.731
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

245
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:29.181
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>

246
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:32.420
<v Speaker 2>there is definitely a team aspect where people,</v>

247
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 2>they want to belong to something I say belong to team technology if that's what</v>

248
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:37.251
<v Speaker 2>you're into.</v>

249
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:42.251
<v Speaker 2>Because the truth is these devices and these platforms push one another that the</v>

250
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 2>positive things that happened in android push ios to be better than the positive</v>

251
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 2>things that happened in Ios push android to be better.</v>

252
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 2>And the same thing goes for laptops,</v>

253
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 2>desktops really anywhere.</v>

254
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 2>There's innovation.</v>

255
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Having a little bit of competition is a positive thing.</v>
