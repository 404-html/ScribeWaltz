<v Speaker 3>apologized.</v>

83

<v Speaker 3>I do want to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they didn't care that you use </v>

84
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 3>sincerely apologized and did not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't mean to offend.</v>

85
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 3>You were cracking a joke about a woman.</v>

86
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was funny how they've missed.</v>

87
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Characterize it and lied about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>added words to it.</v>

88
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

89
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like talking about the tweet.</v>

90
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

91
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:14.884
<v Speaker 2>I seriously apologize to all whom I </v>
<v Speaker 2>inadvertently offended and because they </v>

92
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 2>were offended for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even what they say.</v>

93
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 2>They were offended because it didn't say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

94
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 2>But they think that I tweeted a said she</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked like a,</v>

95
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody and I never said anything about</v>

96
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:39.961
<v Speaker 2>her looks it was a political tweet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just proof of how everybody's under</v>

97
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 2>mass mind control because they took a </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

98
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.290
<v Speaker 2>and of course I'm always</v>

99
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.650
<v Speaker 3>interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

100
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've talked to control.</v>

101
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.713
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people are under the wave of </v>

102
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:55.144
<v Speaker 3>self mind control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's like there's anybody </v>

103
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 3>pulling the strings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get out of it.</v>

104
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.903
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone's pulling the </v>

105
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 3>strings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think this is.</v>

106
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

107
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.473
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's by design.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people are caught up in a wave </v>

108
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 3>of fear and paranoia and political </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctness.</v>

109
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.343
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the reasons why </v>
<v Speaker 3>attack they attack someone like you is </v>

110
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.323
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wealthy and successful and </v>

<v Speaker 1>Eleven 67.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were born in 1967?</v>

150
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

151
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in my,</v>

152
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.520
<v Speaker 1>I was in the Utah State Hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you were born,</v>

153
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.550
<v Speaker 1>what were you doing given birth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

154
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I was in a mental institution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my first hospitalization.</v>

155
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.373
<v Speaker 1>It lasted for nine months and it was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Utah State Hospital in Provo where the </v>

156
00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:47.854
<v Speaker 1>osmonds are from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's was always a big Marie Osmond </v>

157
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

158
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.650
<v Speaker 1>the mental health aspect of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation is an important one because</v>

159
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.650
<v Speaker 1>here's my take on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extremely important.</v>

160
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.513
<v Speaker 1>It is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yesterday was mental health </v>

161
00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:02.560
<v Speaker 1>awareness day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

162
00:08:02.561 --> 00:08:03.394
<v Speaker 1>I know and I was quite aware of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally healthy yesterday as I was </v>

163
00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:11.550
<v Speaker 1>smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone,</v>

164
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.990
<v Speaker 1>all I eat is cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone has a,</v>

165
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.950
<v Speaker 1>an injured leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't expect them to run marathons.</v>

166
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.770
<v Speaker 1>If someone has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.753
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with their liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't expect them to process food </v>

168
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:25.420
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't blame it on them,</v>

169
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.183
<v Speaker 1>but if someone has a mental health issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they do something erratic or they </v>

170
00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:35.020
<v Speaker 1>say something that's inappropriate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they apologize for it.</v>

171
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Or if they're Canadian or if they're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian and you,</v>

172
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:43.531
<v Speaker 1>you've had the gitelman real diagnosed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treated mental health issues,</v>

173
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.500
<v Speaker 1>trauma related issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

174
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 1>How'd you like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit better.</v>

175
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Kenya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

176
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to pretend that this</v>

177
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.933
<v Speaker 2>is a deliberate act by calculating </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who is just being an asshole and </v>

178
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 2>that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not an asshole at this time.</v>

179
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I have been an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you weren't there but you weren't.</v>

180
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 2>That's not what you were doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about Iran and the woman's</v>

181
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:16.680
<v Speaker 2>revelation there and how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

182
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's always been because,</v>

183
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:20.634
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I had my dna done because I wanted </v>

184
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 2>to know and I am of North African </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancestry,</v>

185
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.140
<v Speaker 2>how much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a very small percentage,</v>

186
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.003
<v Speaker 2>but it was something like 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago they left North Africa which </v>

187
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:40.851
<v Speaker 2>has kind of Syria and they went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lithuania and I'm Russia and uh,</v>

188
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:46.003
<v Speaker 2>some Europe to July 23 and me or </v>
<v Speaker 2>someplace and just answered so many </v>

189
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:52.650
<v Speaker 2>questions for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

190
00:09:52.651 --> 00:09:55.770
<v Speaker 2>why I feel this yearning towards that </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the world.</v>

191
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.390
<v Speaker 2>But I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

192
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.420
<v Speaker 2>and especially the geopolitics there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some have always intrigued me and I have</v>

193
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:08.220
<v Speaker 2>always attempted to use my voice to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>support all of the people there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>

196
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:18.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one tweet was like about.</v>

198
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.143
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually a genius tweet if you </v>

199

<v Speaker 2>really fucking knows what exactly did </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say it was?</v>

200
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Find the tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

201
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.443
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you if it's a artificially </v>
<v Speaker 2>rendered because an artificially </v>

202
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:36.744
<v Speaker 2>rendered one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of them were people </v>

203
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.210
<v Speaker 2>distorted what you actually said it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>racist Roseanne,</v>

204
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.433
<v Speaker 2>and then a couple of weeks later it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgraced comic Roseanne and her racist </v>

205
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:52.731
<v Speaker 2>tweet and then after that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgraced comic can her offensive racist</v>

206
00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:57.930
<v Speaker 2>tweet because there's all these hoops </v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta jump through,</v>

207
00:10:57.931 --> 00:11:01.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're never done punishing you.</v>

208
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.363
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look were saying before all my friends </v>

209
00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:05.244
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't apologize to social justice </v>

210
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:09.360
<v Speaker 2>warriors because that's the kiss of </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

211
00:11:09.361 --> 00:11:12.150
<v Speaker 2>That's like chum in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood in the water,</v>

212
00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:13.860
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely a little bit of that.</v>

213
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:16.080
<v Speaker 2>But what I was saying before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast to use,</v>

214
00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:17.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really.</v>

215
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:18.683
<v Speaker 2>What I really think happens is they find</v>
<v Speaker 2>a target and they don't care if it's a </v>

216
00:11:21.421 --> 00:11:24.110
<v Speaker 2>viable target,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once the target gets greenlit,</v>

217
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:29.390
<v Speaker 2>they go after you until some new target </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes along until only distraction.</v>

218
00:11:29.901 --> 00:11:30.860
<v Speaker 2>That target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

219
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's recreational outrage.</v>

220
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:33.954
<v Speaker 2>They find the attack you and they go </v>
<v Speaker 2>after you and they to what the fuck you </v>

221
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:42.630
<v Speaker 2>said and obviously they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what kind of cracks me up.</v>

222
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:43.464
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

223
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.660
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look what they're saying and that meant,</v>

224
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.553
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to bow down before them </v>

225
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.480
<v Speaker 2>and say you were right and they want me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

226
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.170
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm right.</v>

227
00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 2>I wrote it bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I know what I meant,</v>

228
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:59.050
<v Speaker 2>so you don't get to tell me what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>meant,</v>

229
00:11:59.080 --> 00:11:59.913
<v Speaker 2>but they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is they don't want to look at </v>

230
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:02.890
<v Speaker 2>it rationally and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

231
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:05.780
<v Speaker 2>here's a woman that has a history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental health problem.</v>

232
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.613
<v Speaker 2>She was on Ambien and drinking and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>says something that is slightly </v>

233
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:13.690
<v Speaker 2>irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but given your explanation of it,</v>

235
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.360

<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

236

<v Speaker 2>You have been saying that for fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>here since I went on twitter.</v>

239
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just don't get 'em.</v>

240
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:31.923
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe if I was in the same mindset as </v>

241
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:35.140
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would get them.</v>

242
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but obviously no one is.</v>

243
00:12:37.341 --> 00:12:38.174
<v Speaker 2>When I say crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they don't think like other </v>

244
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:41.164
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that I've always known that my </v>

245
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:46.720
<v Speaker 2>whole life I'd always test other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see what they were thinking like as even</v>

246
00:12:46.721 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Speaker 2>as a kid I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I try to fit in.</v>

247
00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:52.120

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

249
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

250
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:55.624
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's have Barbie be a resistance </v>

251
00:12:58.421 --> 00:13:01.640

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

252
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.740
<v Speaker 2>into the hidden lines of the German </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and save all the Jews.</v>

253
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.130
<v Speaker 2>And they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be her cousin skipper.</v>

254
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.023
<v Speaker 2>Then they'd hand me the skipper doll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always had to personify skipper and </v>

255
00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:16.800
<v Speaker 2>they got to be Barbie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know a Barbie.</v>

256
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Had a cousin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

257
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:18.904
<v Speaker 2>Skipper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has a little tiny tits and I </v>

258
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:26.920
<v Speaker 2>resented that because I always had very </v>
<v Speaker 2>large pendulous breasts since I was four</v>

259
00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:29.474
<v Speaker 2>or five.</v>

260
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.550
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

261
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't think or look like other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm an alien.</v>

262
00:13:37.991 --> 00:13:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What planet you think you'd be from?</v>

263
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

264
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:44.020
<v Speaker 2>somebody told me as from the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know anything about that?</v>

265
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the people that call the art bell</v>

266
00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:46.504
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would always say that they say </v>

267
00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 2>round faces are from Pat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see you got a round face.</v>

268
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:55.240
<v Speaker 2>That's what I told you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even go by what people look like</v>

269
00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:57.610
<v Speaker 2>except for I do look at the shape of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their head.</v>

270
00:13:57.611 --> 00:14:00.460
<v Speaker 2>I have to admit that's how I classify </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

271
00:14:00.461 --> 00:14:05.461
<v Speaker 2>I classified people my own way because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think like everybody else thinks I</v>

272
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:06.603
<v Speaker 2>take a person shape of their head and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that group they represent to me </v>

273
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:16.110
<v Speaker 2>and I have noticed that the Dutch have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the largest heads people,</v>

274
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.230
<v Speaker 2>the Dutch have pure score.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all of them of course,</v>

275
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.730
<v Speaker 2>but some of them you're the average </v>
<v Speaker 2>height for a Dutch person,</v>

276
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:28.470
<v Speaker 2>like six feet tall.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the imagination,</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all like that,</v>

293
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:12.854
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Misanthropic intentions or you have to </v>

294
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:16.514
<v Speaker 3>hate all people the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you definitely have to mock and </v>

295
00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:20.181
<v Speaker 3>make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

296
00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:24.200
<v Speaker 3>it's part of your job description to </v>
<v Speaker 3>mock and make fun of and you,</v>

297
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.870
<v Speaker 3>you look for things that are irritating </v>

<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

300
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:30.764
<v Speaker 3>that was part of your character on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>show was part of the reason why ABC </v>

301
00:15:33.471 --> 00:15:34.304
<v Speaker 3>wanted you back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's part of the reason why the show </v>

302
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 3>became such a giant hit and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>returned.</v>

303
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.923
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a fucking huge hit coming right </v>

304
00:15:40.401 --> 00:15:41.420
<v Speaker 3>out of the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

305

<v Speaker 3>Twenty 8 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of fucking panel number </v>

306
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.030
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every episode.</v>

307
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of people and a lot of that</v>

308
00:15:50.661 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 3>was because people love this aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

309
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.200
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as you get labeled a racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody throws their hands up.</v>

310
00:15:57.201 --> 00:15:57.861
<v Speaker 3>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

311
00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:00.290
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know she was racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's racist,</v>

312
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:04.550
<v Speaker 3>and they don't care about nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't care about the details.</v>

313
00:16:04.551 --> 00:16:06.950
<v Speaker 3>They don't care about ambien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't care about alcohol.</v>

314
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:07.843
<v Speaker 3>When I called you on the phone was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first thing that I think I've learned </v>

315
00:16:10.911 --> 00:16:12.500
<v Speaker 3>gel well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're gonna,</v>

316
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.850

<v Speaker 3>Not do not drink a beer.</v>

317
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.060
<v Speaker 3>Always only drink a wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

318

<v Speaker 3>covered in his own vomit with the </v>

322
00:16:31.311 --> 00:16:32.720

<v Speaker 3>standing over him,</v>

323
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.590
<v Speaker 3>asking him if he knew what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ended up getting arrested.</v>

324
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.513
<v Speaker 3>They brought him to the jail in Germany </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they add and he's a ceo of a large </v>

325
00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:46.010

<v Speaker 3>him and they said,</v>

00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:47.360
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you remember?</v>

327
00:16:47.361 --> 00:16:48.194
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

328
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.840

<v Speaker 3>then I went to sleep and then I had a,</v>

329
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.560
<v Speaker 3>I guess I had a beer at some point in </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and they go,</v>

331
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.090
<v Speaker 3>This is what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they described how he was hitting</v>

332
00:16:59.091 --> 00:16:59.924
<v Speaker 3>on the stewardesses and trying to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights with men in the cabin and wasn't </v>

333

<v Speaker 3>as being as real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Selfie was on.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's the nicest guy.</v>

335
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:11.624
<v Speaker 3>If you knew this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would never in a million years </v>

336
00:17:13.611 --> 00:17:17.810
<v Speaker 3>believed that he was capable of anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>remotely like this and the German people</v>

337
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.910
<v Speaker 3>actually let him stay in the country.</v>

338
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.250
<v Speaker 3>They let him continue his vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

00:17:24.351 --> 00:17:24.741
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

341
00:17:24.741 --> 00:17:26.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm never fucking taking that shit again</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my life,</v>

342
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.140
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things that I said to you</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I called you up,</v>

343
00:17:30.141 --> 00:17:32.500
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

348
00:17:43.731 --> 00:17:44.564
<v Speaker 3>friend of mine who literally made a meal</v>
<v Speaker 3>while he was on Ambien cooked at the </v>

349
00:17:47.991 --> 00:17:50.080
<v Speaker 3>supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what God</v>

350
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.990
<v Speaker 2>food look at Tiger Woods that he was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and then he'd go driving off in the</v>

351
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.050
<v Speaker 2>golf cart to meet some check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

352
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.190
<v Speaker 2>g and that I don't understand where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people said they had sex on Ambien.</v>

353
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.510
<v Speaker 2>People say that's a big thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people take ambien to have sex.</v>

354
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how they can stay at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess they don't stay awake,</v>

355
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:14.370
<v Speaker 2>but another part of them wakes up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their sex part comes out.</v>

356
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.750
<v Speaker 2>That's all I can figure.</v>

357
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.490
<v Speaker 3>I've never taken it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm terrified of the song ever take.</v>

358
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.041
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I've never had.</v>

361
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:22.860
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've been doing that and I,</v>

365
00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.770

<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

372
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.070
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see that today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see that?</v>

373

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

374
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had Hamilton Morris on the podcast who</v>

375
00:18:57.551 --> 00:19:01.900
<v Speaker 3>is a drug expert and he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He writes for advice and it does a piece</v>

376
00:19:01.901 --> 00:19:06.190
<v Speaker 3>for vice and he went into the advice </v>
<v Speaker 3>after your incident.</v>

377
00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:10.770
<v Speaker 3>He came on and went in great detail </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how that.</v>

378
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.510
<v Speaker 3>That is something that happens to people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were.</v>

379
00:19:13.511 --> 00:19:15.190
<v Speaker 3>They have no idea what the fuck they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

380
00:19:15.191 --> 00:19:18.370
<v Speaker 3>It's called a hypnotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the classification of drugs that</v>

381
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.223
<v Speaker 3>it falls under and people do all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of involuntary things when they're on </v>

382
00:19:22.511 --> 00:19:22.931
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

383
00:19:22.931 --> 00:19:25.180
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't just make you say racist </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

384
00:19:25.181 --> 00:19:27.880
<v Speaker 3>but you didn't say anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>intentionally racist.</v>

385
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.043
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

386
00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:35.410

<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

391
00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:53.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like the hundredth monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the thing?</v>

392
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Is that the name of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

393
00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.850
<v Speaker 2>100 monkey on the typewriter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They write up those monkeys.</v>

394
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.713
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that work that if you have a </v>

395
00:20:03.641 --> 00:20:04.474
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hundredth monkey that changes </v>

396
00:20:06.251 --> 00:20:07.220
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

397
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.350
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a,</v>

398
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.650
<v Speaker 2>if a species does something 99 times in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a row,</v>

399
00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.950
<v Speaker 2>the hundredth time it's gotten into </v>
<v Speaker 2>their DNA.</v>

400
00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

401
00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.550
<v Speaker 2>and then they evolve to the next level.</v>

402
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.200
<v Speaker 3>Hundredth monkey effect or just monkey </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect is a hypothetical phenomenon.</v>

403
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Which new behavior ideas co claim to </v>
<v Speaker 3>spread rapidly by unexplained means from</v>

404
00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:30.360
<v Speaker 3>one group to all related groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once a critical number of members of one</v>

405
00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:33.240
<v Speaker 3>group exhibit a new behavior or </v>
<v Speaker 3>acknowledged that new idea.</v>

406
00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

407
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Well the thing is a lot of people put </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures of that woman right next to the</v>

408
00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:41.510
<v Speaker 3>lady picture.</v>

409
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.690
<v Speaker 2>I understand the picture was put up </v>
<v Speaker 2>after my tweet.</v>

410
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.120
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I am not going to do with that.</v>

411
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.470
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say she looked like anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>real seriously.</v>

412
00:20:50.471 --> 00:20:52.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that fucking shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

413
00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:57.661
<v Speaker 2>I never talk about nobody's looks unless</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're thin and blonde and I'm jealous,</v>

414
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.980
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and youthful now but or whatever.</v>

415
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:08.160
<v Speaker 2>But wasn't there another tweet that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>made a long time ago about?</v>

416
00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Who was that other woman?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Susan Rice?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Let me explain that now because this is </v>

419
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:19.684
<v Speaker 2>the regional listic regionalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from Utah and all the girls in Utah </v>

420
00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:29.350
<v Speaker 2>when we got married and are we heard our</v>
<v Speaker 2>moms do it too.</v>

421
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.300
<v Speaker 2>It's always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's your ape?</v>

<v Speaker 2>is all,</v>

427
00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.750
<v Speaker 2>all of the men were all apes.</v>

428
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.680
<v Speaker 2>That's how it is in a breeder culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Salt Lake City,</v>

429
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:49.480
<v Speaker 2>breeder cheerleader culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

430
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:51.260
<v Speaker 2>where's your ape?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And was like,</v>

431
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.173
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a passive big fucking swing and </v>

432
00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:55.390
<v Speaker 2>eight balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give them that,</v>

433
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a regional,</v>

434
00:21:56.621 --> 00:21:59.770
<v Speaker 2>holistic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

435
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I used it and apologize,</v>

436
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.230
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't realize,</v>

437
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just sometimes forget what race </v>

438
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:12.130
<v Speaker 2>everybody is as if I could tell half the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time anyway,</v>

439
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.370
<v Speaker 2>I can't even see people that tell you </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth.</v>

440
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:16.563
<v Speaker 2>I need like bifocals trifocals and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>never identified other human beings by </v>

441
00:22:21.611 --> 00:22:22.444
<v Speaker 2>what they looked like for God's sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just could tell if I felt a liking to </v>

442
00:22:25.871 --> 00:22:26.704
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

443
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:27.643
<v Speaker 2>whatever they looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Point is the only two things over the </v>

444
00:22:31.451 --> 00:22:34.330
<v Speaker 2>course of thousands of don't mess my </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

445
00:22:34.331 --> 00:22:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Susan Rice,</v>

446
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:41.610
<v Speaker 2>let's say that she has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has incredible audacity.</v>

447
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.640
<v Speaker 2>That's what I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she does.</v>

448
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.070
<v Speaker 2>But you didn't mean it in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>complimentary way.</v>

449
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.800
<v Speaker 2>If someone is audacious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that negative or positive?</v>

450
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.200
<v Speaker 2>You weren't you talking about her in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative way though?</v>

451
00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.010
<v Speaker 2>I said she has a lot of audacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I meant.</v>

452
00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:03.683
<v Speaker 2>She does whatever it was that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was one that got brought up as </v>

453
00:23:09.301 --> 00:23:10.134
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was also in the middle of a huge </v>

454
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.670
<v Speaker 2>conversation about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>painful.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well definitely shouldn't be reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't read it.</v>

464
00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.850
<v Speaker 2>But um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

465
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 2>when</v>

466
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.780
<v Speaker 3>you become a target,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you know if you don't read it?</v>

467
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.143
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I've lived through when it </v>

468
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.920
<v Speaker 2>first happened and that's been like four</v>
<v Speaker 2>or so months ago,</v>

469
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.980
<v Speaker 2>so I just know how I've reacted in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>real life since that happened to me.</v>

470
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.160
<v Speaker 2>How long for things die off to die off?</v>

471
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.310
<v Speaker 3>What do you slow down where they weren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>just coming after you constantly,</v>

472
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.833
<v Speaker 3>like I told you that news crews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they found out that you were going </v>

473
00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:14.120
<v Speaker 3>to come on the podcast the first time </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to show up at my house,</v>

474
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:15.920
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to show up at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>studio.</v>

475
00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:17.810
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to find me at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy store.</v>

476
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were just trying to hunt </v>
<v Speaker 3>down anything about you.</v>

477
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.633
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm snake and segues from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend because we were at my mom's </v>

478
00:24:26.761 --> 00:24:27.594
<v Speaker 2>house when I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what we were at home in Salt </v>

479
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Lake City when I tweeted at 2:11</v>
<v Speaker 2>AM.</v>

480
00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.750
<v Speaker 2>I just woke up and I had this thought in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my head,</v>

481
00:24:36.751 --> 00:24:38.850
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this can make so much sense.</v>

482
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:41.443
<v Speaker 2>And then I tweeted it and I went right </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to sleep and when I woke up at </v>

483
00:24:44.431 --> 00:24:46.170
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit had hit the fan,</v>

484
00:24:46.171 --> 00:24:47.290
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

485
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.740
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to expound on this later.</v>

486
00:24:49.741 --> 00:24:51.340
<v Speaker 2>That was one of those kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

487
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.890
<v Speaker 2>You just want to get it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

488
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always slept with my computer and tweet.</v>

489
00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.670
<v Speaker 2>When I wake up like one year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go to the bathroom a lot.</v>

490
00:24:59.671 --> 00:25:01.290
<v Speaker 2>So I always tweet and fall back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>

491
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.170
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on the ambient tweets,</v>

492
00:25:04.171 --> 00:25:05.610
<v Speaker 2>my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to always,</v>

493
00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:09.060
<v Speaker 2>when I took my Ambien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call my daughter and she or she called</v>

494
00:25:09.061 --> 00:25:09.750
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

495
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:10.240
<v Speaker 2>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

496
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.930
<v Speaker 2>you're starting to do the Ambien tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get off,</v>

497
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.340

<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

498
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.220

<v Speaker 2>I saw,</v>

499
00:25:16.221 --> 00:25:18.330
<v Speaker 2>I just called my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then every night when I,</v>

500
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.660
<v Speaker 2>when I was doing the Ambien and I'd go,</v>

502
00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Here comes a big fish right through my </v>
<v Speaker 2>window.</v>

524
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.553
<v Speaker 2>social justice warrior types.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what did they think about your </v>

525
00:26:20.021 --> 00:26:23.070
<v Speaker 2>position as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think I'm a frigging correct.</v>

526
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.280
<v Speaker 2>They think I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always did like,</v>

527
00:26:26.281 --> 00:26:27.114
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always thought all my choice for </v>

528
00:26:29.111 --> 00:26:29.944
<v Speaker 2>president were crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then oddly they were all very </v>

529
00:26:33.611 --> 00:26:37.690
<v Speaker 2>supportive when I personally ran for </v>
<v Speaker 2>president in 2012.</v>

530
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.050
<v Speaker 2>They were really supportive of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're their mom.</v>

531
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was cool.</v>

532
00:26:42.401 --> 00:26:45.180

<v Speaker 2>Oh god,</v>

533
00:26:45.181 --> 00:26:47.580
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your generation.</v>

534
00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:51.120
<v Speaker 2>The baby boomers are the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is all fucked up.</v>

535
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.550
<v Speaker 2>So stop letting yourself pop back up.</v>

536
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.690
<v Speaker 3>Conversations in the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Household.</v>

<v Speaker 3>brought into a mental hospital,</v>

540
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:05.993
<v Speaker 3>what was it about?</v>

541
00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had got hit by a car and the,</v>

542
00:27:10.331 --> 00:27:13.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hood ornament went in my head and my</v>

543
00:27:13.481 --> 00:27:18.481
<v Speaker 2>brains and scramble them and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to be an a plus math student.</v>

544
00:27:20.141 --> 00:27:23.170
<v Speaker 2>I was just great in geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

545
00:27:23.171 --> 00:27:28.171
<v Speaker 2>I loved geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got straight a's and then,</v>

546
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of fell apart after that.</v>

547
00:27:30.071 --> 00:27:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Took a long time to heal from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>traumatic head injuries now because I do</v>

552
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.290
<v Speaker 2>read a lot and talked to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>football players who have the same thing</v>

553
00:27:47.291 --> 00:27:49.540
<v Speaker 2>and we do discuss it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but it's like a,</v>

556
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.350
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like an artel artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

557
00:27:57.351 --> 00:27:58.184
<v Speaker 3>You do you find that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you find that you became much more </v>

558
00:28:00.891 --> 00:28:01.724
<v Speaker 3>impulsive?</v>

559

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

561
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.033
<v Speaker 2>Here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was crossing the street on my way to </v>

562
00:28:11.411 --> 00:28:12.610
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old were you?</v>

563
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.800
<v Speaker 2>I was 16.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

564
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:17.634
<v Speaker 2>it's 15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go on to first week of high school and </v>

565
00:28:25.161 --> 00:28:30.161
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a big nerd and anyway,</v>

566
00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was crossing the street and it was a top</v>

567
00:28:35.901 --> 00:28:40.310
<v Speaker 2>of the hill and this woman girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was on her way to the university and</v>

568
00:28:40.311 --> 00:28:45.311
<v Speaker 2>the sun blinded her and she ran me over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

569
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.690
<v Speaker 3>the rest is history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

570
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.520
<v Speaker 3>how long were you in the hospital for </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]?</v>

571
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.910
<v Speaker 3>So first you must have been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must have been in a medical hospital</v>

572
00:28:56.911 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 3>first and then you were admitted to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mental hospital after about three months</v>

573
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:02.360
<v Speaker 3>in between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

574
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.320
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was in the hospital for awhile,</v>

575
00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.173
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

576
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:07.243
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a head concussion and a brain </v>

577
00:29:08.781 --> 00:29:13.540
<v Speaker 2>concussion and I had hamburger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat for legs.</v>

578
00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:15.450
<v Speaker 2>So they did all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

579
00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.330
<v Speaker 2>what do they call them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Skin grafts on my legs.</v>

580
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:24.560
<v Speaker 2>A and m?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

581
00:29:25.761 --> 00:29:26.594
<v Speaker 2>I was in there for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I came out of there and I had </v>

582
00:29:29.211 --> 00:29:30.044
<v Speaker 2>forgotten everything about math when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>returned to school where it's a matter </v>

583
00:29:33.981 --> 00:29:36.510
<v Speaker 2>of weeks after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe two months.</v>

584
00:29:36.511 --> 00:29:39.440
<v Speaker 2>So I'm really bad on time now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

585
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 1>and I had forgotten all my math and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just terrible.</v>

586
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:49.530
<v Speaker 1>That was a big depressive depression I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went into because I couldn't remember.</v>

587
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't remember things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

588
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.650
<v Speaker 1>And also I became way more impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I was like,</v>

589
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:57.663
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I started going really out there </v>

590
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.360
<v Speaker 1>into the ethers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went way out there.</v>

591
00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Like how so way out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:30:07.061 --> 00:30:09.160
<v Speaker 1>how you go way out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever go away out?</v>

593
00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a lot of head injuries.</v>

594
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been but not terrible.</v>

595
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.383
<v Speaker 1>Mostly just punches and kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothin like car accidents or never </v>

596
00:30:21.071 --> 00:30:24.340
<v Speaker 1>played football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my head injuries have,</v>

597
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:25.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were just more of a cumulative </v>

598
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.570
<v Speaker 1>when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until I was about 21,</v>

599
00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:29.620
<v Speaker 1>22.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped,</v>

600
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.900
<v Speaker 1>stopped fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop sparring,</v>

601
00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.380
<v Speaker 3>but nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

602
00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:36.260
<v Speaker 3>definitely</v>

603
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm subject to impulsive behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stealing.</v>

604
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I can't keep it under wraps.</v>

605
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.210
<v Speaker 3>I keep it under control because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>aware of it.</v>

606
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.550
<v Speaker 3>But when I was younger I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what was going on.</v>

607
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:49.540
<v Speaker 3>I would just be subject to whims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very addictive behavior.</v>

608
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.960
<v Speaker 3>But I've tried to keep it positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would be addicted to things,</v>

609
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.920
<v Speaker 3>addicted to doing things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted to games,</v>

610
00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.160
<v Speaker 3>addicted like ridiculously addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like spend 10,</v>

611
00:31:00.161 --> 00:31:02.410
<v Speaker 3>12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>14 hours a day playing video games.</v>

612
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.330
<v Speaker 3>That kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Kid.</v>

613
00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:05.283
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's just normal because video </v>

614
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:08.660
<v Speaker 3>games are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

615
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.020
<v Speaker 3>it would be for me to be everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts,</v>

616
00:31:11.021 --> 00:31:11.854
<v Speaker 3>pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever do is I'll just be completely </v>

617
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:14.164
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with it and be thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it all day in port where it wasn't </v>

618
00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:18.064
<v Speaker 3>necessarily healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just on a whim I would just want to </v>

619
00:31:20.081 --> 00:31:21.150
<v Speaker 3>go do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

620
00:31:21.151 --> 00:31:24.250
<v Speaker 3>I almost had no control over </v>
<v Speaker 3>compulsion's,</v>

621
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think some of that is it.</v>

622
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.053
<v Speaker 3>Whatever brain injuries that I've had </v>
<v Speaker 3>are very mild in comparison to a lot of </v>

623
00:31:31.331 --> 00:31:32.164
<v Speaker 3>people that I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly very mild in comparison to </v>

624
00:31:34.421 --> 00:31:35.254
<v Speaker 3>yours.</v>

625
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:38.810
<v Speaker 1>But there was a lot of trauma in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state hospital that,</v>

626
00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

627
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:45.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being there and seeing and experiencing.</v>

628
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.010
<v Speaker 1>And how long did that for nine months.</v>

629
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.470
<v Speaker 3>So what was it that they brought you in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there for?</v>

630
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.453
<v Speaker 3>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how were you behaving that they decided </v>

631
00:31:56.171 --> 00:31:57.220
<v Speaker 3>that you needed to be admitted?</v>

632
00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.540
<v Speaker 1>I was out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say that like,</v>

633
00:32:01.541 --> 00:32:02.374
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

634
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:04.443
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

635
00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:10.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The English you just can't understand,</v>

636
00:32:10.981 --> 00:32:11.814
<v Speaker 1>didn't have a control of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't have control of your </v>

637
00:32:14.611 --> 00:32:16.920
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your thinking was screwed up.</v>

638
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.310
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

639
00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.413
<v Speaker 1>not thinking like the normal thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say you should be thinking about </v>

640
00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:25.560
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people round you had realized it,</v>

641
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:28.670
<v Speaker 3>that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so bad that they had to admit you</v>

642
00:32:28.671 --> 00:32:30.300
<v Speaker 3>to a hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just A.</v>

643
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rosanne.</v>

644
00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.660
<v Speaker 3>She's eccentric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

645
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:33.523
<v Speaker 3>She needs</v>

646
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.190
<v Speaker 1>actual medical help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

647
00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I asked to be admitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you knew something was really wrong?</v>

648
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:40.060
<v Speaker 1>She</v>

649
00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:40.893
<v Speaker 3>finally admitted it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you know at the time were you </v>

650
00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.640
<v Speaker 3>completely aware that it was connected </v>
<v Speaker 3>to your car accident?</v>

651
00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

652
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.230
<v Speaker 3>You just knew something was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

653
00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:52.853
<v Speaker 3>And back then they didn't really kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that the way they understand </v>

654
00:32:55.921 --> 00:32:56.754
<v Speaker 3>it now,</v>

655
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.943
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't understand too much about </v>

656
00:32:59.121 --> 00:33:04.121
<v Speaker 2>bipolar disorder or they knew nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about multiple personality disorder.</v>

657
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Trauma related trauma related.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

658
00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:10.310

<v Speaker 2>now they call everything pts.</v>

659
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even say d anymore.</v>

660
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.690
<v Speaker 2>They say pts post traumatic stress.</v>

661
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.560
<v Speaker 3>So when they admitted you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the treatment like?</v>

662
00:33:21.561 --> 00:33:24.050
<v Speaker 3>What did they do to you when you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside the mental hospital?</v>

663
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:27.793
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they right away put me on an anti </v>

664

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

702
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just always,</v>

703
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.050
<v Speaker 2>I never questioned that there was danger</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>

704
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I always got in trouble,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the head nurse.</v>

709
00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:26.640
<v Speaker 2>I hated her because she told me I needed</v>
<v Speaker 2>a baby.</v>

710
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:30.350
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell that story later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was horrifying.</v>

711
00:35:30.351 --> 00:35:31.760
<v Speaker 2>It changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

712
00:35:31.761 --> 00:35:32.594
<v Speaker 2>so they all go to dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go in there and steal the keys out </v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

723
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:19.660
<v Speaker 2>chunky because they consider me to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>

724
00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

727
00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:37.220
<v Speaker 2>15 about eight minutes into it I </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized,</v>

728
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit,</v>

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.053
<v Speaker 2>something's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how long it always took me to </v>

730
00:36:47.211 --> 00:36:49.970
<v Speaker 2>like zero in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on what's happening because I'm not even</v>

731
00:36:49.971 --> 00:36:50.990
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

732
00:36:50.991 --> 00:36:53.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm always ignoring when other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk.</v>

733
00:36:53.061 --> 00:36:57.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

734
00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:02.120
<v Speaker 2>So I'm always in my own head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never get out really except for when I</v>

735
00:37:02.121 --> 00:37:03.770
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

736
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.770
<v Speaker 2>so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it got done.</v>

737
00:37:06.771 --> 00:37:07.630
<v Speaker 2>It took a turn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

740
00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:20.060
<v Speaker 2>I had to ask it because she kept on </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting me there to that point where she</v>

741
00:37:20.061 --> 00:37:23.150
<v Speaker 2>wanted me to ask it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to delay it,</v>

742
00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I knew they'd be back in 40 </v>

743
00:37:25.191 --> 00:37:29.540
<v Speaker 2>minutes and it was like going on 20 now </v>
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I got to do margin.</v>

745
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:38.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm in here because I broke a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>attendants backs and they tell you that.</v>

748
00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:49.920
<v Speaker 2>And then my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>

<v Speaker 2>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to think them to think I </v>

817
00:40:57.341 --> 00:40:58.174
<v Speaker 2>was schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew enough not to let them near me </v>

818
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:02.650
<v Speaker 2>that if [inaudible] once you got the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

819
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:07.680
<v Speaker 2>once you got the diagnosis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia they would just shocks and</v>

820
00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.300
<v Speaker 2>they experiment on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're basically,</v>

821
00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 2>you're in Guinea pig and I didn't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

822
00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.070
<v Speaker 2>so maybe I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

823
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.540
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

824
00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:17.374
<v Speaker 2>I was doing weird things like walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the middle of streets after I hit </v>

825
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:23.350
<v Speaker 2>by the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walked down the middle of the streets.</v>

826
00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:24.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

827
00:41:24.311 --> 00:41:25.144
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get over your fear of </v>

828
00:41:25.721 --> 00:41:28.360
<v Speaker 2>crossing the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what was in my head.</v>

829
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.730
<v Speaker 2>And then I'd walk down the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

830
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:33.943
<v Speaker 2>I was in a whole other realm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a real surrealistic and </v>

831
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:40.940
<v Speaker 2>metaphysical realm and I grew </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable there.</v>

832
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:41.774
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

833
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:42.643
<v Speaker 2>I think most artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writers and performers are in that </v>

834
00:41:45.441 --> 00:41:46.610
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

835
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:50.480
<v Speaker 2>we've got a toe in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least I've gone in and out,</v>

836
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:51.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on,</v>

837
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:53.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I think I'm on the right </v>

838
00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:55.820
<v Speaker 2>medications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That helped me.</v>

839
00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:57.853
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of comedians that have </v>

840
00:41:59.461 --> 00:42:00.850
<v Speaker 3>similar stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

841
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.340
<v Speaker 3>some of the grades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

842
00:42:02.341 --> 00:42:04.120
<v Speaker 3>Kinison as a similar story to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

843
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.950
<v Speaker 3>he was hit by a car and change changes </v>
<v Speaker 3>personality radically.</v>

844
00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:11.490
<v Speaker 3>And it happened in a similar age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happened when he was young as well.</v>

845
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.760
<v Speaker 3>And he was one person and then you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit by a car.</v>

846
00:42:14.761 --> 00:42:16.410
<v Speaker 3>And then after the car he was just wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

847
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:18.370
<v Speaker 3>Wild didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

848
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:19.400
<v Speaker 3>totally impulsive,</v>

849
00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:22.360
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't give a fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just thought different,</v>

850
00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.350
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

851
00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:24.430
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

852
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom says when I was 18 months old,</v>

853
00:42:28.991 --> 00:42:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I used to go out in the street and </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct cars.</v>

854
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:35.010
<v Speaker 2>We lived on a highway and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

855
00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:35.830
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

856
00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:37.990
<v Speaker 2>she'd come and find me there just 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

857
00:42:37.991 --> 00:42:39.940
<v Speaker 2>All the holding up my hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

858
00:42:39.941 --> 00:42:40.774
<v Speaker 2>stop in traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always had a weird thing going </v>

859
00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.620
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

860
00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

861
00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:50.170
<v Speaker 2>I think I watched too much of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>police show,</v>

862
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they'd stopped traffic.</v>

863
00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:57.220
<v Speaker 2>I used to love TV shows and think they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were real.</v>

864
00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.133
<v Speaker 3>Some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how many people do you think know </v>

865
00:43:00.851 --> 00:43:05.440
<v Speaker 3>this about your mental health history?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

866
00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.393
<v Speaker 3>anybody who knows me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think very many people know </v>

867
00:43:08.131 --> 00:43:09.070
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're angry you.</v>

868
00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:11.043
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>

869
00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

870
00:43:12.851 --> 00:43:13.684
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people look past the </v>

871
00:43:15.101 --> 00:43:15.934
<v Speaker 3>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they looked at you as a rich </v>

872
00:43:17.141 --> 00:43:21.250
<v Speaker 3>white lady who said something that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered to be racist and they decided</v>

873
00:43:21.251 --> 00:43:23.890
<v Speaker 3>they were going to attack you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the perception,</v>

874
00:43:23.891 --> 00:43:26.920
<v Speaker 3>the optics of this is the reason why ABC</v>
<v Speaker 3>canceled the show.</v>

875
00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:28.450
<v Speaker 3>The reason why was ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

876
00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

877
00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:30.003
<v Speaker 3>It's the reason why they canceled the </v>
<v Speaker 3>show is the reason why everybody pulled </v>

878
00:43:32.441 --> 00:43:33.274
<v Speaker 3>back away from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what did that feel like when nobody </v>

879
00:43:36.431 --> 00:43:37.264
<v Speaker 3>defended you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who should know you the way I </v>

880
00:43:38.801 --> 00:43:42.820
<v Speaker 3>know you and I defended you from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>very beginning because I said,</v>

881
00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.480
<v Speaker 3>look at my son told me I might.</v>

882
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not a racist person.</v>

883
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.230
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a woman who's kinda crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>

885

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

886
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:56.170
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the reasons why I love </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

887
00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:57.161
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

888
00:43:57.161 --> 00:43:59.320

<v Speaker 3>That's what I.</v>

889
00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Well I was surprised that more comics </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't say nothing because you know,</v>

890
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:05.200
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

891
00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.970
<v Speaker 3>they're scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are scared.</v>

892
00:44:06.971 --> 00:44:10.180
<v Speaker 3>They're scared to support someone that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they considered to be racist,</v>

893
00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:11.073
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

896
00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.830
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think what they want and call </v>

920
00:45:22.811 --> 00:45:23.644
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll get wrapped up in conflict and </v>

<v Speaker 3>you'll just be involved in it every </v>
<v Speaker 3>minute of every day.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

926
00:45:35.441 --> 00:45:36.274
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely a strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange environment where all these </v>

927
00:45:39.051 --> 00:45:42.580
<v Speaker 3>people are just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't even know you.</v>

928
00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:43.443
<v Speaker 3>They have no contact with you other than</v>
<v Speaker 3>your this person they could reach and </v>

929
00:45:46.421 --> 00:45:47.254
<v Speaker 3>get to react to certain lines and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>more explosive and the more derogatory </v>

930
00:45:54.401 --> 00:45:55.234
<v Speaker 3>and insulting the lines they say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more impact it's gonna have on you </v>

931
00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.250
<v Speaker 3>so that flavors the way they communicate</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>

932
00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:01.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

933
00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:02.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

934
00:46:02.201 --> 00:46:06.070
<v Speaker 2>It was tough working with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social justice warriors and remake.</v>

935
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
<v Speaker 2>It was tough on me mentally.</v>

936
00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.060
<v Speaker 3>So when you mean like the staff that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were working</v>

937
00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:13.711
<v Speaker 2>with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luck.</v>

938
00:46:13.711 --> 00:46:18.711
<v Speaker 2>I was the only one saying I'm not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican.</v>

939
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:19.883
<v Speaker 2>Dora my fucking Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an independent and I'm just </v>

940
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:28.230
<v Speaker 2>anticorruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just anticorruption don't,</v>

941
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:33.510
<v Speaker 2>don't make me into what your idea of who</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

942
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:35.770
<v Speaker 2>What was that idea who you were and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

943
00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.060
<v Speaker 2>they thought that since I supported </v>
<v Speaker 2>president trump or that I was,</v>

944
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a racist and a scumbag and you know,</v>

945
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.720
<v Speaker 2>anti everything just because I voted for</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

946
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Why did you support trump?</v>

947
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I love what Norm Macdonald said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I can quote him,</v>

948
00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.280
<v Speaker 2>can I quote says it better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

949
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.863
<v Speaker 2>He said the American people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hated hillary so bad that they voted </v>

950
00:47:07.011 --> 00:47:09.320
<v Speaker 2>for a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hate it even worse.</v>

951
00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Just don't rub it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is normal Mcdonald.</v>

952
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.080
<v Speaker 2>That's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

953
00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:22.520
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>

954
00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:26.270
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't for Hillary and I was a woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was like a big.</v>

955
00:47:26.271 --> 00:47:26.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

956
00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:31.240
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Alec basically down to because it</v>

957
00:47:31.241 --> 00:47:33.100
<v Speaker 2>was a woman's turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

958
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:33.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

959
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:34.743
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want a government that works for </v>

960
00:47:36.581 --> 00:47:38.220
<v Speaker 2>the American people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ta.</v>

961
00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.740
<v Speaker 2>I pay taxes and I expect something for </v>
<v Speaker 2>my taxes and,</v>

962
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's news to all of them out there,</v>

963
00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:47.100
<v Speaker 2>including poultice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

964
00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:51.550
<v Speaker 2>I think at some time the American people</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to audit what happened to their tax</v>

965
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:52.384
<v Speaker 2>monies and I think we should all have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>say in what this country does with our </v>

966
00:47:56.141 --> 00:47:58.640
<v Speaker 2>hard earned dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

967
00:47:59.020 --> 00:47:59.853
<v Speaker 2>don't just assume you speak for us </v>
<v Speaker 2>because obviously you don't or we </v>

968
00:48:03.551 --> 00:48:08.100
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have a trade deficit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>$20,000,000,000,000.</v>

969
00:48:08.101 --> 00:48:11.730
<v Speaker 2>So stfu and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

970
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:16.300
<v Speaker 2>let the American people handle what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>should handle in this country.</v>

971
00:48:16.301 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a republic and it's a runs on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

972
00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.500
<v Speaker 2>on the consent of the governed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really,</v>

973
00:48:23.501 --> 00:48:25.300
<v Speaker 2>really time to talk about that</v>

974
00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:26.653
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you say social justice warriors </v>

975
00:48:28.311 --> 00:48:29.144
<v Speaker 3>that you had to work with specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were the issues that you were </v>

976
00:48:30.951 --> 00:48:31.784
<v Speaker 3>dealing with?</v>

977
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump was the big elephant in the room.</v>

978
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.310
<v Speaker 2>My support for trump and they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're patronized.</v>

979
00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Scheidt can I call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

980
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:48.480
<v Speaker 2>well we have to remember that the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm going to paraphrase,</v>

981
00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.010
<v Speaker 2>but it was a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

982
00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:50.873
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ignorant unwashed people who voted </v>

983
00:48:53.221 --> 00:48:55.170
<v Speaker 2>for trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not their fault.</v>

984
00:48:55.710 --> 00:49:00.710
<v Speaker 2>That was Kinda what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

985
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:02.911
<v Speaker 2>because I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

986
00:49:02.911 --> 00:49:04.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was working class people that elected</v>

987
00:49:04.951 --> 00:49:05.950
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

988
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:07.343
<v Speaker 2>I really can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't let you say that to me because </v>

989
00:49:10.651 --> 00:49:12.590
<v Speaker 2>it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

990
00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.940
<v Speaker 2>they already had in their head what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

991
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:16.103
<v Speaker 2>And of course they are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're wrong about this being </v>

992
00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:22.300
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

993
00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:26.910
<v Speaker 2>the cabinet being about abortion rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>or wrong about that too.</v>

994
00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:29.200
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

995
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.530
<v Speaker 2>they're wrong about that because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

996
00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said pretty much that,</v>

997
00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't overturn something that's in </v>

998
00:49:35.311 --> 00:49:38.180
<v Speaker 2>law Roe versus Wade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

999
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.863
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fear mongered to get everybody </v>

1000
00:49:41.221 --> 00:49:45.150
<v Speaker 2>thinking that's what they were after and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is what they were.</v>

1001
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:47.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that is why they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1002
00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I think they're concerned with anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that trump is trying to pass</v>

1003
00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.520
<v Speaker 3>anyone that trump's trying to get to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>supreme court in any bills</v>

1004
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:55.363
<v Speaker 2>they should put on their adult pants and</v>
<v Speaker 2>get involved and make sure that he </v>

1005
00:50:01.591 --> 00:50:03.120
<v Speaker 2>represents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1006
00:50:03.121 --> 00:50:03.954
<v Speaker 2>the will of the people of this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to become involved in the </v>

1007
00:50:07.381 --> 00:50:08.214
<v Speaker 2>process then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't just sit there on your butt </v>

1008
00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.520
<v Speaker 2>criticized and everybody and calling </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody names that,</v>

1009
00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.800
<v Speaker 2>that's really not any kind of a justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>warrior.</v>

1010
00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:20.430
<v Speaker 2>That's all phony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get involved right</v>

1011
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:21.433
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you were first approached about </v>

1012
00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 3>doing a Rosanne,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the relaunch,</v>

1013
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:29.413
<v Speaker 3>when they came to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did this all take place and did you </v>

1014
00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:32.840
<v Speaker 3>get to pick the people that you work </v>
<v Speaker 3>with?</v>

1015
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had already said about a year prior to</v>

1016
00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:43.640
<v Speaker 2>that that I supported trump over </v>
<v Speaker 2>hillary.</v>

1017
00:50:43.641 --> 00:50:45.050
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1018
00:50:45.051 --> 00:50:48.230
<v Speaker 2>a big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in all the papers in Hollywood,</v>

1019
00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:50.030
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could she and,</v>

1020
00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:51.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and that and the other,</v>

1021
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:56.630
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't seem to bother the </v>
<v Speaker 2>American people outside of my audience.</v>

1022
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1023
00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.570
<v Speaker 2>I always try to make content for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>

1024
00:50:59.571 --> 00:51:01.350
<v Speaker 2>not for the critics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1025
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.610
<v Speaker 2>And enough for the industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not for the industry.</v>

1026
00:51:04.611 --> 00:51:05.444
<v Speaker 2>Now the industry is ruthlessly left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to the point where it's not even a </v>

1027
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:09.530
<v Speaker 2>thinking thing.</v>

1028
00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:10.643
<v Speaker 3>It's just like they automatically go </v>
<v Speaker 3>left because that's the way you're </v>

1029
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.490
<v Speaker 3>accepted in this town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the way you stay working.</v>

1030
00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:19.920
<v Speaker 3>That's the way you stay invited to all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1031
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:24.640
<v Speaker 2>That's the way that certain Stalinist </v>
<v Speaker 2>types in show business.</v>

1032
00:51:24.641 --> 00:51:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1033
00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1034
00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:32.170
<v Speaker 2>everything about the media is tightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled in Hollywood.</v>

1035
00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:35.020
<v Speaker 2>So when they came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who came to you with the relaunch?</v>

1036
00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:37.390
<v Speaker 2>How did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how like how does it happen?</v>

1037
00:51:37.391 --> 00:51:38.224
<v Speaker 2>That was an era where they did a sketch </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Sarah's talk show and everyone liked </v>

1038
00:51:44.771 --> 00:51:48.780
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Sarah called me and said,</v>

1039
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:50.550
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John said he's in,</v>

1040
00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:51.770
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1041
00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:56.780
<v Speaker 2>if you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you say Johnson of course is Lori.</v>

1042
00:51:58.740 --> 00:51:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lori's in.</v>

1043
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:00.691
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1044
00:52:00.691 --> 00:52:01.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>

1045
00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.870
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who turned on you after this was over</v>

1046
00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:11.860
<v Speaker 2>while I'm my covenant of lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Advisors.</v>

1047
00:52:11.861 --> 00:52:14.100
<v Speaker 2>I not get into this at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1048
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:15.343
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's self explanatory where </v>

1049
00:52:16.991 --> 00:52:18.200
<v Speaker 2>people could find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1050
00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that they turned on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was always that way since,</v>

1051
00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came in and said,</v>

1052
00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:26.613
<v Speaker 2>I said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody on the show has to be a trump </v>

1053
00:52:28.631 --> 00:52:30.070
<v Speaker 2>supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of them would do it.</v>

1054
00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:35.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great role.</v>

1055
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:37.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do it.</v>

1056
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.510
<v Speaker 2>You're the kind of person who wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

1057
00:52:40.511 --> 00:52:41.950
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>

1058
00:52:41.951 --> 00:52:43.840
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then I'll do it because,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the history of sitcoms.</v>

1062

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1089
00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:09.723
<v Speaker 2>They felt it would go against their </v>
<v Speaker 2>morals to say that there's another way </v>

1090
00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:15.184
<v Speaker 2>to vote or to acknowledge that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half the country voted that way or that </v>

1091
00:54:20.561 --> 00:54:23.230
<v Speaker 2>she's extremely flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1092
00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.050
<v Speaker 2>that point they didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's weird about it,</v>

1093
00:54:26.110 --> 00:54:26.943
<v Speaker 2>isn't that the whole thing's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a complete denial of reality </v>

1094
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:31.210
<v Speaker 2>like this is not.</v>

1095
00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:33.880
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing to do with women as </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with liberals.</v>

1096
00:54:33.881 --> 00:54:36.430
<v Speaker 2>That is another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about an extremely flawed</v>

1097
00:54:36.431 --> 00:54:37.790
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1099
00:54:39.821 --> 00:54:40.654
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just talk about her concepts and her </v>

1100
00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:44.770
<v Speaker 2>voting record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even use the word person,</v>

1101
00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:45.723
<v Speaker 2>politician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Extremely flawed politician with a </v>

1102
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:54.620
<v Speaker 2>background of deep corruption and lies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Demonstratable lies like this.</v>

1103
00:54:56.261 --> 00:54:59.110
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about some amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>gem,</v>

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:02.140
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>A lot of us people who liked Bernie </v>

1106
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.890
<v Speaker 2>voted for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1107
00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:14.193
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when they found out when </v>

1109
00:55:15.281 --> 00:55:16.114
<v Speaker 2>Donna Brazile's book came out and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>found out what they had done to Bernie </v>

1110
00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.800
<v Speaker 2>during the primaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Whatever they said,</v>

1114
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:30.850
<v Speaker 2>nobody will vote for a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd use that one.</v>

1115
00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.020
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious in the cell to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this day,</v>

1116
00:55:35.021 --> 00:55:36.460

<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1117
00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:37.630
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1118
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:39.670
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want her even though she is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>

1119
00:55:39.671 --> 00:55:41.090
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1120
00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I did want her in 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to her,</v>

1121
00:55:44.231 --> 00:55:45.064
<v Speaker 2>not Obama because I liked her healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 2>plan better at that time when I was </v>

1122
00:55:49.451 --> 00:55:50.284
<v Speaker 2>still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1123
00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:53.950

<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>youth.</v>

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:09.653
<v Speaker 2>And what's the ID number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty seven that the cross from the </v>

1130
00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:14.043
<v Speaker 2>White House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to walk from the DNC to </v>

1131
00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:16.204
<v Speaker 2>that park there and make statements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but walking away to wear to an </v>

1132
00:56:19.931 --> 00:56:22.710
<v Speaker 2>independent party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrian.</v>

1133
00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:24.370
<v Speaker 2>They're going Republican,</v>

1134
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's bizarre.</v>

1135
00:56:26.831 --> 00:56:28.930
<v Speaker 3>The polar opposites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right and the left,</v>

1136
00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:29.770
<v Speaker 3>the blue and the red</v>

1137
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.790
<v Speaker 2>and all those guys golf together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get to cut through the bullshit.</v>

1138
00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:36.100
<v Speaker 2>They're all making deals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And scratching each other's back,</v>

1139
00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:39.340
<v Speaker 2>whether from one party or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

1140
00:56:39.341 --> 00:56:40.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump</v>

1141
00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:43.260
<v Speaker 3>paid Clinton to be at his wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did?</v>

1142
00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1143
00:56:44.461 --> 00:56:48.260
<v Speaker 3>that's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got a photo op and a half out of that</v>

1144
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:49.440
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1145
00:56:49.441 --> 00:56:52.160
<v Speaker 3>he paid those people forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons why when,</v>

1146
00:56:52.161 --> 00:56:52.994
<v Speaker 3>when he was campaigning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had so much animosity towards them </v>

1147
00:56:57.330 --> 00:57:00.210
<v Speaker 3>and towards the system that he was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of for so long.</v>

1148
00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.800
<v Speaker 3>He was a democrat most of his life.</v>

1149
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:03.340
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1150
00:57:03.341 --> 00:57:06.040
<v Speaker 2>he's getting the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's getting it too.</v>

1151
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:09.850
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just proves it right there.</v>

1152
00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:13.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give money to both parties.</v>

1153
00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Hollywood,</v>

1154
00:57:14.561 --> 00:57:18.400
<v Speaker 2>they don't just get to the Democrat </v>
<v Speaker 2>party because the Republican Party to.</v>

1155
00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:20.650
<v Speaker 2>But they stay silent about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1156
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:22.970
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda smart duck cover your at </v>
<v Speaker 2>bats,</v>

1157
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which government contractor couldn't be </v>

1158
00:57:25.421 --> 00:57:26.254
<v Speaker 2>able to dip into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And isn't that like what Hollywood is </v>

1159
00:57:29.211 --> 00:57:30.220
<v Speaker 2>really all about?</v>

1160
00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many levels to it,</v>

1161
00:57:31.921 --> 00:57:32.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1162
00:57:32.851 --> 00:57:37.851
<v Speaker 3>there's the blatant tribalism of right </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus left where people pick a side and</v>

1163
00:57:38.071 --> 00:57:42.690
<v Speaker 3>they adopt a predetermined pattern or </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior and they adopt a conglomeration</v>

1164
00:57:42.691 --> 00:57:44.850
<v Speaker 3>of ideas and the program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1165
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:46.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're just bought.</v>

1166
00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.810
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pair it ever.</v>

1167
00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:51.330
<v Speaker 3>And then below the surface he got geo </v>
<v Speaker 3>political aspirations.</v>

1168
00:57:51.331 --> 00:57:55.260
<v Speaker 3>And you have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the global war machine.</v>

1169
00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:56.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1170
00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:56.640
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1171
00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.770
<v Speaker 3>that's what you have the money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real money.</v>

1172
00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:01.720
<v Speaker 2>But you know what Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say when people call me a,</v>

1173
00:58:02.550 --> 00:58:04.780
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whatever they call me,</v>

1174
00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:06.393
<v Speaker 2>but I have optimism and I've said for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time when the right people are at </v>

1175
00:58:10.901 --> 00:58:11.734
<v Speaker 2>the controls of all the machinery and </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology that will be so great for </v>

1176
00:58:15.221 --> 00:58:18.760
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the right within our grasp to,</v>

1177
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:19.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that this is a good place for </v>

1178
00:58:21.461 --> 00:58:23.650
<v Speaker 2>all kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could do that tomorrow.</v>

1179
00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:24.813
<v Speaker 2>So I think we should start thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that and all this artificial </v>

1180
00:58:27.821 --> 00:58:30.160
<v Speaker 2>intelligence that gets us fighting with </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

1181
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Let's just step out of it like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Matrix,</v>

1182
00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:33.604
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go to a new place where we're </v>

1183
00:58:34.331 --> 00:58:35.164
<v Speaker 2>about solutions and working together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing this country together and </v>

1184
00:58:38.231 --> 00:58:41.200
<v Speaker 2>getting some real good jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real good health care.</v>

1185
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Things that we pay taxes for better </v>
<v Speaker 2>streets,</v>

1186
00:58:43.961 --> 00:58:46.990
<v Speaker 2>good education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The things we pay taxes for.</v>

1187
00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And mental health.</v>

1188
00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:50.403
<v Speaker 2>Most of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what we need to protect </v>

1189
00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:54.340
<v Speaker 2>for our veterans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come back and they're,</v>

1190
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:57.040
<v Speaker 2>they're untreated and they won't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>give him marijuana,</v>

1191
00:58:57.041 --> 00:59:00.100
<v Speaker 2>which really helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't even legalized that for,</v>

1192
00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:00.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have pts and marijuana does </v>

1193
00:59:03.131 --> 00:59:05.790
<v Speaker 2>help with pts and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1194
00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:09.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about supporting our troops.</v>

1195
00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Twenty two of them a day are killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

1196
00:59:12.221 --> 00:59:14.120
<v Speaker 2>They're homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

1197
00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:16.840
<v Speaker 2>that's who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that to be who we are.</v>

1198
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:18.063
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd people think nobody can see us </v>

1199
00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:23.440
<v Speaker 2>and we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they do and they,</v>

1200
00:59:23.441 --> 00:59:24.500
<v Speaker 2>they want it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1201
00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.393
<v Speaker 2>People want things to be right in work </v>
<v Speaker 2>and used for the good of all people and </v>

1202
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:31.040
<v Speaker 2>stop tearing people apart from each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

1203
00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:32.330
<v Speaker 2>We're neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1204
00:59:32.331 --> 00:59:33.164
<v Speaker 2>that was why I wanted to go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Roseanne show and say all those things </v>

1205
00:59:35.301 --> 00:59:37.520
<v Speaker 2>and I'm so happy that I did.</v>

1206
00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.590
<v Speaker 2>I did it in nine episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>

1207
00:59:39.591 --> 00:59:40.424
<v Speaker 2>10th season and I did all nine episodes </v>
<v Speaker 2>where exactly the episodes I wanted to </v>

1208
00:59:44.421 --> 00:59:45.254
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1209
00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:46.133
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was number one every week and I </v>

1210
00:59:47.541 --> 00:59:50.330
<v Speaker 2>just thank my fans for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1211
00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.850
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a turn of fortune.</v>

1212
00:59:52.851 --> 00:59:57.080
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did what I wanted to do and uh,</v>

1213
00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:58.273
<v Speaker 2>and it was so gratifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so wonderful and I don't want that </v>

1214
01:00:01.971 --> 01:00:02.804
<v Speaker 2>to be forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the ninth season to </v>

1215
01:00:04.021 --> 01:00:06.650
<v Speaker 2>disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the 10th season to disappear.</v>

1216
01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.290
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about them doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>without you?</v>

1217
01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:14.120
<v Speaker 2>How fucking weird is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is weird.</v>

1218
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:15.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1219
01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:16.154
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sending me a subtle message to </v>

1220
01:00:17.571 --> 01:00:19.220
<v Speaker 2>ode on opioids.</v>

1221
01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:21.960
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1222
01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.070
<v Speaker 2>that sounds that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you think.</v>

1223
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's some of it mind control stuff.</v>

1224
01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think that they want you to kill </v>

1225
01:00:29.641 --> 01:00:30.510
<v Speaker 2>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1226
01:00:30.511 --> 01:00:32.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they would do what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1227
01:00:32.611 --> 01:00:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't make any sense.</v>

1228
01:00:34.681 --> 01:00:35.514
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think they're being completely </v>

1229
01:00:36.751 --> 01:00:38.850
<v Speaker 2>inconsiderate and they don't care about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1230
01:00:38.851 --> 01:00:43.851
<v Speaker 2>they don't and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they so belittled my contribution to the</v>

1231
01:00:44.521 --> 01:00:46.620
<v Speaker 2>show too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just was shocking.</v>

1232
01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.080
<v Speaker 2>That was the most painful part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing.</v>

1233
01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:53.520
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that I read was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you hadn't considered the more than</v>

1234
01:00:53.521 --> 01:00:56.310
<v Speaker 2>100 people that work on the show when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you did what you did.</v>

1235
01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:57.330
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

1236
01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.850
<v Speaker 2>that's a ridiculous statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't cancel the show.</v>

1237
01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Not only did you not cancel the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were on ambien drunk tweeting.</v>

1238
01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:04.623
<v Speaker 2>Did the idea that you did this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was some sort of a deliberate ploy </v>

1239
01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:08.453
<v Speaker 2>to get the show canceled or the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was any justification that's </v>

1240
01:01:11.451 --> 01:01:13.200
<v Speaker 2>just shows should be canceled at all.</v>

1241
01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:15.960
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just say something that you,</v>

1242
01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.560
<v Speaker 2>you didn't want to come out that way and</v>
<v Speaker 2>apologize for it.</v>

1243
01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:21.810
<v Speaker 2>You guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I apologize.</v>

1244
01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Apologize for three months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1245
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know who you are now.</v>

1246
01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:28.540
<v Speaker 2>They tried to wipe me off the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1247
01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:29.723
<v Speaker 2>off the map of the culture because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are scared to be connected with </v>

1248
01:01:34.231 --> 01:01:36.780
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's a target and they acted </v>
<v Speaker 2>like cowards.</v>

1249
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.000
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1250
01:01:39.001 --> 01:01:39.834
<v Speaker 2>if it were my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely I would have years of two </v>

1251
01:01:43.561 --> 01:01:44.394
<v Speaker 2>decades or more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have said something and I </v>

1252
01:01:47.851 --> 01:01:50.570
<v Speaker 2>definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing I would never have done is,</v>

1253
01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:51.493
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stab somebody in the rush to condemn </v>

1254
01:01:54.241 --> 01:01:57.290
<v Speaker 2>somebody who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1255
01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.770
<v Speaker 2>was my biggest,</v>

1256
01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:01.480
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>advocate.</v>

1257
01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of,</v>

1258
01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.520
<v Speaker 2>sometimes an only advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of that.</v>

1259
01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:11.020
<v Speaker 2>I saw a lot of that about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just about them.</v>

1260
01:02:11.021 --> 01:02:14.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just let go of all of it because,</v>

1261
01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1262
01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1263
01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:16.933
<v Speaker 2>I am a person of belief and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>always try to do what's right in front </v>

1264
01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:23.640
<v Speaker 2>of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like what,</v>

1265
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:24.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1266
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.120
<v Speaker 2>my higher intelligence plays in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1267
01:02:27.121 --> 01:02:30.810
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it and [inaudible] it knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>better than me and um,</v>

1268
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:33.870
<v Speaker 2>which is why I don't think like other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1269
01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.513
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1270
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.420
<v Speaker 2>and also that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1271
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not going to fight not at 66.</v>

1272
01:02:41.851 --> 01:02:42.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm too old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1273
01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:45.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty frail and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1274
01:02:45.211 --> 01:02:48.900
<v Speaker 2>I worked really hard to get a second </v>
<v Speaker 2>season and it's kind of ironic.</v>

1275
01:02:48.901 --> 01:02:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I crossed time-zones to do promotion for</v>
<v Speaker 2>free for months.</v>

1276
01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:54.990
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1277
01:02:54.991 --> 01:02:55.824
<v Speaker 2>during that time when you're old and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't sleep and you're crossing time </v>

1278
01:02:58.921 --> 01:02:59.754
<v Speaker 2>zones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going from Hawaii to New York and back </v>

1279
01:03:01.531 --> 01:03:04.860
<v Speaker 2>and then back again and back again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1280
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1281
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I kind of became dependent on Ambien and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1282
01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:13.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost every night took it.</v>

1283
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:15.533
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1284
01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:20.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I,</v>

1285
01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:24.100
<v Speaker 2>something was wrong because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think,</v>

1286
01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:29.340
<v Speaker 2>I thought that tweet was about a science</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiction movie,</v>

1287
01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:31.533
<v Speaker 2>which happens to be my favorite movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And which I think is a very apt in the </v>

1288
01:03:36.971 --> 01:03:38.950
<v Speaker 2>world today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly in Iran,</v>

1289
01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:44.280
<v Speaker 2>were just a small group of corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaders are oppressing the citizens.</v>

1290
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:49.833
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1291
01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:52.573
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of references in </v>

1292
01:03:54.681 --> 01:03:56.330
<v Speaker 2>that movie that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1293
01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:00.980
<v Speaker 2>go along with what's happening in Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1294
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:01.973
<v Speaker 2>of the human beings rising up to throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>over there to over throw their </v>

1295
01:04:04.771 --> 01:04:05.604
<v Speaker 2>overlords.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I was looking at the </v>

1296
01:04:07.651 --> 01:04:09.810
<v Speaker 2>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I woke up to tweet there,</v>

1297
01:04:09.811 --> 01:04:14.100
<v Speaker 2>that was what was in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was certainly not somebody looks and,</v>

1298
01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:14.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1299
01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:18.990
<v Speaker 2>it was also about the Arab spring in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt,</v>

1300
01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.190
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1301
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.113
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1302
01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama,</v>

1303
01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.370
<v Speaker 2>he didn't handle it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1304
01:04:28.371 --> 01:04:29.204
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all those things are interrelated </v>

1305
01:04:30.261 --> 01:04:33.470
<v Speaker 2>with Iran and the Iran deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Iran nuclear deal.</v>

1306
01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:34.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1307
01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:39.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm extremely well read on that subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly wouldn't be at the height of</v>

1308
01:04:42.051 --> 01:04:43.880
<v Speaker 2>my power and my fame</v>

1309
01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:48.370
<v Speaker 7>being on there going command key.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Excuse me.</v>

1310
01:04:48.371 --> 01:04:50.230
<v Speaker 7>I'm not an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1311
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.000
<v Speaker 7>I won't be on the key.</v>

1312
01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:54.623
<v Speaker 2>I'm a well read and intelligent woman in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my word and things that I write to </v>

1313
01:04:59.881 --> 01:05:02.370
<v Speaker 2>people over in that part of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1314
01:05:04.110 --> 01:05:04.943
<v Speaker 2>I've brought a lot of people together in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that part of the world with my tweets </v>

1315
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:12.150
<v Speaker 2>and most of my tweets are spiritual in </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature anyway.</v>

1316
01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:13.660
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1317
01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:18.550
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't what people thought it was and</v>
<v Speaker 2>still,</v>

1318
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:19.443
<v Speaker 2>I apologize for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm inadvertently hurting anyone's </v>

1319
01:05:24.131 --> 01:05:28.210
<v Speaker 2>feelings still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I apologize for inadvertently and not,</v>

1320
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I apologize that they were wrong and </v>

1321
01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:34.720
<v Speaker 2>they misheard it and misunderstood it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that wasn't good enough either.</v>

1322
01:05:34.721 --> 01:05:36.400
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get to a point where I go,</v>

1323
01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm letting go of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1324
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.333
<v Speaker 2>my fans who know me and my family and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who like me and know me for my </v>

1325
01:05:44.081 --> 01:05:44.914
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know who I am and that's all that </v>

1326
01:05:46.781 --> 01:05:47.640
<v Speaker 2>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1327
01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:48.483
<v Speaker 2>they can call me whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't accept their definition of that </v>

1328
01:05:51.161 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that they should read more.</v>

1329
01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.773
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's most shocking </v>

1330
01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:01.940
<v Speaker 3>about this outrage culture that we live </v>
<v Speaker 3>in right now,</v>

1331
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.170
<v Speaker 3>this age of outrage is that there is no </v>
<v Speaker 3>path to redemption.</v>

1332
01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:11.800
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no acceptance of these.</v>

1333
01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:13.530
<v Speaker 3>There is though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a,</v>

1334
01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.260
<v Speaker 3>but there's not from the general public.</v>

1335
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public.</v>

1336
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.120
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people run up to me.</v>

1337
01:06:19.121 --> 01:06:22.210
<v Speaker 2>I never felt so much love in my entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

1338
01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:25.750
<v Speaker 2>in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not on twitter and I'm not on social</v>

1339
01:06:25.751 --> 01:06:26.380
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>

1340
01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.130
<v Speaker 3>not on social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social media.</v>

1341
01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:29.243
<v Speaker 3>It magnifies the very worst aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity because you're not interacting </v>

1342
01:06:33.381 --> 01:06:38.270
<v Speaker 3>with people in the real flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not experiencing social cues.</v>

1343
01:06:38.271 --> 01:06:41.000
<v Speaker 3>You're not looking them in the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not seeing them as a person.</v>

1344
01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.070
<v Speaker 3>You're just seeing them as a target </v>
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>

1345
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that twitter has,</v>

1346
01:06:45.050 --> 01:06:48.190
<v Speaker 2>is a purposeful plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1347
01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.193
<v Speaker 2>like facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got off facebook years ago because I </v>

1348
01:06:51.301 --> 01:06:52.134
<v Speaker 2>realized what they were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think twitter is doing and doing </v>

1349
01:06:55.231 --> 01:06:57.120
<v Speaker 2>the same thing that facebook did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

1350
01:06:57.121 --> 01:07:01.440
<v Speaker 2>so it's manufacturing consent and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1351
01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.430
<v Speaker 2>it's using bots to do it by </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing consent.</v>

1352
01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:08.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a place where like Noam Chomsky </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1353
01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:11.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the press manufacturers consent,</v>

1354
01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:12.443
<v Speaker 2>that consent of the governed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what they're doing is </v>

1355
01:07:16.051 --> 01:07:18.150
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing the consent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>governed,</v>

1356
01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:19.283
<v Speaker 2>but they also manufactured descent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They control the opposition to on </v>

1357
01:07:22.441 --> 01:07:25.350
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I liked getting in between those two</v>

1358
01:07:25.351 --> 01:07:29.850
<v Speaker 2>and causing a Ruckus because I knew it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was all artificial intelligence anyway.</v>

1359
01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:31.043
<v Speaker 2>It's all just a track us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all know that just like they do in </v>

1360
01:07:33.661 --> 01:07:34.494
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

1361
01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:36.813
<v Speaker 3>So what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think there's some sort of a grand </v>

1362
01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:41.110
<v Speaker 3>plan to get people to argue with each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other?</v>

1363
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a social experiment to turn</v>

1364
01:07:44.411 --> 01:07:46.570
<v Speaker 2>one group against another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1365
01:07:46.571 --> 01:07:47.404
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's smart because it's divide and </v>

1366
01:07:48.461 --> 01:07:50.890
<v Speaker 2>conquer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as long as we're like,</v>

1367
01:07:50.891 --> 01:07:52.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all these people getting robbed.</v>

1368
01:07:52.781 --> 01:07:53.614
<v Speaker 2>All these taxpayers getting robbed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting there pointing to other tax </v>

1369
01:07:56.321 --> 01:07:59.110
<v Speaker 2>payers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're getting robbed and blaming them.</v>

1370
01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:00.933
<v Speaker 2>But nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody needs to look upward of our </v>

1371
01:08:02.771 --> 01:08:03.604
<v Speaker 2>government asked for an audit of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes and actually take responsibility </v>

1372
01:08:06.911 --> 01:08:09.970
<v Speaker 2>for the things that our country does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're getting judged for it anyway.</v>

1373
01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:11.620
<v Speaker 2>I think we allowed.</v>

1374
01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:16.430
<v Speaker 3>I think there's certainly people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are capitalizing on all this chaos</v>

1375
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:17.280
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

1376
01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:18.333
<v Speaker 2>all the conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think it's manufactured and </v>

1377
01:08:20.361 --> 01:08:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's engineered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's happening because this</v>

1378
01:08:23.361 --> 01:08:24.830
<v Speaker 2>is a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1379
01:08:24.831 --> 01:08:26.740
<v Speaker 2>this ability to interact with each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

1380
01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:31.670
<v Speaker 2>I think people have a mind of their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people are inherently tribal.</v>

1381
01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:35.450
<v Speaker 2>There's almost no way to stop them from </v>
<v Speaker 2>being tribal tribes or tribal,</v>

1382
01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:36.913
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with tribalism is easy </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes have enemies that are </v>

1383
01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:44.051
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you develop this common ground,</v>

1384
01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:49.040
<v Speaker 2>but that would be nice if we all looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>at ourselves as a tribal world.</v>

1385
01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:50.083
<v Speaker 2>That's how I do look at the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>why I didn't want Hillary Clinton </v>

1386
01:08:52.791 --> 01:08:53.624
<v Speaker 2>because her party is very much for </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate law and the Republican Party </v>

1387
01:08:58.401 --> 01:08:59.234
<v Speaker 2>is very much for tribal law and I am a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribal person and I think tribal people </v>

1388
01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:05.470
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1389
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:07.610
<v Speaker 2>have their land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tribal.</v>

1390
01:09:07.611 --> 01:09:10.220
<v Speaker 2>In what way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How he tribal me?</v>

1391
01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm Jewish.</v>

1392
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:21.040
<v Speaker 2>When I go over there to the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I visit the graves of my teachers.</v>

1393
01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:24.013
<v Speaker 2>That's how I'm tribal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to their graves and that's what we </v>

1394
01:09:27.051 --> 01:09:30.050
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what all indigenous people do.</v>

1395
01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:31.183
<v Speaker 2>They want to control their sacred burial</v>
<v Speaker 2>grounds and that is anti corporate law </v>

1396
01:09:35.931 --> 01:09:38.990
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I'm anti corporate law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

1397
01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I like to study paypal bowls and </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate law and a maritime law and all</v>

1398
01:09:45.201 --> 01:09:46.190
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1399
01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:49.970
<v Speaker 2>I like to read so I have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information and you know,</v>

1400
01:09:49.971 --> 01:09:54.971
<v Speaker 2>it makes me angry or sad is that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the work of an artist over 30 years,</v>

1401
01:09:57.170 --> 01:09:58.003
<v Speaker 2>you think they think that we just pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>that out of their ass and that they can </v>

1402
01:10:00.891 --> 01:10:01.910
<v Speaker 2>copy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1403
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:05.000
<v Speaker 2>without the artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can copy it.</v>

1404
01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:06.680
<v Speaker 2>You mean your show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

1405
01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

1406
01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:09.050
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1407
01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:10.173
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff I suffered in my life I </v>

1408
01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:13.670
<v Speaker 2>put into that show.</v>

1409
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:17.510
<v Speaker 2>That show is about my family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my children,</v>

1410
01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.790
<v Speaker 2>and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1411
01:10:19.791 --> 01:10:22.850
<v Speaker 2>this is so huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so huge.</v>

1412
01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:24.890
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's beyond entitled,</v>

1413
01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:29.390
<v Speaker 2>but what are they going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is their plan and how are they able</v>

1414
01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:32.450
<v Speaker 2>to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you let them signed off?</v>

1415
01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:37.900
<v Speaker 2>He asked me to sign off because I felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I would be a huge hypocrite too.</v>

1416
01:10:39.381 --> 01:10:40.214
<v Speaker 2>Have talked 30 years or more in my life </v>
<v Speaker 2>about labor rights and the rights of </v>

1417
01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:49.640
<v Speaker 2>working people if I took away those p </v>
<v Speaker 2>200 people's jobs.</v>

1418
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:52.130
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted them to work.</v>

1419
01:10:52.131 --> 01:10:52.964
<v Speaker 2>I know how they had planned on another </v>
<v Speaker 2>season and they probably had already </v>

1420
01:10:57.501 --> 01:10:58.334
<v Speaker 2>spent the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there any consideration of </v>

1421
01:11:00.141 --> 01:11:00.974
<v Speaker 2>redemption?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there any path where they can allow </v>

1422
01:11:03.081 --> 01:11:03.914
<v Speaker 2>you to apologize or do something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would endear yourself to the people </v>

1423
01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:10.400
<v Speaker 2>where they heard that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1424
01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:12.200
<v Speaker 2>let me go on all your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1425
01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.093
<v Speaker 2>abc us and explained my tweet and how it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a political and not a racial tweet </v>

1426
01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.800
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1427
01:11:19.801 --> 01:11:20.634
<v Speaker 2>that was denied me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't say anything until </v>

1428
01:11:24.801 --> 01:11:25.634
<v Speaker 2>you sign off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say anything until you sign </v>

1429
01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:28.784
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they wanted you to sign off the </v>

1430
01:11:29.301 --> 01:11:31.910
<v Speaker 2>rights and then they would have you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to do.</v>

1431
01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Go on their interview shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't guarantee that,</v>

1432
01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:35.413
<v Speaker 2>didn't guarantee that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just wanted you to sign off and </v>

1433
01:11:37.701 --> 01:11:40.880
<v Speaker 2>they offered you nothing in return.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They offered me some money,</v>

1434
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:44.960
<v Speaker 2>but the idea was just to be able to Redo</v>
<v Speaker 2>the show.</v>

1435
01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take all those years of my ideas and </v>

1436
01:11:48.321 --> 01:11:52.160
<v Speaker 2>how I thought of 20 years of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations to come back.</v>

1437
01:11:52.161 --> 01:11:55.370
<v Speaker 2>It took me 20 years to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>would these characters,</v>

1438
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:56.263
<v Speaker 2>where would they be now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did that by living among regular </v>

1439
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.470
<v Speaker 2>normal people for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never lived behind a,</v>

1440
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:04.363
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a racially segregated gates like other </v>

1441
01:12:08.721 --> 01:12:09.554
<v Speaker 2>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in working people's </v>

1442
01:12:11.961 --> 01:12:12.794
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods and I farm around farmers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wasn't going to be that big of a </v>

1443
01:12:16.701 --> 01:12:18.710
<v Speaker 2>hypocrite.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

1449
01:12:33.141 --> 01:12:33.974
<v Speaker 2>close to the volcano to look at it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lava over took their boat and thank </v>

<v Speaker 2>affection</v>

1543
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:15.130
<v Speaker 1>from people in all my career.</v>

1545
01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.433
<v Speaker 1>there's the social media outrage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's people in real life that </v>

1546
01:17:21.651 --> 01:17:24.440
<v Speaker 1>feel terrible for you because they feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you got a raw deal.</v>

1547
01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that there's doubt there.</v>

1548
01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:31.780
<v Speaker 1>There are so many double standards of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who said things on the air.</v>

1549
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Remember I just said it to a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

1550
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:37.730
<v Speaker 1>less than 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people on twitter,</v>

1551
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:41.600
<v Speaker 1>but these people say things on the air </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they are not.</v>

1552
01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:42.853
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know joy had to call pants and </v>

1553
01:17:44.721 --> 01:17:46.130
<v Speaker 1>apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

1554
01:17:46.131 --> 01:17:48.530
<v Speaker 1>What a joy bay say about pence.</v>

01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:49.423
<v Speaker 1>She something about his Christian faith </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're psychotic or something </v>

1557
01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I heard,</v>

1558
01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:58.633
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an apology with your network behind you </v>

1559
01:18:01.401 --> 01:18:03.080
<v Speaker 1>really works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with,</v>

1560
01:18:03.081 --> 01:18:05.290
<v Speaker 1>what's her name that called Ivanka?</v>

1561
01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:06.770
<v Speaker 1>The names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

1562
01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:07.693
<v Speaker 1>Samantha and her network was behind her </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was far more offensive and it </v>

1563
01:18:11.901 --> 01:18:12.734
<v Speaker 1>was on the air and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when your network is not behind you </v>

1564
01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:21.660
<v Speaker 1>that you don't really know they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want me to tweet the whole.</v>

1565
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.863
<v Speaker 1>The whole truth is I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told him I wasn't going to tweet and </v>

1566
01:18:26.961 --> 01:18:27.794
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promised him over and over and </v>

1567
01:18:29.961 --> 01:18:33.710
<v Speaker 1>although they never send it in writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was required,</v>

1568
01:18:33.711 --> 01:18:36.920
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they called my publicist and unloaded on</v>

1569
01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:38.860
<v Speaker 1>him all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can,</v>

1570
01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should've stayed up twitter.</v>

1571
01:18:40.491 --> 01:18:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I did it to myself and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1572
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I made a mistake and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ball kept rolling,</v>

1573
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:47.893
<v Speaker 1>put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy that this what I think </v>

1574
01:18:49.611 --> 01:18:50.444
<v Speaker 1>is insignificant mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in light of your apology </v>

1575
01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.390
<v Speaker 1>could lead to no redemption possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1576
01:18:56.670 --> 01:18:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Didn't no redemption possible.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the connors,</v>

1579

<v Speaker 1>Asked me if I had some money to bet if I</v>

1580
01:19:06.861 --> 01:19:09.410

<v Speaker 1>time has passed and people can review </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

1618
01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the wrong woman.</v>

1619
01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Are you shitting me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women are just as horrible as man.</v>

1620
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:12.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible with women to this one.</v>

1621
01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:16.740
<v Speaker 3>Cool assault and rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1622
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:18.310
<v Speaker 3>amongst lesbian couples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1623
01:21:18.311 --> 01:21:19.144
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty bad,</v>

1624
01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:22.300
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about rape in the prisons?</v>

1625
01:21:22.301 --> 01:21:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody talks about that.</v>

1626
01:21:23.621 --> 01:21:24.454
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the real rape culture where men </v>

1627
01:21:26.441 --> 01:21:27.730
<v Speaker 2>are learning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1628
01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:29.710
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible.</v>

1629
01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:30.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1630
01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:31.393
<v Speaker 3>Well we can get into depth about how bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>prisons are in general and how people </v>

1631
01:21:34.101 --> 01:21:34.540
<v Speaker 3>aren't reading.</v>

1632
01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:37.200
<v Speaker 2>You ever watch orange is the new block,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I know.</v>

1633
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:39.270
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

1634
01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>

1635
01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:42.470
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1636
01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.200
<v Speaker 3>there's no rehabilitation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1637
01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:47.370
<v Speaker 3>it's very rare looseness in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in prisons.</v>

1638
01:21:47.371 --> 01:21:51.040
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing is you take people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make them better criminals or make a</v>

1639
01:21:51.041 --> 01:21:53.820
<v Speaker 3>more hardened criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You surrounded with other criminals.</v>

1640
01:21:53.821 --> 01:21:54.900
<v Speaker 3>You give them a horrible work,</v>

1641
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:55.743
<v Speaker 2>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living further because most prisoners </v>

1642
01:21:58.261 --> 01:22:00.210
<v Speaker 2>are in their because they're abused </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

1643
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:01.103
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what percentage of prisoners are in </v>

1644
01:22:01.831 --> 01:22:05.550
<v Speaker 2>there for nonviolent drug offenses just </v>
<v Speaker 2>drives me crazy.</v>

1645
01:22:05.551 --> 01:22:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I ran for president,</v>

1646
01:22:07.361 --> 01:22:10.920
<v Speaker 2>I ran on legalization of marijuana for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that exact reason.</v>

1647
01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly but surely.</v>

1648
01:22:12.421 --> 01:22:14.700
<v Speaker 2>That's becoming a mainstream idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad.</v>

1649
01:22:14.890 --> 01:22:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Glad to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1650
01:22:15.921 --> 01:22:20.180
<v Speaker 3>as a rabid pot user,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

1651
01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.770
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think marijuana is,</v>

1652
01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:25.400
<v Speaker 3>it makes you more sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aware person.</v>

1653
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:26.263
<v Speaker 3>It definitely makes you paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that paranoia allows you to </v>

1654
01:22:28.911 --> 01:22:33.650
<v Speaker 3>understand all the danger in the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you probably ignoring.</v>

1655
01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One more time,</v>

1656
01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.970
<v Speaker 2>like I was with March,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1657
01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:38.920

<v Speaker 2>once I started smoking pot,</v>

1658
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:42.100
<v Speaker 2>then I got real paranoid of people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a good thing.</v>

1659
01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:45.340
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be paranoid of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People should be aware of for sure.</v>

1660
01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Particularly if you watch cable TV for </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis,</v>

1661
01:22:49.210 --> 01:22:50.440
<v Speaker 2>that ID channel.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why don't you do this?</v>

1667

<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1789
01:29:12.721 --> 01:29:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Because I love how this character is put</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

1790
01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:17.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing characters,</v>

1791
01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just like,</v>

1792
01:29:19.351 --> 01:29:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I liked the forensics thing when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>put shit together,</v>

1793
01:29:22.591 --> 01:29:23.424
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>

1794
01:29:23.670 --> 01:29:24.503
<v Speaker 1>they are our purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our purpose of 40 year old white man </v>

1795
01:29:29.690 --> 01:29:32.640
<v Speaker 1>lives with his mother needs prevalent.</v>

1798
01:29:38.610 --> 01:29:39.443
<v Speaker 1>I think the real real problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>though is that the more you study that </v>

1799
01:29:43.771 --> 01:29:46.500
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you live in that world,</v>

1800
01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:51.660
<v Speaker 1>the less happiness you're going to find.</v>

1801
01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:54.910

<v Speaker 1>the world studying it,</v>

1802
01:29:55.130 --> 01:29:58.200
<v Speaker 1>reading about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual people that investigate those</v>

1803
01:29:58.201 --> 01:29:58.740
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They have a real hard time with life.</v>

1805
01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:03.750
<v Speaker 1>They have a real hard time because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>know too much.</v>

1806
01:30:03.751 --> 01:30:06.930
<v Speaker 1>They know too much about the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watch it show mine hunter.</v>

1807
01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch that one though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Douglas.</v>

1808
01:30:09.931 --> 01:30:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen so many of those shows.</v>

1809
01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I've read books on serial killers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1810
01:30:15.630 --> 01:30:17.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've,</v>

1811
01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.950
<v Speaker 1>I've known cops that investigated stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

1812
01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Well after I had that thing with marge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got really into it like Oh my God.</v>

1813
01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:26.990
<v Speaker 1>But you realize that some people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that are there,</v>

1814
01:30:26.991 --> 01:30:29.460
<v Speaker 1>but dark mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're capable.</v>

1815
01:30:29.461 --> 01:30:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Some fucked up shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah they are.</v>

1816
01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.880
<v Speaker 1>And if you were around that all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1817
01:30:32.881 --> 01:30:36.930
<v Speaker 1>I just think you're appreciation for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's one thing to know that it</v>

1818
01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:39.810
<v Speaker 1>exists and it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's another thing to let that enter</v>

1819
01:30:39.811 --> 01:30:40.644
<v Speaker 1>into your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your view of the world and have it in </v>

1820
01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:46.470
<v Speaker 1>there as a standard standard trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

1821
01:30:46.471 --> 01:30:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's wrong to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1822
01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.100
<v Speaker 1>nothing else interests me.</v>

1823
01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:53.453
<v Speaker 1>Why is it interesting to you so much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because it's such a bizarre how </v>

1824
01:30:56.940 --> 01:30:58.880
<v Speaker 1>they get away with it and they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 8>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean they do all these movies about </v>

1849
01:32:05.501 --> 01:32:06.334
<v Speaker 8>robots and other words.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't want to be connected with a </v>

1850
01:32:08.141 --> 01:32:10.180
<v Speaker 8>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a racist,</v>

1851
01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:11.950
<v Speaker 8>and that's what's so fucking stupid </v>
<v Speaker 8>about this.</v>

<v Speaker 8>was when it first came out.</v>

1855
01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:21.040

1871
01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:06.673
<v Speaker 8>Where are you going to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can't remember what they said in the </v>

1872
01:33:10.901 --> 01:33:12.940
<v Speaker 8>Midwest.</v>
<v Speaker 8>All across the Midwest.</v>

1873

<v Speaker 8>Are you performing at all?</v>

1874
01:33:15.101 --> 01:33:15.934
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>are you.</v>

1875
01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:17.460
<v Speaker 8>You're just writing?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1876
01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:20.290

<v Speaker 8>Are you going to start out at clubs?</v>

1877
01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.950
<v Speaker 8>Are you going to theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 8>casinos?</v>

1878
01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:27.370
<v Speaker 8>Do you have a framework of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 8>going to talk about?</v>

1879
01:33:28.230 --> 01:33:33.230
<v Speaker 8>Talk about raising good sons and all </v>
<v Speaker 8>that that entails.</v>

1880
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:36.640
<v Speaker 8>Are you going to bring someone with you </v>
<v Speaker 8>on the road to warm up or.</v>

1881
01:33:36.730 --> 01:33:38.530
<v Speaker 8>I probably should.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

1882
01:33:38.531 --> 01:33:39.364
<v Speaker 8>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's kind of saying I wanted to call </v>

1883
01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.193
<v Speaker 8>headline too.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I thought to co headlined with Monique </v>

1884
01:33:44.561 --> 01:33:46.720
<v Speaker 8>would be a blast.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's a great idea.</v>

1885
01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:49.330
<v Speaker 8>Me and her talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That'd be fun.</v>

1886
01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:50.733
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean anybody just just to get out </v>

1887
01:33:52.991 --> 01:33:54.280
<v Speaker 8>there again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>tell me a joke.</v>

1888
01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:59.290
<v Speaker 8>I really liked hearing people laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That'd be a great thing for you to do it</v>

1889
01:33:59.590 --> 01:34:00.760
<v Speaker 8>better.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do it.</v>

1890
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:02.290
<v Speaker 8>How long has it been Susan?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Stand up.</v>

1891
01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.270
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I did it just before,</v>

1892
01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:05.350
<v Speaker 8>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In fact,</v>

1893
01:34:05.351 --> 01:34:07.670
<v Speaker 8>I think that's why I got so rundown.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1894
01:34:07.671 --> 01:34:10.660
<v Speaker 8>I got so rundown when I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1895
01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:11.613
<v Speaker 8>this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was so run down at that point that I </v>

1896
01:34:14.021 --> 01:34:18.580
<v Speaker 8>had no b vitamins in my body.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How's it impossible?</v>

1897
01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:20.980
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I made was that really low level?</v>

1898
01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:22.840
<v Speaker 8>And the doctor said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1899
01:34:22.841 --> 01:34:25.840
<v Speaker 8>that can cause psychosis.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So that's where I go.</v>

1900
01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:28.180
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what happened to me.</v>

1901
01:34:28.181 --> 01:34:29.770
<v Speaker 8>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was at white.</v>

1902
01:34:29.771 --> 01:34:32.080
<v Speaker 8>I was getting way out there in Salt Lake</v>
<v Speaker 8>City,</v>

1903
01:34:32.081 --> 01:34:32.914
<v Speaker 8>Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Anyway,</v>

1904
01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:33.873
<v Speaker 8>after I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I did do standup all through Canada and </v>

1905
01:34:35.951 --> 01:34:40.951
<v Speaker 8>then I ended up in New York doing promo </v>
<v Speaker 8>for Rosanne and uh,</v>

1906
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:42.730
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just got to run down.</v>

1907
01:34:42.731 --> 01:34:43.564
<v Speaker 8>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't watch myself and do what I </v>

1908
01:34:45.401 --> 01:34:48.970
<v Speaker 8>should have done for my physical health </v>
<v Speaker 8>this time around.</v>

1909
01:34:48.971 --> 01:34:49.804
<v Speaker 8>Let's get you sorted it out and sketch </v>
<v Speaker 8>on some vitamins and get your </v>

1910
01:34:52.930 --> 01:34:57.590
<v Speaker 8>nutritionist and get somebody who's </v>
<v Speaker 8>going to do some blood work you and make</v>

1911
01:34:57.591 --> 01:34:59.240
<v Speaker 8>sure everything's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Blood work done.</v>

1912
01:34:59.241 --> 01:35:00.074
<v Speaker 8>I always go,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I go to the cancer center at a whatever </v>

1913
01:35:03.201 --> 01:35:05.540
<v Speaker 8>that hospitals called over there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1914
01:35:05.541 --> 01:35:06.374
<v Speaker 8>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But I always have to have infusions </v>

1915
01:35:08.091 --> 01:35:12.760
<v Speaker 8>every three months because I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't absorb minerals or vitamins.</v>

1916
01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:14.710
<v Speaker 8>What do you mean you don't absorb them?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1917
01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:19.780
<v Speaker 8>I had this gastric bypass about 25 or so</v>
<v Speaker 8>years ago and I can't absorb minerals or</v>

1918
01:35:20.751 --> 01:35:24.020
<v Speaker 8>vitamins and so I have to go get </v>
<v Speaker 8>infusions every,</v>

1919
01:35:24.330 --> 01:35:26.990
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when I get to down and I,</v>

1920
01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:30.560
<v Speaker 8>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was promoting the residential and also</v>

1921
01:35:30.561 --> 01:35:34.190
<v Speaker 8>doing some touring Canada and I got to </v>
<v Speaker 8>run down and I,</v>

1922
01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.041
<v Speaker 8>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1923
01:35:35.041 --> 01:35:35.860
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

1924
01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:38.360
<v Speaker 8>I think I had a mental collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I told the network,</v>

1925
01:35:38.361 --> 01:35:39.194
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>obviously I'm not behaving in the right </v>

1926
01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:46.300
<v Speaker 8>way and I will check myself in and get </v>
<v Speaker 8>my meds checked to make sure I'm,</v>

1927
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:48.050
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1928
01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:51.710
<v Speaker 8>so I said I have mental health issues </v>
<v Speaker 8>and you know,</v>

1929
01:35:51.711 --> 01:35:52.544
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I said also I thought that woman was </v>

1930
01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:57.800
<v Speaker 8>white and it wasn't anything about race.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was about Iran.</v>

1931
01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.020
<v Speaker 8>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

1932
01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:05.300
<v Speaker 8>we'll see how this washes out in </v>
<v Speaker 8>Sherman.</v>

1933
01:36:05.301 --> 01:36:07.040
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we'll see how this washes.</v>

1934
01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:11.570
<v Speaker 8>And then 20 minutes later Wanda Sykes </v>
<v Speaker 8>tweeted,</v>

1935
01:36:11.571 --> 01:36:12.830
<v Speaker 8>let me off this show.</v>

1936
01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:19.380
<v Speaker 8>And then Sarah Gilbert tweeted,</v>
<v Speaker 8>shortly thereafter a,</v>

1937
01:36:19.670 --> 01:36:24.670
<v Speaker 8>something about she was ashamed of one </v>
<v Speaker 8>cast member and a would.</v>

1938
01:36:26.190 --> 01:36:28.710
<v Speaker 8>That one blew me away.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>

1939
01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:30.313
<v Speaker 8>and Michael Fishman tweeted a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he was ashamed of my racism or some </v>

1940
01:36:34.671 --> 01:36:36.500
<v Speaker 8>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>

1941
01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:38.240
<v Speaker 8>that was hard to take.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But,</v>

1942
01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.910
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was because it was so,</v>

1943
01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:43.820
<v Speaker 8>it seemed orchestrated because they use </v>
<v Speaker 8>the same words,</v>

1944
01:36:43.821 --> 01:36:47.210
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a egregious unforgivable.</v>

1945
01:36:47.630 --> 01:36:50.390
<v Speaker 8>But in fact it might have been </v>
<v Speaker 8>offensive.</v>

1946
01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.310
<v Speaker 8>And like when I was talking to Mike </v>
<v Speaker 8>Today,</v>

1947
01:36:52.311 --> 01:36:52.911
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1948
01:36:52.911 --> 01:36:55.880
<v Speaker 8>we all say things that are racially </v>
<v Speaker 8>insensitive at times.</v>

1949
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:58.340
<v Speaker 8>All of us do that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm a Jew,</v>

1950
01:36:58.341 --> 01:37:02.610
<v Speaker 8>I've heard everything and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1951
01:37:02.611 --> 01:37:05.420
<v Speaker 8>or,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or ethnically offensive to somebody,</v>

1952
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:08.360
<v Speaker 8>but that doesn't mean where the KKK.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1953
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:10.530
<v Speaker 8>That doesn't mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1954
01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:13.550
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>fascists or you know,</v>

1955
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:17.390
<v Speaker 8>and especially if we apologize because </v>
<v Speaker 8>most people who are offensive,</v>

1956
01:37:17.391 --> 01:37:20.180
<v Speaker 8>they mean to be offensive and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 8>apologize.</v>

1957
01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:22.910
<v Speaker 8>And I think that's when,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know there's a difference and if you</v>

1958
01:37:23.150 --> 01:37:23.983
<v Speaker 8>don't have the discretion to understand </v>
<v Speaker 8>that something's wrong with you and I </v>

1959
01:37:28.341 --> 01:37:32.180
<v Speaker 8>think something's wrong with people that</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're so hateful and uh,</v>

1960
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:37.390
<v Speaker 8>so unforgiving and if you don't vote the</v>
<v Speaker 8>way they think you should vote,</v>

1961
01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:40.940
<v Speaker 8>that they feel justified in being.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

1962
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:42.630
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's the word?</v>

1963
01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:47.330
<v Speaker 8>Self sanctimonious and self righteous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And when they themselves are,</v>

1964
01:37:48.650 --> 01:37:51.530
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>kind of saying far more offensive things</v>

1965
01:37:51.890 --> 01:37:54.620
<v Speaker 8>about people's children and such.</v>
<v Speaker 8>For instance,</v>

1966
01:37:54.650 --> 01:37:55.483
<v Speaker 8>I think people are just cowards.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I think when things like this </v>

1967
01:37:57.271 --> 01:37:58.104
<v Speaker 8>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they want to separate themselves from </v>

1968
01:37:58.831 --> 01:37:59.664
<v Speaker 8>controversy and make sure that they're </v>
<v Speaker 8>not a part of the people that I can </v>

1969
01:38:02.391 --> 01:38:04.620
<v Speaker 8>understand that I can kind of understand</v>
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>

1970
01:38:04.621 --> 01:38:07.120
<v Speaker 8>but I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't they do,</v>

1971
01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:09.500
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and you know,</v>

1972
01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.310
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>wow.</v>

1973
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:12.593
<v Speaker 8>They also get really,</v>
<v Speaker 8>really upset when a few years later </v>

1974
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:19.830
<v Speaker 8>somebody does the exact same thing to </v>
<v Speaker 8>them and go,</v>

1975
01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:24.450
<v Speaker 8>what goes around comes around and that's</v>
<v Speaker 8>true and especially true in Hollywood.</v>

1976
01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:28.920
<v Speaker 8>That guide that fired me just was fired </v>
<v Speaker 8>a couple of weeks ago for what?</v>

1977
01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:34.290
<v Speaker 8>I don't know that his contract wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 8>renewed and his last words were,</v>

1978
01:38:34.291 --> 01:38:35.124
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't know I'd be forced to cancel </v>

1979
01:38:37.021 --> 01:38:41.010
<v Speaker 8>our number one show.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It wasn't forced to do anything.</v>

1980
01:38:41.011 --> 01:38:42.360
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he might've been forced.</v>

1981
01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:44.150
<v Speaker 8>They're all fools.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This should just.</v>

1982
01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:46.680
<v Speaker 8>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they should have let the dust settle.</v>

1983
01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:47.813
<v Speaker 8>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they should have examined what you </v>

1984
01:38:49.321 --> 01:38:54.270
<v Speaker 8>actually said and what your intentions </v>
<v Speaker 8>were and let you apologize and then have</v>

1985
01:38:54.271 --> 01:38:57.660
<v Speaker 8>a conversation with you on one of their </v>
<v Speaker 8>shows in long form.</v>

1986
01:38:57.850 --> 01:38:58.683
<v Speaker 8>You May,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in a teaching moment such as Valerie </v>

1987
01:39:00.421 --> 01:39:02.580
<v Speaker 8>jarret would have accepted that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>

1988
01:39:02.581 --> 01:39:06.960
<v Speaker 8>I would like to debate her on the Iran </v>
<v Speaker 8>deal and explain what I what I said,</v>

1989
01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:07.590
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1990
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:12.510
<v Speaker 8>that's not necessarily what Americans </v>
<v Speaker 8>should know about that deal.</v>

1991
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:13.681
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe they should,</v>

1992
01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:16.140
<v Speaker 8>but I don't think that's completely </v>
<v Speaker 8>related to the tweet,</v>

1993
01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:19.140
<v Speaker 8>but it would have been a teachable </v>
<v Speaker 8>moment maybe,</v>

1994
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:22.830
<v Speaker 8>but it also would've been a distraction </v>
<v Speaker 8>from what you were trying to say.</v>

1995
01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:24.920
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they didn't let me say it right.</v>

1996
01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:26.670
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1997
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:29.130
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but to get involved like openly,</v>

1998
01:39:29.131 --> 01:39:31.370
<v Speaker 8>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the television show,</v>

1999
01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:33.630
<v Speaker 8>that's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But Taylor swift just did it.</v>

2000
01:39:34.570 --> 01:39:38.040
<v Speaker 8>What did she say?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just get out and vote Democrat.</v>

2001
01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:40.950
<v Speaker 8>Wasn't that like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's almost abstract.</v>

2002
01:39:41.190 --> 01:39:42.240
<v Speaker 8>Get out and vote,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2003
01:39:42.241 --> 01:39:44.550
<v Speaker 8>she's not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she said vote for the Democrat.</v>

2004
01:39:44.551 --> 01:39:46.800
<v Speaker 8>I don't like the Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Marsha Blackburn,</v>

2005
01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:47.993
<v Speaker 8>she didn't like her.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Although Marsha Blackburn has been the </v>

2006
01:39:50.581 --> 01:39:54.930
<v Speaker 8>author of a lot of great anti rape laws </v>
<v Speaker 8>and all kinds of stuff like that,</v>

2007
01:39:54.931 --> 01:39:57.180
<v Speaker 8>but she didn't like her because she's a </v>
<v Speaker 8>Republican,</v>

2008
01:39:57.181 --> 01:40:00.600
<v Speaker 8>says she took a stand,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a political stand,</v>

2009
01:40:00.930 --> 01:40:01.763
<v Speaker 8>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

2010
01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:03.300
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some people can do it,</v>

2011
01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:08.130
<v Speaker 8>but some people can't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And the political stand I took,</v>

2012
01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:11.260
<v Speaker 8>which I just want to remind people is </v>
<v Speaker 8>that I'm,</v>

2013
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:13.020
<v Speaker 8>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm an independent.</v>

2014
01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:15.210
<v Speaker 8>That's my stance.</v>

2015
01:40:17.370 --> 01:40:18.203
<v Speaker 8>And I just thought both sides had gone </v>
<v Speaker 8>too far out and need to talk to each </v>

2016
01:40:21.031 --> 01:40:21.864
<v Speaker 8>other.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I came back and did a show about </v>

2017
01:40:23.311 --> 01:40:24.144
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's the stance you took with your </v>

2018
01:40:26.491 --> 01:40:31.491
<v Speaker 8>show and in my life it's like if we can </v>
<v Speaker 8>even discuss things that's really,</v>

2019
01:40:32.431 --> 01:40:34.860
<v Speaker 8>really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's not American.</v>

2020
01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:39.920
<v Speaker 8>We we discuss and debate.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We don't label and black list,</v>

2021
01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:41.063
<v Speaker 8>which we certainly can talk things and </v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe that's something that you could </v>

2022
01:40:43.811 --> 01:40:46.950
<v Speaker 8>have done once they had a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 8>with you about your tweet.</v>

2023
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:48.263
<v Speaker 8>But I mean I just think that what they </v>
<v Speaker 8>did was just very hasty and very </v>

2024
01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:51.653
<v Speaker 8>foolhardy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And they should have known who were </v>

2025
01:40:53.501 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 8>beforehand.</v>

2026
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.050
<v Speaker 3>They should have known about your mental</v>
<v Speaker 3>health issues.</v>

2027
01:40:56.230 --> 01:40:57.063
<v Speaker 3>They should know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should have known about your </v>

2028
01:40:58.661 --> 01:41:00.640
<v Speaker 3>medication issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of those things.</v>

2029
01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:02.553
<v Speaker 3>But this is what my point was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a person with a broken leg </v>

2030
01:41:04.841 --> 01:41:08.520
<v Speaker 3>and they can't run and you get mad at </v>
<v Speaker 3>them because they can't run the.</v>

2031
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:09.790
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2032
01:41:09.791 --> 01:41:13.960
<v Speaker 3>if you have a person that has brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues and then they do something that's</v>

2033
01:41:13.961 --> 01:41:14.794
<v Speaker 3>erratic and you're mad at them for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you're a fucking idiot that's </v>

2034
01:41:17.951 --> 01:41:18.784
<v Speaker 3>stupid and you call them a racist or </v>
<v Speaker 3>chastise them in front of the world so </v>

2035
01:41:22.901 --> 01:41:23.734
<v Speaker 3>that you remove any possible any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any possible negative opinions that </v>

2036
01:41:32.141 --> 01:41:34.640
<v Speaker 3>could be cast your way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what a lot of it is,</v>

2037
01:41:34.641 --> 01:41:35.474
<v Speaker 3>is deflection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're worried about negative opinions </v>

2038
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.823
<v Speaker 3>and negative feedback that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come their way so they immediately turn </v>

2039
01:41:41.471 --> 01:41:42.160
<v Speaker 3>on you.</v>

2040
01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:43.960
<v Speaker 3>They turn on you in a disproportionate </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2041
01:41:44.010 --> 01:41:46.220
<v Speaker 3>While they did cancel the show before </v>
<v Speaker 3>evening,</v>

2042
01:41:46.221 --> 01:41:51.221
<v Speaker 3>one advertiser had pulled out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the Sarah Silvermans bet.</v>

2043
01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:56.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm against a amber that I'm against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2044
01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:58.353
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of cowardice going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people trying to save </v>

2045
01:41:59.741 --> 01:42:00.574
<v Speaker 3>their jobs and people panic because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are aware of the outrage culture </v>

2046
01:42:03.341 --> 01:42:06.470
<v Speaker 3>that we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an outrage nation right now.</v>

2047
01:42:06.471 --> 01:42:07.304
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of our number one forms of </v>

2048
01:42:09.221 --> 01:42:10.840
<v Speaker 3>recreation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People love it.</v>

2049
01:42:11.050 --> 01:42:13.480
<v Speaker 3>They love getting mad at whoever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it is.</v>

2050
01:42:13.630 --> 01:42:15.910
<v Speaker 3>As long as you react the way they want </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to react.</v>

2051
01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:17.013
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they love it.</v>

2052
01:42:17.230 --> 01:42:19.750
<v Speaker 3>It's an inquisition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2053
01:42:19.751 --> 01:42:24.751
<v Speaker 3>it's the understanding that people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>way more power to affect change.</v>

2054
01:42:25.991 --> 01:42:26.824
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's good change or bad change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're pushing buttons with social </v>

2055
01:42:29.471 --> 01:42:33.400
<v Speaker 3>media and without rage and with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to express themselves.</v>

2056
01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.233
<v Speaker 3>It's unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's never been a time like this in </v>

2057
01:42:35.591 --> 01:42:39.590
<v Speaker 3>history where people can Salem witch </v>
<v Speaker 3>trials,</v>

2058
01:42:39.930 --> 01:42:42.310
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that was just like,</v>

2059
01:42:42.311 --> 01:42:43.144
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if you swam that proves you're a </v>

2060
01:42:45.161 --> 01:42:46.630
<v Speaker 3>witch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we have to drown.</v>

2061
01:42:46.631 --> 01:42:49.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2062
01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.740
<v Speaker 3>it has said there has to be a loser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there has to be two winters.</v>

2063
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2064
01:42:54.540 --> 01:42:56.980
<v Speaker 3>there has to be an understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happening here.</v>

2065
01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:57.933
<v Speaker 3>And then people have to have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the power that they're </v>

2066
01:43:00.011 --> 01:43:03.340
<v Speaker 3>wielding and what they're doing and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turned back on them.</v>

2067
01:43:03.341 --> 01:43:04.174
<v Speaker 3>And it never just stop at one person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I said I'm surprised that a </v>

2068
01:43:07.811 --> 01:43:11.200
<v Speaker 3>lot more comics didn't defend me because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2069
01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:12.093
<v Speaker 3>this means that anything they find it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your timeline that they think is </v>

2070
01:43:15.671 --> 01:43:16.504
<v Speaker 3>offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can mischaracterize and bringing a </v>

2071
01:43:18.551 --> 01:43:19.384
<v Speaker 3>whole a battle against you that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't possibly win and take your life's </v>

2072
01:43:23.171 --> 01:43:23.710
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

2073
01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many did defend you?</v>

2074
01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:30.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm nobody defended me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did.</v>

2075

<v Speaker 3>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Hope.</v>

2077
01:43:33.611 --> 01:43:35.260
<v Speaker 3>Did Stan hope dead?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2078
01:43:36.130 --> 01:43:39.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a time that we're working with</v>

2079
01:43:39.311 --> 01:43:40.750
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of them that worked with you.</v>

2080
01:43:40.810 --> 01:43:41.643
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody that works,</v>

2081
01:43:41.650 --> 01:43:43.250
<v Speaker 3>you wanted to keep their job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2082
01:43:43.330 --> 01:43:46.240
<v Speaker 3>And I don't blame them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't blame them.</v>

2083
01:43:46.241 --> 01:43:49.000
<v Speaker 3>They needed the money and probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>already spent it.</v>

2084
01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing too,</v>

2085
01:43:50.890 --> 01:43:55.280
<v Speaker 3>the life that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fucking schedule is ruthless.</v>

2086
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:57.170
<v Speaker 3>It's growing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I think it was,</v>

2087
01:43:57.171 --> 01:43:58.600
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2088
01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:01.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gave him the gun to shoot me.</v>

2089
01:44:01.311 --> 01:44:03.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't a helpless victim,</v>

2090
01:44:03.831 --> 01:44:08.831
<v Speaker 3>although I think my explanation either </v>
<v Speaker 3>make sense or doesn't make sense.</v>

2091
01:44:09.261 --> 01:44:10.094
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if you're compassionate it makes </v>

2092
01:44:11.511 --> 01:44:14.210
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of people aren't.</v>

2093
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:15.103
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2094
01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:16.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2095
01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:18.073
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what I was getting.</v>

2096
01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:19.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>compassionate.</v>

2097
01:44:19.791 --> 01:44:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Roseanne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're scared.</v>

2098
01:44:21.230 --> 01:44:24.410
<v Speaker 3>I think that just chicken shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they're looking at it from</v>

2099
01:44:24.411 --> 01:44:27.560
<v Speaker 3>it in terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't win here and I can't lose here.</v>

2100
01:44:27.650 --> 01:44:29.600
<v Speaker 3>Let me just look at what's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2101
01:44:29.601 --> 01:44:31.910
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have anything to win or lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I looked at it,</v>

2102
01:44:31.911 --> 01:44:33.680
<v Speaker 3>I looked at you as someone that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>admire.</v>

2103
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:34.583
<v Speaker 3>Some of that I think is one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>comics ever who I think I know that you </v>

2104
01:44:37.281 --> 01:44:39.920
<v Speaker 3>have mental health issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew from talking to you that you were</v>

2105
01:44:39.921 --> 01:44:42.740
<v Speaker 3>on Ambien and I knew you had alcohol as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2106
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:44.870
<v Speaker 3>I know what that does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mom took ambien.</v>

2107
01:44:45.110 --> 01:44:49.490
<v Speaker 3>She woke up in the middle of the night </v>
<v Speaker 3>and drew all over the bathroom rug,</v>

2108
01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:51.680
<v Speaker 3>drool over it with lipstick and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2109
01:44:51.681 --> 01:44:53.300
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nail Polish.</v>

2110
01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.060
<v Speaker 3>She said like a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Shit.</v>

2111
01:44:55.061 --> 01:44:57.080
<v Speaker 3>You woke up in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had no idea she did it.</v>

2112
01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:59.390
<v Speaker 3>She's terrified of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She won't take it now.</v>

2113
01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:00.573
<v Speaker 3>I have friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many friends that have had bad </v>

2114
01:45:03.081 --> 01:45:05.480
<v Speaker 3>experiences on ambulance tail and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>

2115
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:06.343
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't have shut down that </v>

2116
01:45:06.921 --> 01:45:08.780
<v Speaker 3>conversation like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They shouldn't have.</v>

2117
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:12.770
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking dangerous drug to for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong people in the wrong situations.</v>

2118
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:13.783
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you mix it with alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's beneficial to people that </v>

2119
01:45:16.041 --> 01:45:18.740
<v Speaker 3>need sleep in certain situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't recommend it,</v>

2120
01:45:18.741 --> 01:45:20.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't take it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some people like it.</v>

2121
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:21.703
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to ignore what the actual </v>

2122
01:45:23.571 --> 01:45:28.520
<v Speaker 3>pharmacological effect on the human body</v>
<v Speaker 3>is is ridiculous because there's studies</v>

2123
01:45:28.521 --> 01:45:29.354
<v Speaker 3>on this shit and that people understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>the interaction between chemicals and </v>

2124
01:45:32.271 --> 01:45:33.104
<v Speaker 3>the human brain and there are erratic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially when you mix them with </v>

2125
01:45:35.721 --> 01:45:37.010
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to mix them with.</v>

2126
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:40.290
<v Speaker 3>Weird Shit happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was gonna.</v>

2127
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:44.110
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was going to expand on it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the morning and you know,</v>

2128
01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:49.120
<v Speaker 3>talk about that movie and a too late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2129
01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:51.290
<v Speaker 3>well it could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was too late to put.</v>

2130
01:45:51.291 --> 01:45:53.340
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is just fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2131
01:45:53.370 --> 01:45:56.420
<v Speaker 3>when telling me not to tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2132
01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:57.860
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a good idea,</v>

2133
01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:03.340
<v Speaker 3>but now honestly the problem also a </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter's fucking text is just too.</v>

2134
01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:08.630
<v Speaker 3>It's too simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too crude a way of communicating.</v>

2135
01:46:08.770 --> 01:46:09.603
<v Speaker 3>It really is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can get across some ideas like </v>

2136
01:46:11.271 --> 01:46:12.104
<v Speaker 3>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2137
01:46:12.230 --> 01:46:13.970
<v Speaker 3>I went to see little foot's a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

2138
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:16.740
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thing to tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real simple shit like that,</v>

2139
01:46:16.741 --> 01:46:17.574
<v Speaker 3>but you want to talk about like </v>
<v Speaker 3>political things or things that involve </v>

2140
01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:23.390
<v Speaker 3>nuance or seeing things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex.</v>

2141
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:25.560
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think it's the way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate.</v>

2142
01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:30.600
<v Speaker 3>I know it's terrible way to communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not communicate.</v>

2143
01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:32.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did he say?</v>

2144
01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:36.740
<v Speaker 3>A search and destroy oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For some folks,</v>

2145
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:41.720
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be people that always </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to make things crash and burn.</v>

2146
01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:43.740
<v Speaker 3>They like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like buttons.</v>

2147
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:46.310
<v Speaker 3>They like hitting the buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like to see people suffer.</v>

2148
01:46:46.670 --> 01:46:47.503
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They definitely are suffering </v>

2149
01:46:48.381 --> 01:46:49.530
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2150
01:46:49.590 --> 01:46:50.423
<v Speaker 3>there's a giant percentage of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>population that lives in misery that </v>

2151
01:46:53.210 --> 01:46:57.240
<v Speaker 3>they do all day long and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have mental health issues.</v>

2152
01:46:57.241 --> 01:46:58.860
<v Speaker 3>They're exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're depressed,</v>

2153
01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:00.870
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have despair,</v>

2154
01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:01.793
<v Speaker 3>they're overwhelmed with bills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in shitty relationships and </v>

2155
01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:05.203
<v Speaker 3>they're overwhelmed and they're angry </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they look at someone like you are </v>

2156
01:47:07.381 --> 01:47:09.090
<v Speaker 3>rich white lady,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

2157
01:47:09.091 --> 01:47:11.010
<v Speaker 3>fuck that bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just want to attack you.</v>

2158
01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:12.013
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to make sense because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a reflection of their own personal </v>

2159
01:47:14.251 --> 01:47:15.084
<v Speaker 3>pain as much as it's a reflection of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their irresponsibility with this power </v>

2160
01:47:18.451 --> 01:47:20.040
<v Speaker 3>that they're wielding through social </v>
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>

2161
01:47:20.250 --> 01:47:21.083
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the mob mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of people that are </v>

2162
01:47:22.891 --> 01:47:23.970
<v Speaker 3>already going after you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

2163
01:47:23.971 --> 01:47:26.610
<v Speaker 3>I want to go after a two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to show the world that I'm not</v>

2164
01:47:26.611 --> 01:47:28.080
<v Speaker 3>racist and you know how I'm going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2165
01:47:28.230 --> 01:47:31.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to shit all over this racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this racist Roseanne.</v>

2166
01:47:31.141 --> 01:47:32.700
<v Speaker 3>They don't care if you're really racist.</v>

2167
01:47:32.710 --> 01:47:34.750
<v Speaker 8>But the thing that gets me about it is </v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

2168
01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:35.613
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to shit all over this Jew </v>
<v Speaker 8>because I was talking about Iran as a </v>

2169
01:47:39.791 --> 01:47:43.180
<v Speaker 8>Jew and speaking about Persian Jews and </v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2170
01:47:43.210 --> 01:47:44.043
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all kinds of error when you're talking </v>

2171
01:47:45.701 --> 01:47:48.070
<v Speaker 8>about complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It is complex,</v>

2172
01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:50.640
<v Speaker 8>but I always was on there talking,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2173
01:47:50.670 --> 01:47:53.050
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>defending or,</v>

2174
01:47:53.051 --> 01:47:55.510
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>speaking for Jewish people.</v>

2175
01:47:55.511 --> 01:47:56.620
<v Speaker 8>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2176
01:47:56.650 --> 01:47:59.590
<v Speaker 8>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think that in the long run I've really</v>

2177
01:47:59.591 --> 01:48:00.424
<v Speaker 8>wanted to be known that I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I am a Jew and we're speaking as a Jew </v>

2178
01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.313
<v Speaker 8>and when I spoke about the Iran deal and</v>
<v Speaker 8>its effect on a Jewish people in the </v>

2179
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:10.833
<v Speaker 8>Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I really thought first they didn't </v>

2180
01:48:13.721 --> 01:48:15.520
<v Speaker 8>know that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but now I think,</v>

2181
01:48:15.521 --> 01:48:20.320
<v Speaker 8>well they had to know some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think they want to know.</v>

2182
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:24.340
<v Speaker 8>This is what I think you say when </v>
<v Speaker 8>someone says that's a black woman.</v>

2183
01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:27.130
<v Speaker 8>What is she one eighth black,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like what is she?</v>

2184
01:48:27.410 --> 01:48:29.320
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>something very small,</v>

2185
01:48:29.321 --> 01:48:31.140
<v Speaker 8>46 percent or something.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Really?</v>

2186
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:32.103
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>She had her DNA done was talking about </v>

2187
01:48:35.081 --> 01:48:40.081
<v Speaker 8>it and 40 something Caucasian and it </v>
<v Speaker 8>doesn't look like,</v>

2188
01:48:40.630 --> 01:48:41.950
<v Speaker 8>but whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever.</v>

2189
01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:46.480
<v Speaker 8>We can't tell who people are by how they</v>
<v Speaker 8>look on one point six percent African.</v>

2190
01:48:46.810 --> 01:48:48.880
<v Speaker 8>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Awesome.</v>

2191
01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:54.070
<v Speaker 8>That's the heart of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When you look at what happened,</v>

2192
01:48:54.130 --> 01:48:56.710
<v Speaker 8>I think it's real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think</v>

2193
01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:59.850
<v Speaker 3>she identifies or people identify her as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a black woman.</v>

2194
01:48:59.970 --> 01:49:02.460
<v Speaker 3>You said planet of the Apes Racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

2195
01:49:02.490 --> 01:49:04.350
<v Speaker 3>It's that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they give a fuck if you're</v>

2196
01:49:04.351 --> 01:49:05.184
<v Speaker 3>a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they care if you're not </v>

2197
01:49:06.511 --> 01:49:08.040
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is a</v>

2198
01:49:08.210 --> 01:49:09.990
<v Speaker 8>viable target.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And they go,</v>

2199
01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:12.440
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I said I voted for trump.</v>

2200
01:49:12.490 --> 01:49:15.240
<v Speaker 8>So that was a target to that too.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then,</v>

2201
01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:16.760
<v Speaker 8>and then they could find a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a,</v>

2202
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:20.570
<v Speaker 8>a tweet from the past.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I forget either.</v>

2203
01:49:20.690 --> 01:49:21.523
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Maya got in trouble for that alone many </v>

2204
01:49:23.481 --> 01:49:26.990
<v Speaker 8>times.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's just things you can't say.</v>

2205
01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:29.420
<v Speaker 8>And then there's worse things that you </v>
<v Speaker 8>can.</v>

2206
01:49:29.690 --> 01:49:33.800
<v Speaker 8>So it's weird because they don't censor </v>
<v Speaker 8>anybody who's calling for,</v>

2207
01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:34.281
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2208
01:49:34.281 --> 01:49:35.114
<v Speaker 8>to kill all the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's thousands of them just shared </v>

2209
01:49:38.211 --> 01:49:40.460
<v Speaker 8>about the not famous women with sitcoms.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2210
01:49:40.461 --> 01:49:42.110
<v Speaker 8>they are who,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2211
01:49:42.170 --> 01:49:43.550
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>people that are,</v>

2212
01:49:44.150 --> 01:49:46.730
<v Speaker 8>are tweeting support for Valerie </v>
<v Speaker 8>Jarrett,</v>

2213
01:49:49.230 --> 01:49:51.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're pissed at me and saying,</v>

2214
01:49:51.651 --> 01:49:52.484
<v Speaker 3>how could you say this about not saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because they're saying kill the </v>

2215
01:49:55.221 --> 01:49:56.240
<v Speaker 3>Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

2216
01:49:56.270 --> 01:50:01.120
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe know what your point was like.</v>

2217
01:50:01.130 --> 01:50:03.650
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know about her parentage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2218
01:50:03.651 --> 01:50:04.560
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

2219
01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.920
<v Speaker 3>this is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is who I am.</v>

2220
01:50:06.921 --> 01:50:08.270
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2221
01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:09.283
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2222
01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:10.213
<v Speaker 3>they did this too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not really saying kill the </v>

2223
01:50:11.841 --> 01:50:13.630
<v Speaker 3>Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a valid comparison.</v>

2224
01:50:13.930 --> 01:50:16.220
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that.</v>

2225
01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:18.920
<v Speaker 3>But the people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how it feels.</v>

2226
01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:23.250
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it feels that way to you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the people that are robust,</v>

2227
01:50:23.630 --> 01:50:25.970
<v Speaker 3>they're upset at you because they think </v>
<v Speaker 3>you said something racist.</v>

2228
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:28.990
<v Speaker 3>They're not saying kill the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2229
01:50:28.991 --> 01:50:33.710
<v Speaker 3>but they are to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2230
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:37.550
<v Speaker 3>You see how when people look at your </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

2231
01:50:37.670 --> 01:50:40.940
<v Speaker 3>I can see how they think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you see how when people look at your</v>

2232
01:50:40.941 --> 01:50:45.941
<v Speaker 3>situation and they think it's racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is also how you look at.</v>

2233
01:50:47.150 --> 01:50:47.983
<v Speaker 3>They're reacting to what they think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist and you thinking that they're </v>

2234
01:50:50.850 --> 01:50:52.070
<v Speaker 3>saying kill all the Jews.</v>

2235
01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:53.920
<v Speaker 8>They're saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2236
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:54.783
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Iran everyday threatens the Jewish </v>

2237
01:50:58.061 --> 01:51:01.930
<v Speaker 8>people in Israel with annihilation and </v>
<v Speaker 8>they've already survived,</v>

2238
01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:03.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not too long ago,</v>

2239
01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:05.680
<v Speaker 3>an annihilation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2240
01:51:05.681 --> 01:51:07.810
<v Speaker 3>and then we make a deal with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

2241
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:10.030
<v Speaker 3>What does that say something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that,</v>

2242
01:51:10.031 --> 01:51:10.864
<v Speaker 3>but this is many steps past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to me that you said a racist thing </v>

2243
01:51:15.070 --> 01:51:15.903
<v Speaker 3>or thinking you said a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And understand that they think I said a </v>

2244
01:51:18.701 --> 01:51:21.610
<v Speaker 3>racist thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that completely.</v>

2245
01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:25.120
<v Speaker 3>They have no idea that this had anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do with Jews versus Iran.</v>

2246
01:51:25.150 --> 01:51:27.740
<v Speaker 3>They really don't have any idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen that.</v>

2247
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.080
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen that registered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But because it's not important enough to</v>

2248
01:51:32.081 --> 01:51:32.914
<v Speaker 3>them to know that well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not been explained to </v>

2249
01:51:36.281 --> 01:51:37.360
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For one,</v>

2250
01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.520
<v Speaker 3>I know your position like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're,</v>

2251
01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:40.533
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about now I understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they might not even think it's </v>

2252
01:51:42.881 --> 01:51:43.714
<v Speaker 3>valid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if they went back and went over it </v>

2253
01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:48.640
<v Speaker 3>and you might disagree with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>political aspects of it.</v>

2254
01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're free to do that.</v>

2255
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:53.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to try to be know what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

2256
01:51:53.381 --> 01:51:55.690
<v Speaker 3>Like they're not the reason why I said </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a valid comparison.</v>

2257
01:51:55.691 --> 01:51:57.160
<v Speaker 3>They're not really saying kill the Jews,</v>

2258
01:51:57.490 --> 01:52:01.270
<v Speaker 8>but to me and to other Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they are in fact saying that.</v>

2259
01:52:02.150 --> 01:52:04.990
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and that's very common amongst us.</v>

2260
01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:06.760
<v Speaker 8>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's,</v>

2261
01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:13.140
<v Speaker 8>that's the truth that many of us think </v>
<v Speaker 8>and you know,</v>

2262
01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:18.420
<v Speaker 8>people are understand it or they don't </v>
<v Speaker 8>care to even consider it.</v>

2263
01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:21.070
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they don't have to,</v>

2264
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:25.030
<v Speaker 8>but I'm still going to say it because </v>
<v Speaker 8>that's the reality.</v>

2265
01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:30.700
<v Speaker 8>It's the reality to hear that and to </v>
<v Speaker 8>hear the United States wanting gave them</v>

2266
01:52:30.730 --> 01:52:31.563
<v Speaker 8>billions of our tax dollars when they're</v>
<v Speaker 8>the number one supporter of terror in </v>

2267
01:52:35.351 --> 01:52:38.060
<v Speaker 8>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It is and they always do Kale,</v>

2268
01:52:38.061 --> 01:52:43.030
<v Speaker 8>Jews like in Paris and wherever else </v>
<v Speaker 8>they go and they do it in London too.</v>

2269
01:52:43.031 --> 01:52:43.870
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2270
01:52:43.871 --> 01:52:46.490
<v Speaker 8>I hate to wake people up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you know,</v>

2271
01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:47.953
<v Speaker 8>it is important.</v>
<v Speaker 8>At least it is to me and to people like </v>

2272
01:52:50.721 --> 01:52:51.554
<v Speaker 8>me and to many other people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Many Christians is very important to </v>

2273
01:52:54.861 --> 01:52:56.070
<v Speaker 8>them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to their.</v>

2274
01:52:56.170 --> 01:52:59.750
<v Speaker 8>They're under onslaught too.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not exactly sure what you're talking</v>

2275
01:52:59.751 --> 01:53:00.584
<v Speaker 8>about because you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 8>Iranians killing people in Paris and </v>

2276
01:53:04.281 --> 01:53:05.114
<v Speaker 8>England.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm talking about being the number one </v>

2277
01:53:06.801 --> 01:53:09.980
<v Speaker 8>sponsor of terror in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Iran,</v>

2278
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:15.050
<v Speaker 8>but they're killing people in France and</v>
<v Speaker 8>England that are Jews.</v>

2279
01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:15.950
<v Speaker 8>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when?</v>

2280
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:17.240
<v Speaker 8>When is this happening?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2281
01:53:17.241 --> 01:53:20.540
<v Speaker 8>when they that theater and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 8>other times,</v>

2282
01:53:20.541 --> 01:53:25.541
<v Speaker 8>but there's a lot of Jewish woman to </v>
<v Speaker 8>death and her and her Paris apartment.</v>

2283
01:53:25.670 --> 01:53:28.730
<v Speaker 8>There's a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not saying they only killed Jews,</v>

2284
01:53:29.060 --> 01:53:29.893
<v Speaker 8>but they do kale juice and the money </v>
<v Speaker 8>goes back to those terrorist </v>

2285
01:53:35.001 --> 01:53:39.470
<v Speaker 8>organizations that are funded by Qatar </v>
<v Speaker 8>and Iran.</v>

2286
01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.290
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is a.</v>

2287
01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:44.350
<v Speaker 8>This is a pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 8>These,</v>

2288
01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:46.600
<v Speaker 8>these are general things you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

2289
01:53:46.601 --> 01:53:47.434
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's very general and there's 100 </v>

2290
01:53:48.911 --> 01:53:50.950
<v Speaker 8>shades.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's 100 shades,</v>

2291
01:53:50.951 --> 01:53:54.820
<v Speaker 8>but I'm just saying as a Jew with a </v>
<v Speaker 8>family in Israel,</v>

2292
01:53:55.090 --> 01:53:55.923
<v Speaker 8>this is what we think and this is how we</v>
<v Speaker 8>feel and to not even acknowledge that </v>

2293
01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:02.980
<v Speaker 8>and any discussion is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>disturbing.</v>

2294
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:03.823
<v Speaker 8>It should be factored in.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think it's a matter of not </v>

2295
01:54:05.471 --> 01:54:06.304
<v Speaker 8>acknowledging it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it should be factored in as </v>

2296
01:54:07.991 --> 01:54:08.824
<v Speaker 8>well.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're aware that this had anything to </v>

2297
01:54:10.181 --> 01:54:11.820
<v Speaker 8>do with your motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2298
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:13.780
<v Speaker 8>express.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've never read it anywhere,</v>

2299
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:17.130
<v Speaker 8>but you can't say it last time I'm </v>
<v Speaker 8>saying it.</v>

2300
01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:17.973
<v Speaker 8>He can't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not really smiled on to go against </v>

2301
01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:28.980
<v Speaker 8>the people who control our media and </v>
<v Speaker 8>say,</v>

2302
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:35.070
<v Speaker 8>especially social media and say that </v>
<v Speaker 8>you're pro Israel or you know,</v>

2303
01:54:35.591 --> 01:54:37.420
<v Speaker 8>that you think,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

2304
01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:43.070
<v Speaker 8>you don't think that the media will </v>
<v Speaker 8>allow you to be pro Israel.</v>

2305
01:54:43.130 --> 01:54:44.750
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that seems like a really common thing,</v>

2306
01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:47.450
<v Speaker 8>not on social media for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2307
01:54:47.451 --> 01:54:49.530
<v Speaker 8>it's very anti Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You'll,</v>

2308
01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:51.570
<v Speaker 8>I'll send you statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2309
01:54:51.571 --> 01:54:55.700
<v Speaker 8>I see some anti Israel sentiment and </v>
<v Speaker 8>especially in relation to a,</v>

2310
01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:57.890
<v Speaker 8>they treat the Palestinians</v>

2311
01:54:59.850 --> 01:55:01.740
<v Speaker 8>like I see a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2312
01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:04.700
<v Speaker 8>I'm not going to play into either of </v>
<v Speaker 8>those because I,</v>

2313
01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:06.580
<v Speaker 8>I really believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2314
01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:08.610
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a solution to that problem.</v>

2315
01:55:08.611 --> 01:55:11.070
<v Speaker 8>The solution is pace and I think it can </v>
<v Speaker 8>be achieved.</v>

2316
01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:14.910
<v Speaker 8>So I'm not going to play either one of </v>
<v Speaker 8>those games about who does this or what.</v>

2317
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:18.180
<v Speaker 8>I'd just like to see a solution that </v>
<v Speaker 8>works for all the people.</v>

2318
01:55:18.181 --> 01:55:21.750
<v Speaker 8>They're all people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're so,</v>

2319
01:55:21.751 --> 01:55:22.584
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it can be but it can't be if one </v>

2320
01:55:26.101 --> 01:55:29.520
<v Speaker 8>side has been completely censored and </v>
<v Speaker 8>it,</v>

2321
01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:34.550
<v Speaker 8>that isn't a discussion or is it a </v>
<v Speaker 8>debate and nor is it an American scary.</v>

2322
01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:38.340
<v Speaker 8>It's scary times when,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2323
01:55:38.610 --> 01:55:39.443
<v Speaker 8>like on our college campuses today,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know this because my son was on one </v>

2324
01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:46.410
<v Speaker 8>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a far left far left.</v>

2325
01:55:46.411 --> 01:55:51.030
<v Speaker 8>Professors that espouse that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>stuff daily in all of our colleges.</v>

2326
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:55.620
<v Speaker 8>And it does find its way to the media.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You look at the media that most,</v>

2327
01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:57.833
<v Speaker 8>what are they called,</v>
<v Speaker 8>millennium millennials consume and it's </v>

2328
01:56:00.811 --> 01:56:02.210
<v Speaker 8>heavily,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2329
01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:06.830
<v Speaker 8>to the left it is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so that's where they're informing.</v>

2330
01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:07.810
<v Speaker 8>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they,</v>

2331
01:56:07.850 --> 01:56:08.683
<v Speaker 8>they are getting their opinions from </v>
<v Speaker 8>only hearing one side of things on </v>

2332
01:56:12.631 --> 01:56:14.640
<v Speaker 8>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I don't think that's good.</v>

2333
01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:15.773
<v Speaker 8>I don't think it's good that all </v>
<v Speaker 8>conservative voices are being censored </v>

2334
01:56:18.691 --> 01:56:20.420
<v Speaker 8>off twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2335
01:56:20.570 --> 01:56:22.650
<v Speaker 8>and not all,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I shouldn't say all,</v>

2336
01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:26.700
<v Speaker 8>but so many are because that's a way to </v>
<v Speaker 8>shut down discussion to.</v>

2337
01:56:26.850 --> 01:56:28.950
<v Speaker 8>There's quite a few conservative voices </v>
<v Speaker 8>on twitter,</v>

2338
01:56:28.951 --> 01:56:29.784
<v Speaker 8>but some are when they think they're </v>
<v Speaker 8>inflammatory or they think they're </v>

2339
01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:33.990
<v Speaker 8>espousing hate.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2340
01:56:34.250 --> 01:56:35.083
<v Speaker 8>But they get to decide that you're this </v>
<v Speaker 8>deciding that it's people who are </v>

2341
01:56:39.061 --> 01:56:40.650
<v Speaker 8>heavily political.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

2342
01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:42.600
<v Speaker 8>That's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It shouldn't be.</v>

2343
01:56:44.490 --> 01:56:45.323
<v Speaker 8>It should be more in the middle where </v>
<v Speaker 8>we're both sides are considered to come </v>

2344
01:56:48.361 --> 01:56:49.194
<v Speaker 8>to a consensus means is a diverse </v>
<v Speaker 8>opinion and that's how you reach </v>

2345
01:56:53.281 --> 01:56:54.114
<v Speaker 8>consensus.</v>

2346
01:56:54.210 --> 01:56:55.043
<v Speaker 8>You don't get a consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So nor solution from only listening to </v>

2347
01:56:58.111 --> 01:57:01.530
<v Speaker 8>one side blather on the same ship for 20</v>
<v Speaker 8>years.</v>

2348
01:57:02.150 --> 01:57:04.290
<v Speaker 8>That keeps people fighting at each </v>
<v Speaker 8>other,</v>

2349
01:57:04.370 --> 01:57:07.260
<v Speaker 8>not always fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it recruits people for the other</v>

2350
01:57:07.261 --> 01:57:08.094
<v Speaker 8>side.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it does the opposite of its </v>

2351
01:57:08.731 --> 01:57:11.190
<v Speaker 8>intended effect.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's one of my friends said.</v>

2352
01:57:11.191 --> 01:57:15.450
<v Speaker 8>He said he thinks Michael Moore.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's Michael Moore's role since he's a</v>

2353
01:57:15.451 --> 01:57:18.210
<v Speaker 8>billionaire too,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that he's a billionaire.</v>

2354
01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:20.100
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they said this is what they said.</v>

2355
01:57:20.101 --> 01:57:22.530
<v Speaker 8>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's in that vein.</v>

2356
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:23.431
<v Speaker 8>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

2357
01:57:23.431 --> 01:57:24.264
<v Speaker 8>he did get so many people to vote for </v>
<v Speaker 8>trump when he said that stuff about </v>

2358
01:57:27.841 --> 01:57:30.630
<v Speaker 8>people are angry and they don't think he</v>
<v Speaker 8>did it on purpose.</v>

2359
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:35.750
<v Speaker 8>I think a lot of people credit him for </v>
<v Speaker 8>voting for trump for that speech.</v>

2360
01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:36.933
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm sure my friend said maybe he's a </v>

2361
01:57:39.181 --> 01:57:41.090
<v Speaker 8>double agent,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which I don't think he.</v>

2362
01:57:41.490 --> 01:57:44.910
<v Speaker 8>I think this is one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 8>happens when it's like when,</v>

2363
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:49.970
<v Speaker 8>when when you give people that much </v>
<v Speaker 8>suppression and you,</v>

2364
01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:53.660
<v Speaker 8>you try to indoctrinate people into </v>
<v Speaker 8>thinking a certain way,</v>

2365
01:57:53.690 --> 01:57:54.523
<v Speaker 8>there's going to be people that </v>
<v Speaker 8>resistant a large help sell and seems </v>

2366
01:57:56.980 --> 01:57:57.813
<v Speaker 8>larger and larger,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but freedom of thought is the basis of </v>

2367
01:58:00.031 --> 01:58:03.360
<v Speaker 8>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not freedom of speech or freedom of</v>

2368
01:58:03.361 --> 01:58:07.680
<v Speaker 8>religion and freedom of expression,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the second amendment,</v>

2369
01:58:07.770 --> 01:58:08.603
<v Speaker 8>those are symptoms of freedom of thought</v>
<v Speaker 8>and it did good to consume endless </v>

2370
01:58:14.851 --> 01:58:19.851
<v Speaker 8>propaganda and never have it broken down</v>
<v Speaker 8>or a or debated or pointed out that it's</v>

2371
01:58:22.021 --> 01:58:22.854
<v Speaker 8>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There is an issue when you're only </v>

2372
01:58:25.351 --> 01:58:26.184
<v Speaker 8>getting one side of the argument and the</v>
<v Speaker 8>people that are controlling the media </v>

2373
01:58:28.711 --> 01:58:32.610
<v Speaker 8>only want that one side expressed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That is a problem.</v>

2374
01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:34.073
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and the thing too that right now in </v>

2375
01:58:35.371 --> 01:58:39.510
<v Speaker 8>terms of wing version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well because they won't let it happen,</v>

2376
01:58:39.610 --> 01:58:41.010
<v Speaker 8>but who's they?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2377
01:58:41.110 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 8>people that are in charge</v>

2378
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:44.410
<v Speaker 3>of programming the networks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want that.</v>

2379
01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:47.740
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seemed to always lean left.</v>

2380
01:58:47.741 --> 01:58:52.741
<v Speaker 3>I mean technologically oriented </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies and corporations always almost</v>

2381
01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:56.350
<v Speaker 3>invariably lean left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think that is?</v>

2382
01:58:56.410 --> 01:58:58.510
<v Speaker 3>They're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're educated,</v>

2383
01:58:58.570 --> 01:59:02.430
<v Speaker 3>they're fresh out of college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The colleges are indoctrinating leftwing</v>

2384
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:03.303
<v Speaker 3>kids and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a vast majority of professors </v>

2385
01:59:06.461 --> 01:59:09.910
<v Speaker 3>at universities all across the country </v>
<v Speaker 3>that identify as Democrats.</v>

2386
01:59:10.050 --> 01:59:10.883
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the indoctrination they get </v>

2387
01:59:12.701 --> 01:59:15.300
<v Speaker 3>from people that they respect deeply and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're learning from.</v>

2388
01:59:15.301 --> 01:59:19.390
<v Speaker 3>And there's also an understanding that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the way you advance,</v>

2389
01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:22.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when someone comes out that has</v>

2390
01:59:22.181 --> 01:59:23.014
<v Speaker 3>anything diminish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't think that it has a brain </v>

2391
01:59:26.381 --> 01:59:27.214
<v Speaker 3>center that'll coordinate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not coordinated in terms of the </v>

2392
01:59:30.521 --> 01:59:31.354
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what's happening in the </v>

2393
01:59:32.621 --> 01:59:35.050
<v Speaker 3>universities is you've get people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

2394
01:59:35.051 --> 01:59:35.884
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're existing in this bizarre glass </v>

2395
01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:40.893
<v Speaker 3>walled garden where they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go to universities to get </v>

2396
01:59:45.071 --> 01:59:47.860
<v Speaker 3>indoctrinated into this left wing </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultures and then they start teaching at</v>

2397
01:59:47.861 --> 01:59:48.410
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>

2398
01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:49.900
<v Speaker 3>So they never get out into the real </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2399
01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:50.913
<v Speaker 3>And then they teach children these </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts and ideas and then most of the </v>

2400
01:59:54.401 --> 01:59:56.710
<v Speaker 3>kids leave and they take these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else.</v>

2401
01:59:56.830 --> 02:00:00.250
<v Speaker 3>And then slowly over time they become </v>
<v Speaker 3>more moderate.</v>

2402
02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:05.280
<v Speaker 3>Most of them do or they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they reject those ideas and either go to</v>

2403
02:00:05.381 --> 02:00:07.990
<v Speaker 3>the center or go right or some of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>stay left.</v>

2404
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:12.790
<v Speaker 3>But when they go into tech companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them go center,</v>

2405
02:00:12.791 --> 02:00:14.890
<v Speaker 3>which is I think probably where sanity </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

2406
02:00:15.190 --> 02:00:16.023
<v Speaker 3>I think Saturday is somewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>center and I think discussion is </v>

2407
02:00:19.151 --> 02:00:19.984
<v Speaker 3>critical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of friends that are </v>

2408
02:00:20.831 --> 02:00:21.664
<v Speaker 3>Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of friends that are </v>

2409
02:00:22.331 --> 02:00:24.730
<v Speaker 3>liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing wrong with either either</v>

2410
02:00:24.731 --> 02:00:25.564
<v Speaker 3>mindset and the only way we find out </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not we really agree or </v>

2411
02:00:29.471 --> 02:00:30.304
<v Speaker 3>disagree is we let people express </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and as soon as you suppress </v>

2412
02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:35.860
<v Speaker 3>that kind of expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you run into real problems.</v>

2413
02:00:36.130 --> 02:00:39.540
<v Speaker 3>That's absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I wanted on my show that</v>

2414
02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:41.560
<v Speaker 3>I would show that there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2415
02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:46.510
<v Speaker 3>a trump lover and a trump hater in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same house and they managed to deal with</v>

2416
02:00:46.511 --> 02:00:48.400
<v Speaker 3>it and get on with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great,</v>

2417
02:00:48.670 --> 02:00:49.503
<v Speaker 3>that's a great premise for a show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was one of the reasons why I </v>

2418
02:00:51.311 --> 02:00:54.640
<v Speaker 3>think people loved it so much is because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was that conflict.</v>

2419
02:00:55.090 --> 02:00:58.870
<v Speaker 3>And because look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can love a lovable curmudgeon.</v>

2420
02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:01.960
<v Speaker 3>People can love someone who has ideas </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they disagree with.</v>

2421
02:01:01.961 --> 02:01:02.794
<v Speaker 3>People can love someone who lives with </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who has a completely opposing </v>

2422
02:01:06.791 --> 02:01:08.560
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They figure it out and they get along.</v>

2423
02:01:08.890 --> 02:01:10.210
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

2424
02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:12.810
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my boyfriend,</v>

2425
02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:15.130
<v Speaker 3>my boyfriend said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a mistake,</v>

2426
02:01:15.131 --> 02:01:17.800
<v Speaker 3>is that you put a cramp in the hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

2427
02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:20.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that just you,</v>

2428
02:01:20.261 --> 02:01:22.540
<v Speaker 3>just you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you became a target.</v>

2429
02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:25.300
<v Speaker 3>You fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were happy from the beginning.</v>

2430
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:27.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they really wanted me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come back.</v>

2431
02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:28.713
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a certain amount of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they found out that you're a trump </v>

2432
02:01:30.671 --> 02:01:35.290
<v Speaker 3>supporter and then the show became </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful and Donald Trump loved it and</v>

2433
02:01:35.291 --> 02:01:36.124
<v Speaker 3>then trump supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lafayette was a trouble maker and a big </v>

2434
02:01:38.321 --> 02:01:39.710
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've always thought that,</v>

2435
02:01:39.890 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2436
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:40.873
<v Speaker 1>you're a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know and everybody remembers when you </v>

2437
02:01:42.921 --> 02:01:45.800
<v Speaker 1>sang the national anthem and grabbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>your crotch and spit on the ground.</v>

2438
02:01:45.870 --> 02:01:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do that.</v>

2439
02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:52.910
<v Speaker 1>When you do that gastric bypass thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that something they can reverse?</v>

2440
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:56.360
<v Speaker 1>They could reverse it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what the hell?</v>

2441
02:01:56.361 --> 02:01:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundred books.</v>

2442
02:01:58.131 --> 02:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>You really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't,</v>

2443
02:02:01.710 --> 02:02:05.030
<v Speaker 1>would you just everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

2444
02:02:05.031 --> 02:02:05.864
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all I had it because I couldn't </v>

2445
02:02:08.151 --> 02:02:10.700
<v Speaker 1>stop talking about addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Impulsive,</v>

2446
02:02:10.701 --> 02:02:11.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2447
02:02:11.781 --> 02:02:14.360
<v Speaker 1>All Day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eclairs what have you.</v>

2448
02:02:16.230 --> 02:02:19.100
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate those goddamn things.</v>

2449
02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Claire's no got gastric bypass </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgeries.</v>

2450
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:24.390

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2451
02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:25.273
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just wish there was a better way </v>

2452
02:02:27.250 --> 02:02:28.083
<v Speaker 1>just because it fucks up your nutrient </v>
<v Speaker 1>absorption abilities like you were </v>

2453
02:02:30.351 --> 02:02:31.840
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2454

<v Speaker 1>I mean I've heard that from several </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2455
02:02:33.651 --> 02:02:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I know guys who have gotten in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental state.</v>

2456
02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:38.390

<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

2457
02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:39.433
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2458
02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:41.560
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it has to do with the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2459
02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:43.100
<v Speaker 1>the health of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2460
02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:44.390
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>

2461
02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:48.140
<v Speaker 1>your ability to absorb nutrients affects</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2462
02:02:48.141 --> 02:02:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Your mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your energy levels,</v>

2463
02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:51.573
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean food doesn't get in there the </v>

2464
02:02:53.091 --> 02:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2465
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>I just lay in bed till they called for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me enough to stumble in and do my thing.</v>

2466
02:02:59.781 --> 02:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Go back to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had no energy in Brazil.</v>

2467
02:03:03.090 --> 02:03:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you do something like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this,</v>

2468
02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:06.793
<v Speaker 1>this conversation with these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do this on your time whenever </v>

2469
02:03:10.251 --> 02:03:11.084
<v Speaker 1>you want to do it without anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you what to say or what not to </v>

2470
02:03:14.421 --> 02:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>say without any executives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without anybody to fire you.</v>

2471
02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>You Diy Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kick you off everything they could,</v>

2472
02:03:23.271 --> 02:03:25.730
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on top of that,</v>

2473
02:03:25.731 --> 02:03:27.200
<v Speaker 1>you could do it off of your own website.</v>

2474
02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:29.270
<v Speaker 1>You could do it on Roseanne Barr Dot </v>
<v Speaker 1>com.</v>

2475
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2476
02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:35.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm always afraid they'll come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like,</v>

2477
02:03:35.091 --> 02:03:35.924
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this the time of my life from 66 is </v>

2478
02:03:38.271 --> 02:03:40.040
<v Speaker 1>probably the time for me to just lay </v>
<v Speaker 1>low.</v>

2479
02:03:40.041 --> 02:03:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Does stand up sometimes and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great idea.</v>

2480
02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:44.420
<v Speaker 1>That's even better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2481
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Go do that then and show us some of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>farming videos,</v>

2482
02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:49.653
<v Speaker 1>listen to people like to know about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to grow food and I'm really good at </v>

2483
02:03:52.071 --> 02:03:52.904
<v Speaker 1>growing food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do stand up and you go on a </v>

2484
02:03:54.711 --> 02:03:55.544
<v Speaker 1>tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be hugely </v>

2485
02:03:56.601 --> 02:03:58.370
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

2486
02:03:58.490 --> 02:03:59.323
<v Speaker 1>I think people are going to come out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>droves and I think it's going to be </v>

2487
02:04:00.531 --> 02:04:04.130
<v Speaker 1>awesome and I think once you get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>legs under you and you start doing a few</v>

2488
02:04:04.131 --> 02:04:07.050
<v Speaker 1>shows and get things cracking again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like the Rosanna.</v>

2489
02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Do you be crushing it?</v>

2490
02:04:08.450 --> 02:04:12.860
<v Speaker 1>I was crushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say in my tour of Canada,</v>

2491
02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I was crushing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a blast I had.</v>

2492
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had the most fun,</v>

2493
02:04:19.131 --> 02:04:23.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get like 90 minutes of beautiful control</v>

2494
02:04:23.151 --> 02:04:24.230
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2495
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:25.131

2496
02:04:25.131 --> 02:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>bing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2497
02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:29.330
<v Speaker 1>I've got like a big laugh every 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds and beautiful,</v>

2498
02:04:29.331 --> 02:04:32.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tailor it and craft it and love it.</v>

2499
02:04:32.690 --> 02:04:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Love the people that come out to see me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then five diverse crowd too,</v>

2500
02:04:37.411 --> 02:04:38.700
<v Speaker 1>which is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2501
02:04:38.710 --> 02:04:39.543
<v Speaker 1>I bet it'd be even more diverse now </v>
<v Speaker 1>while it's going to be way better I </v>

2502
02:04:41.731 --> 02:04:42.564
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm going to really start </v>

2503
02:04:43.261 --> 02:04:44.094
<v Speaker 1>talking about the real me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as my abhorrence and fear of </v>

2504
02:04:47.011 --> 02:04:49.560
<v Speaker 1>serpents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serpents.</v>

2505
02:04:49.590 --> 02:04:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always have been.</v>

2506
02:04:50.910 --> 02:04:53.200

<v Speaker 1>I won't,</v>

2507
02:04:54.210 --> 02:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>don't go to the swamps for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard about what's going on there?</v>

2508
02:04:57.420 --> 02:05:01.470
<v Speaker 1>What with people releasing pythons all </v>
<v Speaker 1>know over decades.</v>

2509
02:05:01.471 --> 02:05:04.740
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida is overrun with pythons.</v>

2510
02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:05.633
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Non Native Pythons because people </v>

2511
02:05:07.561 --> 02:05:10.350
<v Speaker 1>released them as pets and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved to the swamps and bread.</v>

2512
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've eaten everything.</v>

2513
02:05:12.270 --> 02:05:16.500
<v Speaker 1>There's almost no mammals in the swamps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2514
02:05:16.501 --> 02:05:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Said 99 percent of all raccoons are </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

2515
02:05:19.770 --> 02:05:20.603
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't find any marsh rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't find any bobcat's and the </v>

2516
02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:27.340
<v Speaker 1>pythons and started eating alligators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2517
02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:31.020
<v Speaker 1>thousands of them out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say the world's gone nuts.</v>

2518
02:05:31.140 --> 02:05:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay away from Florida.</v>

2519

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2520
02:05:34.441 --> 02:05:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I had A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a turtle that kind of felt.</v>

2521
02:05:37.230 --> 02:05:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Are we done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2522
02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean we can be done or we can keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

2523
02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this turtle that fell in love with</v>

2524
02:05:42.481 --> 02:05:44.690
<v Speaker 1>me wanting to meet with me and Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2525
02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:46.080
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2526
02:05:46.081 --> 02:05:49.530
<v Speaker 1>This is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really afraid of serpents.</v>

2527

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2530
02:05:55.051 --> 02:05:58.200
<v Speaker 1>don't touch the turtles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a $5,000</v>

2531
02:05:58.950 --> 02:06:03.180
<v Speaker 1>fine or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't touch those big old things.</v>

2532
02:06:03.890 --> 02:06:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Sound like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2533
02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:06.330
<v Speaker 1>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Jew.</v>

2534
02:06:06.331 --> 02:06:07.860
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as I hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2535
02:06:07.861 --> 02:06:09.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fuck them.</v>

2536
02:06:09.001 --> 02:06:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm catching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did.</v>

2537
02:06:11.970 --> 02:06:12.803
<v Speaker 1>And then it turned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it went and started swimming around me </v>

2538
02:06:16.050 --> 02:06:16.883
<v Speaker 1>and then it went in this big circle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's head came out of the water in it </v>

2539
02:06:20.551 --> 02:06:22.110
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I me,</v>

2540
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:24.660
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Christ,</v>

2541
02:06:24.661 --> 02:06:27.390
<v Speaker 1>it's the serpent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been afraid of my own life.</v>

2542
02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:30.330
<v Speaker 1>And he chased me onto the shore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

2543
02:06:30.331 --> 02:06:33.780
<v Speaker 1>that's why we don't touch the turtles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they bond with you.</v>

2544
02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy wants me to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Merriam.</v>

2545
02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you touch them,</v>

2546
02:06:38.821 --> 02:06:40.650
<v Speaker 1>they like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2547
02:06:40.651 --> 02:06:45.651
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll go for it as a terrifying.</v>

2548
02:06:47.610 --> 02:06:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I've seen them in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking cool to look at.</v>

2549
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:51.223
<v Speaker 1>Their swimming are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like a little Volkswagen with </v>

2550
02:06:53.521 --> 02:06:54.354
<v Speaker 1>these four paddles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serpent head coming out and like this </v>

2551
02:06:57.630 --> 02:07:00.140
<v Speaker 1>where they look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my,</v>

2552
02:07:01.050 --> 02:07:04.050
<v Speaker 1>that's how I left it locked eyes with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2553
02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:07.370
<v Speaker 1>he did like this side by side.</v>

2554
02:07:10.230 --> 02:07:11.310
<v Speaker 1>They go side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll.</v>

2555
02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:12.153
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2556
02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:15.750
<v Speaker 1>it was terrible to think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrifying.</v>

2557
02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never gotten back in that water.</v>

2558
02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah I could see where that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a problem and I have a lot of serpent</v>

2559
02:07:23.581 --> 02:07:24.414
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also like when I see people I can </v>

2560
02:07:26.341 --> 02:07:29.340
<v Speaker 1>see if they're a serpent or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how they say the Reptilian.</v>

2561
02:07:29.790 --> 02:07:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Like I told my kids this the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing ever.</v>

2562
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Type Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I really do see them now.</v>

2563
02:07:35.770 --> 02:07:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I sort</v>

2564
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:38.470
<v Speaker 8>of believe him.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's gone down a rabbit hole.</v>

2565
02:07:38.471 --> 02:07:41.800
<v Speaker 8>That guy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's more like a,</v>

2566
02:07:42.190 --> 02:07:46.210
<v Speaker 8>like a gopher hole somewhere real deep </v>
<v Speaker 8>into the core of the earth.</v>

2567
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:50.860
<v Speaker 8>But he talks about that stuff anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now he kinda laid it back.</v>

2568
02:07:50.861 --> 02:07:52.960
<v Speaker 8>But that's because I confronted him.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Dude,</v>

2569
02:07:52.961 --> 02:07:55.030
<v Speaker 8>you just lost it.</v>
