1
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.360
The joe rogan experience podcast comes at you again.

2
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.750
Oh,

uh,
with laptop on old school.
Old School.
Retard moves.

3
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.330
That's me.
Fuckers.
I can't get it right.
Ever.

4
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.440
We're brought to you by several things,
but before we even get to that,
um,

5
00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:23.590
we got Brian and um,

6
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.550
Thompson Gaura and Tony Hinchcliffe has some fucking shows coming up in Ohio

7
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.600
that are awesome.
Uh,
one of them sold out already.
The Columbus one is sold out,

8
00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:32.000
right?

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.880
<v 2>Yeah.
The first show of Columbia sold out.
Second one is almost sold out.</v>

10
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.370
And then there's your also doing date,
Dayton,
Ohio,

11
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.220
Thursday and then Cincinnati Friday.
And we decided to put out a ticket,

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.670
a coupon code there that will give you two for one tickets.

13
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:50.790
It's Red Cross and 10% of the proceeds go to hurricane relief for,

14
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.520
it's beautiful for Florida.
That's beautiful.
And a on top of that,

15
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.820
you will,
it's not floor.
Would that be fucked up if it's like,
yeah,

16
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.900
we're collecting hurricane money and we're,
it's going to send it to Texas.
Yeah.

17
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.490
There's a couple of people that lost their fences.
How far did it go in?
Eh,

18
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.390
it went in pretty deep.
I know Ohio got jacked by it,
but it started up north,

19
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:13.520
right?
Yeah.
Started up to super annoying.
We'll start.

20
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:16.150
It was in the Caribbean though,
but then when it touched down in America,

21
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.410
touchdown North Jersey,

22
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.540
it killed so many people in the Caribbean and we don't even paying attention to

23
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:24.620
that about the superstorm.
They're going to get Wednesday.
Yeah,

24
00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:26.720
they're getting a superstorm Wednesday.
That's supposedly,

25
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.360
it's going to have winds up to 65 miles per hour.

26
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.150
That's just going to hit New York again and so it's going to just fuck

27
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:35.720
everything up again.
Oh my God.
Fuck that man.

28
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:39.530
Fuck living on the east coast.
Yeah.
Fuck all that hurricane nonsense.

29
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.360
That stuff's nuts for tickets.
Oh good.
It does.
Quad that TV or a brown paper.

30
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:47.000
tickets.com and search for a deck squat and another show news.

31
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:52.001
I'm at the Balboa theatre this Saturday night in San Diego with a Joey Diaz,

32
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:57.650
Aka mad flavor.
So are you coming?
What are you doing?
Uh,
what Thursday?

33
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.790
No Saturday sat around.
I'm in Columbus,
Ohio.
This same date.

34
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.990
Okay.
So if you're on the west coast folks and trying to stay alive,
not freeze,

35
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:10.550
you'd tick off.
Yeah.
Bow,
bullet theater,
San Diego,
Columbus,
Ohio,

36
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.880
Dayton and Cincinnati with Brian,

37
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.920
who's fucking killing it lately.

38
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.850
Brian killed it this weekend in San Francisco and killed it in Seattle.

39
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:23.990
Even better,
man.
It was,
you're really getting funny,
man.
It's,
it's fun to watch,

40
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.780
fun to watch you add new shit and growing and stuff.
Well,

41
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:30.020
you gave me great advice.
Just be more silly.
And so I,
I've yourself,
yeah,

42
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:33.230
I'm just being,
it's hard trying to be yourself 100%.
You're almost like,

43
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.270
I just want to get through this joke and make it perfect.

44
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.810
Instead of just being like Utah telling a friend at joke or something.
Yeah.

45
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:42.100
You're getting to be,
you're just getting more comfortable on stage.

46
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.410
They already like you.
So it's,

47
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:45.500
it's a different sort of a scenario you're learning.

48
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.490
Stand up in front of a bunch of people who already like you,
which is a huge,

49
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:53.360
huge advantage.
But a,
the crowds are awesome.
So thanks.
Uh,
San Francisco,

50
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:56.630
people in Seattle,
people was fucking awesome.
We had,
we had an amazing weekend.

51
00:02:56.631 --> 00:03:01.480
Greg Fitzsimmons crushed it.
So funny.
Oh,
he's hilarious.
He's much funnier.

52
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.100
Even then.
I've seen him lately.
I mean he's always been great,
but he was like,

53
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.160
he was on fire this weekend and it was like the perfect kind of crowd for him.

54
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.680
They were all savages.
Um,
so thanks for that.

55
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:14.740
Before we even get into any commercials,
look at this real quick.
Yeah.

56
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:18.070
This is from the,
just to show you,
you're going on stage.

57
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.460
<v 0>This is in San Francisco.</v>

58
00:03:39.561 --> 00:03:44.561
[inaudible] [inaudible]

59
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.040
<v 2>bizarre.
Soon we will start to cope,
but not yet.</v>

60
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.690
The job experiences buzzard by Ting Ting,
ting,

61
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.790
ting is that felt cope with just sitting here going,

62
00:04:01.791 --> 00:04:04.190
what the fuck did I get myself into?
Man,

63
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.550
I was hoping I was just going to go here and promote my awesome book.

64
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.950
I got to deal with these assholes.
That nonsense.
Ting is a,
uh,

65
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.870
it's a cell phone company that uses the backbone of sprint.

66
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.570
It is an excellent cell phone company.

67
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.380
What they're doing is they're giving you the same service as far as like your

68
00:04:21.381 --> 00:04:24.230
reception and everything that you would get with a major provider.

69
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.960
But they're doing it in a very,

70
00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:31.130
in what I believe are very ethical and fair way.
They're there,
first of all,

71
00:04:31.131 --> 00:04:32.960
they're offering their service with no contracts.

72
00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:36.200
You don't have to have a contract that you have to cancel and pay a bunch of

73
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:39.020
fucking money back for that.
That shit's gross.

74
00:04:39.021 --> 00:04:41.870
That you got to pay them to get out of your cell phone contract.

75
00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:46.130
That's ridiculous.
That's a competition issue.
That's all that is.
I mean,

76
00:04:46.131 --> 00:04:48.800
could you,
uh,
could you imagine if that was the case for any other service?

77
00:04:48.801 --> 00:04:51.680
Like if you every wanted to get a,
a gallon of milk,

78
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.040
you had to continue to give these people money and buy their milk.

79
00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:56.840
Or if you didn't do that,

80
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.270
you would have to pay them because you're not going to buy their milk anymore

81
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.180
and be like,
what the fuck are you talking about?
Guess what?

82
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.390
Cause the same thing with a cell phone company.
It's nuts.
We're just,

83
00:05:05.391 --> 00:05:10.010
we just accepted this silly stupid fucking way and the way they get away with
it,

84
00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:13.940
as they trick you into thinking you're paying less for a phone than you are,

85
00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:18.410
so they sorta like roll the money that you would have spent if you bought the

86
00:05:18.411 --> 00:05:19.670
phone for full price.

87
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.470
They sort of roll that into your bill and that's how they justify giving you a a

88
00:05:24.471 --> 00:05:25.820
cancellation fee.

89
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.690
But really what it is is it's like a way of strong arming you in sticking
around.

90
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.600
They got your bitch.
You don't want to give up that 300 bucks.

91
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.620
Well that's not the case with Ting and with tin there.
They're there.
So Fair.

92
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.730
In fact that if you only like,
say there's,
there's different tiered programs,

93
00:05:40.731 --> 00:05:43.640
but if you use one program you will use like half the minutes you thought you

94
00:05:43.641 --> 00:05:46.550
did well,
they discount you on the next month.

95
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.850
I mean it's like the coolest setup you could ever hope for.

96
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.260
They have awesome devices.

97
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.350
If you go to rogan.ting.com they have it set up so that you say 50 bucks off

98
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.160
your first

99
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.941
<v 1>Tang device.</v>

100
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.460
You just click that link and check out all the different devices they have.

101
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:05.870
They have top of the line android phones.
I have the Samsung Galaxy s three.

102
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:08.930
That's the only one that I can talk about that I've actually used personally.

103
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.460
It's the only one I've actually used since the,

104
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:14.120
I had an old droid and there was a piece of shit.
It was terrible.
It had like a,

105
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:18.440
it's like a keyboard.
It was wack.
But this thing is Badass.

106
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.210
This is a very,
very good

107
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.840
<v 3>I've had is I noticed in Seattle,
everyone had that phone.</v>

108
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.030
I saw that more than iPhone.

109
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.810
<v 1>It's a killer phone.
It's,
there's no denying it.
That thing's the shit.
And uh,</v>

110
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.910
it's um,
it's legit.
Like there's,

111
00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:34.480
there's been some phones in the past where people are good.
You know,
this,

112
00:06:34.481 --> 00:06:39.010
my windows phones just as good as your iPhone.
Ah,
no,
it's not,
it's just not,

113
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.340
the android is the first time I've ever seen a real solid argument for it

114
00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:48.250
actually being better.
It has a way bigger screen.
The screen is amazing.

115
00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:51.550
The galaxy STD screen,
it's incredible that the pictures are beautiful.

116
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.150
It's way better for doing like online shit.

117
00:06:55.151 --> 00:06:57.160
If you want to like go online and check out websites,

118
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.250
there's no denying that that bigger screen is fucking way better.

119
00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:01.660
It's just better,
you know?

120
00:07:01.661 --> 00:07:05.890
So then it comes down to texting and phone calls and it's great at those.

121
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.640
So what else do you need?
You know when it gets,

122
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.780
I'm seriously thinking about not using iPhones anymore,
especially with all this,

123
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.500
this concept.
I'm not kidding.
This is nonsense with the fucking maps,

124
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.221
you know,

125
00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:22.060
and the one guy quit because he didn't want to apologize for maps and they took

126
00:07:22.061 --> 00:07:25.060
youtube off the like,
you don't just automatically get youtube,

127
00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:26.410
you got to go get it as an APP.

128
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.301
<v 3>No,
it is a,</v>

129
00:07:27.301 --> 00:07:32.301
it's a nicer app and the Google maps APP is going to be out any day now.

130
00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:35.410
So that's going to be better.
And once that happens,
then I,
yeah,

131
00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:37.160
it's back to normal.
But I'm telling you need to

132
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.050
<v 1>get ahold of Ting Tang.
If you're listening,</v>

133
00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:42.630
we need to get Brian a Samsung galaxy s three because,
well,

134
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.540
how come I've never figured this out.
Why?

135
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.460
How can we talk about this in the beginning of every podcast?

136
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:51.250
I don't get you a fucking phone.
Fuck,
I'm,
I know no show is this.
No,

137
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.820
no,
no.
You'd break it down immediately,

138
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.070
but I did with the iPad this week while you do it with everything,

139
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:59.390
you were fucking,
you're weird.
You're weird.
There were dude,
really love it.
Uh,

140
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.230
but look,
I,
I firmly endorsed Tang.
It's fucking bad ass company.
Um,
you can get,

141
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.840
you could split a plan and he's like,

142
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.840
you can split the minutes with your girlfriend or your wife or your,
your buddy,

143
00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:13.190
what do whatever you want to do.
Um,
there's a lot of different flexible options.

144
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:16.310
It's a,
it's just an excellent company and that's the only things that will,

145
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:18.170
we're ever gonna support on this podcast,

146
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.180
whether it's an audible.com or on it.com or anything we support.

147
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.040
We are 100% in a supporting ethical companies that are cool,

148
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.750
that sell products that we believe in.
That's really it.
You know when,

149
00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:36.410
when we sell Alpha brain and we sell shroom tech sport or any of the products

150
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:39.110
from on it,
I use all that shit.

151
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:43.580
I've used all that shit way before I ever had any sort of a,

152
00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:48.350
a business connection to it.
I,
I've always been a fan of,

153
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:52.880
uh,
first of all healthy food.
I mean,
that's just like a Duh,
you have to say that,

154
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:56.370
but it is something that's super important to constantly reinforce.

155
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.540
The more nutrients you take in your body,
the better your body works.

156
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.850
The more water you drink,
the better your body works.

157
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:07.650
I'm not saying only eat perfect.
I will fuck off and have chocolate cake.

158
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.020
I,
um,
I like to have a diet coke.

159
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.070
Every now and again I'll give myself like one or two diet cokes a week.
You know,

160
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.310
it's not,
it's not eliminate all this shit from your diet,

161
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:21.780
but if you have a diet that is rich in nutrients,
especially phytonutrients,

162
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:26.280
plant nutrients,
like a strong stuff like Kale and spinach,

163
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:31.350
it's just better for your fucking life,
man.
It's just better taking nutrients,

164
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:33.840
taking vitamins like Alpha brain,

165
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:36.990
which is a cognitive enhancing supplement formula.

166
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:40.580
The idea is that we've taken all the best food and nutrients,

167
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.790
all the ingredients that enhance cognitive function and put it into a vitamin

168
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:47.370
form.
The key with all the products that on it,

169
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:51.930
one of the big keys is there's 100% money back guarantee without even returning

170
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:56.160
the product.
If you buy off a brain and you try it and he didn't do shit for me,

171
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.730
just you get your money back.
It's not,
there's no questions asked.

172
00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:03.330
So it's not like we want you to send the pills back and throw them up or

173
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:05.640
something.
No one's trying to rip you off.

174
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:09.210
We're selling you things that I 100% believe in that I use,

175
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.160
that I've had definite positive benefits from.
And uh,
we,

176
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.560
we want it to be a positive experience for everybody that orders.
So if you,

177
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.270
you know,
if you,
if you order it,

178
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.080
we want you to order more because you enjoy it and because it benefits you and

179
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:25.350
if it didn't benefit you,
it wouldn't be something that we'd sell or were,

180
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:27.130
were not interesting.
The,
the,
the,

181
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.240
the fitness equipment that we sell is all shit that I use.
Kettle bells,

182
00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:34.800
especially huge proponent of kettlebells,
you know,
between Kettlebells,

183
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.470
bodyweight squats and Chin ups.

184
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:41.490
You can get fucking ferocious workouts and like unbelievable heart exploding,

185
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.880
ferocious workouts.
The idea that,
you know,

186
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:48.030
you need a bunch of different equipment to get an incredible full body workout.

187
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:50.490
It's really a myth.
You,
you need,
uh,

188
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.820
I believe you need a couple of different weights of kettle bells and a chin up

189
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:55.350
bar and you can get almost anything done.

190
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.800
There's so many different options as far as exercises.

191
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.710
There's a million free videos that you can get online,

192
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:05.580
off youtube and watched of various workouts that people put together.
Just,

193
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.420
just put cattle bells,
just throw that shit in a youtube and you'll find it.
And,

194
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:09.981
uh,
we,

195
00:11:09.981 --> 00:11:14.981
we also have an accumulating supply of different things that are too to enhance

196
00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:21.300
health and different things that are to enhance physical reform,
performance,

197
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:22.140
mental performance.

198
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.340
We were trying to stay on the edge of everything that we hear about that has any

199
00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:29.420
benefit.
It's one of the reasons we're going to start caring.
Um,
uh,

200
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.960
Dave Asprey's MCT oil when it,
uh,

201
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.140
sell it through on it as well.
And his,
uh,
his coffee,
he's a,

202
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:41.700
he's got a amazing coffee and amazing theories on coffee and why a lot of us

203
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.020
feel sick when you drink it.

204
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.640
You don't realize that there's actually toxic mold and a large percentage of the

205
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:49.380
coffee that's sold in America.

206
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.890
Dave Aspery is a fucking brilliant guy and having him on the podcast was so

207
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.670
eyeopening

208
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:59.590
<v 2>when it came to how food is stored,
mold and fungus as that can grow on food.</v>

209
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:01.120
How important is to avoid that?

210
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.600
How much mold and fungus grows on corn or crazy?

211
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:06.490
So we're going to try to start carrying his stuff as well,

212
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.250
just because it's the vast,
and he had this buffalo and Mary Barra easy.
Yeah.
We,

213
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.830
we started carrying these to a bars or a tonka bars rather tonka was,

214
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.690
that's what I used to call the buffalo.
It's what he's call me.
Kat Tonka.
Um,

215
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.870
they're,
they're amazing.
They're made with cranberries and buffaloes and it's a,

216
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.250
it's buffalo jerky and super healthy,
super lean and a,

217
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:30.790
you get to feel like you're Davy Crockett and shit like you went out and at a

218
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:33.130
buffalo we can eat buffalo again for while we couldn't eat him.

219
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:35.890
I'm saying pick drunken dangerous.
Really.
I think so.

220
00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:37.300
Let's get them back on that list guys.

221
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:42.370
Go to [inaudible] dot com and it get yourself some Alpha brain.
Oh,

222
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:45.640
if you use the code name rogue and you'll save 10% off of any and all

223
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:50.050
supplements,
Alpha brain,
shroom,
tech,
sport,
new mood,
you name it,
chuck it all out.

224
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.540
And we also have,
well there's plenty of shit.

225
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.720
I can't even fit it all in a car commercial because it'll get too annoying.

226
00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:00.700
But go go there on it.
O n n I t and the code works only for supplements.

227
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.260
10% off.
All right folks,
Philip Copans is here.
Am I pronouncing it correctly,
sir?

228
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.390
Well,
close enough.
And,
uh,
we're,
we're fixing it busy.

229
00:13:08.391 --> 00:13:11.110
I'm going to talk about ancient civilizations,
ladies and gentlemen,

230
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.720
my personal favorite subject of all time,

231
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.140
the Joe Rogan experience,

232
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.500
<v 0>train by day,
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

233
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.990
<v 2>Powerful.
Phillip Copans.
How are you sir?
I'm doing good.</v>

234
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:31.040
That's a long dragged out ending.
Uh,
thanks for coming man.
And uh,
you're,

235
00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:32.860
you're here about your book.
Your book is,
uh,

236
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.920
the lost civilization enigma and uh,
this,
uh,
I,

237
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:41.930
I got into this subject through Graham Hancock who I'm sure you're familiar

238
00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:45.410
with,
his work,
um,
the fingerprints of the gods.

239
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:50.690
I before that I had no idea that there were so many mysteries in,

240
00:13:50.691 --> 00:13:54.560
in terms of like how ancient structures were constructed,
you know,

241
00:13:54.561 --> 00:13:57.930
who the people were that actually designed them and built them.
And it,

242
00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.940
it's an amazing part of the history of the human race that is,

243
00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:06.830
um,
really doesn't get enough attention in my opinion.
And I don't understand why.

244
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.480
<v 4>Well,
I think we've somehow kind of like,
you know,</v>

245
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.720
we have this 4,000 BC Wallander and anything before that people just don't seem

246
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:18.130
to be interested in and it doesn't get into textbooks.

247
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.580
It doesn't get into official kind of anything.

248
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.810
And anything before that is just treated as if it's sporadic.

249
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.820
We've been around for 35,000 years and we were led to believe that for 30,000

250
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:33.950
years of Dell existence,
we did nothing.
We sat on our bum.

251
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:38.170
<v 2>Is it because of the fact that the information wasn't available when the people</v>

252
00:14:38.171 --> 00:14:41.260
who are professors right now we're teaching and they would teach you for 20 and

253
00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:42.094
30 years,

254
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:47.100
some of them and they don't want to like rewrite what they have already taught.

255
00:14:47.591 --> 00:14:50.800
Like it's,
there's an ego thing to it that would you've,
they've taught you that,

256
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.490
you know,
this was built in 2000

257
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.260
<v 1>BC and that's,
that's where it ends.</v>

258
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.670
<v 4>Absolutely.
I mean,</v>

259
00:14:55.671 --> 00:14:58.430
there's one example in the book in the opening chapter is called the new

260
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:01.310
inquisition and it's about one,
several cases,

261
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:06.260
but one of them is from the 1920s and basically in the 1920s at discovery was

262
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:10.730
made in France glozell and if this was true,

263
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:16.060
early indications were that writing was thousands of years older than everybody

264
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:19.100
had been writing about all of these professors who are going to be proven wrong

265
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.440
and they just couldn't let that happen.

266
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:26.180
So what they did was he had a 16 year old farmer boy who just found a hole in

267
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:29.420
his field who said like,
Hey,
look what I have found.
Um,

268
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.470
and they threw him in jail and they pretended that he was thrown in jail for

269
00:15:33.471 --> 00:15:37.330
fraud.
And ever after science could say like,
well,
he was arrested on fraud,

270
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.791
wasn't he?

271
00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:41.600
We don't have to look at this guy because he was arrested on fraud and he was

272
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:42.820
completely vindicated.

273
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.670
There was no evidence whatsoever that he had made fraudulent claims about the

274
00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:47.900
artifacts which he'd found.

275
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:52.070
But ever since the 1920s according to the eyelids,

276
00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:53.510
free walls of academics,

277
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.840
this is a complete thing which they don't have to look into anymore because they

278
00:15:56.841 --> 00:15:58.010
have labeled it a fraud.

279
00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.130
<v 1>Wow.</v>

280
00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:04.130
So you think there was a conspiracy to label it a fraud and Hema fraud just so

281
00:16:04.501 --> 00:16:08.670
that they didn't have to address it?
Yes.
Why?
How is that possible?

282
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.900
Isn't it weird that academics are supposed to be the leading lights of thought?

283
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:17.220
They're supposed to be the people that are at the forefront of knowledge,

284
00:16:17.221 --> 00:16:20.820
but for the most part they are.
For the most part they are,

285
00:16:20.821 --> 00:16:23.580
but there are exceptions and there are issues.

286
00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.520
The the Egyptologists that you know,

287
00:16:26.521 --> 00:16:31.521
that guy who was a arguing with a Robert Schoch and Graham Hancock in that fee

288
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.150
or in a John Anthony West and that famous video where they're dealing with this

289
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.230
obvious water erosion on the stones and all these geologists are saying like,

290
00:16:40.231 --> 00:16:45.231
you've got a problem here because this was cut at like 9,000 plus BC.

291
00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.410
There's no other way around it.
If you look at climate change,
you look at that,

292
00:16:49.411 --> 00:16:52.980
it had to be thousands of years of rainfall to create these erosions.

293
00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:58.250
And the way he reacted was so egotistical and nonscientific it was really

294
00:16:58.831 --> 00:16:59.664
infuriating.

295
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:04.670
He was laughing like what evidence of the civilization from 10,000 years ago do

296
00:17:05.281 --> 00:17:10.110
you have?
And it was so infuriating to see a guy who's supposed to be uh,
the,

297
00:17:10.111 --> 00:17:14.280
the man out there at the forefront of knowledge when it comes to this particular

298
00:17:14.281 --> 00:17:17.430
subject.
He's a guy who,
a professor at a university,

299
00:17:17.431 --> 00:17:20.130
a highly respected one and here he is,

300
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.330
he's carrying the flag for knowledge in this particular subject.
And he is,

301
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:28.110
if he could see how gross it looked to watch that reaction,

302
00:17:28.111 --> 00:17:32.550
like why don't you tell me what the fuck you think would be around from 10,500

303
00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:34.950
years ago,
dude,
cause I don't think it's going to be much.

304
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:40.130
I really don't think we barely can find shit from 2000 beers years ago.

305
00:17:40.591 --> 00:17:44.190
We barely find shit from 2000 BC,
barely.

306
00:17:44.191 --> 00:17:46.250
We finally a little pottery.
Oh,

307
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.900
we found some place where nobody got killed by mud.
Quick,
get over here.

308
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.970
Let's clean this shit with a,
with a paintbrush.

309
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:56.750
But you want to go more time back from that than it is from us to the

310
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:02.130
construction of the pyramids.
And it is from the established 2,500 BC,

311
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.070
which is insanity.
That's an insane amount of time.

312
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:09.330
And you're talking about 8,000 years before that you're supposed to know or have

313
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.290
any evidence whatsoever other than giant stones.

314
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.330
What the fuck do you think would be left,
right?

315
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.720
<v 4>Yeah.
I mean the great doctors I was,</v>

316
00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:20.840
and just to kind of come back on the conspiracy angle there,
he,

317
00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.800
in the 1980s had actually found evidence that the pyramids,

318
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.190
the Great Pyramid of Giza,

319
00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:29.090
carbon dating results were in uncontested 800 years old.

320
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:34.130
Now that might not see much at 2,400 would make it 3,200 BC,

321
00:18:34.461 --> 00:18:36.950
but it's 800 years.
It's,

322
00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.580
<v 1>it's basically long time man.</v>

323
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.620
<v 4>And they don't want to do it.
So what do they do for the last 30 years?</v>

324
00:18:43.621 --> 00:18:47.580
They haven't published these findings because for them to play the game,

325
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.820
it has to be published in a peer reviewed scientific journal,

326
00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.650
and so by not publishing this,

327
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.160
they can pretend these carbon dating results don't exist and they can pretend

328
00:18:56.161 --> 00:19:00.090
that everything is fine,
that the great perimeter is built in 2,400 BC.

329
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.500
They set the rules,
they played a game,
and then they shout at everybody else.

330
00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:05.700
As you're pointing out one year,

331
00:19:05.701 --> 00:19:08.640
Robert Schoch and everybody else comes to these things and say,
you're already,

332
00:19:08.641 --> 00:19:09.474
it's

333
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.470
<v 1>well,
it's clear to this ego involved,
which is very,</v>

334
00:19:12.471 --> 00:19:14.840
very disturbing when it comes to knowledge.

335
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:19.430
When it comes to something that is obviously a work in progress,

336
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:24.110
the uncovering of ancient civilizations is clearly a work in progress.

337
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:28.310
So to be arrogant about what the results are,

338
00:19:28.311 --> 00:19:32.480
just based on the fact that you've taught these to students for so many years

339
00:19:32.481 --> 00:19:36.020
and you don't want to admit that you were wrong when you're talking about the

340
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.160
the time,
the construction,
that's finks,
whatever it is that,
that,
that it is,

341
00:19:40.161 --> 00:19:42.590
that starts getting controversial.

342
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:47.480
There's a weird thing where you see their ego flare up and it's so gross and

343
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.230
it's so transparent.
It's really weird to watch them argue like,

344
00:19:51.231 --> 00:19:54.560
like little girls like the way they talk about it.

345
00:19:54.561 --> 00:19:58.580
So Ego maniacal.
It's like what are you taught you?
What?

346
00:19:58.581 --> 00:20:01.760
You know exactly what the fuck happened?
No you don't.
No you don't.

347
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.500
And you need to take this into consideration.

348
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.490
You've got a real issue because if this guy's right,
then you way off,

349
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.530
if this guy's right and this sphinx enclosure was cut 9,000 plus BC,

350
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.320
then you've got a real problem on your hands because you've,

351
00:20:15.321 --> 00:20:17.570
you've established this whole timeline.

352
00:20:17.571 --> 00:20:20.360
It doesn't work anymore because there was obviously some really,

353
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.690
so then we have to figure how,

354
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:26.700
what the fuck happened that we had this incredible sophistication at 10,000 BC

355
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:32.060
and then there's obviously spend some declines here and there.

356
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.970
This is a really obvious system.
If you,

357
00:20:34.971 --> 00:20:36.770
if you really pay attention to like go Beckley,

358
00:20:36.771 --> 00:20:40.670
tat bay or all of these really 14,000 plus BC things,

359
00:20:40.671 --> 00:20:44.930
it's like this isn't like a s a linear graph.
It doesn't like go straight up.

360
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:49.750
There's like probably some fairly sophisticated cultures wiped out,

361
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.360
fairly sophisticated,
wiped out and other places.

362
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:57.010
Just like today you can go to Africa today and there's a lot of people that if

363
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.900
you didn't,
if Western civilization didn't go in there and give them things,

364
00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:04.390
they wouldn't have radios.
They wouldn't be wearing underwear.

365
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.930
They would be living exactly the same way they with thousands and thousands of

366
00:21:07.931 --> 00:21:10.930
years ago.
At the same time on other parts of the world,

367
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.160
people are dropping bombs on people,
people are doing nuclear tests,
people are,

368
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:15.491
you know,

369
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:18.310
they're doing the large Hadron collider that's all taking place at the exact

370
00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:21.250
same time.
I suspect that's always been like that.

371
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:25.810
I suspect that there's been some super duper sophisticated cultures where for

372
00:21:25.811 --> 00:21:30.811
whatever reason these people were ever able to figure out how to use agriculture

373
00:21:32.621 --> 00:21:33.400
earlier,

374
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.050
figure out how to use societies and Wa figured out how to become enough to start

375
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:41.170
breaking things down and thinking it through and trying to figure out how to

376
00:21:41.171 --> 00:21:42.040
improve things.

377
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.210
And then it's this exponential process in these groups and some of them get

378
00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:48.040
better at it than others and it seems to be like,

379
00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:50.860
it's like who wasn't attacked by hordes of barbarians.
You know,

380
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.730
those dudes seem to figure out how to,
you know,
get it.

381
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:57.790
Like all you need is like a couple of decades to get ahead.

382
00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.390
If you look at like what we've accomplished in 100 years,
you know,

383
00:22:01.391 --> 00:22:06.391
it's really staggering thing when that's the most staggering thing about whether

384
00:22:06.731 --> 00:22:10.810
it's a ball back,
the stones in Lebanon or,
or Egypt or anything.

385
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:15.280
The most staggering thing is how far we've come in a hundred years and to think

386
00:22:15.281 --> 00:22:19.720
that this shit was all going on thousands and thousands and thousands of years

387
00:22:19.721 --> 00:22:22.780
ago.
Those numbers are just bullshit to us.

388
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.020
You start telling someone 7,000 years ago,
it's like Blah Blah.

389
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.920
I hear noise coming out of your mouth.
I really don't.
I can't see it.

390
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.030
I don't know what it means,

391
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:35.160
<v 4>but I think it's the problem because the way history is still then it is like,</v>

392
00:22:35.161 --> 00:22:37.030
you know for 30,000 TSV sat on our,

393
00:22:37.031 --> 00:22:41.700
but then we stood up and we scramble around for some food and then all of a

394
00:22:41.701 --> 00:22:44.910
sudden in 4,000 BC somebody finds a light switch and all of a sudden it's

395
00:22:44.911 --> 00:22:48.330
civilization.
That's the standard two and it doesn't work like that.

396
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.110
And then when you confront them with things like tobacco tap,
your cattle,

397
00:22:52.111 --> 00:22:55.290
you work or anything like that,
they'll say,
well,
you know,

398
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:59.550
they were very close to like a few thousand people in a city somewhere who would

399
00:22:59.551 --> 00:23:03.630
doing this.
But it was all isolated and it just doesn't work.
You know?

400
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.040
Great Empires exist.

401
00:23:05.041 --> 00:23:08.640
Great Empires for our ancestors were saying about this as well.

402
00:23:08.641 --> 00:23:12.060
They're basically saying about Atlantis,
you know this civilization existed.

403
00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.440
Then it disappeared and are we kind of got it?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

404
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.880
Because we were sitting in the book sittings phase of civilization 10,002 years

405
00:23:20.881 --> 00:23:23.160
ago.
Nobody was building anything.
Nobody was doing anything.

406
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.300
And it is just look,

407
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.310
because you can't argue with them.
They know for sure about how this was,

408
00:23:32.311 --> 00:23:34.350
we were sitting on our butts for thousands of years.

409
00:23:34.351 --> 00:23:38.040
Then we scrambled around a bit and then all of a sudden in 4,000 BC we finally

410
00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:39.300
see the light and here we are.

411
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.720
And it is this very much like evolution of mankind taken to the absolute

412
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:45.710
extreme.

413
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.960
<v 2>Hmm.
It's a,
it's a weird sort of cognitive denial.
It's very strange.</v>

414
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:54.820
It's very strange that it's like,
it's,
it's,
it's like,
it's like laboring Labor,

415
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:59.440
uh,
labeling something,
a conspiracy theory.
Like,
Oh,
you a conspiracy theorist.

416
00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:04.780
Like automatically or even how the new one is truther that's hilarious.

417
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.140
The nine one one people like truth nine,
one one truth.

418
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:12.610
They became truth hers like somehow or another it's an insult to be a truther.

419
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.300
That's,
that shit's for doing so.

420
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.950
<v 4>Well.
I mean,
I was doing something for my blog,</v>

421
00:24:18.951 --> 00:24:21.500
which is going to be on somewhere in the next few days and it's about the

422
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:24.380
Kennedy assassination and the single bullet theory.

423
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.040
And the single bullet theory was invented by Arlen Specter,

424
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:29.900
who was a very junior lawyer at that time.

425
00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:32.390
And he basically saw the Zapruder film,

426
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:36.080
which basically is a guy shooting a film of,
of Kennedy.
And they,

427
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.780
they thought that the Malika Kolkata,
which was what was using shocked rife,

428
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.910
you could fire it at intervals of 2.3 seconds.

429
00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.740
And you see on this film how Kennedy reacts to a gunshot and commonly reacts to

430
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:49.850
a gunshot as well.

431
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:54.680
And the interval is less than 2.3 so all of a sudden they have this issue of

432
00:24:54.681 --> 00:24:57.260
like,
oh,
there are two rifleman there,

433
00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.690
or we need to try and explain it the way.

434
00:24:59.691 --> 00:25:04.580
So comes in spec their junior lawyer who basically gets to solve this problem

435
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.740
and he comes up with a single bullet theory,

436
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:10.970
which basically says the shot goes into the back of Kennedy,
somehow travels up,

437
00:25:10.971 --> 00:25:14.270
goes down,
jumps up again to go into Connally's back,

438
00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:15.680
kind of like keeps traveling up a bit,

439
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:18.230
goes down again into his wrist and then up again.

440
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.310
And he calls it the magic bullet theory.
And when he goes public with this,

441
00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:23.300
he basically says like,

442
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.800
I don't expect anybody to leave this shit and this is going to be contested in a

443
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.760
year,
five years,
a hundred years from now.
Nobody should believe that.

444
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.633
And guess what?

445
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.870
Academic history has taken this on wholesale,

446
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.940
wholesale and everybody who says,

447
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:42.740
but the magic bullet is teary is just crap.
They're labeled conspiracy nuts.

448
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.000
<v 2>It's,
yeah,
it's not just crap.
It's like you're,
you're almost,</v>

449
00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:51.290
it's almost unexcusable to believe it.

450
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.890
It was invented because of the guy in the underpass.
We got hit with a ricochet.

451
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.500
They had to attribute,
that was another reason for it.

452
00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:02.590
They had attribute a bullet to this one guy hitting a curb and it ricocheted him

453
00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:03.710
and he had to go to the hospital.

454
00:26:03.711 --> 00:26:06.800
So they knew that one of the bullets missed one of the bullets hit this curb.

455
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.560
And the bill,

456
00:26:08.561 --> 00:26:13.561
what they found was in the Gurney of governor Connolly when they brought him to

457
00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:15.801
the hospital.

458
00:26:15.801 --> 00:26:20.420
So the idea is that this fucking bullet came out of this dude's body and like

459
00:26:20.421 --> 00:26:23.150
perfect form was just laying around there.
No one ever noticed it.

460
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:26.300
Like he got shot and it was like in his pocket or something.

461
00:26:26.301 --> 00:26:30.170
It went through his body and landed in his pocket and then fell out

462
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:34.730
conveniently.
Right where they were looking around.
See if there's any evidence.

463
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.250
Oh look,
we found the bullet that did all the damage.

464
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.250
It looks to me when I'm watching Zapruder film,

465
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:44.190
I've never heard anybody say this,
but there's a scene,
there's part

466
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.180
<v 1>it part of it where it does look like,
I mean he does.</v>

467
00:26:48.181 --> 00:26:50.220
His head definitely goes back into the left,

468
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.040
but the spray looks like it's going forward.

469
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.720
I wonder if he was hit more than once by by you know,

470
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:01.710
different snipers at the same time.
I mean I wonder how many,

471
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.220
how many actual shots went into his body because they know that there was the

472
00:27:05.221 --> 00:27:10.221
one that went through the front that they tried to disguise as a tracheotomy if

473
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.230
they know there was definitely an entry wound the neck and that's when he grabs

474
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:15.120
his neck.
Just that alone.

475
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.600
The fact that that was deceptively labeled as a tracheotomy whole,

476
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.350
why would you do that?
Why would you,

477
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.580
the only reason cause you don't want to show an entry room and the front of his

478
00:27:23.581 --> 00:27:24.414
neck,

479
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:29.450
an entry wound looks entry for ruined entry wound looks so much different than

480
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:32.190
an exit wound and everybody knows that.
So you had to,

481
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.430
they had to come up with something by these fucking round hole in the middle of

482
00:27:35.431 --> 00:27:39.750
this guy's neck.
So they decided to make it a trick scar,
which is just deception.

483
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:40.920
Yup.
Just that alone.

484
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.230
<v 4>But you know we are led to believe that it's all official history.</v>

485
00:27:45.231 --> 00:27:47.720
It kind of like his rubber stamped and so much is it rubber stamp,

486
00:27:47.721 --> 00:27:50.630
which is absolute bs on so many things.

487
00:27:50.631 --> 00:27:55.631
And you know that is 50 years ago and when we're coming back to trying to find

488
00:27:56.421 --> 00:27:59.610
out what really happened a thousand years ago,
you know when we got to do it,

489
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.390
<v 1>the rubber stamp,
those motherfuckers,
it's those rubber stamp people man.</v>

490
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:09.600
It really is that that really is what it is in the notion that certain things

491
00:28:09.821 --> 00:28:12.100
make you a ridiculous person if you discuss them,

492
00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.800
whether it's a Sasquatch or whether it's you,
fos,
or whether,

493
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:16.643
whether it's anything,

494
00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:22.080
the idea that Schumann beings even exist and exist in this form with cell phones

495
00:28:23.171 --> 00:28:27.370
and fucking space travel and airplanes.
And that is so crazy.

496
00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:31.300
Just the reality of people is so crazy.
Um,

497
00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:36.330
I don't know why anybody would argue any ridiculous proposition about aliens or

498
00:28:37.931 --> 00:28:42.460
the possibility of,
of a life that we haven't discovered another planet.

499
00:28:42.461 --> 00:28:45.850
It's like,
just think about how fucking weird we are.
You know,

500
00:28:45.851 --> 00:28:50.851
we're co the fact that we even exist is so mind blowing and exist in this form

501
00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.750
for sure.
It could be a,
there,
there,

502
00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.880
there could be Ufo is around us all the time that we can't see cause they know

503
00:28:57.881 --> 00:28:59.440
how to hide.
They,
they,

504
00:28:59.441 --> 00:29:04.180
there could be easily some way or are you just are just completely invisible.

505
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:07.990
It doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility that they could deceive us.

506
00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:11.650
That they could figure out a way to be a tree.
You know,

507
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:16.730
you know why I mean,
and who knows if it be like the,

508
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.500
the idea of like cloaking devices,
like all the shit that we're coming up with.

509
00:29:20.501 --> 00:29:24.580
Like where we project an image of who knows what the fuck is up there that we

510
00:29:24.581 --> 00:29:26.650
can't see.
Maybe they're Asians.

511
00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:31.780
Brian,
you need to just jump in front of a train today.

512
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.800
<v 4>Well one of the questions I get asked Brian is where the cat style aliens in</v>

513
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.980
this client's aliens?
Cats?
No.
What if up?
What if a Chinese people are

514
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.640
<v 2>more aliens?
That human and when the Nibiru people came and the Annunaki came,</v>

515
00:29:45.641 --> 00:29:50.350
they just added a little more alien,
the little more chimp to like my people,

516
00:29:50.351 --> 00:29:54.880
the Italians.
So like him a little more champ.
I believe that more than the tray.

517
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.810
You believe that more than them being a tree?
Well,

518
00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.960
what about if they were the wind?

519
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.090
<v 4>Well,
I mean there's a pull,
Davis is a guy who's a,</v>

520
00:30:04.091 --> 00:30:08.200
an astrobiologist from University of Phoenix and he's basically writing a paper

521
00:30:08.201 --> 00:30:11.620
on non material technology,
which he basically kind of like goes like,

522
00:30:11.621 --> 00:30:12.520
I'm going to talk about this,

523
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:15.100
but I have no idea what I'm talking about because it's so out there.

524
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.490
But he's basically saying that alien beings,

525
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.500
if they were to call me or if they came here,

526
00:30:20.501 --> 00:30:22.930
that technology might actually not be physically real,

527
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.390
that it might be something kind of like,
you know,

528
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:27.550
some kind of energy cloud in front of them,

529
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.930
which they can direct with thought and can do stuff with that.
Um,

530
00:30:31.931 --> 00:30:33.040
and you kind of think like,
well,

531
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:37.510
we're almost there because a few days ago there was some headline whereby I

532
00:30:37.511 --> 00:30:40.330
think in Japan,
Asians again,
um,

533
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.900
where they somehow have been able to map.
If somebody is thinking about,

534
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:45.910
I think it was a tomato or something like that,

535
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:50.140
the computer could pick up the patent that this guy was thinking about tomatoes.

536
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:55.680
So we are rapidly moving in directions of really being able to pick up what

537
00:30:55.751 --> 00:30:59.410
we're thinking and computer technology being able to identify what we're

538
00:30:59.411 --> 00:31:00.160
thinking.

539
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.620
<v 2>Yeah,
and who knows whether you're,</v>

540
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:06.630
they're going to be able to enable consciousness to exist inside of computers or

541
00:31:08.141 --> 00:31:10.360
consciousness to exist inside of a signal.

542
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.630
If you can get consciousness to exist inside of a computer.

543
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.620
Think about how much energy and how much information is distributed just through

544
00:31:17.621 --> 00:31:19.120
wireless Internet.

545
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:24.010
Just flying around all around you constantly is fucking videos and ones and

546
00:31:24.011 --> 00:31:28.180
Zeros.
And who knows if one day they'll be able to do that with consciousness.

547
00:31:28.181 --> 00:31:33.181
Just broadcast consciousness like a wifi signal so that you,

548
00:31:33.451 --> 00:31:38.451
you essentially are everywhere all the time if you choose to be so the aliens

549
00:31:38.621 --> 00:31:40.720
are here without even physically being here.
Well,

550
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:43.990
you said that aliens were wind and the Wifi in the air,

551
00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:48.640
so the Internet is aliens.
Dude.
What if the hurricanes in alien,
what?

552
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.740
I just smell than alien.
Did you do some?
No,
it's a child.

553
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.700
I apologize.
I missed coping.
She's fucking serious author here,
Dude.

554
00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:03.130
You're just messing this whole thing up.
It when you,

555
00:32:03.131 --> 00:32:06.130
uh,
you know,
when you tell people that you're on that show ancient aliens,

556
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.880
isn't that like automatically one of those things where they go,
oh,
okay,

557
00:32:09.881 --> 00:32:12.910
you believe in aliens,
look,
oh,
you believe in Ufos?

558
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.420
<v 4>No,
it's amazing in them an America that has been a complete change.</v>

559
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:22.220
The answer is no longer no.
Really,
people kind of like go like,
wow,
interesting.

560
00:32:22.221 --> 00:32:25.880
This is being explored as is being discussed.
Um,
you know,

561
00:32:25.881 --> 00:32:30.470
it's got phenomenal ratings and it's got an attraction from five to 95 and all

562
00:32:30.471 --> 00:32:34.280
of a sudden,
and I think this is largely due to the format of the show as well.

563
00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.870
Um,
really people are into this.
People are beginning to question things.

564
00:32:38.871 --> 00:32:43.871
I got feedback from university professors and specifically highs to high school

565
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.330
teachers and the high school teachers are saying,
you know,

566
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.390
we used to say something like very dogmatically something like,

567
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:54.080
let's say water is liquid.
Um,
they can still get away with that,

568
00:32:54.081 --> 00:32:58.150
but some of the other claims they're making students are now challenging just

569
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:03.050
saying,
well,
where did he get that from?
And before there was this acceptance of,

570
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.460
Oh yeah,
the teacher says so.

571
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:09.050
So we have to accept whatever it is knowledgeable person says and we will just

572
00:33:09.051 --> 00:33:11.180
write it down.
And all of a sudden high school teachers,

573
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:16.190
even university students are basically saying,
no,

574
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.130
we're not going to do that.
We're going to ask where this came from.

575
00:33:19.131 --> 00:33:21.260
Why do you come to that stance?

576
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.740
And I think that's interesting and it's definitely something which is happening

577
00:33:24.741 --> 00:33:26.030
in America.
Um,

578
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.210
because the series is also in different countries are kind of like going forward

579
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.530
in all countries.
Definitely in like Europe,
it's definitely still like,

580
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.700
oh you believe in aliens.

581
00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:37.710
<v 2>Well here's the thing that's happening in this country especially.</v>

582
00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:42.890
And it's a thing that you can call intellectual wealth and financial wealth

583
00:33:44.341 --> 00:33:46.380
might still be locked down by the elite,

584
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:51.630
but intellectual wealth is no longer intellectual.
Wealth is,
look,

585
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.790
you don't really have to have any sort of formal education and you could educate

586
00:33:56.791 --> 00:34:01.370
yourself just by reading the Internet.
You literally any subject,
any you,

587
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:06.380
you could find forums where virtually any topic that you wished to engage in and

588
00:34:07.051 --> 00:34:10.710
what to figure things out about could be discussed.
You could go to,

589
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.490
you could download Birst,
virtually every book that's ever been written about it.

590
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.640
And it's,
it's not like it used to be.

591
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:21.390
So it's not like when they go into a college,

592
00:34:21.391 --> 00:34:25.290
the professor is intellectually incredibly wealthy and the children are

593
00:34:25.291 --> 00:34:26.850
intellectually poor.
No.

594
00:34:26.851 --> 00:34:31.830
The children have fucking smart phones and they could Google anything.
Like,
no,

595
00:34:31.831 --> 00:34:34.140
that's not why I was at 17,
26.

596
00:34:34.141 --> 00:34:37.650
And they found it this way and that professor looks like an idiot now because

597
00:34:37.651 --> 00:34:41.520
he's got some old outdated information.
Yeah.
It's,
uh,
it's,

598
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:45.480
it's not easy to just run a bunch of kids.
Tell them lies.

599
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.790
Well,
you know,
what do you do with kids?

600
00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.130
These fucking kids these days and they're aliens.

601
00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:55.650
But the idea of aliens is always been sexy.
It's always been,
you know,

602
00:34:55.651 --> 00:34:59.580
it's daunting.
Like the idea,
like,
wow,
what could you imagine?
If it is real,

603
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.490
what would it be like?
And that's why there's a thousand fucking movies.

604
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.330
<v 4>I was going to say Hollywood down the street.</v>

605
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.320
<v 2>Yeah,
just look,
you know like it's,</v>

606
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:13.500
it's one of those things where I don't know what would happen if it proved it

607
00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.550
was proven to be real,
but I don't,

608
00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:19.480
I don't think it would be good if they could prove that there are aliens and

609
00:35:19.481 --> 00:35:22.180
aliens exist.
I think people are too stupid.

610
00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.070
I think they're just start jumping off buildings.

611
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.350
I don't think they'd be able to handle it.

612
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:30.200
<v 4>Yeah,
there's,
there's various scenarios there.
Definitely.
I mean,
you know,</v>

613
00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.300
the World War of the worlds thing from the 1930 Sweden,
Orson Welles.
Yeah.

614
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.710
It's kind of like the classic thing of,
of,
of the panicky situation.

615
00:35:37.711 --> 00:35:41.580
Then there are those who say that was exaggerated,
that it was really isolated,

616
00:35:41.581 --> 00:35:44.580
that it would the headlines of the newspapers who invented this kind of thing.

617
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.920
I don't know.
I mean I

618
00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:49.330
<v 2>depends how sexy the alien is.</v>

619
00:35:49.331 --> 00:35:53.110
I think it was an attractive alien.

620
00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.550
We might not panic and jump off.

621
00:35:54.551 --> 00:35:57.700
We might try to arrive and they're all hot as fuck.

622
00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.490
Like Natasha Hendrickson species.
Remember that

623
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.060
<v 4>maybe this is a conspiracy.</v>

624
00:36:02.061 --> 00:36:05.990
Maybe everything about the UFO cover up has happened because they were ugly and

625
00:36:05.991 --> 00:36:09.470
they were not photogenic and to insect like,

626
00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.520
and the government is just waiting for beautiful aliens to come and then that

627
00:36:13.521 --> 00:36:14.360
will be this closure.

628
00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.830
<v 2>Meanwhile,
there's going to be a new movie about that very same subject.</v>

629
00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:21.280
Now that they've heard this,
someone will write a movie about it,
be awesome.

630
00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:26.560
Hot Ac.
No,
dammit,
we forgot.
We forgot to copyright that.

631
00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:31.030
Um,
yeah.
I think for,
for whatever reason,

632
00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:36.370
I think people are barely able to handle this reality.

633
00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.660
You know,
for whatever reason,

634
00:36:37.661 --> 00:36:41.170
whether it's they're not living the life that they want to live there not around

635
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.740
too many people that think a lot.
They don't have much education,

636
00:36:44.741 --> 00:36:47.170
they don't have a strong mind.
They have a lot of phobias.

637
00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:50.770
They have addictions to substances,
whatever the fuck it is.

638
00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:55.000
There's people that are a lot of people that are barely hanging on to this life

639
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.810
as is.

640
00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:59.030
<v 4>It's an awful lot of framework.
People love to have a framework and yeah,</v>

641
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.420
going back to children,
children need a framework.

642
00:37:01.421 --> 00:37:03.940
They need structure in their life and adults,

643
00:37:03.941 --> 00:37:08.410
so many adults need to do that as well.
And once that framework is in place,

644
00:37:08.411 --> 00:37:11.290
and I think this is tying it back to like the academic professors,

645
00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.710
it's really hard to break out of that.
And it's,
it's like you know,

646
00:37:14.711 --> 00:37:18.130
whether it is things like how cisgenic substances,

647
00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:22.480
whether it is things like that.
That's experiences life after death,

648
00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.180
all of these things,
aliens,
lost civilizations,

649
00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:30.250
they all somehow are pushing this cardboard thing of the framework saying how we

650
00:37:30.251 --> 00:37:33.760
need to get through because there's something outside of this framework and

651
00:37:33.761 --> 00:37:37.390
basically people saying
keep it intact.

652
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.280
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

653
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:43.280
the ancient aliens one is one where I've had the conversation with people where

654
00:37:44.091 --> 00:37:48.260
I sort of described the Zechariah Cichon thing,
situation scenario,

655
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:49.400
what could have happened?

656
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:54.730
And they look at you like they're trying to find a way to get away you like,

657
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:59.300
what the fuck?
Kind of stupid conversation.
Am I locked in with this idiot?

658
00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.240
If you've never read any of Zacharias sitch and stuff,

659
00:38:02.241 --> 00:38:05.120
I'll just summarize it very quickly and it's such and believes that we were

660
00:38:05.121 --> 00:38:10.121
engineered by these alien beings and that it's all in the ancient Sumerian text,

661
00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.380
his translations of it or all that.

662
00:38:12.381 --> 00:38:16.130
These people came down and did genetic experiments on human beings and created

663
00:38:16.131 --> 00:38:21.100
us to mine for gold,
which is really a trip.
It's really a mind fuck me.

664
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.020
Start thinking about how gold has always been valuable and you're like,

665
00:38:24.021 --> 00:38:27.500
why you can't even make a sword out of it.
Like why did people back then,

666
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.980
why was anybody willing to take like a bag of gold for your donkey?

667
00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.800
Like that doesn't make any sense.
Like why,
why,
why did it have so value?

668
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.330
The ZACHARIAE CICHON scenario is that they,

669
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:44.370
these aliens had ruined their environment and they needed gold dust suspend

670
00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:48.670
their atmosphere to protect them from the radiation.
Well,

671
00:38:48.671 --> 00:38:52.300
it's really fucked up is scientists didn't figure that like when they were

672
00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:56.530
started to discuss possible climate change,
uh,
erosion,

673
00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:00.940
the ozone layer,
what would they do to protect the United if we lost all of our,

674
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:01.371
uh,
our,

675
00:39:01.371 --> 00:39:06.371
our ozone or atmosphere and the number one solution was to suspend reflective

676
00:39:06.941 --> 00:39:08.860
particles in the atmosphere.
Like,

677
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:13.480
and so Cichon had actually translated this in the 70s.

678
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.200
This is like far before scientists had even proposed that.

679
00:39:17.201 --> 00:39:21.090
So it's really kinda interesting,
like that's one little piece of that switch,

680
00:39:21.091 --> 00:39:22.540
that thing that makes you go,
Whoa,

681
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.970
like who the f how did he figure that out?
It was that,
I don't know,

682
00:39:27.971 --> 00:39:30.250
I'm not smart enough to know about the,
you know,

683
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:34.780
the environment and the climate change and how much they knew about the ozone

684
00:39:34.781 --> 00:39:37.090
layer back in the 1970s.
But

685
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:40.990
<v 4>when he was a very controversial man,
he,
uh,
he,</v>

686
00:39:40.991 --> 00:39:45.260
he was very kind of like Edelman dead set in his ways and he wasn't the one

687
00:39:45.261 --> 00:39:49.640
character,
but he definitely was an interesting character.
And,
um,
you know,

688
00:39:49.641 --> 00:39:52.700
towards the end of his life to get to it in traditions,
his publisher,

689
00:39:52.701 --> 00:39:56.500
he began to like push for the DNA analysis.
He wanted to,

690
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.310
to do some DNA testing.

691
00:39:58.311 --> 00:40:01.610
And unfortunately he died before any of that could have happened.

692
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:04.670
But it would have been interesting to see where he was going to take it because

693
00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:09.320
he really was pushing his,
his reputation and his legacy on the line there.

694
00:40:09.321 --> 00:40:12.050
And again,
it didn't happen because he died.
But um,

695
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.060
<v 2>it is the DNA evidence he was trying to find was that we were genetically</v>

696
00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:18.310
manipulated and created.
That's why we're so,

697
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.760
the idea is that's why we're so different from every other monkey that's here.

698
00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:23.890
I mean,
we,
it's so clear that we're different.

699
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.580
We're so much different than all the rest of them.
And people are like,
well,

700
00:40:27.581 --> 00:40:29.920
we are apes were just were from a different branch.

701
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:34.510
How the fuck did this one branch just take off?

702
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:39.190
This one branch has cars and this was one brand me.
Every,

703
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:43.150
everybody else is the same.
They're all just throwing their own shit.

704
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:47.620
Even the chimps that are the status,
they're in this,
the chimps have the baddest,

705
00:40:47.621 --> 00:40:51.610
smartest motherfuckers the closest to us,
but look at him like,
oh,

706
00:40:51.611 --> 00:40:55.570
they're using a tool,
they're sticking a stick to fucking get ants.

707
00:40:55.660 --> 00:41:00.040
That's as close to a tools that get like,
whoa,
whoo.
You know,

708
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:02.350
call me when they figured out a bow and arrow.
Okay.

709
00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:07.590
It's the difference between them and us is so gigantic and I've never heard that

710
00:41:07.811 --> 00:41:09.520
adequately explained,
never,

711
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:14.290
never heard the fossil records baffling to a lot of biologists when it comes to

712
00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:16.310
the doubling,
the human brain size are,

713
00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:20.770
I've read all these different theories of why the human brain size doubled over

714
00:41:20.771 --> 00:41:25.540
a period of 2 million years and they're all fucking north,
so it's all like,
Ooh,

715
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:27.580
knows man.
Who knows?

716
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:32.170
If we really found now conclusively that there was some sort of genetic

717
00:41:32.171 --> 00:41:33.710
manipulation by some

718
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:40.100
genetic manipulation by some sort of an outside force that might be too much for

719
00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:41.000
people to handle.

720
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:45.920
<v 4>Yeah,
I mean,
you know,
it's,
again,
it's,
it's the framework.</v>

721
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:50.950
It's like if we somehow were to be able to change time and I didn't interview

722
00:41:51.171 --> 00:41:54.290
for a DVD,
which is going to come out of that thinking in a few months from now.

723
00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:55.880
And it's about the Marcel family,

724
00:41:55.881 --> 00:42:00.140
the ones who are involved with Roswell and two generations of them,

725
00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:02.060
specifically the grants on Jesse Marcel.

726
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:06.050
The third grew up with the absolute conviction that Iti existed.

727
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:10.040
The family is absolutely convinced that what grandfather found was x address

728
00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.020
jewel,
the dads at the age of 10.

729
00:42:12.021 --> 00:42:16.310
So some of these artifacts and they raised his son and the grandchild I the

730
00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:17.570
third.
Um,

731
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:22.600
in this absolute conviction that Iti existed and his mindset is completely

732
00:42:22.971 --> 00:42:26.090
different from the rest of us.
It's like,
you know,
like at the age of five,

733
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:29.240
he's not questioning whether what he sees on television,

734
00:42:29.241 --> 00:42:33.020
about Battlestar Galactica could be possibly real or anything of the science

735
00:42:33.021 --> 00:42:36.470
fiction thing.
He just grew up with his complete acceptance that it is,

736
00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:39.320
they're just like shamanic cultures believe absolutely.

737
00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:42.140
That there are other entities out there that there is a larger framework out

738
00:42:42.141 --> 00:42:46.580
there.
Uh,
you know,
so many people,
but the majority of us,

739
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:51.330
the majority of the normal people get raised in a religion.
They kind of,

740
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.570
you know,

741
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:55.940
grow up with that and then they continue to endorse it or they break away from

742
00:42:55.941 --> 00:43:00.070
it and sometimes completely throw the baby out with the bath water.
Um,

743
00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.110
and that is very interesting.
Kind of like,

744
00:43:03.111 --> 00:43:06.540
you know how 2 billion people right now are,

745
00:43:06.541 --> 00:43:11.541
are in this Catholic tradition all by themselves already of like having this

746
00:43:11.871 --> 00:43:15.980
framework which has created for the last 2000 years and everything where you

747
00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:20.981
look around you in this Western world is basically the cardboard box of the last

748
00:43:21.981 --> 00:43:23.030
2000 years.

749
00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.360
<v 2>Yeah.
The Catholic one is wa.
That's where I started out when I was a little kid.</v>

750
00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.760
I was,
I was Catholic and the hair,

751
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.540
I can't believe there's so many people that are still on that.

752
00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.800
That one's a tricky one.
That ones,

753
00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.250
I mean like how much abuse do you have to take?

754
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:43.420
How many kids have to get molested by priests and how many times they have to

755
00:43:43.421 --> 00:43:44.254
cover that up?

756
00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:49.290
How many people have to live these horrible guilt laden lives because of that

757
00:43:50.441 --> 00:43:52.000
wacky ass fucking religion.

758
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:52.731
<v 4>But you see,</v>

759
00:43:52.731 --> 00:43:57.380
this is what the Catholic religion doesn't give any any shit about it because

760
00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.740
this is what they're think about.
You are baptized.

761
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:04.640
That's all they care about for the rest of your life.
Where do you live?
Good.

762
00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.640
Do you murder people?
They don't care because once you're baptized,

763
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:10.790
you god gonna die.

764
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.090
You do the rituals and all of that stuff and then they believe in a physical

765
00:44:14.091 --> 00:44:17.810
resurrection of the dead at the time when Jesus comes back living right.

766
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.800
Or you know,
whether you are a pedophile or a mass murderer,
they don't care.

767
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:25.430
It's all about being baptized and that's all good and the rest is all pretty

768
00:44:25.431 --> 00:44:27.740
much make belief and entertainment for the masters.

769
00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:32.250
<v 2>Well,
I don't think that's the case.
I think they care if you're a or a murderer.</v>

770
00:44:32.251 --> 00:44:35.730
I mean,
people don't want that in their community,
but I know what you're saying.

771
00:44:35.731 --> 00:44:39.870
Then if you follow the dogma,
if you follow the actual word of the religion,

772
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:45.260
the most important part is that they're baptized so that they can possibly come

773
00:44:45.301 --> 00:44:49.360
back.
It can go to heaven.
And that they,
you know,
that they,

774
00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:52.320
what did they have to say?
They love Jesus right before they die.

775
00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:56.520
They have to say that except Jesus into their heart.
Do they have to say it?
Nope.

776
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.870
Yeah,
you have to say it.
I have to say that.
That's the one to say it.

777
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.660
Do you always have that in the back of your head?
Like,
just in case,
like,

778
00:45:01.661 --> 00:45:05.760
I'm like,
what is it again?
Okay.
I gotta do that.
No,

779
00:45:05.761 --> 00:45:09.630
but this chick I used to date,
her roommate used to say shit like that.

780
00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:15.120
It's just in case.
Just in case.
I except you to my heart,
just the case.
It's like,

781
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:18.000
it's always,
uh,
it's always good to better be safe than sorry.

782
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.420
What the fuck are you talking about?
Put on those purple Nike's.

783
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:25.550
Yeah.
It's,
um,
it's a,
it's,

784
00:45:25.551 --> 00:45:30.551
it's just ridiculous how big it is and that those stories are far more

785
00:45:31.411 --> 00:45:35.010
ridiculous than the Zechariah Cichon tale of humanity.

786
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:39.090
The Zechariah sitch until if you manage just like,
hmm.
That makes you,
I mean,

787
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.410
it's like,
we know what we can do.
We've got a rover on Mars right now.

788
00:45:43.411 --> 00:45:45.570
We're collecting soil were taken for,

789
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:50.571
we know we can do that and we know that we did used to be able to do that a

790
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.671
hundred years ago.

791
00:45:50.671 --> 00:45:54.480
So why wouldn't we think that someone could have been here a few thousand years

792
00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.160
ago?
This is a young ass planet.

793
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.770
Planet's only been around like 4 billion years or something like that.
Right?

794
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:03.390
4.67 of them.
Creatine.
Yeah.
If you look at the earth,

795
00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.460
the earth in comparison to the rest of the universe,

796
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.840
there's planets that are billions of years older than us out there somewhere.

797
00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.610
<v 4>Yeah.
And you know,
again,
as he was saying earlier,</v>

798
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:18.640
it's like give a hundred years into the future and if they came here 8,002 years

799
00:46:19.101 --> 00:46:24.080
ago,
how would you tell?
Yeah.
And statistically that they're all like,

800
00:46:24.081 --> 00:46:24.231
you know,

801
00:46:24.231 --> 00:46:28.010
people have been doing this statistical analyses and that would have been two or

802
00:46:28.011 --> 00:46:31.460
three of these incidents happening.
Now,
first of all,
you know,

803
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:36.050
if his spaceship does crash in let's say 15,000 BC,

804
00:46:36.051 --> 00:46:40.440
somewhere in America,
good luck finding evidence of that.
Um,
you know,

805
00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:42.380
there's hardly anybody living here at that moment.

806
00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.740
<v 2>Wouldn't spaceships lasts longer though then?
Like I iPhones,
you know,</v>

807
00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:49.700
like your iPhone wouldn't be around for 10,000 years,
but a fucking spaceship,

808
00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.290
that shit is pretty durable.
I bet it'd be around for awhile.
You would hope.

809
00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:56.970
You would hope you're going to travel through,
uh,
you know,

810
00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.160
galaxies with one of those fucking things are planets so young.

811
00:47:00.161 --> 00:47:04.110
It hasn't even started it's period.
Right?

812
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:06.610
These are not good because you're not good lines.

813
00:47:06.611 --> 00:47:08.680
You're interrupting the support and conversation with,

814
00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.540
I apologize.
See the problem with those Brian is the dirt.

815
00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:19.360
They're train wrecks and they ruined the flow of the conversation.

816
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.650
And now I don't even remember what we were saying.
The planet is just shut up.

817
00:47:23.651 --> 00:47:24.810
Shut up.
Brian's,

818
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:29.380
it is a,
um,

819
00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:34.690
an issue with people when they talk about the origins of humanity and they talk

820
00:47:34.691 --> 00:47:39.691
about the origins of civilizations and how far we've come over the short period

821
00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:44.380
of time and is an issue with people where there's no clear beginning.

822
00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:49.270
It's like,
Ooh,
it gets foggy from Mesopotamia.
Something,

823
00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:53.860
you know,
it gets real foggy.
It gets real foggy about five,
6,000 years ago.

824
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:58.450
And those guys were all talking about people that lived before that and they all

825
00:47:58.451 --> 00:48:02.080
had stories of ancient civilizations that were more advanced and greater.

826
00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:07.120
They all have these kind of catastrophe stories and they also all have like

827
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.430
these stories about being visited.

828
00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:10.891
<v 4>Yeah.
And I mean,
yeah,</v>

829
00:48:10.891 --> 00:48:13.470
the ancient Egyptians are probably the best example of this.

830
00:48:13.471 --> 00:48:18.471
They have stories which basically say that they go back 25,002 years ago to a

831
00:48:18.871 --> 00:48:21.330
time when the goats,
whatever they are,
um,

832
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:24.960
rules and we're present amongst the stand,
a disappeared.

833
00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.590
Then there was some kind of debt.
My goals and then dynastic rule of Egypt can,

834
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.050
and that's kind of very much something that you find everywhere.

835
00:48:31.051 --> 00:48:32.450
What do you go into Arizona?

836
00:48:32.451 --> 00:48:36.420
And you hear the same story of the Hopis just period when the gods were amongst

837
00:48:36.421 --> 00:48:40.340
the study,
still how it can be contacted.
And in the case of,

838
00:48:40.341 --> 00:48:42.780
of the ancient Egyptians who have this disorder,

839
00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:47.470
very interesting scenario that they speak about Atlantis.
And you know,

840
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:52.620
these wonderful Greek who have fought for so many generations dominated our

841
00:48:52.621 --> 00:48:55.470
education as the cradle of civilization.

842
00:48:55.770 --> 00:49:00.240
Well they themselves say they weren't the cradle of civilization to taggers says

843
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:02.040
he studied in ancient Egypt.

844
00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.190
All of them went to ancient Egypt to study these things.

845
00:49:05.191 --> 00:49:08.940
Yet we keep calling them Pataka,
Aristos and Euclid this and all of that stuff.

846
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:12.270
But they all say it came from Egypt.
So all of this knowledge came from Egypt.

847
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:17.750
And what happens is that in the fourth century when Plato starts writing about

848
00:49:18.541 --> 00:49:21.390
Atlantis,
he says,
you know,
this is history.

849
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.760
He writes about it in a history book.

850
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:29.240
He has his critics because nobody in Greece's believing that somehow Athens is

851
00:49:29.851 --> 00:49:32.160
thousands of years older than then.

852
00:49:32.161 --> 00:49:36.960
They believe they are talking about a lost civilization somewhere in what seems

853
00:49:36.961 --> 00:49:39.660
to be the Atlantic Ocean.
And that there's this continent behind it.

854
00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:43.140
What kind of nonsense is this?
So as soon as he's written it,

855
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:46.050
basically a few guys jump on a boat,
go to Egypt,

856
00:49:46.051 --> 00:49:48.330
hope that they can get confronted with evidence,

857
00:49:48.331 --> 00:49:52.650
which shows that Sulan in plate or absolute morons who've invented this and they

858
00:49:52.651 --> 00:49:55.830
arrive in the temple complex and the Egyptian priest kind of like points and

859
00:49:55.831 --> 00:49:59.610
says,
Yup,
that's the column over there,
um,
which has this story.

860
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:03.990
And they jumped back in the boat,
arrive in Athens and basically say,
Oh yeah,

861
00:50:03.991 --> 00:50:06.380
sorry.
Um,
you know,
yeah,
Plato was right.

862
00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:10.140
The ancient Egyptians have this information about this lost civilization.

863
00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:13.770
Now that doesn't mean necessarily that ancient Atlantis is real,

864
00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:18.030
but definitely that the ancient Egyptians believed that it was real.
Um,

865
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:22.110
and all of that is,
is kind of like,
you know,
factual.
All of this is,

866
00:50:22.111 --> 00:50:27.060
is identified as,
as being real.
We know that this guy jumped on a boat,
um,
and,

867
00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:30.170
and that his colon was there up until the fourth century BC.

868
00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.370
And what we have right now,
again,
this cardboard box,

869
00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:37.970
which we were trying to maintain.
We had the likes of Ken Fedder who,
you know,

870
00:50:37.971 --> 00:50:40.150
I'm all about the fact that there should be debate,

871
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:44.030
but it also has to be informed.
And this guy basically says,
well,
you know,

872
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:47.750
played to invent it as this is an idealized state and when you ask him,

873
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:53.090
but it's about history.
He says it history,
well that was a literary device.

874
00:50:53.091 --> 00:50:55.250
He invented the literary device.
Uh,

875
00:50:55.251 --> 00:51:00.251
he was very upset with the way Athens was being run and so he pretends that it

876
00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:06.140
is history,
um,
and he really wants to expose that for and it's like,
oh,

877
00:51:06.141 --> 00:51:09.800
shut up.
Um,
you know,
again,

878
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:13.430
right now there is no evidence that Atlantis was real,

879
00:51:13.431 --> 00:51:17.420
but we should get to a point to say that there is some validity that it might be

880
00:51:17.421 --> 00:51:20.750
real.
Um,
and guess what,
10,000 years ago,

881
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:22.880
we know that the water levels were lower.

882
00:51:22.881 --> 00:51:26.210
We know that there was ice above things like Great Britain,

883
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.720
two miles of ice sitting there that begins to melt.
At the end of the last,

884
00:51:29.721 --> 00:51:33.530
I'd sage to see levels begin to rise.
What's the story of Atlantis?

885
00:51:33.531 --> 00:51:37.510
Have a low level playing somewhere near water,
which all of a sudden is,
you know,

886
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:40.640
submerged by water,
which comes out of nowhere apparently.

887
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:45.200
And submerge has this civilization.
It's what we have found.

888
00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:47.610
<v 2>Haven't they discovered the,</v>

889
00:51:47.611 --> 00:51:51.840
what they believe is the concentric circles that made up of Atlantis in Spain?

890
00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.100
<v 4>Well,
they have found so many things to the answer.</v>

891
00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:59.080
The answer is that our ancestors built in concentric circles everywhere.
Uh,

892
00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:03.050
in the book gloss civilization.
In the,
there,
there is actually the work of a,

893
00:52:03.051 --> 00:52:07.120
of a Belgian historian Marcel Mastec who finds that these circles also existed

894
00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:10.660
around Stonehenge,
Avery,
but also in France.

895
00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:12.030
<v 2>Why did they do that?
Why did they build?</v>

896
00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:17.140
<v 4>Um,
we don't necessarily know the,
the kind of like,</v>

897
00:52:17.141 --> 00:52:21.490
the indications are that our ancestors were very much aware of water technology.

898
00:52:21.491 --> 00:52:24.280
They realize that they wanted to do certain things with water,

899
00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:29.290
that they could purify it somehow,
that he could get more quality out of this.

900
00:52:29.291 --> 00:52:33.570
That,
you know,
like it's,
it's somehow that they understood the qualities of,
of,

901
00:52:33.571 --> 00:52:36.700
of water.
And we're only beginning to touch that there's some research,

902
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:38.930
<v 2>concentric circles may have been filters</v>

903
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:43.560
<v 4>potentially.
I mean,
over the last 10 to 20 years,</v>

904
00:52:43.561 --> 00:52:47.220
people have beginning to look at this,
most of,
most of it in Russia.
Uh,

905
00:52:47.221 --> 00:52:51.120
it is slowly coming back to us and kind of like the results of what you're
doing.

906
00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:55.830
But yeah,
you know,
like a motto at his water and memory and all of that stuff.

907
00:52:56.270 --> 00:53:00.470
<v 2>That's also probably a good way to have building set up.</v>

908
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:03.590
And if you had an these concentric circles and the water was inside of each

909
00:53:03.591 --> 00:53:05.690
circle,
everyone would have access to water.

910
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:09.550
<v 4>Yes.
And there's also something about,
you know,
like the proximity to water,</v>

911
00:53:09.551 --> 00:53:13.850
how this was somehow important and beneficial to health.
Um,

912
00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:17.110
that water healed.
You know,
until a few years ago,

913
00:53:17.111 --> 00:53:20.920
everybody went to these spots across the world to,
to partake in the waters,

914
00:53:20.921 --> 00:53:25.380
which were meant to cure everything and indefinitely made our ancestors feel

915
00:53:25.381 --> 00:53:26.880
better.
And that seems to be tradition,

916
00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:31.380
which existed for thousands of years to take this past somehow that is water,
uh,

917
00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:35.190
was important.
But also of course they had to make sure that what rewards pure,

918
00:53:35.191 --> 00:53:38.150
that water was clean,
that it didn't contain,
you know,

919
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.680
things which would write a kill you rather than helium.

920
00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:44.190
<v 2>Well,
water is always been something that makes people feel good too,
right?</v>

921
00:53:44.191 --> 00:53:47.070
I mean,
it's gotta be helpful for you playing in the ocean and just,

922
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:50.960
<v 4>Oh my wife,
my wife is a big supporter of,
of thing.
If you have a problem,</v>

923
00:53:50.961 --> 00:53:53.560
take a shower and there are people who actually say that the,

924
00:53:53.561 --> 00:53:58.340
the physical fact of water getting on your head makes your brain think better.

925
00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:01.910
Um,
and she's an absolute,
like she's an example of this.

926
00:54:01.911 --> 00:54:04.850
She will sometimes go into the shower and come back and say,
this problem,

927
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:08.720
I'm kind of have the solution.
I think I found this.
She's not alone.

928
00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:10.120
<v 2>It definitely feels good.</v>

929
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:14.080
That's one of the great pleasures of being a civilized person.

930
00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:16.090
Take a hot shower,
man.

931
00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:19.780
I went camping recently and I was camping for five days.

932
00:54:19.781 --> 00:54:23.590
We're wore the same clothes,
no showers cold out,
so no showers,
no nothing.

933
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:28.060
And then finally we checked in in a hotel room on the fifth day and I took a

934
00:54:28.061 --> 00:54:32.590
shower and I took a shot for like an hour.
It felt so good and it's,

935
00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:36.060
I don't think we,
we have so many awesome things like that that we,

936
00:54:36.061 --> 00:54:41.061
we don't even appreciate so much likely or it's very likely rather that these

937
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:43.420
people that even in Atlanta,

938
00:54:43.421 --> 00:54:47.710
it's probably weren't as sophisticated as us and it comes to a lot of things.

939
00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:52.120
But they did have different methods of,
of running in their society,

940
00:54:52.121 --> 00:54:56.440
different methods of employing natural resources to,
to,
you know,

941
00:54:56.441 --> 00:55:01.180
they didn't have a gas and oil based society.
So we have to look at that as well.

942
00:55:01.181 --> 00:55:05.230
Like what when when you're dealing with people that didn't have machines and

943
00:55:05.231 --> 00:55:09.390
combustion engines and a gas and oil based society,
you're,

944
00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:14.400
you got wonder like how does this superintelligence of the human mind manifest

945
00:55:14.981 --> 00:55:18.280
itself in a physical form?
Well it seemed like it did with stone.

946
00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:23.560
It seems like that's,
that was where all the intelligence went.
All the thought.

947
00:55:23.561 --> 00:55:28.561
And innovation went to structures and building these incredible geometrically

948
00:55:29.501 --> 00:55:31.140
accurate structures.
Mm.

949
00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:34.360
<v 4>Well our ancestors I think had far more knowledge than we do.</v>

950
00:55:34.361 --> 00:55:36.730
And this is to some extent also visible,

951
00:55:36.731 --> 00:55:40.720
I think in the work which Jeremy RBS trying to do with the pharmacology
industry.

952
00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:41.930
<v 2>Far More knowledge about what</v>

953
00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:46.760
<v 4>knowledgeable about various things,
like whether it is plants,
plants,</v>

954
00:55:46.761 --> 00:55:51.320
how they can heal,
how we can use them.
You know,
today we kind of like say,
okay,

955
00:55:51.321 --> 00:55:55.520
pill acts is made out of this and this molecule and it'll do this in your body.

956
00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.280
Um,
and it this,
this pill which we can give you,

957
00:55:58.310 --> 00:56:00.920
which we have created two lots of machinery.

958
00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:04.550
And in the Amazon it's not,
it doesn't work like that.

959
00:56:04.551 --> 00:56:07.820
They'll say what's wrong with you?
They will do the analysis and they'll say,
oh,

960
00:56:07.821 --> 00:56:12.170
if we boil plant,
why four,
five hours?
And we mix it with plan Z,

961
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:15.710
uh,
the end result will be something which will help you with this.

962
00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.470
It's knowledge base,
but the preparation is so easy.

963
00:56:18.471 --> 00:56:21.830
You are the boil it or you take it in its native form or you mix them England's,

964
00:56:21.831 --> 00:56:25.750
it's this very basic thing of,
of working.
But you need to have the knowledge.

965
00:56:25.751 --> 00:56:28.000
You need to know that all of these plants work.

966
00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:30.880
And today we have the big physical approach of like,
you know,

967
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:35.470
like we have machines and power plants which are able to produce this pill,

968
00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:38.800
but the end result is the same.
You get better from taking this.

969
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:43.210
<v 2>My take on it is that they knew a lot more back then.</v>

970
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:46.060
Um,
then we think they did,

971
00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:51.100
but they knew a lot about the natural world.
The knew a lot about healing.

972
00:56:51.101 --> 00:56:53.990
But I don't think they had internet.
I don't think there have Google,

973
00:56:53.991 --> 00:56:57.760
they didn't have cars.
We know way more now and we know about them.

974
00:56:57.761 --> 00:56:59.410
They didn't know about us so they can go fuck themselves.

975
00:56:59.411 --> 00:57:03.830
Anything even see us coming,
we're here.
Bitch,
you're not.
Um,
I think,
you know,

976
00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:06.100
like computers and laptops,
what are the odds are they,

977
00:57:06.101 --> 00:57:07.400
have they had all that shit?
Well,

978
00:57:07.401 --> 00:57:10.750
you'd have to have oil to make all that stuff like that.

979
00:57:10.751 --> 00:57:14.590
So the one component that people have to recognize in the construction of almost

980
00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.680
every modern piece of technology is plastic and plastic is we can be made from

981
00:57:22.031 --> 00:57:23.860
plants.
It could be made from hemp fiber,

982
00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.990
but for the most part it's made from fucking oil.

983
00:57:25.991 --> 00:57:27.400
And there's a lot of the shit that's in there,

984
00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:31.370
it's made from oil and you've got a burn oil to fire up engines to fly over the

985
00:57:31.371 --> 00:57:35.950
fucking sky to carry these things from China.
You know,
it's a,
it's a really,
uh,

986
00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:39.670
being,
there's no way around it.
You need some,
you need,

987
00:57:39.671 --> 00:57:43.180
you need to figure out a way to mass manufacture things in order to have a

988
00:57:43.181 --> 00:57:44.200
society like this.

989
00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:47.530
This is a completely different sort of society than they had back then.

990
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.680
<v 4>Oh yeah.
I mean definitely,
but I,
I think that's this interesting thing.
Yeah.</v>

991
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:56.190
The more academics denied the existence of Atlantis,
the more extreme.

992
00:57:56.191 --> 00:57:59.010
Some people make the civilization as well.
Um,

993
00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:03.210
and I think the truth is somewhere in the middle they were more advanced then.

994
00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.250
You know,
like we have what you were talking about the four,

995
00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:08.880
they were more advanced than the people who were running around doing nothing

996
00:58:08.881 --> 00:58:10.980
whatsoever on the various other continents,

997
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:15.060
which is why the likes of the ancient Egyptian spoke about them of like,
Hey,

998
00:58:15.061 --> 00:58:18.570
these guys did something.
Hey,
these guys lived.
There just was,
you know,

999
00:58:18.571 --> 00:58:20.910
like if you ever find something in your neighborhood of admins,

1000
00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.820
this might be related to these guys thousands of years ago,

1001
00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.390
but it's not going to be a spaceship.

1002
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:29.250
It's not going to be something which is going to be so wow.
Wow,
wow.

1003
00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:33.270
But it is still wow in the sense that it was a large civilization.

1004
00:58:33.271 --> 00:58:35.940
If we take a Plato's word for it,

1005
00:58:35.941 --> 00:58:40.941
it was know pretty much Europe unified before Europe was ever unified and it was

1006
00:58:41.491 --> 00:58:46.491
also as a civilization which gave it's information to other civilizations there

1007
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:49.710
it seems to be this,
this handover of information,

1008
00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:53.370
even though the civilization died,
not everything died.

1009
00:58:53.371 --> 00:58:55.500
Some of their knowledge seems to have gone over,

1010
00:58:55.501 --> 00:58:59.640
which is what the stories of the ancient Egyptians are about and how,

1011
00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:02.640
and you know,
there's somehow preserve this information from,

1012
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:03.630
from their ancestors.

1013
00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:08.820
<v 2>The most shocking thing to me about ancient man is the ability to move giant</v>

1014
00:59:09.191 --> 00:59:11.820
stones.
That that one is the real mind.

1015
00:59:11.821 --> 00:59:14.200
Fuck well isn't the only thing to do back then.

1016
00:59:14.201 --> 00:59:16.300
So he probably got really good at it.
You know,
there's,

1017
00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:18.100
you got a lot of things to do,
dude.

1018
00:59:18.101 --> 00:59:21.980
You had a hunt and you had to gather and you had to make food,

1019
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:26.480
you had to make shelter.
It's,
there's always shit to do.
Just being a human being.

1020
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:30.170
And back then it was probably way more stressful to get your food than it is

1021
00:59:30.171 --> 00:59:31.004
today.

1022
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:35.000
So I don't buy that or rocks just weighed the way less back then and your badge,

1023
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:37.910
there was no way for us to judge that.

1024
00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:41.330
How much we know how much box way you silly fuck.

1025
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:45.200
Maybe after years of rain it starts soaking it in and getting some kind of like

1026
00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:49.310
a wet towel,
wet towel effect for rocks.
Um,

1027
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:51.540
some of the stones,
like those,
uh,
the,
the,

1028
00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:56.150
the Lebanon stones and Bob back that just did just how old did they think those

1029
00:59:56.151 --> 00:59:56.984
are?

1030
00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.480
<v 4>Nobody knows.
He can't date rocks,
but,
right.
I mean it's,</v>

1031
01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:04.670
it's so many of these structures you can't date.
And I mean,

1032
01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:07.490
trying to answer the bell back thing via Stonehenge,

1033
01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:11.930
the traditional explanation of stone shares that it is 3000 BC,

1034
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:13.281
but there's one guy,

1035
01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:18.281
Robert Langdon who is actually showing that these stones are probably 8,000 BC

1036
01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:23.570
and he's doing it by basically saying the holes which were found our 8,000 by

1037
01:00:23.571 --> 01:00:27.260
carbon dating results.
Some of the stones which are used elsewhere,

1038
01:00:27.261 --> 01:00:32.180
but specifically the blue sarsens are found in these holes 8,000 years ago,

1039
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:34.400
sorry,
thousand BC.
Um,

1040
01:00:34.401 --> 01:00:39.401
so he's basically saying you are constantly putting Stone Henge and his 3000 BC

1041
01:00:39.471 --> 01:00:43.160
framework,
but actually the evidence suggests that it is 8,000 BC.

1042
01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:46.360
He's trying to push it out.
He's basically trying to,

1043
01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:50.060
to do the reinterpretations of this.
And in the case of Baalbek,

1044
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:54.380
in the case of so many things,
it's always circumstantial dating.
Um,
you know,

1045
01:00:54.381 --> 01:00:58.430
this building has been repainted what year,
two years ago.
Um,

1046
01:00:58.431 --> 01:01:02.960
and imagine if somebody's,
you know,
five years ago says like,
Oh,
this building,

1047
01:01:02.961 --> 01:01:07.370
you know,
dates from seven years ago because the paint is,
is seven years ago.

1048
01:01:07.371 --> 01:01:12.230
Well that is circumstantial.
You know,
in the absence of you need to go further,

1049
01:01:12.231 --> 01:01:15.510
you need to be able to,
to find out more.
And in the case of this building,

1050
01:01:15.511 --> 01:01:16.970
you will probably find land registries.

1051
01:01:16.971 --> 01:01:20.900
You will find so much information which shows that it is probably 30,
40 years.

1052
01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.410
But in the case of things like bowel back,
you don't have anything.

1053
01:01:24.411 --> 01:01:28.640
You have a bit of plant life or some kind of discarded wood from an ancestors.

1054
01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:29.541
Um,
you know,

1055
01:01:29.541 --> 01:01:33.040
it's like trying to date Baalbek or Stonehenge or whatever monument by,

1056
01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:37.370
by a Twix wrapper,
which are tourist has left a 3002 years from now.

1057
01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:42.060
<v 2>That's funny.
That's a funny way.
Or looking at it.
Um,
how big are those stones?</v>

1058
01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.200
The Baalbek stones,

1059
01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.900
<v 4>they're big.
They,
um,</v>

1060
01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:49.840
some of the stones in the foundation of the platform are 800 tons.

1061
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:52.870
There is one in situ which wasn't completely excavated,

1062
01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:57.040
which was 1200 tons is absolutely gigantic.

1063
01:01:58.050 --> 01:02:01.290
<v 2>So how tall is that?
Is it like eight feet tall,
nine feet tall?</v>

1064
01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:06.310
<v 4>Uh,
I think to the 1,201 is,
um,
to</v>

1065
01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:11.650
add,
those are about eight,
eight to 12 I think.
Yes,

1066
01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.460
it's Christ meters and feet.

1067
01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:18.100
<v 2>And so what would be the theory?
Like what is the,</v>

1068
01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:19.980
what is the standard theory

1069
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.820
<v 4>about how those people who were basically hunter and gatherers,</v>

1070
01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.980
how they figured out how to do that?
They don't address it loud.
To me it's,

1071
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:32.210
it's somehow like,
oh look,
they're there.
The Romans get this.
Um,
and,

1072
01:02:32.211 --> 01:02:35.250
and to large extent Baalbek is like that as a whole.
Um,

1073
01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:39.330
it is the second largest temple complex,
which to Romans built on top.

1074
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:44.520
And parts of that haven't been explained by by traditional scientists either.

1075
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.560
They kind of like,
we'll go like,
well,
you know,

1076
01:02:46.561 --> 01:02:51.561
some of these stones are 200 tons and we know that the ancient Romans were able

1077
01:02:51.871 --> 01:02:56.010
to work with cranes of,
of five turns.
And so they kind of go back.

1078
01:02:56.011 --> 01:02:58.620
So we need 40 of these cranes.
And you kind of got it.
Okay,

1079
01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:02.340
so why are you going to put them?
It's,
it's kind of like saying,
you know,

1080
01:03:02.341 --> 01:03:05.100
we need 40 people but your room can only hold five.

1081
01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:08.610
Where are you going to put the 35 extra?
You have to fit them somewhere.

1082
01:03:08.611 --> 01:03:11.670
These cranes around this piece of rock.
Um,

1083
01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:14.010
and so they do this all the time,

1084
01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:18.840
whether it's the Great Pyramid of Egypt and the pyramids theory about how they

1085
01:03:18.841 --> 01:03:23.460
are built as proposed by an archeologist is ridiculed by a project manager in

1086
01:03:23.461 --> 01:03:27.240
the building industry because they basically go like,
you can't do that.

1087
01:03:27.241 --> 01:03:30.810
You can't build anything like that.
Uh,
you know,
it's,

1088
01:03:30.811 --> 01:03:33.780
it's kind of like saying how many people do you need for the building of this?

1089
01:03:33.781 --> 01:03:37.320
And some archeologists will say,
oh,
10,000.
Okay,

1090
01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:40.260
fit them around this pyramid.
Put them all in line.

1091
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:42.990
They play with some of these numbers.

1092
01:03:42.991 --> 01:03:46.920
And in the case of bowel back when it comes to the foundation stones,

1093
01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:48.570
like you know,
some will say,

1094
01:03:48.571 --> 01:03:53.220
well we know in the case of Jerusalem that the ancient Romans constructed this

1095
01:03:53.221 --> 01:03:57.210
and they were using things like 200 or 400 tons.
Great.

1096
01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:02.040
800 tons is pretty much double of that.
Um,

1097
01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.180
and we don't really know even how the ancient Romans did this.

1098
01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:10.000
They clearly did.
But how they did it in the case of,

1099
01:04:10.001 --> 01:04:14.490
of Baalbek is,
is a known,
we can speculate,

1100
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:18.660
wooden rollers are,
are a great device leavers,
wooden rollers,

1101
01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:21.480
massive amounts of slaves pushing up.
But still,

1102
01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.910
but if you put a big stone on top of wooden roller,

1103
01:04:23.911 --> 01:04:26.270
the wooden rollers basically gets destroyed.

1104
01:04:26.271 --> 01:04:31.200
It gets incinerated through the weight.
So you ha if Bruton rollers were used,

1105
01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:36.201
somehow our ancestors were able to do something to that wood to make something

1106
01:04:37.621 --> 01:04:41.730
happened with that,
which would be able to sustain the weight on top.
You know,

1107
01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.730
it doesn't seem right.
Fell.
No,
I mean,
and here's the thing.

1108
01:04:44.731 --> 01:04:47.070
This is what bugs me so much.

1109
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:52.400
It is the fact that so much of what our ancestors did remains unexplained on a

1110
01:04:54.421 --> 01:04:56.520
very mundane level.
You know,

1111
01:04:56.521 --> 01:05:00.780
the most basic things as to how Stonehenge was built,
how Avery was built,

1112
01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:05.190
why it was built,
how this mode was Doug Baalbek,
Jerusalem.

1113
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:08.880
So many things,
it doesn't get explained by scientists.

1114
01:05:08.881 --> 01:05:12.600
And the reason why is that archeologists dig these things up and then somehow

1115
01:05:12.601 --> 01:05:15.540
treated as if it's their bailiwick and they're going to come up with the

1116
01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:18.370
explanations.
Now,
an archeologist is good with a shovel,

1117
01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.800
but he has no idea about the building industry.

1118
01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:23.140
He has no idea about project management.

1119
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:27.000
And as soon as some of these people from the outside basically say,
em,

1120
01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:28.570
we know some of these things.

1121
01:05:28.571 --> 01:05:32.440
Would you like us to help the ocular just say basically fuck off.

1122
01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:37.240
This is our garden.
This is our playground.
We don't want you.

1123
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:38.420
Wow.
Okay.

1124
01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.170
<v 1>What have you,
and now have you seen a,
you,
I'm sure you've seen that video,</v>

1125
01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:45.620
ancient aliens debunked.
I did.
And you wrote a piece about it.

1126
01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.610
Have you seen his theory about the interior ramp?

1127
01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:52.760
How they're constructed it?
I saw that.
I thought it was fascinating,

1128
01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:57.710
but it's still,
the,
the Great Pyramid is still so bananas.
It doesn't,

1129
01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:58.520
it doesn't help.

1130
01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:01.790
Just knowing that they made a ramp doesn't help for folks who don't know the

1131
01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:04.340
numbers.
This is a root cause.
I used to do a bit about the pyramids.

1132
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:09.800
The Great Pyramid of Giza has,
what is it?
2 million,
600,000 stones.

1133
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:13.460
And if you cut in place 10 a day,

1134
01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.970
it would take you 664 years to build.

1135
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:23.300
I read that somewhere.
Just 10 of those monster fucking stones a day.

1136
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:27.890
It would take you 664 years to make the pyramid like that.
Is that,

1137
01:06:27.891 --> 01:06:31.450
is that,
that's such a crazy accomplishment that building?

1138
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:34.200
<v 4>Well,
I mean,
a great friend of mine,
um,</v>

1139
01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:37.290
he's unfortunately having to take care off off his dying wife.

1140
01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:40.930
It's Josie to Vidovich and Joseph to Vidovich is a French professor.

1141
01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.350
He's called the father of his own signs,
Chia polars.

1142
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.040
And basically in the 1970s what he was looking at was he looked at rocks and he

1143
01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:51.010
said like,
okay,
I know how rocks are created,
geological process,

1144
01:06:51.011 --> 01:06:55.600
volcanic activity,
but is that a way I can recreate rocks in my laboratory?

1145
01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:00.110
And the answer was yes,
he was able to accomplish it as any called DC geopolymer.

1146
01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:04.280
And basically geopolymer is a natural rock,
sorry,
isn't,
is a manmade rock,

1147
01:07:04.281 --> 01:07:06.610
which looks almost identical to a natural rock.

1148
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:10.780
Now there are certain differences in limestone for example,
you know,

1149
01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:15.550
you see these little mollusks and all of these other things which are in there

1150
01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.980
and there will need the aligned because the,
the,

1151
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:22.240
the water came in and the wave came out and they are all perfectly aligned in a

1152
01:07:22.241 --> 01:07:25.420
geopolymer.
That's not the case because basically somebody has tested in,

1153
01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:30.130
in some structure and has basically over a period of 24 hours to 48 hours,

1154
01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:34.540
create a distinct,
so he went to Egypt on a holiday in the 19,

1155
01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:39.100
late 1970s where his wife,
family,
um,
look that degrades pyramid and said,

1156
01:07:39.101 --> 01:07:43.630
shit,
this isn't geopolymer.
All of these blocks are made.

1157
01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:45.250
In what I have just discovered.

1158
01:07:45.251 --> 01:07:49.300
And he began to point out on the Giza plateau,

1159
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:53.170
40 easily identifiable features in about these drugs,

1160
01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.640
which anybody who goes there with his book and see for themselves that this

1161
01:07:57.641 --> 01:08:00.350
isn't natural stone.
Um,
in the end,

1162
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.700
<v 1>don't even disputed though Ryan hasn't that,
that mean that that is a,</v>

1163
01:08:03.701 --> 01:08:06.120
the geologists are not agreeing with him.
Well,

1164
01:08:06.210 --> 01:08:09.630
certain ones that have actually put up a stink about that.
The grade.

1165
01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:10.493
Do you think about that?

1166
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:15.010
<v 4>It's the great first one.
Uh,
doctor [inaudible] who was,
who,
who has an,</v>

1167
01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:20.210
he basically said he,
he is an idiot.
This is not cement.
Um,

1168
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:24.560
and it isn't cement,
you know,
a horse has no idea what he's talking about.

1169
01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:28.160
Since then,
the likes of Michael Barr,
assume who is a professor,

1170
01:08:28.530 --> 01:08:32.600
I think in a Detroit University or somewhere in America University,

1171
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:37.490
he has taken pretty much the,
the,
the,
the roll up there from,
from the Vidovich.

1172
01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:42.540
Um,
they have submitted samples off of Geo polymers to some of the ancient Egypt,

1173
01:08:42.570 --> 01:08:46.850
sorry,
to,
to Gypsy in departments,
uh,
Libre laboratories.
And they basically said,

1174
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.930
oh,
this is natural limestone.
To which,
you know,
bar Suman and the village said,

1175
01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.180
no,
it's not to be created at a few weeks ago.

1176
01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.330
But the basic problem is this.

1177
01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.470
We have a professor had father of a science,

1178
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.710
a guy who has metals left,
right and center.

1179
01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:08.210
And the archeologists basically say,
go away.

1180
01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.410
This is our playground.

1181
01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.500
We're not even going to listen to what you're going to say.
Instead.

1182
01:09:12.501 --> 01:09:15.650
We're going to pretend that what you were saying is that the great pyramid was

1183
01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:18.170
made of cement and we know it wasn't made of cement.

1184
01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:21.680
And that is kind of like the sad thing.
And you know,

1185
01:09:21.681 --> 01:09:24.560
when it comes to project management,
when it comes to all of these,

1186
01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.420
this disciplines,
they basically say f off,
we don't want you here.

1187
01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.060
It's our playground.
It's our Sanford.

1188
01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:36.350
<v 1>It was,
so there are,
uh,
actually,
I'm looking at this there,
there are many people,</v>

1189
01:09:36.351 --> 01:09:40.730
very,
very intelligent people that believe that this is made out of concrete.

1190
01:09:40.731 --> 01:09:45.680
So the,
the propaganda may actually be the people that are disputing it because,

1191
01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:49.910
uh,
some scientists from MIT,
um,
they,
uh,
they,

1192
01:09:49.911 --> 01:09:51.840
it seems like they,
uh,

1193
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:56.930
believe I'm trying to read this as I'm doing it.

1194
01:09:57.770 --> 01:10:02.480
Um,
yeah,
they,
they believe that this,
uh,
it's very possible this was a,

1195
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:06.470
what they're calling a limestone concrete and that they just made powder and mix

1196
01:10:06.471 --> 01:10:08.690
it there.
And that's why they're all perfect because they were caught,

1197
01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.220
they were poured into a mold,

1198
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.910
which is far easier to do because then you're just carrying bags of shit up

1199
01:10:13.911 --> 01:10:17.600
there instead of actual pyramids.
Pyramid stones rather.

1200
01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:20.390
<v 4>I mean there's one stone which he points out again,
like,
you know,</v>

1201
01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:25.520
his books are mostly in French,
but he has self published one in English.
Um,

1202
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:30.380
and basically he points at one stone where there is wedding in the middle.
Now,

1203
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:33.500
wedding of a stone in the middle of a stone doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

1204
01:10:33.501 --> 01:10:35.690
How is this,
this,
this Po,
this possible.

1205
01:10:35.691 --> 01:10:39.980
And the only reason why it's possible is because at one point in time,

1206
01:10:39.981 --> 01:10:40.970
probably at night,

1207
01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:46.280
they mixed on the port one stone to a certain level and the following day they

1208
01:10:46.281 --> 01:10:49.940
completed it to the next level as a result of which to weathering could both at

1209
01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:53.030
the top and in the middle of this stone.
But again,
you know,

1210
01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.200
throughout the pyramid complex,
he's able to,

1211
01:10:56.230 --> 01:11:00.590
to show you and guide you around potential evidence because again,

1212
01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:04.550
there needs to be more research done.
But 40 points is,
you know,

1213
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:09.440
more than one.
Um,
to Kinda like do an indication that this might be the case.

1214
01:11:09.441 --> 01:11:12.920
And the sad fact to me,
the thing which,
uh,
uh,

1215
01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:17.850
me is that the scientific establishment just basically says,
fuck off.

1216
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.510
<v 1>This is his actual position.
This makes it actually even more interesting.</v>

1217
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:27.080
His position is that only 10% or 20% were cast and that most of the blocks were

1218
01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:33.780
cut.
This is the w w what he believes that said,

1219
01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:37.500
most of the blocks were carved as suggested by archeologists,

1220
01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:38.790
but 10 to 20%.

1221
01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:41.670
We're probably cast in areas where it could have been highly difficult to

1222
01:11:41.671 --> 01:11:43.470
position the blocks.
So that's,

1223
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:47.280
that's why they can show you blocks that haven't been cast and say,
see,

1224
01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.700
see these,
these the unquestionably were cut,
this guy's a fool.

1225
01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:54.150
But actually it makes a lot more sense.
Like they figured out both.

1226
01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:57.960
They figured out how to cast blocks and move them into positions where it'd be

1227
01:11:57.961 --> 01:12:01.120
much more difficult to cut them.
And they also caught them as well.
Yeah,

1228
01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:06.090
they're fucking really a mind blowing civilization.

1229
01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.300
He really try to wrap your head around where did they get all that information

1230
01:12:09.301 --> 01:12:12.090
from?
And then you look at their own history and it says they were,

1231
01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:15.420
they were hanging out with God's fuck man,

1232
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:20.430
it sounds so stupid.
If you buy into it and believe it and bring it up at a,

1233
01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:25.020
at a,
um,
you know,
a dinner party.
But if it was real,

1234
01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.060
what a mind fuck that must event.

1235
01:12:27.061 --> 01:12:32.061
If human beings really did coexist in the same place as aliens and they were

1236
01:12:33.511 --> 01:12:38.511
really were teaching us and their big giant dudes like the guy in promethium

1237
01:12:39.201 --> 01:12:43.560
[inaudible]
is that possible man?
Do you think that's possible?

1238
01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.800
<v 4>I think that that definitely is something to be said that our ancestors were</v>

1239
01:12:47.801 --> 01:12:50.440
absolutely in communication with nonhuman intelligences.

1240
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:53.860
I don't think that in a number of cases it was physical presence,

1241
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:57.940
but definitely that they were in communication with something and that they

1242
01:12:57.941 --> 01:13:02.230
could establish this bank.
It's like,
you know,
like it's not like some contact,

1243
01:13:02.231 --> 01:13:06.130
which I should put this and intimate and phone signal.
It's a constant line.

1244
01:13:06.131 --> 01:13:09.790
They can kind of like go to whatever,
a statue or something in a temple.

1245
01:13:09.791 --> 01:13:13.570
And this uplink downlink thing works greatly.
Um,

1246
01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:16.960
and there's also something to be said.
All of these cultures across the world,

1247
01:13:16.961 --> 01:13:20.250
they always say that,
you know,
the,
the offspring of,

1248
01:13:20.251 --> 01:13:23.770
of the gods somehow became the rulers.
Um,

1249
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:28.570
and that is definitely something which is another universal constant.

1250
01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:32.700
And you know that again,
genetic memory is,
is,

1251
01:13:32.701 --> 01:13:37.060
is one of these things,
it's been poo hard in,
in the the 19th century,

1252
01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:40.720
the ideas of Collagen and all of these things have been pushed aside,

1253
01:13:40.721 --> 01:13:44.420
but we have a hundred thousandths of,

1254
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:48.730
of primitive cultures elsewhere who basically say they can access this pool of

1255
01:13:48.731 --> 01:13:52.960
information on a regulated basis.
And you know,

1256
01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:57.670
I am a firm believer that certain hallucinogenics substances really take you

1257
01:13:57.671 --> 01:14:02.170
outside of this cardboard box outside of this framework and that they take you

1258
01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.740
into a world of,

1259
01:14:03.741 --> 01:14:08.470
of intelligences and that our ancestors were given the tools and the techniques

1260
01:14:08.471 --> 01:14:12.700
to basically establish this link.
And once this link was established,

1261
01:14:12.701 --> 01:14:16.380
he could pretty much just these intelligences whatever they wanted.
Um,

1262
01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:19.180
and then it was up to the intelligence as I guess,
what did he say?
Yeah,

1263
01:14:19.181 --> 01:14:22.180
we'll tell you this or no,
we won't tell you that.
Um,

1264
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:26.980
and I think that is too large extent what our ancestors were saying about this

1265
01:14:26.981 --> 01:14:29.800
link of the gods being present amongst them,

1266
01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:34.840
that somehow they were able to sustain a presence.

1267
01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:39.140
Um,
you know,
in a number of occasions.
It seems to be specifically in,

1268
01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:43.630
in kind of like the what I would say the non traditional societies,

1269
01:14:43.631 --> 01:14:48.250
some of them which have escaped most attention,
uh,
remote tribes in,

1270
01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:50.590
in China,
uh,
and,
and things like that.

1271
01:14:50.591 --> 01:14:54.730
There might have been a physical alien creature running around there for a
while.

1272
01:14:55.150 --> 01:14:59.800
Um,
but in most societies,
specifically the famous ones,

1273
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:05.220
it somehow seems that these gods were non human intelligence is not necessarily

1274
01:15:05.711 --> 01:15:08.080
physical but definitely present.

1275
01:15:08.081 --> 01:15:12.100
Then somehow in communication with our ancestors and how that went.

1276
01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:14.950
Very few people knew back then.
And

1277
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.330
<v 2>do you think that's from psychedelics and that was the communication method for</v>

1278
01:15:18.331 --> 01:15:20.550
the non nonphysical entities?

1279
01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:23.500
<v 4>I think it's definitely one possibility.
I think it's,</v>

1280
01:15:23.501 --> 01:15:27.170
it's something which we can go and say this is how it could have happened.

1281
01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.420
<v 2>That sounds so stupid to anybody who's never done mushrooms.
But if you have,</v>

1282
01:15:31.450 --> 01:15:35.770
or if you've done judge doesn't mean about mushrooms and they're saying that

1283
01:15:35.771 --> 01:15:39.490
it's what they thought happens when you do mushrooms is totally wrong that your

1284
01:15:39.491 --> 01:15:41.680
machine that shuts off your brain like your,

1285
01:15:41.681 --> 01:15:44.710
your whatever the mushrooms doing to you.

1286
01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:47.290
It's almost like it like flips your switch

1287
01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:53.350
and it runs a show with mushroom.
Well,
you know what,
what?
Yeah,

1288
01:15:53.351 --> 01:15:57.490
well mushrooms are,
is very closely related to human neuro chemistry.

1289
01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:59.560
When you take a mushroom mushroom is like,

1290
01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:03.820
I forget that the chemical way to describe it,
but it's for Fox,

1291
01:16:03.821 --> 01:16:08.410
for old oxy and,
and dimethyltryptamine.
I'm not saying it right,

1292
01:16:08.411 --> 01:16:12.220
but it's an [inaudible] trip to me as a part of human neural chemistry.

1293
01:16:12.221 --> 01:16:14.770
So this stuff,
this silicide is like,

1294
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:19.380
it's like human neuro chemistry with a little added something to it.
And when,

1295
01:16:19.381 --> 01:16:22.300
when it hits you,
it basically takes over the show.
Crazy.

1296
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:25.770
Fucking really crazy scarier.
Well,
it is scary.

1297
01:16:25.771 --> 01:16:28.340
The idea that Mckenna always had was that it was a,

1298
01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.990
an artificial intelligence and that,

1299
01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:32.710
that we were eating it and that's how it was communicating with us.

1300
01:16:32.711 --> 01:16:36.190
And then he came here from other planets.
Yeah.
That's why it's so different.

1301
01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:37.050
Apparently there's the,

1302
01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:40.750
there's no other organism on this planet with the phosphorous and the four

1303
01:16:40.751 --> 01:16:45.340
position according to Mckenna.
I don't even know what that means,
but,
uh,
like,
uh,

1304
01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:49.390
like psilocybin and he believed that it probably came here as spores and an

1305
01:16:49.391 --> 01:16:54.220
asteroid.
And that's,
uh,
that's,
that's why it has such an unbelievable impact.

1306
01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:58.180
It's like when you,
when you,
when you have a mushroom experience,

1307
01:16:58.181 --> 01:17:01.780
if you haven't had one before,
it doesn't seem like it could ever be possible.

1308
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:04.810
You're like,
this is no way.
How does,
how,

1309
01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:09.710
how did I not know that this was a possibility to folks who haven't had

1310
01:17:09.711 --> 01:17:10.820
psychedelic experiences?

1311
01:17:10.821 --> 01:17:13.840
The idea that a psychedelic experience could somehow be otherworldly

1312
01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:18.720
intelligence.
Like I hear,
um,
Richard Dawson,
who I'm a huge fan of,
uh,

1313
01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:22.360
I think he's a brilliant guy and,
uh,
he,

1314
01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:25.550
Richard Dawkins rather,
and,
uh,
his,
uh,

1315
01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:29.300
all his breaking down a fundamentalist religions is,

1316
01:17:29.301 --> 01:17:30.860
I think it's a fantastic stuff.

1317
01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.490
But then when I've heard that the guy had never had a psychedelic experience,

1318
01:17:34.491 --> 01:17:35.540
I'm like,
my God,

1319
01:17:35.541 --> 01:17:40.541
you have to know that there's so many books and so much work written on the

1320
01:17:41.061 --> 01:17:43.190
connection,
which a w the,

1321
01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:47.660
the connection between what they call entheogens or psychedelic substances and

1322
01:17:47.661 --> 01:17:51.920
higher states of consciousness,
revelations,
religious experiences.

1323
01:17:51.921 --> 01:17:55.430
Like why would you as an intellectual not want to experience that?

1324
01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:59.780
It's not like you'd never come back or it's not like it fucking,
you know,

1325
01:17:59.781 --> 01:18:03.860
red lines.
Your brain sends you into a,
uh,
a mental tree.

1326
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:05.430
<v 4>But I think it's because the,
the,</v>

1327
01:18:05.490 --> 01:18:10.300
the definition of a psychedelic is that it puts you somewhere which isn't real.

1328
01:18:10.301 --> 01:18:13.210
So it's of no interest to explore that.
Why would you want to create,

1329
01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.410
why would you,
why do you want to explore?

1330
01:18:14.850 --> 01:18:19.120
<v 2>I think that is a very silly way of looking at reality.</v>

1331
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:24.160
I think that the idea that we even understand what that's doing to you,

1332
01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:27.370
it all that means to me is you haven't done it.
That's all it means to me.

1333
01:18:27.371 --> 01:18:30.640
If you really feel like you have some concrete definition as to what's going on

1334
01:18:30.641 --> 01:18:31.460
in that state,

1335
01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:35.650
and I most likely say you probably haven't done it before because if you have

1336
01:18:35.651 --> 01:18:38.820
done it,
he'd come back very humble about your,

1337
01:18:38.821 --> 01:18:41.410
your opinions on what's going on there.
It's too weird

1338
01:18:41.970 --> 01:18:43.740
<v 4>and that's when you know what our ancestors are saying.</v>

1339
01:18:43.741 --> 01:18:48.741
They had this entire system of initiations and what we're discovering is that

1340
01:18:48.961 --> 01:18:52.860
through a series of fasting,
sleep deprivation,
psychedelic drugs,

1341
01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:57.930
whatever it is,
and all of it together combined,

1342
01:18:58.390 --> 01:19:02.130
they basically pushed you out of your comfort zone and it was the high level.

1343
01:19:02.131 --> 01:19:04.350
You know you were going to experience your ancestors,

1344
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:05.940
you are going to experience to gods.

1345
01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:09.510
You were going to really find out that you will not learn in the universe.

1346
01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:13.630
And this is pretty much the everything which are our ancestors are saying.

1347
01:19:13.631 --> 01:19:17.670
And like in the book I say,
you know at some point,

1348
01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:21.930
relatively early on,
thirty thousand twenty five thousand years ago,

1349
01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:25.530
we figured it out.
We figured out that this cardboard box,

1350
01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:30.420
the things which we see with our senses is not everything there was to reality.

1351
01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:32.670
We figured out that there was something larger there.

1352
01:19:32.670 --> 01:19:37.560
And we began to speculate and think about as to why we were here.
What was this,

1353
01:19:37.561 --> 01:19:41.970
you know,
why,
why did we run around here,
what is this thing in the mind?
And then,

1354
01:19:42.330 --> 01:19:46.860
um,
you know,
they didn't have computers.
They didn't have all of that stuff,

1355
01:19:46.861 --> 01:19:50.160
but they were thinking about it and they were experiment based.

1356
01:19:50.161 --> 01:19:55.020
And to large extent we are back to where we are because right now you have,

1357
01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:55.590
you know,

1358
01:19:55.590 --> 01:20:00.590
surgeons in hospital environments who are pushing little axes or little weird

1359
01:20:00.841 --> 01:20:04.500
things on top of machinery where the patient will never see it.

1360
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:06.480
But when the patient says like,

1361
01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:11.440
hey doctor is the little thing on top of this thing there,
um,
doctor,

1362
01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:15.390
we'll kind of go like,
how did he know you had a near death experience?

1363
01:20:15.391 --> 01:20:17.290
He went to,
he had an out of body experience.
You,

1364
01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:22.590
you somehow were able to pick this up through nonsense,
nonsense,
the remains.

1365
01:20:23.010 --> 01:20:27.120
Um,
and you know,
we're back there,
but as a whole,
again,

1366
01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:31.560
jumping on my high horse here,
um,
science isn't interested.

1367
01:20:31.561 --> 01:20:34.920
Science basically says like,
it's nothing to do with this.
It's religious.

1368
01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:39.360
You were never going to look into these things and,
and what you have is this,

1369
01:20:39.361 --> 01:20:42.930
this standoff for this stalemate or whatever situation we're in,

1370
01:20:42.931 --> 01:20:46.920
whereby people hunger for information,
um,

1371
01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:49.670
nobody who has the tools and,

1372
01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:53.550
and to some extent of schooling to give us the answers is interested.

1373
01:20:53.551 --> 01:20:58.320
And so at the other end of the,
the prospective,
you have wild theories.
You know,

1374
01:20:58.321 --> 01:21:02.490
you have the fact that the ancient Atlantan must have had helicopters and

1375
01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:05.550
machinery and all of these things.
And guess what,
you know,

1376
01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:09.120
I actually don't care too much.
I don't believe it,

1377
01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:13.020
but I don't care too much that it's out there because it seems somehow,
you know,

1378
01:21:13.021 --> 01:21:18.021
Eric [inaudible] had to say that the Nazca lines were a spaceport before the few

1379
01:21:19.171 --> 01:21:24.171
scientists went to Peru and studied them and try to preserve them before 0.001

1380
01:21:26.130 --> 01:21:29.160
was interested and it was a lone woman.
Um,
you know,

1381
01:21:29.161 --> 01:21:33.380
basically trying to convince the locals not to drive over in that trucks over

1382
01:21:33.381 --> 01:21:37.560
and over the Nazca lines.
She was the only one interested,
nobody else was,

1383
01:21:37.561 --> 01:21:41.610
it took a guy to say,
hey,
maybe the gods have landed here.

1384
01:21:41.611 --> 01:21:46.380
Maybe this is a space board before they were pushed into action.
And so,
you know,

1385
01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:51.510
the fact that people are making sometimes extremely wild claims might hopefully

1386
01:21:51.511 --> 01:21:52.590
push these people,

1387
01:21:52.591 --> 01:21:56.550
these scientists off their butt into the field and do actually some of kind of

1388
01:21:56.551 --> 01:22:01.440
research to disprove things just to,
to,
to just to just do some yeah.

1389
01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:05.250
Something on it.
Do something.
And you know,
in the case of the Nazca lines,

1390
01:22:05.730 --> 01:22:08.730
what they have been discovering since it's so great to have this corporate

1391
01:22:08.731 --> 01:22:12.510
pyramids,
they have discovered that these people had a high civilization.
Um,

1392
01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:16.230
there are even potentially,
um,
there are even people out there who,

1393
01:22:16.410 --> 01:22:19.920
who really began to realize that what was happening there had to be seen from

1394
01:22:19.921 --> 01:22:23.520
the sky or understand what the Nazca lines or I just felt filled them in because

1395
01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:25.230
some,
some people might be ignorant to it.

1396
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:27.660
Well then as clients are basically gigantic geoglyphs,

1397
01:22:27.661 --> 01:22:31.860
some in the shape of monkeys and other animals that are quite often and mostly

1398
01:22:31.861 --> 01:22:34.170
famous art alliance which just criss cross,

1399
01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.610
they have basically been made by sweeping off the top,

1400
01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:41.150
so top layer of surface off of sand and below it there's quite often a,

1401
01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:42.450
a wider surface.

1402
01:22:42.451 --> 01:22:46.530
So they stay visible for hundreds of years because it's a desert condition.

1403
01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:51.210
It hardly rains at all.
Uh,
on that plateau.
And you know,

1404
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:54.000
it's come to a point where,
why people have said,
okay,

1405
01:22:54.001 --> 01:22:55.740
they have to be seen from the sky.

1406
01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:00.060
And there are a few scientists out there who've actually seen that some of the

1407
01:23:00.061 --> 01:23:05.060
rocks near the,
some of the,
some of the lines were exposed to extreme height.
Uh,

1408
01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:10.120
they also began to see that some people were actually varied with extreme

1409
01:23:10.121 --> 01:23:13.120
heighth.
Is He,
sorry.
Sorry.
Eat.
Um,

1410
01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:15.500
there were also people who were buried with um,

1411
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:18.970
basically what we would describe as hang glider material.
Um,

1412
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.140
and so they are beginning to find out that these people took to disguise and one

1413
01:23:23.141 --> 01:23:26.530
of them has actually proposed that they had balloons,

1414
01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.240
that this is why the hot air basically was encapsulated and they went to the

1415
01:23:31.241 --> 01:23:35.650
sky.
Other people you know,
are pursuing things like kites.
All of these things,

1416
01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:40.630
um,
all of a sudden are becoming,
um,
within the bailiwick of,

1417
01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:44.050
of the potential.
People are looking at this and see whether this is possible,

1418
01:23:44.051 --> 01:23:48.580
whether they can find evidence around Nascar.
And so,
you know,
this,

1419
01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:52.930
it took somebody to say,
hey,
this thing needs to be seen from the sky.

1420
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:57.100
Um,
before w people are really beginning to say,
oh yeah,

1421
01:23:57.101 --> 01:24:00.490
there is something to this Nicka civilization.
There were pyramids there.

1422
01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:04.120
You know,
this is a,
this isn't not an important civilization.
Which ones there,

1423
01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:09.610
<v 2>well,
that is a crazy concept that they might have had some sort of air travel,</v>

1424
01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:14.110
some of whatever.
They figured out some sort of plain or or something.

1425
01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.080
Now if it was just hand gliding,
would that be enough?

1426
01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:20.850
<v 4>There's definitely evidence that there was some kind of hang gliding.</v>

1427
01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.030
Obviously the environment was allowing for that as well.

1428
01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.930
<v 2>I think people would try that shit.</v>

1429
01:24:25.931 --> 01:24:30.550
If you get to the top of a a big cliff and the wind is blowing like crazy and

1430
01:24:30.551 --> 01:24:31.690
you see a bird doing it,

1431
01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:34.600
you know that some crazy motherfuckers going to try and make a wing.

1432
01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:37.030
I mean that's probably always been people.

1433
01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:38.530
People will probably always try to figure,

1434
01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.570
put some animal skins and strap it down.
I mean it's,

1435
01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:44.770
it's like you're just mimicking what you see right in front of you that already

1436
01:24:44.771 --> 01:24:48.490
works,
you know?
Wow,
that's crazy.

1437
01:24:48.491 --> 01:24:51.580
If they figured out some sort of rudimentary air flight,

1438
01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:56.170
<v 4>I mean actually the kind of,
I believe the latest Boeing's to the seven three,</v>

1439
01:24:56.171 --> 01:24:58.540
seven and an old 800 series of that.

1440
01:24:58.541 --> 01:25:00.630
They have like these little things at the end till the winds,

1441
01:25:00.670 --> 01:25:04.840
which stickup now and it's the Boeing engineers looked at at some of the birds,

1442
01:25:04.841 --> 01:25:08.500
specifically the birds of prey and they realize that these birds had little

1443
01:25:08.501 --> 01:25:12.850
feather at the end as well.
And so he began to test in the wind tunnels,

1444
01:25:12.851 --> 01:25:16.270
whether putting this thing at the end of the wings of planes would help.

1445
01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.780
And it kind of improved stability and all of that stuff.
Like,
like,
you know,

1446
01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:24.250
like percentages,
which really were kind of like out of the,
out of the norm.

1447
01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:29.280
Like nature birds are super fliers and we just mimicked them when we are

1448
01:25:29.741 --> 01:25:30.880
designing aircraft.

1449
01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:35.840
<v 2>One of the most fucked up things about that area around the Nazca lines is those</v>

1450
01:25:35.841 --> 01:25:40.520
skeletons they find with the long dated heads where these people,
they,

1451
01:25:40.530 --> 01:25:41.060
they,

1452
01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:46.060
they took their heads of the babies and they select smushed them to form.

1453
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:51.420
Like they tried to get them to look like,
like aliens.
Like,

1454
01:25:51.421 --> 01:25:55.160
like you would think of if you think of an alien,

1455
01:25:55.161 --> 01:25:58.070
you think of someone with a really big long head,
you know,

1456
01:25:58.071 --> 01:26:01.220
and they did that on purpose to their head.

1457
01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:03.980
<v 4>I mean,
again,
these are the same like you and I,</v>

1458
01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:09.820
your child would you subject your child to wooden planks and years of basically,

1459
01:26:11.991 --> 01:26:16.540
you know,
probably not,
you know,
like abuse into school,
um,
by,

1460
01:26:16.570 --> 01:26:20.840
by having these elongated skulls.
And they say,
did it because they,

1461
01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:24.920
somehow these children were special are going to be special in a sense that they

1462
01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:26.300
were going to resemble the gods.

1463
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:30.890
<v 1>Brian,
have you seen that shit before?
Pull it up.
Google.
Elongated skulls.</v>

1464
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:34.530
Just,
just Google that and you'll,
you'll see a,

1465
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:37.040
I bet Peru is even more specific.

1466
01:26:40.330 --> 01:26:41.680
It's a,
it's a very,

1467
01:26:41.681 --> 01:26:45.910
very strange practice and yeah,

1468
01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:47.730
and it was really common.
They fee,

1469
01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:51.370
it's not like they felt like one or two of these they've found like fucking

1470
01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:55.480
burial grounds filled with these fucking things where they stretched out

1471
01:26:55.481 --> 01:26:56.710
people's heads.
I don't know how the,
no.

1472
01:26:56.770 --> 01:26:59.620
Do you know the number of how many of these different skulls they found?

1473
01:27:00.210 --> 01:27:04.380
<v 4>Uh,
it depends.
I mean we're talking about hundreds when,</v>

1474
01:27:04.381 --> 01:27:08.100
when it comes across to worlds and it is a worldwide phenomenon.
Like you know,

1475
01:27:08.101 --> 01:27:11.700
one of the images there I had to do with,
with one from Egypt,

1476
01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:15.090
they are found in North America.
They are found across the world

1477
01:27:15.170 --> 01:27:19.790
<v 1>and didn't toot common,
have a very long Gaten had himself but seemed natural.</v>

1478
01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:22.250
But what an oddly shaped head himself.

1479
01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:25.820
<v 4>Well in the depictions,
him and his dad were depicted as such.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

1480
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:29.930
he had a normal skull as,
as a,
as a human being,

1481
01:27:30.330 --> 01:27:32.500
<v 1>but he wasn't picked it as this weird wait</v>

1482
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:35.250
<v 4>creature.
Now,
of course his dad,</v>

1483
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.470
which we all see him miss his economic,
uh,

1484
01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:42.030
he's really depicted weirdly apart from a weird hat.

1485
01:27:42.330 --> 01:27:45.420
All of his joints are,
are weird as well.
And again,

1486
01:27:45.421 --> 01:27:46.980
they're trying to explain it the way of his,

1487
01:27:46.981 --> 01:27:50.870
he had more felons or something like that,
some kind of disease.
Um,

1488
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:55.560
which basically means that you have deformities of your fingers,
your bones,

1489
01:27:55.980 --> 01:28:00.120
but they haven't found his body.
Akhenaten's body is missing.

1490
01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.870
And I find it interesting then one of the potentially more interesting bodies,

1491
01:28:03.930 --> 01:28:08.580
Oz is missing in action.
Um,
if anybody knows the whereabouts of economic,

1492
01:28:08.581 --> 01:28:12.360
there's body,
please help.
Um,
because he was an interesting guy.

1493
01:28:12.361 --> 01:28:15.850
He absolutely took over a,
a system of,

1494
01:28:15.851 --> 01:28:18.870
of ancient Egypt and basically set to it all mistaken.
Um,

1495
01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:23.450
you can experience the gods in certain other ways and I'm going to push forward

1496
01:28:23.451 --> 01:28:25.710
with my religion and basically tell you how it is.

1497
01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:30.960
And I think what happened was that in his case,
again,

1498
01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:34.210
district trepanation of with Alan gating skulls,
um,

1499
01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:39.240
it has to happen from birth.
And I think his revelation happens.
Um,

1500
01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:43.390
obviously he was a teenager or an adult when he had it.

1501
01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:47.670
He couldn't travel back in time and do it to his own skull and tooth and common

1502
01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:52.710
I think was already too old as well.
This is speculation,
um,
to,

1503
01:28:52.711 --> 01:28:54.210
to have it done to,
to him.

1504
01:28:54.211 --> 01:28:57.450
So it would have been the next generation basically to 10 comments children

1505
01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:00.420
where they could have performed it on FDA.
So wanted to,

1506
01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:04.410
but an art Davey are depicted as such if they could,

1507
01:29:05.930 --> 01:29:09.800
<v 1>well,
it,
it seems like a in art in might have been exaggerated,</v>

1508
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:14.210
but it does seem like there's people that are saying that the skull itself of a

1509
01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:17.950
to 10 common was elongated and is the skull of a,

1510
01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:19.520
his family,

1511
01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:23.330
apparently other members of his family who else was of his family was alive.

1512
01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:27.370
<v 4>Right,
right.
I was his wife.</v>

1513
01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:30.550
I think he had a sister.
Um,

1514
01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.870
I think he had some deceased people who were,
um,

1515
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:39.700
dying before him.
Again,
the great controversy as you know,
did he die naturally?

1516
01:29:39.701 --> 01:29:42.830
Have was he murdered Robert and um,

1517
01:29:43.150 --> 01:29:45.090
[inaudible] have written about it in,

1518
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:49.300
in their reason Duke and then it's a great controversy which doesn't want to go

1519
01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:50.130
away.

1520
01:29:50.130 --> 01:29:53.580
<v 1>Yeah.
That's the,
the most recent one.
This is a,
the,</v>

1521
01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:55.970
the National Geographic saying that,
uh,

1522
01:29:56.010 --> 01:29:59.460
he was not murdered violently that CT scans show.

1523
01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:01.413
<v 4>Huh?</v>

1524
01:30:02.290 --> 01:30:06.310
<v 1>What a fucking nutty find that must have been.
They found that in 1926,
Huh?</v>

1525
01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:11.740
How margin just dig in and you hit that thing in the middle of that sandy asked

1526
01:30:12.881 --> 01:30:17.230
desert where there's nothing going on and you all of a sudden hit this

1527
01:30:17.470 --> 01:30:22.470
incredible treasure trove of artwork and just this insight into what it was like

1528
01:30:23.291 --> 01:30:24.124
back then,

1529
01:30:24.370 --> 01:30:29.370
how many of those tombs were there that just got found and rated and just

1530
01:30:30.011 --> 01:30:33.850
stripped of all their wealth.
So many of them,
the majority to what a,

1531
01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:35.620
what a huge,
huge,

1532
01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:40.730
like a loss for history because just what we found makes you just go,

1533
01:30:41.710 --> 01:30:45.100
what the fuck was going on back then?

1534
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:49.420
When you look at the sarcophagus and the golden that guild work and you're like,

1535
01:30:49.930 --> 01:30:50.770
what?
This,

1536
01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:55.110
these people were living in so much differently than anybody in Europe.
Yep.
Yeah.

1537
01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:59.340
<v 4>And I mean,
just,
you know,
like in the new world in Corey Conklin Cusco,</v>

1538
01:30:59.341 --> 01:31:03.060
you had an entire temple made out of gold.
You had Colton animals.

1539
01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:07.170
The entire core chart was made out of gold and a Spanish came,

1540
01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:10.830
they melted it all down,
put it on ships to sail back to Spain.

1541
01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:16.280
And English pirates basically sang to ships and all of that gold sitting at the

1542
01:31:17.641 --> 01:31:21.180
bottom of the sea.
And so,
you know,

1543
01:31:21.181 --> 01:31:26.180
it's kind of like double sad because it was first melted.
Uh,

1544
01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:29.870
there are stories that,
some of it has been secreted away,
uh,

1545
01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:33.920
people in,
uh,
about one in every 50 years.
There's,

1546
01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:38.400
there's a guy who comes forward and says,
like,
I was led into certain aspects of,

1547
01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:42.060
of,
of basically subterranean parts of this original structure.

1548
01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:46.020
And there is still something there.
Um,

1549
01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.670
people like Javier Sierra have,

1550
01:31:47.671 --> 01:31:51.450
have written a fiction books about them and that one hasn't been translated from

1551
01:31:51.451 --> 01:31:55.350
Spanish into English yet.
But,
um,
there's,
you know,

1552
01:31:55.351 --> 01:31:56.640
there was so much gold,

1553
01:31:56.641 --> 01:32:01.641
there was so much treasure and so has disappeared and it is so sad to see that.

1554
01:32:03.011 --> 01:32:07.300
So little remains.
And it was just one guy,

1555
01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:11.680
he was a minor ago.
He wasn't minder of Pharaoh.
Nobody cared about him.
Ramps is,

1556
01:32:11.730 --> 01:32:14.740
was so much more important.
Just imagine what he would have had.

1557
01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.573
<v 2>It's crazy.</v>

1558
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:19.460
It's really crazy when you think about what they could have discovered and we

1559
01:32:19.461 --> 01:32:23.060
know so much just because the two tongue comments discovery,
um,

1560
01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:24.400
it's saying that the,
uh,

1561
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:27.650
examinations of a scroll though that he did have an elongated hell,
uh,

1562
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:32.530
head probably wasn't as exaggerated as the,
the images.
Um,

1563
01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:37.550
but he had a impacted wisdom teeth as well,
and he had a cleft palate.

1564
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:42.500
So they know that the,
the,
the medicine was not up to par,
you know,

1565
01:32:42.501 --> 01:32:45.740
so that's at least good evidence that if this guy was a pharaoh because they

1566
01:32:45.741 --> 01:32:49.190
didn't understand basic dentistry,
they didn't know how to fix cleft palates.

1567
01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:53.180
So they,
they weren't ahead of us with everything.
You know,

1568
01:32:53.790 --> 01:32:57.010
<v 4>they,
they,
again,
they were very good at certain things,</v>

1569
01:32:57.011 --> 01:33:01.600
but they were crap that others like,
I mean the ancient Egyptians for example,

1570
01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:05.380
as much as they build things,
they never built things like arches.

1571
01:33:05.410 --> 01:33:08.230
They were able to build bridges,
but they never built artists.

1572
01:33:08.231 --> 01:33:11.020
Now it's possible that they could build arches,

1573
01:33:11.021 --> 01:33:14.560
but they basically didn't think they were aesthetically pleasing.
Um,

1574
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:16.120
but certain things like,
you know,

1575
01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:19.600
what we would think they would have been able to do,

1576
01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:23.920
they might not have been able to do.
And,
but at the same time,
you know,

1577
01:33:23.921 --> 01:33:27.610
building structures with hundreds of tons of stone in there,

1578
01:33:27.611 --> 01:33:30.550
whether it's the valley pyramid complex,
um,
or,

1579
01:33:30.551 --> 01:33:32.470
or the great pyramid they were able to do.

1580
01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:37.330
And people often say when it comes to the Great Pyramids,
Oh,
like,
you know,
okay.

1581
01:33:37.331 --> 01:33:42.280
It was only the,
it was the Eiffel Tower last century or two centuries ago now,

1582
01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:44.320
uh,
which,
which rivaled it.

1583
01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:49.170
But actual score that is indeed somewhat along in it.

1584
01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:53.380
<v 2>Yeah,
that's his actual skull.
That's the actual cat scan of his skull.</v>

1585
01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:57.460
If you could pull that up,
Brian,
we'll get took a look at that.
But it's,

1586
01:33:57.461 --> 01:34:01.390
but that's nothing compared to the images.
He's got a fucked up head for sure.

1587
01:34:01.391 --> 01:34:05.470
He'd make get made fun of in high school,
but he didn't look like an alien.

1588
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:07.630
It's probably why they put him in private education major.

1589
01:34:07.730 --> 01:34:10.540
What if he did have a fucking giant brain?
What is the,

1590
01:34:10.541 --> 01:34:13.690
the pharaohs were like more that would,

1591
01:34:13.691 --> 01:34:17.860
if they originally had some alien and them eventually got bred out.

1592
01:34:17.890 --> 01:34:18.690
Is that possible?

1593
01:34:18.690 --> 01:34:22.190
<v 4>Well,
I mean,
again,
it's possible if somebody were to do research into it,</v>

1594
01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:22.950
to explore it.

1595
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:27.950
What we know is that our ancestors set that all of these kinks were partly

1596
01:34:28.201 --> 01:34:29.670
human,
partly divine,

1597
01:34:29.970 --> 01:34:33.360
and that they were here to make a bridge between our world and the world of the

1598
01:34:33.361 --> 01:34:36.930
gods.
That was their job.
And if they were unable to do that,

1599
01:34:36.931 --> 01:34:39.810
they were quite often kicked out and basically told,
okay,

1600
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:44.040
we'll find another one or substitute for you.
The ancient Egyptian Pharaohs,
uh,

1601
01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:46.820
if specifically when they became older,
um,

1602
01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:49.980
we're quite often told to to perform a hab sad festival,

1603
01:34:49.981 --> 01:34:54.600
which was basically a fitness test whereby they physically and mentally had to

1604
01:34:54.601 --> 01:34:58.730
prove that it could somehow communicate the world of the gods.

1605
01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:03.470
Um,
you know,
that is clearly as a job specification day.

1606
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:08.420
They were told to do this and clearly it means that this communication with the

1607
01:35:08.421 --> 01:35:13.421
gods for dumb somehow involved a physical aptitude thing.

1608
01:35:13.491 --> 01:35:17.060
It wasn't that they were simply inventing certain things,
uh,
you know,

1609
01:35:17.061 --> 01:35:20.240
they were basically told you need to be physically fit to do these things.

1610
01:35:20.241 --> 01:35:23.930
Whether it is true having synergenic substances,
some kind of,
you know,

1611
01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:27.920
other means,
which we haven't been able to identify.
But across the world,

1612
01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:33.290
the job of a king was to be an enabler or a bridge between us and the world of

1613
01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:35.540
the ancestors,
the gods,
whatever you want to call them.

1614
01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:39.510
<v 1>I think it's very difficult for people in this day and age to wrap their heads</v>

1615
01:35:39.511 --> 01:35:44.511
around the idea that at one point in time the whole reality of human beings was

1616
01:35:46.321 --> 01:35:48.630
very,
very different than it is now.

1617
01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:53.760
But if you stopped and thought about it and if there was some introduction or

1618
01:35:53.761 --> 01:35:55.040
some uh,
um,

1619
01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:59.640
intervention rather have some sort of alien consciousness.

1620
01:35:59.670 --> 01:36:03.420
If physical alien forms and then they weren't there anymore and they weren't

1621
01:36:03.421 --> 01:36:05.280
there for thousands and thousands of years,

1622
01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:08.700
how much would we know how much evidence will be left?
What,

1623
01:36:08.701 --> 01:36:11.460
what would be around that?
We could point fingers at,

1624
01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:15.600
well there'd be like stolen crowd carvings that show giants holding small
people.

1625
01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:20.040
They have those,
they really do have those.
I mean there,
there is some,

1626
01:36:20.250 --> 01:36:22.920
a lot of ancient art that the,
the,
the,

1627
01:36:22.921 --> 01:36:27.210
the ancient Sumerian stuff is the weirdest stuff where it actually has double

1628
01:36:27.211 --> 01:36:30.030
helix DNA that we,
the ancient Sumerian,

1629
01:36:30.031 --> 01:36:34.920
like I've had a conversations with people that try to deny that they had some

1630
01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:38.850
knowledge of the workings of the solar system.
Like it's really,

1631
01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.790
you have to be crazy.
You look at their,
their what they've,

1632
01:36:41.970 --> 01:36:45.660
what they left in stone tablets.
Like they knew where the stars were,

1633
01:36:45.661 --> 01:36:47.730
they knew where the planets,
they knew the constellations.

1634
01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:51.270
They knew for sure they knew what was going on in our solar system.

1635
01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:54.120
They knew where the planets were.
They had them in the right order.

1636
01:36:54.330 --> 01:36:57.750
They had like little grant and people would try to say no,
that's not the planet.

1637
01:36:57.751 --> 01:36:59.820
So those are just some stars.
Like what are you talking?

1638
01:36:59.821 --> 01:37:03.330
Why is there the right amount?
Why they're the same size.
Why is it in proportion?

1639
01:37:03.331 --> 01:37:05.550
The big ones here in the smaller ones,
they're like,

1640
01:37:05.610 --> 01:37:08.940
that looks like the sun and the solar system.
It looks like our planets.

1641
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:10.840
<v 4>Right.
And you know,
family,</v>

1642
01:37:10.841 --> 01:37:15.430
basic things like nab guidance seems to be this metal plate which has a moon and

1643
01:37:15.431 --> 01:37:18.370
a settling it.
And then some kind of like bars and you kind of think about,

1644
01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:21.460
oh how sweet our ancestors were trying to depict the sun and the moon.

1645
01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:24.550
Elanco clever of them are little ancestors.

1646
01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:28.360
And then some people start to analyze this for real and they realize that if you

1647
01:37:28.361 --> 01:37:32.410
hold it in front of you,
you and you directed to the horizon,

1648
01:37:32.710 --> 01:37:36.910
these little bars,
which you might think are of no significance whatsoever,

1649
01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:40.090
mark on the place where these were found in Germany,

1650
01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:43.990
the position of the rising of the sun and the setting of the sun on things like

1651
01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:47.980
the solstices and equinoxes and all of a sudden you kind of go,
Oh shit,

1652
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:52.150
it looks stupid.
But actually,
you know,
it's a very clever device.

1653
01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:56.370
What's the name of this device?
It's the neighbor disks.
[inaudible] Sky Neb Ra.

1654
01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:59.530
<v 2>There's a one thing that you talked about in your book that we've talked about</v>

1655
01:37:59.531 --> 01:38:03.940
on this podcast before because it's uh,
it's always fascinated me that device.

1656
01:38:03.941 --> 01:38:06.580
How do you say it again?
What's the antica terra device?

1657
01:38:06.581 --> 01:38:09.340
Explain that thing cause that's a mind fuck and a half.

1658
01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:13.190
<v 4>Well,
the antica terra device is basically a piece of metal,</v>

1659
01:38:13.610 --> 01:38:14.750
which was heavily corroded,

1660
01:38:14.751 --> 01:38:19.751
found in the ship wreck off the coast of Greece in 1901 or 1902.

1661
01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:24.080
It was put in a museum where it's sat for several decades.

1662
01:38:24.081 --> 01:38:28.850
And in 1950s and sixties,
a guy called Derek the price solo,

1663
01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:32.540
sorry,
Derek desoto price and became interested in this.

1664
01:38:32.541 --> 01:38:33.560
And he began to look at it.

1665
01:38:33.561 --> 01:38:38.480
He began to study this and he felt that is somehow was a scale model of our

1666
01:38:38.481 --> 01:38:42.440
solar system thrown in some kind of uh,
constellations,

1667
01:38:42.441 --> 01:38:46.220
throw in obviously the moon,
throw in some zodiacal signs.

1668
01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:51.170
And he began to experiment with this.
Uh,
he pushed it theory forward,

1669
01:38:51.171 --> 01:38:54.470
which was attacked because we all know that the Greeks are stupid and we're not

1670
01:38:54.471 --> 01:38:57.200
able to do this because,
you know,
the earth was flat,

1671
01:38:57.201 --> 01:39:01.460
wasn't it until somebody in the 16th century,
um,
proved otherwise.

1672
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:05.840
So he was attacked.
But in the last 10,
15 years,

1673
01:39:05.841 --> 01:39:09.530
and specifically with computer modeling techniques,

1674
01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:11.020
what they have found is,

1675
01:39:11.021 --> 01:39:16.021
is basically that the direct price wasn't 100% right,

1676
01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:22.180
but that he definitely had the right frame of mind that this was basically a

1677
01:39:22.591 --> 01:39:25.730
scale model of our,
of our solar system.
Now,

1678
01:39:25.731 --> 01:39:30.080
what they've been able to show is that the Greeks were using Babylonian things

1679
01:39:30.081 --> 01:39:32.810
like metronic cycles about the moon.
Um,

1680
01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:37.840
that basically this device was taking in [inaudible] information from ancient

1681
01:39:38.241 --> 01:39:43.220
Babylonia,
Greek,
uh,
native to Greek things,
general information about,

1682
01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:44.413
uh,
you know,

1683
01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:49.510
how the earth has 365 days to go around the sun and all of that stuff that they

1684
01:39:49.911 --> 01:39:53.620
made this device,
um,
which basically,
you know,

1685
01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:56.720
would have had the sun at its middle and then all the plants going around it

1686
01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:59.180
that this device actually worked.

1687
01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:03.920
That is kind of like what's put in motion and then continued watch for the

1688
01:40:03.921 --> 01:40:07.850
universe.
Yeah.
And or those sorts of sort of sources.
And um,

1689
01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.850
they think because they don't know,
you know,
this device was fan.

1690
01:40:10.851 --> 01:40:14.240
So they go into ancient accounts and ancient Greek accounts and trying to find

1691
01:40:14.241 --> 01:40:16.610
out whether anybody is talking about the 10.

1692
01:40:16.611 --> 01:40:21.140
They have found sporadic references to people basically saying this would sit in

1693
01:40:21.141 --> 01:40:21.974
the temple.

1694
01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:26.570
So somehow our ancient Greek ancestors were creating these devices.

1695
01:40:26.571 --> 01:40:31.460
We're putting them into temples to basically show how the universe work.

1696
01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:32.330
Imagine that,
you know,

1697
01:40:32.331 --> 01:40:36.620
imagine going into a Christian Church right now and finding a scale of the solar

1698
01:40:36.621 --> 01:40:40.010
system in there,
but for the Greeks,
that was apparently what they wanted.

1699
01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:44.660
<v 2>And we have,
what does the idea of how old this thing is?</v>

1700
01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:45.600
<v 4>Um,</v>

1701
01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:50.600
the device is probably second century or first century BC and that is what

1702
01:40:51.811 --> 01:40:52.520
remains of it.

1703
01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:54.130
<v 2>So it's at 2000 years old.</v>

1704
01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:57.460
<v 4>Yes.
Fucking Christ.</v>

1705
01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:03.580
What is the,
what's the academic response to like what do they believe it is?

1706
01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:05.290
Um,

1707
01:41:05.290 --> 01:41:10.290
they are silently accepting really they are,

1708
01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:15.730
um,
they basically,
you know,
they realize they can't contest its origins.

1709
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:19.990
It's found in the shipwreck.
They can't contest that.
It's 2002 years old.

1710
01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:22.960
Um,
so they have to accept for what it is.

1711
01:41:22.961 --> 01:41:25.780
They have to accept that there are gears,
um,

1712
01:41:26.170 --> 01:41:30.340
where day rebel at is if somebody would push the boat out too much.

1713
01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:33.910
So right now they connect say,
well,
you know,
it's an,

1714
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:38.760
it's a representation of the solar system but it has some errors in there.
Um,

1715
01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:43.180
and to some extent they can get away with that because basically what we have is

1716
01:41:43.181 --> 01:41:48.181
a piece of material which wasn't seawater for 2000 years and it is painstakingly

1717
01:41:49.450 --> 01:41:53.710
being kind of like,
you know,
how many wheels is it?
Does it have here?

1718
01:41:53.711 --> 01:41:55.930
How wide is this?
All of this is reconstruction,

1719
01:41:55.931 --> 01:41:59.770
which is going to take decades more before we have a completely accurate

1720
01:41:59.771 --> 01:42:04.060
representation of what is device was sort of corroded and mushed together.

1721
01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.460
Completely corroded.
Obviously you'd sits when a museum,

1722
01:42:06.461 --> 01:42:10.330
which basically means that they are very reluctant to do destructive testing or

1723
01:42:10.570 --> 01:42:11.920
anything of taking apart.

1724
01:42:11.921 --> 01:42:16.921
So it relies on technology to go through this piece of corroded material and

1725
01:42:16.931 --> 01:42:20.800
come up with better images,
better imaging software and all of that stuff too,

1726
01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:24.550
to identify what do wheels precisely where.
Um,

1727
01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.920
but basically the overall picture is this,

1728
01:42:26.921 --> 01:42:29.500
that the ancient Greeks were able to do certain things,

1729
01:42:29.501 --> 01:42:34.150
which we didn't give them credit for.
Um,
and very slowly,
um,
you know,

1730
01:42:34.151 --> 01:42:38.140
the academics are kind of going,
yeah,
okay,
that's fine because it's safe.

1731
01:42:38.141 --> 01:42:38.951
It's ancient Greece.

1732
01:42:38.951 --> 01:42:42.040
We've credited the ancient Greeks with an awful lot of these things and even

1733
01:42:42.041 --> 01:42:44.500
though it sits somewhat outside of the bailiwick,
but like you know,

1734
01:42:44.501 --> 01:42:47.590
we don't really want to credit them with a machine.

1735
01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:50.820
I mean people actually refer to it as the first computer.
Yeah.

1736
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:52.130
<v 2>Spelling.
So folks,</v>

1737
01:42:52.131 --> 01:42:55.080
cause I know people are scrambling right now to figure out how do you,

1738
01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:55.710
how do you spell it?

1739
01:42:55.710 --> 01:43:00.710
<v 4>Antica terra anti as in we don't care about them and Katerra.</v>

1740
01:43:00.810 --> 01:43:03.450
K Y t h e r a.

1741
01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:07.730
<v 2>So go check out that if you really want to get high in the middle,</v>

1742
01:43:07.731 --> 01:43:08.690
almost like a third.

1743
01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:12.020
I think that's just a screw or a bolt or something like that.

1744
01:43:12.021 --> 01:43:13.850
The whole thing is fascinating.
Oh look at that.

1745
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:17.510
That's 2000 years old that they were making something so complicated.

1746
01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:21.440
I think a steering wheel.
It does.
It will look,
it looks like.
Yeah,
it could be.

1747
01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:23.690
You look like it could be like a really ancient clock,

1748
01:43:24.230 --> 01:43:29.230
which is 2000 years ago and that obviously was from some technology that we

1749
01:43:31.191 --> 01:43:34.280
don't understand.
We don't know where they got the information from.

1750
01:43:34.281 --> 01:43:36.080
We don't know anything about it.

1751
01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:40.600
<v 4>Nope.
But what we do know about it is that,
you know,
again,</v>

1752
01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:46.000
our ancestors were more intelligent.
We're more clever than we standard,

1753
01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.200
give them credit for,

1754
01:43:47.250 --> 01:43:52.100
<v 2>and it's also a good representation of what happens to something just 2000</v>

1755
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.030
<v 1>years now.</v>

1756
01:43:53.031 --> 01:43:58.031
If you think about what 2000 years is to human history and then go back and say,

1757
01:43:58.101 --> 01:44:00.440
well,
this guy,
the Egyptologists was like,

1758
01:44:00.441 --> 01:44:03.920
where's the evidence of this 10,000 year old culture?
Where would that stuff be?

1759
01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:08.000
10th at eight more thousand plus years.
That's not gonna exist anymore.

1760
01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:10.460
It's obviously corroding away after 2000

1761
01:44:10.650 --> 01:44:14.250
<v 4>and if you come to the last Ice Age,
10 12,000 years ago,</v>

1762
01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.580
pots of Britain,
we're under an ice sheet,
two miles thick.

1763
01:44:18.030 --> 01:44:22.040
It washed away everything.
It changed to out of health.

1764
01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:26.460
Any hut which we would have had there any piece would have just been completely

1765
01:44:26.461 --> 01:44:28.560
obliterated by the power of the ice.

1766
01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:31.590
<v 1>Yeah,
that's a,
that's another thing that people have to take.</v>

1767
01:44:31.591 --> 01:44:34.260
Any consideration when you think about how long people had been around,

1768
01:44:34.261 --> 01:44:35.610
like we had to move around a lot.

1769
01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:39.750
Like there's there spots where people were around that were all raised by miles

1770
01:44:39.751 --> 01:44:43.080
of ice,
slowly crushing everything in its path.

1771
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:47.280
Literally like a giant eraser.
You know,
I a lot of people on Twitter,

1772
01:44:47.281 --> 01:44:48.640
like we're freaking out about the two,

1773
01:44:48.641 --> 01:44:52.170
two common thing showing me all these images of how they get babies,

1774
01:44:52.171 --> 01:44:54.450
his stretch their heads out.
It doesn't mean that he's an alien.

1775
01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:57.600
I'm not saying to Don Coleman was an alien.
What I am saying is,

1776
01:44:57.650 --> 01:45:00.390
and I think it's fascinating and I don't think,

1777
01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:04.110
I don't see how it could be disputed that all of these people who are stretching

1778
01:45:04.111 --> 01:45:08.850
their baby's heads out are trying to get their babies' heads to look like what

1779
01:45:08.851 --> 01:45:13.110
we consider the classic image of aliens.
That that's,
to me,
it's very weird.

1780
01:45:13.410 --> 01:45:17.370
It's very weird that you would want to do that.
Like I don't understand.

1781
01:45:17.371 --> 01:45:19.630
I know that there's weird things that people do culture a little,

1782
01:45:19.631 --> 01:45:22.290
like they stretched their necks out,
they put plates in their lips.

1783
01:45:22.291 --> 01:45:24.300
There's a lot of wacky shit that people do,

1784
01:45:24.690 --> 01:45:28.660
but that one to me is really interesting when you consider the fact that you're,

1785
01:45:28.661 --> 01:45:31.890
you're dealing with some culture that may or may not have had something to do

1786
01:45:31.891 --> 01:45:36.180
with space flight or you know,
or,
or,
uh,
air flight and,

1787
01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:39.280
<v 4>and they did it because they say to resemble the goats,</v>

1788
01:45:39.281 --> 01:45:40.450
to assemble the ancestors.

1789
01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:43.240
That's why we do it like in a nipple piercings and all of that stuff,

1790
01:45:43.241 --> 01:45:46.600
which might be considered weird in some cultures.
We know why they do it.

1791
01:45:46.630 --> 01:45:50.380
We know why we do it.
There's always a reason which we can identify.

1792
01:45:50.381 --> 01:45:53.020
And in this case,
the reason is because they want it to resemble the gods.

1793
01:45:53.090 --> 01:45:57.380
<v 1>Then there's another thing that I saw you touched on in this book is how many</v>

1794
01:45:57.410 --> 01:46:01.940
different pyramids and structures they're finding in South America.

1795
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.910
Yes.
It's really bananas,
isn't it?

1796
01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:05.970
<v 4>Well,
I mean,
you know,</v>

1797
01:46:06.330 --> 01:46:09.930
I wrote a previous book called a new pyramid h five years ago.

1798
01:46:09.931 --> 01:46:13.770
And that book is actually completely out of date because,
um,

1799
01:46:13.890 --> 01:46:17.850
and up until 1994 when Robert both,
I'll Roti Orion mystery.

1800
01:46:17.851 --> 01:46:18.900
We had this idea,

1801
01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:22.440
there are pyramids in Egypt and their pyramids in the Mayan culture and that's

1802
01:46:22.441 --> 01:46:27.120
pretty much it.
But now,
um,
and specifically around 2006 and seven,

1803
01:46:27.330 --> 01:46:31.320
every single week,
some pyramid was found somewhere.
Um,

1804
01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:36.380
and we are in a situation right now whereby the academics agree that the oldest

1805
01:46:37.471 --> 01:46:42.060
pyramids in the world are in Peru Chorale 2,800.

1806
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:44.130
Now the Egyptians could be older.

1807
01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:47.820
We have carbon dating results as we were saying,
but they refuse to publish them.

1808
01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:51.000
But you know,
officially to corral tournaments are older,

1809
01:46:51.330 --> 01:46:55.590
the largest one volume wise,
our latch DiLulla in Mexico as well.

1810
01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:57.010
And then,
um,

1811
01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:00.420
height wise there is a new contender in the Bosnian pyramids which might

1812
01:47:00.421 --> 01:47:04.680
actually be 220 meters I 660 yards high,
um,

1813
01:47:04.710 --> 01:47:08.310
which is pretty much quite a bit higher than,
than the Great Pyramid.

1814
01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:12.150
All of these things is,
is really changing the pyramid landscape.

1815
01:47:12.151 --> 01:47:16.410
And also what is happening is that we're beginning to understand why the

1816
01:47:16.411 --> 01:47:20.190
pyramids were built,
why,
um,
these structures were,

1817
01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:24.360
were there and there is this kind of like uniform template which basically says

1818
01:47:24.361 --> 01:47:28.440
that our ancestors somehow build pyramids because they were linked with kingship

1819
01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.800
and somehow enabled our ancestors and specifically the king to once again be

1820
01:47:34.861 --> 01:47:37.230
this bridge from one world to the other.

1821
01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:39.850
<v 1>What is the controversy about the Bosnian pyramids?</v>

1822
01:47:39.851 --> 01:47:43.900
Cause I know even Robert Schoch from Boston versus who doesn't believe that it's

1823
01:47:43.901 --> 01:47:45.880
a,
it's a manmade structure.

1824
01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:51.100
<v 4>Then the controversy is that there is very much divided between western science</v>

1825
01:47:51.431 --> 01:47:56.350
and former East Bloc signs on this.
Um,
it is very much maintained,

1826
01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:01.360
um,
you know,
by a small group of people.
But in the archeological establishment,

1827
01:48:01.361 --> 01:48:06.330
Antony Harding is one of them.
He was the former president of the West and,

1828
01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:09.160
uh,
sort of European archeological society.

1829
01:48:09.161 --> 01:48:13.480
And he basically said that if he found any archeologist digging on the Bosnian

1830
01:48:13.481 --> 01:48:14.314
term side,

1831
01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:19.500
he would forever make sure that this guy or woman never had any other job.

1832
01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:24.490
Um,
the reason I think why it is so controversial is because they are not in

1833
01:48:24.491 --> 01:48:25.324
control.

1834
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:29.590
The license went to San Jose [inaudible] who has three PhDs,

1835
01:48:29.591 --> 01:48:34.450
one in history,
mine studies one,
um,
in,
in,
in business.

1836
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:38.780
Um,
and another one who's I've forgotten,
I think it's in,
so in anthropology,
um,

1837
01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.660
actually no something in economics.
Um,

1838
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:44.530
and they realize that they were too late to realize that,
you know,

1839
01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:49.560
this was going to be run differently than traditional archeological digs.

1840
01:48:49.630 --> 01:48:53.770
And they made up some incredible,
you know,
bs about it.

1841
01:48:53.771 --> 01:48:56.650
Like what happened early on was that,
uh,

1842
01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:02.230
San Jose [inaudible] road to Zahi Hawass,
um,
and wanted to need,
uh,

1843
01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:05.980
basically wanted the geologists who come and study these pyramids.

1844
01:49:05.981 --> 01:49:10.870
He sent Doctor Rati Barakat Barakat stayed there for roughly two months.

1845
01:49:10.871 --> 01:49:15.130
He did the analysis and he said that these pyramids were manmade.
Um,

1846
01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:20.710
he,
um,
was then attacked by her,
was basically saying,
I never,

1847
01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:25.540
I never sent,
Barack got there too,
which was [inaudible] basically.

1848
01:49:25.541 --> 01:49:29.410
So the letter signed by Havas saying like,
you know,
what is this?

1849
01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:32.470
I was there in 2008.
I've been there a number of occasions,

1850
01:49:32.471 --> 01:49:36.580
but I was there in 2008 when the first international conference on the Bosnian

1851
01:49:36.581 --> 01:49:37.930
pyramids was being held.

1852
01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:42.380
You had the people who were in charge of the Chinese pyramids,
um,

1853
01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:47.070
who basically doing the excavations cm,
uh,
involving such things,
you know,
as,

1854
01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:48.100
as the emperor who,

1855
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:52.130
who unified China that with 30 of the leading Egyptologists Stair,

1856
01:49:52.131 --> 01:49:56.050
the current minister of antiquities,
Mohammed Ibrahim Ali was one of the,
the,

1857
01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:59.020
the people present there.
Uh,
his,

1858
01:49:59.230 --> 01:50:02.880
he was at that moment in time to deal with volcanology of ain't chains.
Um,

1859
01:50:03.390 --> 01:50:07.530
another dean of archaeology of Cairo University was there in short term,

1860
01:50:07.570 --> 01:50:10.750
you know,
30 off deleting Egyptologists and geologists from,
from,

1861
01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:15.580
from Egypt who were there.
When you go onto things like Wikipedia.
However,

1862
01:50:15.581 --> 01:50:19.210
the opening sentence will be that the pyramids are natural phenomenon,

1863
01:50:19.810 --> 01:50:23.590
but I would invite anybody to click on the talk page of Freaky pedia when it

1864
01:50:23.591 --> 01:50:24.790
comes to the Bosnian pyramids.

1865
01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:28.930
And you will see a guy called dog dweller who's constantly over there and he

1866
01:50:28.931 --> 01:50:33.910
gets asked the question.
Um,
somewhere on the talk page,
basically saying,

1867
01:50:33.911 --> 01:50:37.750
well,
in 2008,
this committee of,
you know,

1868
01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:42.640
remember they were discovered in 2005 first excavations happened in 2006,

1869
01:50:42.641 --> 01:50:46.400
2008 was the first time,
uh,
when all of these scientists get,

1870
01:50:46.401 --> 01:50:50.050
or they have since scattered in 2011 and 2012 as well.
Um,

1871
01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:54.040
but in 2008 to recommendation of all of these scientists was that they should

1872
01:50:54.041 --> 01:50:58.540
continue digging and that there was evidence to point out and to suspect that

1873
01:50:58.541 --> 01:51:00.850
these were more than likely man made.
Since then,

1874
01:51:01.090 --> 01:51:05.440
there has been more evidenced there when the quellar is asked,

1875
01:51:05.530 --> 01:51:09.370
why can the conclusions of the international conference on the Bosnian pyramids

1876
01:51:09.371 --> 01:51:14.371
in 2008 not be mentioned on the front page of the entrance of the Bosnian

1877
01:51:14.561 --> 01:51:16.960
pyramids?
He says,
well,

1878
01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:21.580
people who believe in creation have these semis pseudo archeological conferences

1879
01:51:21.581 --> 01:51:25.330
as well.
Um,
and Wikipedia should not adhere to these things.

1880
01:51:25.930 --> 01:51:29.590
Sure.
But in this case,
when it comes to the Bosnian pyramids,

1881
01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:33.760
the leading lights of archeology signed off,

1882
01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:38.880
physically signed off with their signature on these conclusions from 2008,

1883
01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:43.690
but there is this idea,
you know,
that we should not look at it.

1884
01:51:43.691 --> 01:51:47.370
And again it has to do with why.
What about Robert Schoch though?
Cause he's not,

1885
01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:52.420
Robert Schoch went there in 2007 when when very little was,

1886
01:51:52.450 --> 01:51:55.940
wasn't covered.
So much more has happened since.
Um,

1887
01:51:56.050 --> 01:51:58.030
and I would actually invite him to,
to go back.

1888
01:51:58.031 --> 01:52:00.480
I would invite everybody to go back.
Um,

1889
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:06.100
so convincing they have done pretty much more excavations.
They have found,
um,

1890
01:52:06.130 --> 01:52:08.500
you know,
at that moment in time of the tunnel complex,

1891
01:52:08.590 --> 01:52:13.590
pretty much what you had in 2007 was roughly 75 yards of have tunnel complex.

1892
01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:17.740
It looked like going in one direction for 40,

1893
01:52:17.741 --> 01:52:21.490
50 yards and 25 yards in another direction.
Since then,

1894
01:52:21.491 --> 01:52:25.240
they have found a thousand yards of this.
They have found that it loops back.

1895
01:52:25.241 --> 01:52:29.950
They have found exposed areas where they didn't have to even scrape anything out

1896
01:52:29.951 --> 01:52:32.410
where it just is.
They have found underground rivers,

1897
01:52:32.411 --> 01:52:37.411
they have found gigantic stone bulgur swing eight tons lying in the middle of of

1898
01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:42.550
these things of these tunnel complex as they have,
you know,
dug up elsewhere.

1899
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:46.700
They have found how,
for example,
treat pyramids saw perfectly.

1900
01:52:46.701 --> 01:52:48.800
The tops of them are perfectly equidistant.

1901
01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:51.770
They have found how on certain dates of the year,

1902
01:52:52.010 --> 01:52:56.450
the pyramid of the sun costs the shadow precisely on the top of the Pyramid of

1903
01:52:56.450 --> 01:52:58.220
the moon.
All of these things are,
you know,

1904
01:52:58.250 --> 01:53:02.780
things which have been discovered since 2007 and what shock was looking at in

1905
01:53:02.781 --> 01:53:07.260
2007 was very little.
They kind of like,
you know it,

1906
01:53:07.261 --> 01:53:11.930
it's almost kind of like going into your garden and saying,
Hey,
I've,

1907
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:13.280
I've hit this patch.
It's,

1908
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:18.080
it's 10 inches wide and it's a stone and it might be something completely else.

1909
01:53:18.081 --> 01:53:20.360
And you ask a guy about the 10 inches.

1910
01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:25.520
<v 1>It seems to me that a go Beckley tabby was the first real significant monkey</v>

1911
01:53:26.571 --> 01:53:30.030
ranch that they had to discover.
You know that they had to,

1912
01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:34.140
they had to admit that this fucking thing was 14,000 plus years old.

1913
01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:38.160
There's no getting around it.
And it is a [inaudible] this point,

1914
01:53:38.161 --> 01:53:42.330
I believe it's a 5% has been Escovedo.
Is that what it is at now?

1915
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:45.480
<v 4>Yes.
I mean,
did they keep going say the percentages go up?</v>

1916
01:53:45.610 --> 01:53:49.840
<v 1>Yes.
And it's so it's a slow process.
The s excavation,
so five,</v>

1917
01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:54.760
5% of it has been uncovered and it was purposely covered up 14,000

1918
01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:59.600
<v 4>yes.
So it's so incredible.
I mean like,
you know,
they'll kind collect,
tell you,</v>

1919
01:53:59.601 --> 01:54:04.400
oh and you know,
t shaped columns,
blah blah,
blah this,
but look at the images.

1920
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:08.360
This is treat,
I mentioned carving of,
of animals and kind of,
yeah,

1921
01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:11.350
<v 1>that's the two folks who understand the,
you know,</v>

1922
01:54:11.351 --> 01:54:15.490
like when you like say if you had a flat wall and you wanted a car of a monkey

1923
01:54:15.491 --> 01:54:16.210
into it,

1924
01:54:16.210 --> 01:54:19.450
like you would just draw the monkey like you would on a two dimensional piece of

1925
01:54:19.451 --> 01:54:21.190
paper.
That's not what they did.

1926
01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:26.230
They actually made it larger and then cut the monkey.

1927
01:54:26.231 --> 01:54:28.840
Or it wasn't a monkey,
but they cut like the lizard.

1928
01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:33.340
They cut different animals out of it so that they stuck out and then the rest of

1929
01:54:33.341 --> 01:54:34.810
it was flat and smooth.

1930
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:39.370
So it all came from one giant piece of stone and they had the technology to trim

1931
01:54:39.610 --> 01:54:41.410
everything else straight around it,

1932
01:54:41.411 --> 01:54:45.970
get to that one spot and then construct this little relief animal.

1933
01:54:45.971 --> 01:54:47.170
It's really weird.

1934
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:51.200
<v 4>Yeah,
absolutely.
And you know,
I think it's,
it's on something on power,</v>

1935
01:54:51.201 --> 01:54:53.870
which we again don't see for thousands of years.

1936
01:54:53.890 --> 01:54:55.460
Ancient Egyptians did it somewhat,

1937
01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:59.510
but I think really it takes us to gothic times.
Then Cathedral building,

1938
01:54:59.511 --> 01:55:02.540
when you see some of these intricacies once again on this plane

1939
01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:07.880
<v 1>and it's all built at a time where they believe people were just a 100% hunter</v>

1940
01:55:08.731 --> 01:55:12.690
gatherers.
When you go back to 14,000 years standard,

1941
01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:17.130
the standard academic model is that people were like really unsophisticated back

1942
01:55:17.131 --> 01:55:18.810
then sitting on the boat.
Yeah.

1943
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:23.190
Just chasing animals and throwing sticks at him and shit.
Meanwhile these people,

1944
01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:24.270
and they found this,

1945
01:55:24.271 --> 01:55:27.300
cause the dude was just like sheep herding and he found a rock.
Yeah.

1946
01:55:27.570 --> 01:55:30.270
He like kicked this rock was moving around with the fuck is this.

1947
01:55:30.271 --> 01:55:34.410
So he starts digging around it then realizes what was it,
nine feet 19 feet tall.

1948
01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:36.510
How many feet was the column?

1949
01:55:36.570 --> 01:55:37.081
<v 4>Yeah,
I,</v>

1950
01:55:37.081 --> 01:55:40.140
I've I've done who the exact dimensions that they normally like somebody in the

1951
01:55:40.141 --> 01:55:44.850
1960s you know,
had had to look at it and I'm the,
the thing was like,

1952
01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:48.720
oh this is a medieval Byzantine Sam cemetery of no interest whatsoever.

1953
01:55:48.721 --> 01:55:52.500
And then everything happened in the early 1990s there now people who are

1954
01:55:52.501 --> 01:55:57.501
actually beginning to do investigations into it and are coming up with stellar

1955
01:55:57.931 --> 01:56:01.250
alignments and the fact that these ancestors who built go back to the tab,

1956
01:56:01.251 --> 01:56:02.430
he had knowledge of the stars.

1957
01:56:02.431 --> 01:56:06.330
And what is interesting is not simply that they had knowledge of the stars and

1958
01:56:06.331 --> 01:56:07.170
the constellations,

1959
01:56:07.171 --> 01:56:11.850
but that the kind of stars and constellations they were interested in happens to

1960
01:56:11.851 --> 01:56:15.270
be the kind of constellations which other cultures like ancient Egypt and the

1961
01:56:15.271 --> 01:56:19.700
mines were interested in the work as well.
So you have this continuum of,
of,

1962
01:56:19.701 --> 01:56:21.030
of knowledge and you know,

1963
01:56:21.090 --> 01:56:24.070
the more research is going to happen there and go back to the happy,

1964
01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:29.010
the more is going to be exposed.
And there are actually pockets of,

1965
01:56:29.070 --> 01:56:32.670
uh,
of other structures in the yoga back,
the tappy,

1966
01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:35.190
which are actually slightly older,
but again,

1967
01:56:35.191 --> 01:56:38.090
it's going to be piecemeal given to us,
um,

1968
01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:41.880
as to how we are older and more interesting than we really think we are.

1969
01:56:42.850 --> 01:56:45.760
<v 1>The whole thing is crazy.
They're 10 feet high.
Those,
uh,</v>

1970
01:56:45.761 --> 01:56:50.050
these giant t shaped monolith pill monolithic pillars there,

1971
01:56:50.051 --> 01:56:53.080
limestone and uh,
there's a,

1972
01:56:53.081 --> 01:56:57.000
another bigger pair of pillars is placed in the center of the structures.

1973
01:56:57.060 --> 01:57:01.180
It's craziness.
And again,
it's an enormous site.

1974
01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:05.740
Like they're just slowly starting to piece it together.
What do they use?

1975
01:57:05.741 --> 01:57:09.610
Do they they x ray the ground or something?
How they find out how big it is?

1976
01:57:09.710 --> 01:57:12.210
<v 4>Yeah.
Doing covered it,
yeah.
To doing basically GFS.</v>

1977
01:57:13.590 --> 01:57:17.910
<v 1>And this is just one of them is just one of them that might exist and we can</v>

1978
01:57:17.911 --> 01:57:22.770
easily stumble upon one and a year.
That's 10,000 years older than that.

1979
01:57:22.890 --> 01:57:25.020
<v 4>Yeah.
Oh,
I mean,
you know,
corral the pyramids,</v>

1980
01:57:25.021 --> 01:57:29.430
which we were talking about just now in,
through,
um,
40 years ago,

1981
01:57:29.431 --> 01:57:32.400
people looked at them and said like,
they look like shit.
They like,

1982
01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:35.790
they don't even look like anything man made.
And guess what,
you know,

1983
01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:37.950
erosion destroyed these things.

1984
01:57:37.951 --> 01:57:42.120
It's like picking at the end to Katerra device and thinking this is just a piece

1985
01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:46.020
of,
of crap.
Um,
that's 2000 years old.

1986
01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:49.110
Things change,
you know,
put,

1987
01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:53.400
put a a long play record in the sunshine and we know what happens to it as well.

1988
01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:54.090
Um,

1989
01:57:54.090 --> 01:57:58.560
but we need to recognize that sometimes we miss identify it and then we go back

1990
01:57:58.561 --> 01:58:01.530
and we say,
Oh shit,
this is so much more interesting than,

1991
01:58:01.531 --> 01:58:05.580
than we originally thought it was.
And that is happening relatively a lot.

1992
01:58:05.581 --> 01:58:08.280
To go back to the Tapi is an example of that corral pyramid says and those are

1993
01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:08.970
one of them.

1994
01:58:08.970 --> 01:58:13.050
<v 1>It's fascinating that the more a culture advances the more easily it's records</v>

1995
01:58:13.051 --> 01:58:16.740
are destroyed because in the beginning you just carve and shit on rocks.

1996
01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:18.750
And then when it gets to us,
we got,
you know,

1997
01:58:18.751 --> 01:58:21.930
micro USB cards in your fucking cell phone and you know,

1998
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:27.200
you lose that little fucker,
you know,
it's gone or you know,
late leave it around,

1999
01:58:27.210 --> 01:58:30.570
it gets stepped on a couple of times.
It's done,
you know,
leave it in the ground,

2000
01:58:30.571 --> 01:58:34.920
the ground will eat it and absorb it in a few years,
it'll be gone.
It's a,

2001
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:38.460
it's fascinating to think that if we had some sort of a reset button,

2002
01:58:38.461 --> 01:58:41.920
like you look at this hurricane that just hit New York and New Jersey and the

2003
01:58:41.921 --> 01:58:43.870
massive amount of devastation that it did.

2004
01:58:44.290 --> 01:58:45.810
<v 4>And just on a purely practical,</v>

2005
01:58:45.811 --> 01:58:48.640
I've like how all of a sudden these people are unable to survive.

2006
01:58:48.670 --> 01:58:53.670
We really need to send very basic things like clothing and food out to them.
Um,

2007
01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:54.191
you know,
it,

2008
01:58:54.191 --> 01:58:59.191
it just shows you how reliant we are on technology to keep our food fresh,

2009
01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:04.740
uh,
to keep our food frozen,
to keep us warm.
And when that isn't there anymore,

2010
01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:07.400
we are unable to cope.
We do.

2011
01:59:07.450 --> 01:59:12.040
These people really need help from the rest of us because we have become so

2012
01:59:12.041 --> 01:59:15.170
overly sophisticated that be can no longer survive in said,

2013
01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:19.580
<v 1>and we are here in southern California until we get an earthquake.</v>

2014
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.350
We don't even know what the fuck whether is,
we are completely detached.

2015
01:59:24.590 --> 01:59:28.120
That's why some of the most clueless people live here.
The the,

2016
01:59:28.121 --> 01:59:32.030
there was some of the people that are the most detached from nature and from the

2017
01:59:32.031 --> 01:59:36.530
concept of the fact that we are a part of an ecosystem and we are in fact on a

2018
01:59:36.531 --> 01:59:37.364
planet.

2019
01:59:37.610 --> 01:59:42.610
Because when you live in Florida and one of those motherfuckers come through and

2020
01:59:42.831 --> 01:59:44.510
you realize that this is possible,

2021
01:59:44.511 --> 01:59:48.230
that the earth can possibly have this sort of a crazy violent,

2022
01:59:48.260 --> 01:59:52.790
powerful reaction is very humbling.
It's very humbling and it's and it,

2023
01:59:52.791 --> 01:59:56.510
and it makes you like,
oh,
we've got to plan for this.
Okay,
we,
we've met,

2024
01:59:56.511 --> 01:59:59.580
we might have to dig holes like deep in the ground and cement the men and,

2025
01:59:59.670 --> 02:00:03.740
and build some kind of a shelter that you could survive through this because

2026
02:00:03.741 --> 02:00:08.000
being on the surface is not an option.
Here in California.

2027
02:00:08.001 --> 02:00:11.710
We don't have that every now and then the ground moves,
but we forget about it.

2028
02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:14.180
It only moves like every couple of decades.
Everybody freaks out,

2029
02:00:14.181 --> 02:00:17.630
moves to Colorado and they slowly creep back in and everybody pretends it never

2030
02:00:17.631 --> 02:00:18.464
happens.

2031
02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:21.890
It just keeps on going on building houses on the side of hills with stilts.

2032
02:00:22.490 --> 02:00:23.650
Have you seen those fucking things?

2033
02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:28.220
How hilarious are those coming from what you know about a ancient history?

2034
02:00:28.221 --> 02:00:31.880
Like what are you doing with this temporary house?
You have you silly bitch.

2035
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.840
<v 4>Yeah.
And you know,
but here's the difference.
I think,
you know,</v>

2036
02:00:35.841 --> 02:00:39.860
our ancestors would just like us.
They wanted to build that beautiful house.

2037
02:00:39.861 --> 02:00:41.570
They wanted to have that beautiful view,

2038
02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:44.810
but they made sure it wasn't built on Boyden sticks.

2039
02:00:44.850 --> 02:00:47.690
They made gigantic foundations in stone.

2040
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:51.470
This is the reason that I can like ball back is,
is uh,
you know,

2041
02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:52.970
say seismically active,

2042
02:00:52.971 --> 02:00:57.971
but definitely not as much as things like Cusco shakes every five seconds.

2043
02:00:58.041 --> 02:01:00.890
And the Inca civilization built for this.

2044
02:01:00.891 --> 02:01:04.490
They built gigantically weird shaped stones,
um,
in,

2045
02:01:04.491 --> 02:01:08.590
in all shapes whereby we know day withstand earthquakes.
Um,
you know,

2046
02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:12.450
<v 1>is that why they have things that,
what curvy fit in like jigsaw puzzles.</v>

2047
02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:13.960
<v 4>Lovely.
Because you know,</v>

2048
02:01:13.961 --> 02:01:18.961
what happens to Sherman oaks was an epicenter and I think the 94 earthquake and

2049
02:01:19.181 --> 02:01:22.120
basically two plates kind of like made houses jump up.

2050
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:25.870
And then from the other side they basically gave them a different sellers so to

2051
02:01:25.871 --> 02:01:30.520
speak.
Um,
and so because we build so linearly,

2052
02:01:30.850 --> 02:01:34.520
um,
you know,
houses,
I mean I'm slightly exaggerating here,
jumped up and Jim,
Jim,

2053
02:01:34.570 --> 02:01:39.140
Jim down again.
Um,
but because all of these stones can kind of go,
okay,

2054
02:01:39.141 --> 02:01:41.390
we can't jump,
but we can't show that.
We kind of like,

2055
02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:44.950
we're stuck because we are so wedged with these other stones.

2056
02:01:44.951 --> 02:01:48.710
They earthquake resistant and our ancestors understood this.
They employ this.

2057
02:01:48.711 --> 02:01:53.090
But somehow,
you know,
despite some of these billion dollar 12,
okay,

2058
02:01:53.091 --> 02:01:56.060
slight exaggeration,
million dollar houses in Los Angeles,

2059
02:01:56.090 --> 02:02:00.020
the architects don't seem too willing to borrow from our Inca ancestors when it

2060
02:02:00.021 --> 02:02:01.460
comes to two designs.

2061
02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:04.630
<v 2>Planned obsolescence,
that sort of,
as no one's making a house,</v>

2062
02:02:04.631 --> 02:02:06.040
it's going to live for 10,000 years.

2063
02:02:06.041 --> 02:02:11.020
They just want a house as good for like a cop.
100,
insulate it,
make it eco.

2064
02:02:11.050 --> 02:02:13.330
How long have your solar panels good for the solar panel?

2065
02:02:13.331 --> 02:02:14.440
Even good for a hundred years

2066
02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:19.030
<v 4>I think.
I think it,
I think they mostly outdated by the,</v>

2067
02:02:19.090 --> 02:02:20.980
by the ability to get like near,

2068
02:02:20.981 --> 02:02:23.740
they want to be replaced because they constantly keep doing better ones,

2069
02:02:23.741 --> 02:02:26.170
which get more power out of them.

2070
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:30.910
<v 2>Now you wrote a rebuttal to the,
it's a dude who made that video,
which was the,</v>

2071
02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:33.690
yeah,
Chris White who made,
uh,
the,
um,

2072
02:02:34.050 --> 02:02:38.980
it was ancient aliens debunked and essentially he pointed out errors that

2073
02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:42.600
existed on the television show.
And then you made a,
you,

2074
02:02:42.601 --> 02:02:47.130
you rebutted his,
his video.
What did you feel like it was wrong about his video?

2075
02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:50.010
<v 4>Well,
there's,
there's several things wrong.
And you know,</v>

2076
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:54.060
one of the things is that he,
even though he's not your traditional skeptic,

2077
02:02:54.061 --> 02:02:57.210
he does betray some of those things.
Um,

2078
02:02:57.211 --> 02:03:01.080
he will go and read something on the Internet and we'll say,
well,

2079
02:03:01.081 --> 02:03:05.430
on the Internet I found something else.
Um,
and some of the science,

2080
02:03:05.431 --> 02:03:07.650
he references like rational Wiki,

2081
02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:13.410
which is basically a skeptic Wikipedia.
Um,
and he'll kind of like say,

2082
02:03:13.411 --> 02:03:16.770
look,
this guy shows you how,
um,

2083
02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:20.800
when it comes to the people in my hand,
your Daro,
um,
how they were,
you know,

2084
02:03:20.890 --> 02:03:22.740
like on ancient aliens,

2085
02:03:22.770 --> 02:03:27.630
it is said that these people are lying hand in hand in the middle of,
um,

2086
02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:32.580
of the street.
And this guy says that they were buried.
Well,

2087
02:03:32.581 --> 02:03:36.090
this guy's article is actually online and this guy actually says,

2088
02:03:36.330 --> 02:03:40.350
when they were doing initial excavations in my hand,
your Daro,
they were done.

2089
02:03:40.351 --> 02:03:43.120
So crappily that it's,
uh,

2090
02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:48.000
you don't know it is open for speculation.
They might have died in the street,

2091
02:03:48.001 --> 02:03:52.770
they might have been buried.
Nobody knows.
And this guy says that himself.
Uh,

2092
02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:56.580
he then goes on to to basically say,
but in my opinion,
they were buried.

2093
02:03:56.910 --> 02:04:01.910
<v 2>So he's basically siding purposefully towards the skeptical thing when it's</v>

2094
02:04:03.411 --> 02:04:04.820
still an open point of,

2095
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:08.120
<v 4>yeah,
I mean,
on a number of occasions,
I agree with him.
Like,
you know,</v>

2096
02:04:08.121 --> 02:04:12.710
there are certain things which people hold the allee and we'll say on camera,

2097
02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:15.860
uh,
which I don't agree with him.

2098
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:20.030
<v 2>You're fucked whenever Giorgio goes with Georgiou sucralose goals.</v>

2099
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:25.400
Is it possible?
Oh your mother fucker.
You got man,
cause as soon as he does that,

2100
02:04:25.401 --> 02:04:29.480
dude,
it's fucking,
everything's aliens is possible.

2101
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:34.330
<v 4>But I mean that,
that's like,
you know,
I mean my biggest beef with,
with him is,</v>

2102
02:04:34.450 --> 02:04:39.060
is to do with crystal skulls.
Like he makes it appear as if he cannot,

2103
02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:42.310
he comes up with this new media and says like Anna Mitchell hedges never,

2104
02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:46.800
she always tried to sell the crystal skull and she never allowed for scientific

2105
02:04:46.801 --> 02:04:50.010
dating.
And I said like,
well she did,

2106
02:04:50.490 --> 02:04:53.790
she gave it to you.
Look Packard.
Um,

2107
02:04:53.850 --> 02:04:57.880
and she gave it to the British Museum and he then comes back and says like,

2108
02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:00.360
what I know about the British Museum,
uh,

2109
02:05:00.361 --> 02:05:04.430
analysis in 1936 I even mang mentioned it in the documentary and you kind of go,

2110
02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:05.730
no,

2111
02:05:05.730 --> 02:05:10.680
you're actually referring to you yourself claim to have read this article.

2112
02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:12.240
In this article,

2113
02:05:12.510 --> 02:05:17.130
there is a photograph of animal [inaudible] hedges in the British Museum when

2114
02:05:17.131 --> 02:05:20.220
she was doing the dating.
By the way,
there's an entire video of it,

2115
02:05:20.221 --> 02:05:23.550
which the BBC mate,
uh,
in 1980 or 81,

2116
02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:27.270
and you can see Mitchell hedges in the British Museum with the British Museum

2117
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:31.440
school and her school there.
I'm talking about the 1980 stating,
but that is,

2118
02:05:31.470 --> 02:05:35.400
you know,
that is,
you know,
Chris is,
again,

2119
02:05:35.401 --> 02:05:38.610
he's not your typical skeptic,
but he does this thing of like,

2120
02:05:38.611 --> 02:05:41.400
I have found something on the internet which says something differently,

2121
02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:43.290
therefore you have to be wrong.

2122
02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:46.860
And there was definitely a lot of shit that he was right about.
Right.

2123
02:05:46.890 --> 02:05:50.040
There was a lot of errors that you pointed out.
He,

2124
02:05:50.070 --> 02:05:54.480
he make some clever miss directions though with some of it as well.
Kind of like,

2125
02:05:54.481 --> 02:05:55.530
you know,
like,
yes,

2126
02:05:55.560 --> 02:06:00.450
Georgiou is wrong when he says diorite or whatever the other one is.

2127
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:01.703
Um,

2128
02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:05.960
but it doesn't change anything to do with the density or the hardness of,

2129
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:07.020
of that material.

2130
02:06:07.410 --> 02:06:12.120
He also comes up with kind of like what I think is sometimes the mids direction

2131
02:06:12.150 --> 02:06:14.100
of like he's,
he'll kind of say like,

2132
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:17.490
why is David Hatchery Children's talking about levitation?
Um,

2133
02:06:17.491 --> 02:06:19.560
when it comes to the Easter island statues,
one,

2134
02:06:19.561 --> 02:06:21.640
they could have been put on wooden rollers.
Well,

2135
02:06:21.641 --> 02:06:25.170
the reason why David had her children's is talking about it is because the local

2136
02:06:25.171 --> 02:06:28.620
say that they walked,
that they were floated in to space.

2137
02:06:28.621 --> 02:06:33.621
So ancient aliens is discussing the possibility whether it is possible that

2138
02:06:33.901 --> 02:06:37.290
there was such a thing as levitation.
It's a question mark.
You know,

2139
02:06:37.291 --> 02:06:40.950
we are exploring the possibility that our ancestors might be wrong.

2140
02:06:41.340 --> 02:06:45.150
Our ancestors actually don't say that they were put on wooden rollers.

2141
02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:49.140
They might have been put on wooden rollers.
Um,
you know,
that might've happened.

2142
02:06:49.141 --> 02:06:53.220
Our ancestors might have complained and speculated and said like,
oh,
well,

2143
02:06:53.230 --> 02:06:56.280
wouldn't roller sounds so boring,
let's say the levitated.
Um,

2144
02:06:56.580 --> 02:07:00.390
but it is about the exploration of the possibility and this is what ancient

2145
02:07:00.391 --> 02:07:04.560
aliens does.
It's saying,
should we take our ancestors word for it?

2146
02:07:04.590 --> 02:07:08.060
Is this possible?
And then,
you know,
it's up to the viewer to,

2147
02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:09.810
to decide whether or not it's the case.

2148
02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:14.800
But the biggest beef I have with Chris White is the following.
Um,

2149
02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:17.040
and it is very clever what he does.
He says,

2150
02:07:17.310 --> 02:07:21.240
no matter how many mistakes I have found by the fault,

2151
02:07:21.330 --> 02:07:24.450
I know that the ancient alien theory is wrong.

2152
02:07:24.690 --> 02:07:29.690
So even if he finds nothing wrong with the ancient deal in a series,

2153
02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:35.130
he basically says in his opening and his closing,
I know that this is impossible.

2154
02:07:35.670 --> 02:07:40.210
Um,
and he does a very clever trick as well,
which is,
um,
basically he says,

2155
02:07:40.510 --> 02:07:44.290
you know,
okay,
I found one evidence here,
I have found.
So one area here,

2156
02:07:44.291 --> 02:07:47.320
I had found another railroad there.
The third one,
they're great.

2157
02:07:47.321 --> 02:07:52.040
That's 50 hours of television.
You know,
if,
if you find 50 errors in there,
uh,

2158
02:07:52.130 --> 02:07:54.130
it's quite good.
Um,

2159
02:07:54.970 --> 02:07:59.970
but he sees every evidence as evidence of somehow there's a vast conspiracy by

2160
02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:03.690
us to,
to Ms Director.

2161
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:06.070
<v 2>Well,
there's certainly,
let's be honest,</v>

2162
02:08:06.071 --> 02:08:11.071
there's certainly a confirmation bias that's involved with almost every fringe

2163
02:08:11.981 --> 02:08:16.330
subject,
whether it's goats or big foot or aliens.
There is a,

2164
02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:21.340
an unquestionable confirmation bias where people who really want to believe in

2165
02:08:21.551 --> 02:08:23.620
it find ways to believe in it.

2166
02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:26.590
<v 4>But it's the same.
A traditional archeologist is up to xy.
He has loss.</v>

2167
02:08:26.591 --> 02:08:30.780
We'll find clues in there to kind of like explain certain things away as well.

2168
02:08:30.781 --> 02:08:32.060
It works on both sides.
Yes,

2169
02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:36.110
<v 2>totally.
Right.
I absolutely agree.
Especially when Mr Huw os he's famous for,</v>

2170
02:08:36.111 --> 02:08:38.820
he's funny,
isn't he in trouble,
wasn't even going to go to jail.
He,

2171
02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:43.070
he cannot leave the country.
What happened?
What'd you do wrong?
Some fashion shit.

2172
02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:47.360
Yes.
Basically sit and money disappeared in the ses.

2173
02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:51.090
Who would've thought that guy was crooked?
Most people are like,
what?
God,

2174
02:08:51.110 --> 02:08:53.750
what Dorks or these guys,
they're do there.
They're doing it.

2175
02:08:53.751 --> 02:08:58.700
They're gasbag about Egyptologists certain guys,
bitchy Egyptologists.

2176
02:08:59.300 --> 02:08:59.990
Um,

2177
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:04.620
I thought that what he did was a very brilliant,
uh,

2178
02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:09.670
take on mistakes and he was very time consuming and tedious.
And I,

2179
02:09:09.671 --> 02:09:12.770
I thought it was very well done and I can't wait to talk to him about it,

2180
02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:18.280
but my problem is that there's still a lot of courageousness to that stuff

2181
02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:21.590
saying that,
you know,

2182
02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:26.390
they had done and moved larger stones before and that somehow or another,

2183
02:09:26.420 --> 02:09:30.050
because of it was a,
a part of a foundation wall wasn't that one.

2184
02:09:30.070 --> 02:09:33.650
It was that it wasn't so impressive.
Like look,
the Baalbek like that,

2185
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.970
that's kind of crazy.

2186
02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Like there was a lot of where you're trying to find some reason why it's not

2187
02:09:40.101 --> 02:09:43.100
fantastic and it's obviously fantastic.

2188
02:09:43.190 --> 02:09:46.820
<v 4>Yeah.
And I mean,
you know what I,
and this is probably a sign of our times,</v>

2189
02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:50.060
but ancient aliens is a TV show.

2190
02:09:50.330 --> 02:09:54.080
It tries to put forward into the public mind.
Is this possible?

2191
02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:57.530
Here's a bit of traffic intonation for you.
Um,

2192
02:09:57.740 --> 02:10:00.560
and by default,
the ancient aliens,

2193
02:10:00.561 --> 02:10:05.561
the series is not identified with whether or not we have been visited by the P

2194
02:10:06.650 --> 02:10:07.790
in the past.
I mean,

2195
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:12.560
the best evidence was put forward by the likes of Carl Sagan and shows Ostrowski

2196
02:10:12.610 --> 02:10:17.090
in the,
in 19,
late 1970s,
Carl Sagan,
who was very much a skeptic,

2197
02:10:17.091 --> 02:10:20.570
he didn't believe in anything like crop circles and all that stuff.
Um,

2198
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:24.350
and he basically said,
you know,
of Paleo contact,

2199
02:10:24.351 --> 02:10:26.690
where do we have been visited in the past or not,
or not.

2200
02:10:26.930 --> 02:10:28.290
The best example is the one,

2201
02:10:28.291 --> 02:10:31.640
it's this creature which comes out of the sea and teachers,
man,

2202
02:10:31.641 --> 02:10:35.000
the arts of civilization,
various other things.
Uh,

2203
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:37.570
one is disappeared and other creature came up,
uh,

2204
02:10:37.730 --> 02:10:42.470
basically to cuff where you began to instruct people.
What does this from,

2205
02:10:42.770 --> 02:10:46.360
this is from Babylonia.
It is actually,
it's,
it's a Babylonian rendering of a,

2206
02:10:46.361 --> 02:10:49.940
of a Sumerian mythology as well.

2207
02:10:49.941 --> 02:10:53.360
So basically the Babylonians were repeating what they got from,

2208
02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:54.141
from the Samaritans.

2209
02:10:54.141 --> 02:10:58.430
And basically they were saying that from the Persian Gulf thousands of years
ago.

2210
02:10:58.610 --> 02:11:03.080
It's not too clear when precisely this creature came.
Um,

2211
02:11:03.170 --> 02:11:04.400
he came out of the sea,

2212
02:11:04.401 --> 02:11:09.401
he took off his kind of like fishy outside and underneath was a human hat and he

2213
02:11:10.191 --> 02:11:15.020
began to instruct our ancestors on the arts of architecture,
um,

2214
02:11:15.021 --> 02:11:18.230
mathematics and art and all of all of these sciences.

2215
02:11:18.690 --> 02:11:22.050
<v 2>Man,
that's a good way for aliens to go in the water first and then pop out.
Hey,</v>

2216
02:11:22.051 --> 02:11:25.680
we were here all along.
Yeah,
that's better than coming from the sky.
You know,

2217
02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:27.720
you're like,
I was right behind us.
True sort of.

2218
02:11:27.721 --> 02:11:30.250
I came here from another fucking galaxy.
Um,

2219
02:11:31.210 --> 02:11:35.580
<v 4>I mean,
you know,
in the eyes of Carl Sagan and many,
uh,</v>

2220
02:11:35.610 --> 02:11:38.220
people who are looking into this from it,
from a scientific point of view,

2221
02:11:38.221 --> 02:11:41.730
this is kind of like amongst the best evidence that we might have potentially

2222
02:11:41.731 --> 02:11:46.650
been visited by,
by,
by ancient aliens.
Chris White doesn't even mention it.

2223
02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:50.700
And it's kind of like,
okay,
you should really try to negate this.

2224
02:11:50.910 --> 02:11:55.110
If you want to pretend that you have completely destroyed the ancient alien

2225
02:11:55.111 --> 02:11:57.930
theory,
you know,
you can try and attack the ancient alien,

2226
02:11:58.260 --> 02:12:00.700
ancient aliens to series.
Um,

2227
02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:04.470
but if as long as you don't go for the best evidence,

2228
02:12:04.740 --> 02:12:09.000
like through on a story and you do it on a scientific level,
you kind of like,

2229
02:12:09.001 --> 02:12:12.330
you know,
you,
you argue why Carl Sagan thought this was interesting.

2230
02:12:12.340 --> 02:12:15.710
Wireless scientists thought this was interesting.
Then really you,

2231
02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:20.250
you can make a documentary and pretend that you have completely destroyed the

2232
02:12:20.251 --> 02:12:24.210
possibility that we were ever visited in the past by,
by ancient aliens.

2233
02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:25.140
But you haven't,

2234
02:12:25.141 --> 02:12:28.470
you can just do that at the end of your documentary and you're no better or

2235
02:12:28.471 --> 02:12:32.930
worse than the narrator on ancient alien series who says,
you know,
could have,

2236
02:12:32.931 --> 02:12:36.930
we could,
we have been visited by aliens and the pants on the same level.

2237
02:12:37.020 --> 02:12:39.600
<v 2>I see what you're saying.
You,
he's not considering all the evidence.</v>

2238
02:12:39.601 --> 02:12:43.650
He's trying to prove a point and it's,
there is a possibility,

2239
02:12:43.710 --> 02:12:45.660
no matter how many mistakes you guys make,

2240
02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:50.340
there are still a possibility that the human race has been visited.
And in fact,

2241
02:12:50.490 --> 02:12:54.170
maybe even engineered by advanced lifeforms.
It's,

2242
02:12:54.171 --> 02:12:55.560
it's absolutely a possibility.

2243
02:12:56.340 --> 02:13:01.110
<v 4>Well,
you know,
when it comes to such things as,
as,
as astrobiology,
it's,</v>

2244
02:13:01.111 --> 02:13:05.070
it's one of my great passions in the ancient alien question.

2245
02:13:05.130 --> 02:13:08.550
I write about it and I thought when I was going to write that chapter,

2246
02:13:08.551 --> 02:13:12.420
it was going to be boring.
It was going to be at some point in the past,

2247
02:13:12.421 --> 02:13:15.480
there were some scientists who thought that life came from elsewhere in the

2248
02:13:15.481 --> 02:13:19.200
universe riding on a comment or a meet to ride and then it crashed here.

2249
02:13:19.201 --> 02:13:22.710
And then all of a sudden we had life on planet us.
Um,

2250
02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:24.330
and it's so different.

2251
02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:28.770
What we have right now are astrobiologist who are working for NASA who are

2252
02:13:28.771 --> 02:13:33.690
saying that the building blocks of life are spontaneously in interstellar space.

2253
02:13:33.930 --> 02:13:38.930
That as a result lifelike us is potentially everywhere in the universe.

2254
02:13:39.450 --> 02:13:42.860
Um,
you know,
they have been saying that fire buses,
um,

2255
02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:46.560
are more than likely some of them more than likely are coming from,

2256
02:13:46.561 --> 02:13:48.690
from outer space as well.
Um,

2257
02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:53.300
<v 2>did you see that one?
I think it was from Harvard,
uh,
the astronomer that's a,</v>

2258
02:13:53.301 --> 02:13:58.301
that it's very unlikely that we'll ever find life and there is probably no life

2259
02:13:58.690 --> 02:14:03.370
anywhere but earth because we've looked at 500 planets and we have found no

2260
02:14:03.371 --> 02:14:07.450
life.
And I looked at that and I said,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2261
02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:12.480
You've looked at 501 planets and one out of 500 has life.

2262
02:14:13.010 --> 02:14:16.150
<v 4>What did Edison say?
I have found 202 ways of not making light.</v>

2263
02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:19.420
<v 2>I mean,
I just find that fascinating.
It's so,</v>

2264
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:22.770
it would be so arrogant when life does exist on this one.
That's so dumb.

2265
02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:27.180
Just because you looked at 500 other planets,
if it's one out of a thousand,

2266
02:14:27.181 --> 02:14:28.320
that's pretty amazing.

2267
02:14:28.321 --> 02:14:33.321
When you consider the hundreds of billions of stars just in this galaxy alone,

2268
02:14:34.570 --> 02:14:37.190
<v 4>I,
I don't know who you're referring to,
but like,
you know,
if,</v>

2269
02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:38.950
if he was the traditional sets,

2270
02:14:38.951 --> 02:14:41.610
I guy who looks a bit radio astronomy kind of stuff,

2271
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:45.210
NASA is a banding that they realize you're looking for a needle in a haystack.

2272
02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:48.770
It's built on so many assumptions.
Um,
no,

2273
02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:53.010
the bandwidth where they would be able to broadcast this NASA has basically

2274
02:14:53.011 --> 02:14:56.910
abandoned is they're looking at us through biology and they're basically saying

2275
02:14:57.210 --> 02:15:01.990
that,
you know,
there is now more than substantial evidence that indeed life,
um,

2276
02:15:02.190 --> 02:15:04.290
didn't originate on on this planet,

2277
02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:08.250
but that had a somewhere else in the universe and that it came here,

2278
02:15:08.251 --> 02:15:10.770
this theory of Panspermia,
which Francis Crick,

2279
02:15:10.771 --> 02:15:14.820
who was the guy who identified a structure to do the double helix of DNA.

2280
02:15:14.821 --> 02:15:17.370
He always said it didn't originate here,

2281
02:15:17.371 --> 02:15:19.950
that it came from somewhere else and NASA gas,

2282
02:15:19.951 --> 02:15:24.951
what the greatest astrobiologists in the world can't get published in peer

2283
02:15:25.171 --> 02:15:30.150
review journals because the peer review journals are still so adamant that life

2284
02:15:30.180 --> 02:15:34.200
originated on planet earth.
So NASA is doing science by press release day.

2285
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:38.280
They do the findings,
they get them peer reviews amongst their,
their,
their peers.

2286
02:15:38.281 --> 02:15:39.450
They know they can't get published.

2287
02:15:39.451 --> 02:15:42.690
So they published them on the Internet and everybody can consult them on the

2288
02:15:42.691 --> 02:15:45.870
Internet.
And the guys who do the peer review journals,

2289
02:15:46.110 --> 02:15:50.490
they're now saying that NASA is involved in a conspiracy to convince the world

2290
02:15:50.700 --> 02:15:55.200
that life exists elsewhere in the universe as well.
It's kind of like,
okay,

2291
02:15:56.410 --> 02:15:59.740
<v 2>it seems like shades of what Galileo had to go through.</v>

2292
02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:05.200
Just a more advanced form of arrogance because we have more information now to

2293
02:16:05.561 --> 02:16:10.480
back up our claims and we can make these big grandiose statements like,

2294
02:16:10.481 --> 02:16:13.090
well we've examined 500 planets.
We're pretty sure we're alone.

2295
02:16:13.091 --> 02:16:14.860
Like that is so silly.

2296
02:16:15.130 --> 02:16:17.580
If you think of how many fucking plan it's the right there is.

2297
02:16:17.581 --> 02:16:20.980
This guy's examined 500 of them.
They think they got it fixed.

2298
02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:24.640
You better get back to work,
bitch.
You better go do your homework cause that's,

2299
02:16:24.670 --> 02:16:29.500
that's bananas.
So silly that you can even say that.
Like the numbers again,

2300
02:16:29.530 --> 02:16:30.070
it's like

2301
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:33.550
<v 1>we talked about how 7,000 years is impossible for people to think about.</v>

2302
02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:38.560
Well that ain't shit compared to the number of stars just in this galaxy.

2303
02:16:38.561 --> 02:16:41.150
When you start getting into the,
the,
the,
the,

2304
02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:45.400
just the phrase hundreds of billions and then think about each one may have,

2305
02:16:45.401 --> 02:16:50.380
who knows how many goddamn planets.
It's not,
you can't do it.
It's too crazy.

2306
02:16:50.410 --> 02:16:52.600
It's,
it's,
it's too hard for people to,

2307
02:16:52.810 --> 02:16:55.060
so when a guy comes out and says something like that,
I'm like,

2308
02:16:55.061 --> 02:16:56.950
are you just trying to get attention?
Like what do,

2309
02:16:56.951 --> 02:16:59.110
what do you think of when you see a press release?

2310
02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:03.220
<v 4>Um,
yeah,
I do see an awful lot of,</v>

2311
02:17:03.221 --> 02:17:06.660
of kind of like headline grabbing tripe type of people who try to,

2312
02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:11.130
and specifically,
you know,
scientists has become about this scramble for money.

2313
02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:15.690
Um,
we need to be in on it and on a completely different level.
Like,
you know,

2314
02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:20.160
this was very much in evidence,
but Jesus wife controversy,
which hit like,

2315
02:17:20.161 --> 02:17:22.740
you know,
like somebody found this scrap of material,

2316
02:17:23.490 --> 02:17:27.180
which basically only could ever prove that in the third century.

2317
02:17:27.330 --> 02:17:32.330
And there were people who believed that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalen and

2318
02:17:32.611 --> 02:17:36.660
all of a sudden you have this enormous stampede of scientists saying,
no,

2319
02:17:36.661 --> 02:17:40.620
this can't be true.
This is,
I have found this,
that let me do research.
Um,

2320
02:17:40.700 --> 02:17:44.550
and they're basically kind of saying,
give me money and for the rest of you know,

2321
02:17:44.551 --> 02:17:45.270
five years,

2322
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:49.620
I will debate endlessly about this and I will create this controversy about
that.

2323
02:17:49.890 --> 02:17:51.780
And it just escalates like,
you know,

2324
02:17:51.930 --> 02:17:55.290
because it's Jesus and we know Jesus has more than controversial.

2325
02:17:55.530 --> 02:17:58.980
The likes of National Geographic actually pulled the initial documentary,

2326
02:17:59.220 --> 02:18:02.040
which wasn't done by some kind of,
you know,
crazy person.

2327
02:18:02.310 --> 02:18:07.020
It was a Harvard professor who,
who basically came up with this.
Um,

2328
02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:11.980
but it is like,
you know,
like she basically,
it's in private possession.
Uh,

2329
02:18:12.030 --> 02:18:16.770
she had made this deal with the guy that she would take all the slack.

2330
02:18:16.860 --> 02:18:20.370
She would if she had done the analysis,
this was old.
Um,

2331
02:18:20.430 --> 02:18:24.720
but she wasn't going to reveal who the owner was.
Fine.
Is that so controversial?

2332
02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:27.090
But then all of a sudden you have scientists saying,
no,

2333
02:18:27.091 --> 02:18:29.790
we need to know who the owner is.
Because if we don't know who the owner is,

2334
02:18:29.791 --> 02:18:32.520
we're going to completely,
you know,
not believe anything you're saying.

2335
02:18:32.730 --> 02:18:36.390
And it's like,
oh,
come on.
Is this,
you know,
kindergarten or as this academics,

2336
02:18:36.391 --> 02:18:37.860
and unfortunately it's kindergarten.

2337
02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:40.291
<v 1>It's a,</v>

2338
02:18:40.291 --> 02:18:44.850
it's really fascinating that at the highest levels of intelligence,

2339
02:18:44.851 --> 02:18:46.420
the highest levels of knowledge,
the,

2340
02:18:46.430 --> 02:18:50.580
the place where you're actually supposed to go to,
to get that stuff,

2341
02:18:50.581 --> 02:18:54.420
that things are withheld bait just on the basis of ego,

2342
02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:55.890
just completely on the basis.

2343
02:18:56.130 --> 02:18:59.580
There's things that are not considered because people don't want to look

2344
02:18:59.581 --> 02:19:00.390
ridiculous,

2345
02:19:00.390 --> 02:19:04.530
and there's certain subjects that you're not even allowed to study or consider

2346
02:19:04.650 --> 02:19:07.920
because they can be bad for your career.
They can ruin your career.

2347
02:19:08.010 --> 02:19:11.160
Just even study them like it must be very,

2348
02:19:11.220 --> 02:19:15.120
you have to be a very brave person to admit to having a fascination with

2349
02:19:15.121 --> 02:19:16.920
psychedelic drugs.
If you're a scientist,

2350
02:19:17.850 --> 02:19:21.450
if you're an archeologist and you suggest the possibility,

2351
02:19:21.451 --> 02:19:25.560
just the possibility that there may very well have been ancient civilizations

2352
02:19:25.561 --> 02:19:27.830
that were unaware of,
we have an on that

2353
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:31.220
<v 2>immediately throws you into a certain fringe category.
Right?</v>

2354
02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:35.730
<v 4>Oh,
I mean,
I was around John Mack Havac,
professor of psychiatry.</v>

2355
02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:40.440
He created the Psychiatry Department at Harvard University.
And in 1995,

2356
02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:43.560
he became involved with the entire Ufo abduction thing.

2357
02:19:43.561 --> 02:19:47.700
And what he was saying was he had looked at these people and these people were

2358
02:19:47.701 --> 02:19:50.020
reporting something which in his opinion,

2359
02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:54.870
which coincided with what other people were describing as when they saw,
uh,

2360
02:19:54.871 --> 02:19:58.380
you know,
uh,
a car driving through a red light and they were describing it.

2361
02:19:58.381 --> 02:20:00.900
He said,
these people are not making this up.

2362
02:20:01.110 --> 02:20:05.490
These people are describing it as if this has reality to them.

2363
02:20:05.491 --> 02:20:09.030
This is something which they relate as relevant to me.
That soul.

2364
02:20:09.031 --> 02:20:12.030
He wasn't saying it was real.
He was basically saying,

2365
02:20:12.060 --> 02:20:16.690
everybody who I've interviewed,
um,
is relating it to me in wording.
Um,

2366
02:20:16.770 --> 02:20:20.040
which suggests to me that it is something which has happened to them.

2367
02:20:20.100 --> 02:20:23.400
<v 2>He went a little further than that and his second book,
the second book,</v>

2368
02:20:23.401 --> 02:20:25.450
I read both of his books and the second book,
uh,

2369
02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:30.510
he was basically relaying the message that these aliens had told these people

2370
02:20:30.721 --> 02:20:31.710
about what we know,

2371
02:20:31.711 --> 02:20:36.120
what the consequences of human destruction and what we're doing to the planet.

2372
02:20:36.750 --> 02:20:38.640
It's,
it's all pretty fascinating stuff.

2373
02:20:38.641 --> 02:20:43.530
But what always killed me about the John Mack stuff is that everything happens

2374
02:20:43.531 --> 02:20:46.260
at night.
All these people were abducted at night.

2375
02:20:46.500 --> 02:20:51.440
We know during the nighttime the brain releases and dodginess bursts of dimethyl

2376
02:20:51.450 --> 02:20:54.990
trip to me,
which is an incredibly powerful hallucinogenic drug.

2377
02:20:55.290 --> 02:20:59.160
Like why don't we get these people who have had these alien abduction

2378
02:20:59.161 --> 02:21:03.180
experiences and introduce them to intervene is dimethyltryptamine and see if it

2379
02:21:03.181 --> 02:21:06.960
recreates the same thing.
Cause if it does,
then you know what you got going on,

2380
02:21:06.961 --> 02:21:09.780
you know that you have doesn't mean it's not a real event.

2381
02:21:10.020 --> 02:21:11.940
And exactly that's the point he was making.

2382
02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:15.300
Well we have this idea that something is only real.

2383
02:21:15.301 --> 02:21:18.330
If you could pick it up in a way at,
yeah.
You know,
if you have this and you can,

2384
02:21:18.331 --> 02:21:22.230
you can saw it and half,
well then it's real.
But there's,

2385
02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:27.260
it's very possible that there's chemical doorways that exist and there something

2386
02:21:28.171 --> 02:21:29.310
goes through them,

2387
02:21:29.340 --> 02:21:33.750
something returns or the resonance in which you interface with the universe

2388
02:21:33.751 --> 02:21:36.810
changes because of the introduction to the of these alkaloids and these

2389
02:21:36.811 --> 02:21:40.980
chemicals into,
into the mind.
Like the resonance of the universe changes.

2390
02:21:40.981 --> 02:21:44.820
You tune into something that doesn't exist or it doesn't exist without it.

2391
02:21:45.570 --> 02:21:50.570
And that that's something that in until we consider that possibility,

2392
02:21:51.451 --> 02:21:55.260
it's till we really wrap our heads around what exactly is going on there.

2393
02:21:55.410 --> 02:21:58.410
We're ignoring in a pretty profound experience.

2394
02:21:58.590 --> 02:22:02.220
We're not even using it as a part of the equation.

2395
02:22:02.221 --> 02:22:07.221
We're not even throwing one of the most profound and life altering things that

2396
02:22:08.431 --> 02:22:11.940
can happen to a person,
a psychedelic experience,
a real truly profound.

2397
02:22:12.210 --> 02:22:14.640
And we're not even introducing it into the conversation.

2398
02:22:14.820 --> 02:22:17.150
We're pretending it doesn't exist because we don't want to look.

2399
02:22:17.450 --> 02:22:21.170
<v 4>It's a hallucination and something which your mind makes up and therefore we can</v>

2400
02:22:21.171 --> 02:22:25.770
ridicule live.
And the way it,
it's,
it's an important and you know,
kind of like,

2401
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:30.270
and there are people absolutely out there who are absolutely convinced it's not

2402
02:22:30.271 --> 02:22:31.104
real.
Sure.

2403
02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:33.310
<v 1>Well again,
you know,
Richard Dawkins,</v>

2404
02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:37.570
Dawkins has had no psychedelic experiences and talked about how you maybe you

2405
02:22:37.571 --> 02:22:39.960
would consider doing LSD in a clinical setting.
Like,
oh you're,

2406
02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:43.180
this is like talking to a child.
Like you're scared and you need to,

2407
02:22:43.181 --> 02:22:45.410
you don't need to go do mushrooms,
fish.
You need a,

2408
02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:50.600
if Richard Dawkins went and did an Iowasca ceremony or Richard Dawkins went and

2409
02:22:51.810 --> 02:22:52.900
smoked DMT,

2410
02:22:53.140 --> 02:22:57.280
he would come back with a completely different view on this whole fucking thing.

2411
02:22:57.610 --> 02:23:00.070
A brilliant mind and incredible academic.

2412
02:23:00.090 --> 02:23:04.260
A guy who is just so good at Boston through the bullshit of religion that,

2413
02:23:04.270 --> 02:23:04.540
you know,

2414
02:23:04.540 --> 02:23:08.830
especially in the waning years of his existence on this plane and that he was,

2415
02:23:08.831 --> 02:23:10.900
he's really cheating as consciousness of not,

2416
02:23:11.290 --> 02:23:15.340
not just crossing over at least once,
just to say,

2417
02:23:15.700 --> 02:23:19.870
wow,
that's available.
How did I not know that was available?

2418
02:23:20.330 --> 02:23:23.270
<v 4>But also like the,
the,
the,
the attitude of like,
you know,</v>

2419
02:23:23.271 --> 02:23:27.770
like I don't need to do this.
So silly.
I know it's,
it's like,
you know,

2420
02:23:27.771 --> 02:23:30.710
I know it doesn't exist so I don't need to do,
it's like,
okay,

2421
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:32.990
just to say you haven't done it.
That's fine.

2422
02:23:33.130 --> 02:23:36.460
<v 1>Yeah.
Well they have to justify it because then people will bring it up.</v>

2423
02:23:36.461 --> 02:23:39.880
But it's like,
you know,
someone who's never seen combat before and he'd say,
well,

2424
02:23:39.881 --> 02:23:42.550
you don't know about war unless you seen combat.
Well,
I don't need,

2425
02:23:42.580 --> 02:23:45.700
I don't need to see it.
I know what's going on.
The fuck you do.

2426
02:23:45.730 --> 02:23:47.220
How could you possibly understand what,

2427
02:23:47.230 --> 02:23:50.680
what happens to a person in the grips of war if you haven't been there?

2428
02:23:50.681 --> 02:23:54.040
It's pure speculation.
You don't know.
You know,
there's,
there's many,

2429
02:23:54.041 --> 02:23:55.660
many things in this life that are like that.

2430
02:23:55.661 --> 02:24:00.460
I think very few are as profound as the psychedelic experience as far as the how

2431
02:24:00.461 --> 02:24:04.000
alien it is too.
Normal everyday consciousness.

2432
02:24:04.570 --> 02:24:09.570
And I think that has to be considered when you stop and think about the idea of

2433
02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:15.790
alien,
Inter interjection,

2434
02:24:16.090 --> 02:24:18.940
alien altering of our world.

2435
02:24:19.210 --> 02:24:23.770
The idea of the psychedelic experience being a gateway to some other form of

2436
02:24:23.771 --> 02:24:28.180
consciousness or some other form of intelligence that has to be considered the

2437
02:24:28.181 --> 02:24:29.290
eye,
the eye.

2438
02:24:29.350 --> 02:24:32.830
Let me tell you something that happened to me after one of my first DMT

2439
02:24:32.831 --> 02:24:36.940
experiences,
I stopped caring about Ufo was completely stopped caring

2440
02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:39.440
<v 4>as a Terence Mckenna.
I remember him and I need a five.</v>

2441
02:24:39.820 --> 02:24:41.570
Well that Ufo conference then kind of like,

2442
02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.180
it's went down the line and you had both Hopkins,

2443
02:24:44.181 --> 02:24:48.230
they're in shock filet and they were like physically first and then it came to

2444
02:24:48.231 --> 02:24:51.800
him and said like,
I can tell you,
I mean I can't do his accent.

2445
02:24:51.801 --> 02:24:52.730
It was very specific.

2446
02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:56.730
Like I can tell you like you know I have spoken to these people

2447
02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:02.720
<v 1>don't have to like go around like wondering whether or not you foes are possible</v>

2448
02:25:02.791 --> 02:25:06.230
because something is possible.
That's a billion times crazy than that.

2449
02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:10.290
The way I was described,
Dmt as mushrooms times a million plus aliens,

2450
02:25:10.710 --> 02:25:14.910
like really is like that.
So for someone to,
you know,

2451
02:25:14.911 --> 02:25:18.870
to interest me,
it was some flying space disk.
I'd be like,

2452
02:25:18.871 --> 02:25:23.160
why don't they just come down here and talk like the DMT guys do?
Cause the DMT

2453
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:27.910
<v 2>brings you into a completely different dimension.
I,</v>

2454
02:25:28.190 --> 02:25:31.940
I just completely got bored with the idea of flying saucers,
you know,
like,

2455
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:35.590
oh look,
it's a little light.
It's spinning around in a circle.
Really?

2456
02:25:35.770 --> 02:25:39.820
Is that what that is?
You know,
who knows what the fuck that is?
Who Cares?

2457
02:25:39.821 --> 02:25:40.720
I don't even do anything.

2458
02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:44.770
If there's aliens and they come here and they just fucking spin around the sky

2459
02:25:44.771 --> 02:25:47.860
and then go home,
you know,
it could be like,
this could be like earth.

2460
02:25:47.861 --> 02:25:50.020
It's like the high school parking lot.

2461
02:25:50.170 --> 02:25:52.810
Like remember when your kids and there's dudes who already graduated and they

2462
02:25:52.811 --> 02:25:56.710
come back and do donuts in the parking lot.
Did you,
uh,
did you,
you didn't,

2463
02:25:56.711 --> 02:25:58.960
you got an English accent,
right?
What does it,
was it Australian?

2464
02:25:58.961 --> 02:25:59.670
What is your accent?

2465
02:25:59.670 --> 02:26:03.360
<v 4>Uh,
I'm originally from Belgium and I speak three languages and assigned like a</v>

2466
02:26:03.361 --> 02:26:04.500
Florida and all of them.
So

2467
02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:05.770
<v 2>Ah,
that's what it is.</v>

2468
02:26:06.060 --> 02:26:07.980
<v 4>Then England for about 10 years,</v>

2469
02:26:07.981 --> 02:26:12.530
worked in England for about 10 years and I've been partly European,
partly in,
uh,

2470
02:26:12.570 --> 02:26:15.000
Los Angeles for the last four years.

2471
02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:17.110
<v 2>When a,
in American high schools,</v>

2472
02:26:17.111 --> 02:26:20.500
there's this phenomenon ward that's leaving the nest thing or a lot of guys that

2473
02:26:20.501 --> 02:26:22.160
graduated but they still come back to hang out.

2474
02:26:22.161 --> 02:26:25.420
They've thought of as losers and they usually have cool cars cause now their

2475
02:26:25.421 --> 02:26:28.450
work so that come back and they would do like donuts in the parking lot.

2476
02:26:28.810 --> 02:26:31.840
So maybe that's where the aliens are doing.
They're just coming back to show off.

2477
02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:35.980
Yeah.
They're only the douchebag.
Aliens come back.
Um,

2478
02:26:36.010 --> 02:26:37.740
do you buy into Annie?

2479
02:26:37.790 --> 02:26:41.440
But that's why there is a conspiracy because we were covering does up.
Exactly.

2480
02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:46.780
Do you buy into any of the like stuff when uh,
you know,

2481
02:26:46.781 --> 02:26:47.271
you,
you,

2482
02:26:47.271 --> 02:26:52.271
you hear about Ufo is interfering with like launch commands and missiles and the

2483
02:26:52.751 --> 02:26:56.560
UFOS,
like cutting power over military bases.

2484
02:26:56.830 --> 02:26:59.860
Do you buy into any of that stuff?
Have you ever seen anything that's compelling?

2485
02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:00.311
<v 4>Well,</v>

2486
02:27:00.311 --> 02:27:03.460
I know that somebody has written a book about it and I read the book and you

2487
02:27:03.461 --> 02:27:07.930
know,
when you take ufs as an unidentified flying objects,
um,

2488
02:27:08.110 --> 02:27:12.910
Dan,
it is possible because it doesn't mean it's not earthly.
Yeah,
exactly.

2489
02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:16.970
Um,
and if I was a human power,
um,

2490
02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:19.630
I would be interested in,
in an atomic missiles,

2491
02:27:19.631 --> 02:27:24.220
I think more so than if I was an alien power.
I mean,
you know,
of course,

2492
02:27:24.221 --> 02:27:29.140
if I was nailing okay,
I mean,
making a science,
science fiction scenarios here,

2493
02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:33.070
either they say,
okay,
they can blow them to smithereens,
let's do it's,
um,
or,
well,

2494
02:27:33.071 --> 02:27:36.920
we have this thing whereby we can pick up this nuclear device anyway in mid

2495
02:27:36.921 --> 02:27:40.240
flight and then take it out of there.
But when,

2496
02:27:40.270 --> 02:27:44.340
when people tell me weird things happened on a military facility,
um,

2497
02:27:44.410 --> 02:27:48.850
involving top secret things and there's a Ufo side it then,

2498
02:27:48.851 --> 02:27:52.950
to me that Ufo is probably of terrestrial origins.
Um,

2499
02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:57.910
and there's probably a very good reason why,
um,
whoever power it is,

2500
02:27:57.911 --> 02:27:59.860
you know,
we would probably blame the Russians first,

2501
02:27:59.861 --> 02:28:03.070
but it doesn't necessarily have to be them.
Um,
you know,

2502
02:28:03.071 --> 02:28:06.040
kind of like there's a good reason why they are going to keep this secret and

2503
02:28:06.041 --> 02:28:08.980
they probably want to pretend.
And I think to a large extent,

2504
02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:13.390
the American government has an active promotion of hey,

2505
02:28:13.510 --> 02:28:15.360
we are covering up certain things.
Yeah.

2506
02:28:15.610 --> 02:28:19.960
<v 2>Well that whole area 51 thing put a lot of questions into people's minds because</v>

2507
02:28:19.961 --> 02:28:22.520
they denied its existence.
What year was it?

2508
02:28:22.521 --> 02:28:25.130
[inaudible] 94 or something like that where they want to expand its boundaries.

2509
02:28:25.210 --> 02:28:27.100
<v 4>Yeah.
And then an independent state like,
you know,</v>

2510
02:28:27.101 --> 02:28:30.550
like they make a big thing about area 51 and then at the end you see like with

2511
02:28:30.551 --> 02:28:34.090
the active participation and help of the departments of,
of,
of the fence.

2512
02:28:34.091 --> 02:28:37.110
And you kind of think like any are telling me they didn't read the script.

2513
02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:37.860
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2514
02:28:37.860 --> 02:28:41.310
You're telling me that they're okay with pretending there's a fucking flying

2515
02:28:41.311 --> 02:28:44.370
saucer tucked away back there.
Yeah.
What do you believe?

2516
02:28:44.371 --> 02:28:46.800
What do you think about Robert Lasar?
Do you know his story?

2517
02:28:47.330 --> 02:28:50.750
<v 4>Yeah,
I mean,
you know,
I,
again,
I,</v>

2518
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:55.250
I think he might have seen something which people told him was alien.

2519
02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:59.570
Um,
and I think that's a form of protection.
Like,
you know,

2520
02:28:59.630 --> 02:29:03.110
if I tell you here is the light,
you know,
it's,
it's alien technology.

2521
02:29:03.470 --> 02:29:07.700
You're not going to say,
Oh Phillips,
oh,
that must be a cover up thing.

2522
02:29:07.701 --> 02:29:11.690
Kind of like,
you know,
um,
people that they're,

2523
02:29:11.710 --> 02:29:15.410
they're known instances.
And I think it was bill Moore who found some,

2524
02:29:15.411 --> 02:29:19.250
some stuff there in 1953 or 52.
Um,

2525
02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:21.590
all of a sudden in America was okay.
Again,

2526
02:29:21.591 --> 02:29:25.460
I think we'd Hungary and there was a very important relic across,

2527
02:29:25.461 --> 02:29:29.080
off seen Steven or something like that,
which was somewhere,
uh,

2528
02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:31.490
displaced after the second world war.

2529
02:29:31.491 --> 02:29:33.410
And the American government was going to give it back.

2530
02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:38.270
But it was so secretive that nobody knew on this flight.
Um,
what it was.

2531
02:29:38.930 --> 02:29:43.460
And the official cargo of what was being transported was described as a Ufo,

2532
02:29:44.020 --> 02:29:47.510
uh,
basically crashed saucer,
which was being transported.

2533
02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:51.560
They didn't want the people on board to know what it was.

2534
02:29:51.561 --> 02:29:56.360
They said it was a crush source or it wasn't.
It was a relic of,
of,
of,

2535
02:29:56.361 --> 02:30:00.530
you know,
some st which was being transported back to Hungary.
So,

2536
02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:03.650
<v 2>so they're just freaked people out just to put a stupid story out there for</v>

2537
02:30:03.651 --> 02:30:04.310
[inaudible].

2538
02:30:04.310 --> 02:30:05.420
<v 4>Yeah.
And you know,</v>

2539
02:30:05.421 --> 02:30:08.270
if you can then convince the soldiers that there's a big cover up,

2540
02:30:08.271 --> 02:30:12.920
you're going to probably die if you say that you,
you,
you,
you,
you,
you have,

2541
02:30:12.940 --> 02:30:15.530
when you're going to speak out about crashed,
crashed saucers,

2542
02:30:15.710 --> 02:30:18.080
the ramp guys are going to be kept quiet.

2543
02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:19.670
<v 2>Yeah.
The Robert was our store.
I'm sorry,</v>

2544
02:30:19.700 --> 02:30:23.090
the Robert Lasar story was so compelling because he's so fucking intelligent,

2545
02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:24.081
you know,
and what,

2546
02:30:24.081 --> 02:30:27.710
he doesn't sound like a liar when he starts talking about the base and stark

2547
02:30:27.711 --> 02:30:31.460
about back at reverse engineering the aircraft and you know,

2548
02:30:31.461 --> 02:30:34.250
and how they would take them out for test flights or they couldn't exactly

2549
02:30:34.251 --> 02:30:36.680
figure out how to work them.
That's fascinating shit.

2550
02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:39.440
So it is possible that it was Russian or something.

2551
02:30:39.500 --> 02:30:41.790
And then that Robert Lasar was told that it was a,

2552
02:30:41.930 --> 02:30:43.940
an alien just because they wouldn't,

2553
02:30:43.950 --> 02:30:46.700
didn't want to admit that the Russians had figured out some fucking incredible

2554
02:30:46.701 --> 02:30:47.534
shit that we hadn't.

2555
02:30:48.030 --> 02:30:50.360
<v 4>I mean,
you know,
and I agree with you on with our,</v>

2556
02:30:50.370 --> 02:30:53.730
I don't think he made this all up.
Um,
he was told something.

2557
02:30:54.030 --> 02:30:56.370
The government might have told them the truth,

2558
02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:59.370
but I think on balance the government told him a lie.

2559
02:30:59.900 --> 02:31:04.860
<v 2>Hmm.
Look at that Robert Lewis.
Are you just got debunked by Philip Copans?</v>

2560
02:31:05.430 --> 02:31:08.670
<v 4>Well,
I actually think I support him because most people just say he's a liar.</v>

2561
02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:12.170
<v 2>Yeah,
that is,
that's true.
You are supporting them in some sort of a way.
You're,</v>

2562
02:31:12.171 --> 02:31:14.570
you're just letting him,
giving him a,

2563
02:31:14.571 --> 02:31:18.140
an out like you didn't know that is possible.
Yeah.

2564
02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:20.430
I'm seems like Stealth bombers and stuff that,

2565
02:31:20.431 --> 02:31:23.590
that we know the government did design that actually looked like aliens and Luke

2566
02:31:23.591 --> 02:31:24.660
are you some Ufo?

2567
02:31:25.230 --> 02:31:27.590
<v 4>And as you pointed out,
he's an intelligent guy.
You know,
he,</v>

2568
02:31:27.620 --> 02:31:28.860
he came to these conclusions,

2569
02:31:28.861 --> 02:31:33.720
he felt that this was alien and I'm more than willing to give him the benefit of

2570
02:31:33.721 --> 02:31:35.580
the doubt.
I'm just saying on balance,

2571
02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:39.780
our government lies when it tells you this is something alien.
They,

2572
02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:44.250
when they tell you that here's the point,
if it's alien,

2573
02:31:44.280 --> 02:31:46.980
they would probably tell the guys involved at it was terrestrial.

2574
02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:49.940
<v 2>That's a very good point.
That's a very good point.</v>

2575
02:31:49.941 --> 02:31:53.600
Why would they tell this for I'd motherfucker from the middle of nowhere.

2576
02:31:53.720 --> 02:31:56.900
Albuquerque,
New Mexico,
wherever he's from.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We got an alien.

2577
02:31:57.650 --> 02:32:00.020
I wonder if they did tell him.
I don't think a story is actually they told them.

2578
02:32:00.021 --> 02:32:02.090
I think it's story was that they didn't explain it at all.

2579
02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:04.520
They just told him to back engineer it and he did.

2580
02:32:04.610 --> 02:32:09.170
He did deuced with his own intelligence that it was,
uh,

2581
02:32:09.530 --> 02:32:13.580
an alien craft.
But yeah,
who knows what the fuck they're making out there,
right?

2582
02:32:13.581 --> 02:32:16.490
I mean they have this gigantic facility out there,
or at least they did.

2583
02:32:16.730 --> 02:32:20.000
I think they've moved things now because so many people are aware of it.

2584
02:32:20.001 --> 02:32:22.760
And because of a Google earth,
I believe they,

2585
02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:25.400
they believe they've moved stuff to Utah now.

2586
02:32:25.820 --> 02:32:28.520
That's the new place where they test out crazy shit.

2587
02:32:28.890 --> 02:32:32.790
<v 4>Well,
I mean again,
I was talking about that was the whole documentary.
And um,</v>

2588
02:32:32.820 --> 02:32:35.220
there's some very interesting things.
How,

2589
02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:38.580
and actually skeptics in this case are great.
I mean,

2590
02:32:38.581 --> 02:32:41.160
there's some great skeptics in the sense that they stick with it.

2591
02:32:41.161 --> 02:32:44.250
They've done research for 20 years and that's great.
You know,

2592
02:32:44.590 --> 02:32:48.870
w the skeptics I hate are these 24 hit and run guys day.
They see something,

2593
02:32:48.871 --> 02:32:51.750
they write something,
they've seen it on Google,
but like,
you know,
like the,

2594
02:32:51.751 --> 02:32:55.500
like the likes of called flock when it comes to,
um,
Roswell,

2595
02:32:55.560 --> 02:32:59.490
he's got great material in there.
Um,
it can be interpreted in two ways,

2596
02:32:59.491 --> 02:33:04.140
but he's got great material and some of the stuff which he's also kind of like,

2597
02:33:04.170 --> 02:33:08.630
you know,
confirmed is that you had this tiny cabal of like Jesse Marcel,

2598
02:33:08.631 --> 02:33:11.430
the base commander,
which was called,
um,
blonde shard.

2599
02:33:12.120 --> 02:33:15.630
They somehow knew the likes of a Barry Goldwater.

2600
02:33:15.630 --> 02:33:20.510
And when Goldwater starts talking about,
hey,
can I see what's in hanger,

2601
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:24.540
you know,
18 at at Wright Patterson,
it's a big scam.

2602
02:33:24.541 --> 02:33:28.950
It's a scam of these guys who are absolutely convinced that there is alien

2603
02:33:28.951 --> 02:33:30.550
material being covered up in,

2604
02:33:30.551 --> 02:33:34.290
in Wright Patterson who were trying to get it on the record.
Um,

2605
02:33:34.291 --> 02:33:36.010
and who are trying to push the,

2606
02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:40.620
the government basically into Kinda like coming up with an answer and the answer

2607
02:33:40.621 --> 02:33:43.980
is like fuck off,
you know,
you're not allowed to say this.
Um,
you know,

2608
02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:47.910
like Goldwater was basically told he wasn't allowed to to ask such questions.

2609
02:33:47.911 --> 02:33:51.090
The government was never going to say anything of the kind hanger 18 didn't

2610
02:33:51.091 --> 02:33:54.270
exist and it's like,
okay that's interesting.

2611
02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:58.590
These people were working behind the scenes and like the base commander spoke to

2612
02:33:59.070 --> 02:34:03.420
gold was trying to push something out there.
Um,
and again,

2613
02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:07.240
it's not as such evidence of the fact that something extra terrestrial landed
in,

2614
02:34:07.241 --> 02:34:09.420
in,
in Roswell,
but that there are,

2615
02:34:09.570 --> 02:34:12.990
that there were more things happening behind the scenes then quite often

2616
02:34:12.991 --> 02:34:14.080
[inaudible] are being credited.

2617
02:34:14.430 --> 02:34:18.130
<v 2>There's a clear evidence of conspiracy at Roswell and one of the big pieces</v>

2618
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:21.700
<v 1>of evidence is the fact that they flew the records out to Wright Patterson air</v>

2619
02:34:21.701 --> 02:34:24.970
force base in two separate plans cause they were worried if one of them crashed.

2620
02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:28.840
Yeah.
They wanted to make sure that they,
they could not lose this.

2621
02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:33.340
Amanda separated this stuff.
Yeah.
And they said it's really light material.

2622
02:34:33.341 --> 02:34:35.500
So it wasn't done for weight considerations.
Nope.

2623
02:34:35.610 --> 02:34:38.710
Because they claimed that it was material from a weather balloon,

2624
02:34:38.711 --> 02:34:41.440
which is nothing.
They can throw that in the back of a plane.
No problem.
Yep.

2625
02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:45.020
<v 4>And I mean,
Kinda like it,
hanging out with it.
Chassis,
Marcellin,</v>

2626
02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:47.020
having him talk about his,
his grandfather,

2627
02:34:47.021 --> 02:34:50.890
his grandfather was the chief of intelligence for Roswell.

2628
02:34:51.310 --> 02:34:55.810
Roswell air force base at that moment in time was the only add field in the

2629
02:34:55.811 --> 02:34:58.150
world where there was constantly,

2630
02:34:58.460 --> 02:35:00.820
I'm an atomic bomb being sent in the sky.

2631
02:35:01.210 --> 02:35:06.210
America wanted to have an atomic presence in the sky as result of that be 52 or

2632
02:35:06.551 --> 02:35:11.110
whatever kind of machinery.
Um,
went and landed at Roswell constantly.

2633
02:35:11.111 --> 02:35:15.160
There was always one in the sky.
He knew that he had briefed,
um,

2634
02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:20.140
people on,
um,
on,
um,
atomic missions of,
of like dropping nuclear bombs.

2635
02:35:20.450 --> 02:35:25.330
Uh,
at one point he was one of five people in the world who knew where a certain

2636
02:35:25.331 --> 02:35:29.200
bomb was going to be dropped.
He was declared a national hero.
He was,
you know,

2637
02:35:29.350 --> 02:35:34.300
when he went into a fort worth and was going to make that announcement,

2638
02:35:34.301 --> 02:35:38.800
he was absolutely convinced that he was going to tell the world about the

2639
02:35:38.801 --> 02:35:43.600
existence of extraterrestrial beings.
And when you see,
um,
this,

2640
02:35:43.630 --> 02:35:45.700
this,
this story through his family,

2641
02:35:45.701 --> 02:35:49.450
you see that afterwards he apparently trampled on his,
uh,
metals.

2642
02:35:49.451 --> 02:35:53.440
He hated what the American government had him do.
He,

2643
02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:58.360
he basically killed thousands of people by sentencing them to death by briefing.

2644
02:35:58.361 --> 02:36:01.810
This officer were to drop an atomic bomb.
And at the same level,

2645
02:36:01.811 --> 02:36:05.800
he was absolutely convinced that what happened in Roswell was extraterrestrial

2646
02:36:06.220 --> 02:36:11.220
and that he somehow had to say on air live that he was an idiot.

2647
02:36:11.970 --> 02:36:16.240
Um,
and he,
he hated what the American government made him do.
He trampled on it.

2648
02:36:16.241 --> 02:36:17.470
He got out of,
uh,

2649
02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:22.300
the government and basically began to repair televisions and radios to occupy

2650
02:36:22.301 --> 02:36:25.990
his mind and,
and,
and do something else.
He,
you know,

2651
02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:27.880
but in 1947,

2652
02:36:27.881 --> 02:36:31.660
he was a guy at the top briefed kind of level.

2653
02:36:31.810 --> 02:36:35.870
Whatever he saw shook his mind.
It wasn't wherever Luna,

2654
02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:38.730
<v 1>it's a fascinating thing to me that at all curd,</v>

2655
02:36:38.770 --> 02:36:43.670
the majority of these a Ufo and even the coining the term flying saucer,

2656
02:36:43.671 --> 02:36:47.330
it all occurred once we started fucking around with nuclear power when we

2657
02:36:47.331 --> 02:36:49.310
started fucking around with nuclear bombs.

2658
02:36:49.340 --> 02:36:52.400
That's when they seem to start arriving.
That is a,

2659
02:36:52.401 --> 02:36:57.401
that is really fascinating to me and if it really did exist and it was just some

2660
02:36:57.591 --> 02:37:00.320
sort of an isolated incidence where they came down and said,
all right,

2661
02:37:00.321 --> 02:37:04.100
let listen you crazy pink monkeys.
You,
you can't do that.

2662
02:37:04.130 --> 02:37:06.770
You can't just go fucking blowing things up with new girl.

2663
02:37:06.830 --> 02:37:09.950
You're going to ruin your whole planet.
All right.
Stop Man.

2664
02:37:09.951 --> 02:37:11.180
That would be interesting to know.

2665
02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:15.460
<v 4>Well,
and I mean,
you know,
again,
complete speculation yeah.
Of,
yeah.</v>

2666
02:37:15.630 --> 02:37:20.150
Our ancestors always say that the goats were there to help us get to somehow

2667
02:37:20.420 --> 02:37:22.700
these helpers,
these,
these kind of like,
hey,

2668
02:37:22.701 --> 02:37:26.210
we're trying to do it all by ourselves,
but if we run into trouble,
um,

2669
02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:29.450
all of a sudden they're kind of go like,
okay,
well have you looked at this,

2670
02:37:29.451 --> 02:37:30.080
this problem?

2671
02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:33.230
It's like a parent looking at his child and kind of like knowing that four plus

2672
02:37:33.231 --> 02:37:36.290
four equals eight,
but after a while you're kind of going like,
okay,

2673
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:40.760
count them on your hands and like,
you know,
you get to eight like that.
Um,

2674
02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:43.880
and if this is the case,
if um,

2675
02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:49.240
then if we can somehow self destruct completely more than likely to idiocy or

2676
02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:55.220
computer failure of pushing,
you know,
whatever buttons,
um,

2677
02:37:55.340 --> 02:37:58.100
then you might actually say,
okay,
they,
they would step in there,

2678
02:37:58.101 --> 02:37:59.930
they would stop this from happening.

2679
02:38:00.010 --> 02:38:03.130
<v 2>That's a constant theme with people.
Right.
Somehow or another,</v>

2680
02:38:03.131 --> 02:38:06.550
the alien overlords are going to step in and stop us at the brink of disaster.

2681
02:38:06.640 --> 02:38:10.240
<v 4>Yeah.
And you know,
there is no evidence for it whatsoever.
Um,</v>

2682
02:38:10.270 --> 02:38:14.410
but there is logic to it.
If,
if,
if we do,
we are monitored.

2683
02:38:14.530 --> 02:38:16.180
If we,
if we have,

2684
02:38:16.210 --> 02:38:20.500
if we are the children and there is an alien intelligence who slightly brighter

2685
02:38:20.501 --> 02:38:24.340
Dennis,
who means,
well then they're going to look out for us.
It's like,

2686
02:38:24.350 --> 02:38:28.230
<v 2>so how do you explain Worldstar hip hop.com?
Well,</v>

2687
02:38:28.390 --> 02:38:29.450
how are they laying their hands on?

2688
02:38:29.451 --> 02:38:33.290
Probably innocent in the larger scheme of things in the larger scheme of things.

2689
02:38:33.291 --> 02:38:37.880
In the great scheme of genetics moving forward to our ultimate destiny of being.

2690
02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:43.100
You just have chocolate fever.
Could Be Philip Copans listen man,
this book,

2691
02:38:43.101 --> 02:38:44.480
I can't wait to read it.
Uh,

2692
02:38:44.481 --> 02:38:47.690
I just got it today or otherwise I would have already read it because this is

2693
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:52.460
one of my all time favorite subjects and uh,
this is fucking awesome podcast.

2694
02:38:52.461 --> 02:38:56.550
Thank you very much and thank you for having me.
That people want to,
uh,
if the,

2695
02:38:56.551 --> 02:38:59.180
the book is called the lost civilization enigma,

2696
02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:01.340
I'm sure it's available@amazon.com.

2697
02:39:01.370 --> 02:39:05.360
It's available everywhere where books are sold and a z or an ebook version of
it.

2698
02:39:05.361 --> 02:39:07.490
Cause I just got one of those Barnes and noble nooks.

2699
02:39:07.570 --> 02:39:08.830
<v 4>There is an ebook version.</v>

2700
02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:12.400
There's even an audio book version for people who don't want to read but listen

2701
02:39:12.530 --> 02:39:17.060
<v 2>and they can hear your sultry voice.
They calms him myself,
not you.
Who reads it?</v>

2702
02:39:17.300 --> 02:39:20.750
An actual mother fucker.
That's bullshit,
dude.

2703
02:39:20.900 --> 02:39:24.590
Why don't you release your own and just fucking put it out as a torrent and ruin

2704
02:39:24.591 --> 02:39:29.210
the market.
Easter egg version of you.
Yeah.
How can,
how can you got a great voice,

2705
02:39:29.211 --> 02:39:30.320
man?
Why didn't they let you do it?

2706
02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:34.340
I know it's the way these things were publishing companies,
it's their idea.

2707
02:39:34.490 --> 02:39:38.300
Some Conti stupid ass actor St a bunch of Shitty doesn't even know what he's

2708
02:39:38.301 --> 02:39:42.650
talking about.
God damage as reading your work.
They wouldn't let you do it.
Nope.

2709
02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:44.300
We need to talk to those people.

2710
02:39:44.390 --> 02:39:46.340
What is the public and don't you don't want to get in trouble.

2711

2713
02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:53.360

And I know Callan's in town too,

2774
