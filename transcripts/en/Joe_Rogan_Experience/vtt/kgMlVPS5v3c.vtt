<v Speaker 1>Good experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.740
<v Speaker 1>the guy who has the accordion,</v>

4
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.580
<v Speaker 1>the monkey dance,</v>

5
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.440
<v Speaker 1>monkey dance isn't.</v>

6
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I love the sound of the accordion and I just,</v>

7
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I saw it and I just wanted to bring something to the new studio and like how you</v>

9
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of weird shit here.</v>

10
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.670
<v Speaker 1>And this is weird that somebody loved this sound so much that they decided let's</v>

11
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>make an instrument out of it.</v>

12
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Do people play them in orchestras and shit?</v>

17
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.041
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

18
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they ever made it into the orchestra.</v>

19
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's never been like a really respected piece of musical instrument design.</v>

149
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even doing the show back then and I was doing that in 2003,</v>

150
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>so I think it's 2002.</v>

151
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.990
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

152
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.940
<v Speaker 3>the fear factor bit is one of my favorite.</v>

153
00:04:11.941 --> 00:04:12.661
<v Speaker 3>That's a season two,</v>

154
00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:13.250
<v Speaker 3>if I recall.</v>

155
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.591
<v Speaker 3>Think so.</v>

156
00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:13.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

157
00:04:13.891 --> 00:04:14.390
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

158
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

159
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.550
<v Speaker 3>is really one of the areas,</v>

160
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.830
<v Speaker 3>one of the funniest bits in a show that is,</v>

161
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.850
<v Speaker 3>I would argue</v>

162
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the greatest television show of all time.</v>

163
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the greatest sketch comedy show of all time.</v>

164
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.123
<v Speaker 1>Something bigger.</v>

165
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say that though,</v>

166
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>because if you boil down a lot of the all time great shows,</v>

167
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 1>like in living color or some of the other ones.</v>

168
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

169
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.480
<v Speaker 1>they had so many seasons.</v>

170
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 1>If you boiled them down to two seasons,</v>

171
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.290
<v Speaker 1>maybe there would be some.</v>

172
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.400
<v Speaker 1>But he's got some sketches that worst just groundbreaking,</v>

173
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 1>like the black white supremacist who was blind.</v>

174
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:49.354
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

175
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.781
<v Speaker 3>What about,</v>

176
00:04:50.781 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 3>I was watching last night because jeff and I were talking about last night on</v>

177
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.660
<v Speaker 3>the car ride home from this event we did together.</v>

178
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.040
<v Speaker 3>I was watching black Bush,</v>

179
00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.173
<v Speaker 3>which was another,</v>

180
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.860
<v Speaker 3>I think unbelievably,</v>

181
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.910
<v Speaker 3>which released season two where he plays George w dot Bush,</v>

182
00:05:04.911 --> 00:05:09.911
<v Speaker 3>his version of Georgia and all the rationales for going into the war in Iraq and</v>

183
00:05:09.981 --> 00:05:11.520
<v Speaker 3>it's unbelievably funny.</v>

184
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

185
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 1>he's a genius.</v>

186
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>He's a real comedy genius,</v>

187
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 1>but also a guy who's.</v>

188
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

189
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't get it if you just sort of see him do standup,</v>

190
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>but he's deeply introspective,</v>

191
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 1>like very intensely.</v>

192
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Well thought out,</v>

193
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 1>he's not,</v>

195
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>he's not a surface guy by any stretch of the imagination.</v>

196
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.403
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

197
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.600
<v Speaker 4>But it ended up being just this amazing finish.</v>

198
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.973
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

199
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.830
<v Speaker 4>when I tell Ari I want to go to this,</v>

200
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of thinking that's the Ballpark,</v>

201
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.570
<v Speaker 4>like because that's the only experience I have.</v>

202
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.040
<v Speaker 4>So the games in Atlanta,</v>

203
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.010
<v Speaker 4>he buys tickets and I'm like,</v>

204
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.400
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

205
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.270
<v Speaker 4>you're not flying me coach,</v>

206
00:05:50.271 --> 00:05:50.631
<v Speaker 4>you know that.</v>

207
00:05:50.631 --> 00:05:50.901
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

208
00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

209
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.580
<v Speaker 4>you go first bird rookies coach.</v>

210
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.953
<v Speaker 4>He was</v>

211
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.820
<v Speaker 4>coach,</v>

212
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 4>I'll them a seat belt extension.</v>

213
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 4>Oh cool.</v>

214
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.590
<v Speaker 4>But Brian ended up going from somewhere else.</v>

215
00:06:01.591 --> 00:06:01.971
<v Speaker 4>So anyways,</v>

216
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:02.804
<v Speaker 4>he bought the ticket.</v>

217
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 4>He got an Airbnb,</v>

218
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 4>a really nice house,</v>

219
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

220
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 4>for a few days in Atlanta and then it's a,</v>

221
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

222
00:06:10.711 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 4>it's the big thing that is game day.</v>

223
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking like,</v>

224
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 4>oh that's cool that you got these tickets and you got,</v>

225
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

226
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's reasonable and then we get to the stadium.</v>

227
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 4>It was a total fucking disaster to get in because trump went to the game,</v>

228
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 4>so it was raining,</v>

229
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.830
<v Speaker 4>it was wet secret service everywhere to our lines to get into the venue and I</v>

230
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:31.461
<v Speaker 4>paid a guy,</v>

231
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 4>a security guy 100 bucks to walk us through the line,</v>

232
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:36.284
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

233
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 4>which was almost impossible because it was so packed.</v>

234
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.300
<v Speaker 4>But I dunno,</v>

235
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 4>he just started walking us through the line,</v>

236
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.951
<v Speaker 4>like in front of people.</v>

237
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 4>People were yelling at the security guy,</v>

238
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 4>which was like so uncomfortable.</v>

239
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:51.020
<v Speaker 4>He's like a young black kid and like old white people,</v>

240
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 4>where the fuck are you doing?</v>

241
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.761
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

242
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:53.421
<v Speaker 4>I'm security.</v>

243
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

244
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 4>you're not just security you piece of shit like right to is right in front of</v>

245
00:06:57.411 --> 00:06:57.561
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

246
00:06:57.561 --> 00:06:57.981
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

247
00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:58.814
<v Speaker 4>God damn,</v>

248
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 4>like I just have never seen someone flip out like that.</v>

249
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 4>What we were doing was highly unethical.</v>

250
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:04.514
<v Speaker 4>We shouldn't have done it.</v>

251
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.740
<v Speaker 4>But like we just weren't going to wait in that line.</v>

252
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 4>And then burt,</v>

253
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.121
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

254

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.500
<v Speaker 4>but it's like you see him in his element.</v>

295
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:59.501
<v Speaker 4>It's like him in with crowds is really like,</v>

296
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 4>you realized that he really enjoys it.</v>

297
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 4>Like he really enjoys the large groups.</v>

298
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 4>He enjoys being recognized.</v>

299
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 4>He fucking like sometimes we were walking and people were like,</v>

300
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

301
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.713
<v Speaker 4>you're the guy.</v>

302
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 4>I've seen you on facebook.</v>

303
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:13.311
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

304
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:14.144
<v Speaker 4>you want a picture?</v>

305
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.591
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

306
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:19.424
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

307
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.891

00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:22.401
<v Speaker 4>he loves it.</v>

309
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:23.234
<v Speaker 4>He loves it.</v>

310
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.331
<v Speaker 4>And then we,</v>

311
00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:25.790
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about how like people would say,</v>

312
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:26.240
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

313
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 4>Tom and I were like,</v>

314
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:27.531
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

315
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:28.364
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

316
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:28.910
<v Speaker 4>hey.</v>

317
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:29.743
<v Speaker 4>And then they would walk away.</v>

318
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 4>They wouldn't come over to me.</v>

319
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

320
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 4>hi.</v>

321
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.620
<v Speaker 4>And then they'd walk in another way,</v>

322
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.531
<v Speaker 4>but with birth they're like,</v>

323
00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:35.364
<v Speaker 4>can I hug you?</v>

324
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.410
<v Speaker 4>Then take their shirt off.</v>

325
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:36.740
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>

326
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:37.180
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

327
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:37.900
<v Speaker 4>I love.</v>

328
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I think 55 is an amazing way class right now.</v>

329
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.350
<v Speaker 1>We argue on Fox that they think they,</v>

330
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.360
<v Speaker 1>they try to get under my skin and say lightweight is the best.</v>

331
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Divisional said don't play with me.</v>

332
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.640
<v Speaker 1>After Habib B was a beast,</v>

333
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 1>I watched any of his fights.</v>

334
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 1>I watch them.</v>

335
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll say I need to go back to my,</v>

336
00:08:58.441 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

337
00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 1>my math.</v>

338
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.610
<v Speaker 1>He fights like that every time he's a monster.</v>

339
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.500
<v Speaker 1>See the Michael Johnson fight.</v>

340
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.970
<v Speaker 1>He's telling me to give up.</v>

341
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.710
<v Speaker 1>It must be champ.</v>

342
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Give up,</v>

343
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 1>smashing them his wrestling and his,</v>

344
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:11.970
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

345
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 1>his ground and pound.</v>

346
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just so ferocious.</v>

347
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:15.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just on such another level.</v>

348
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 1>And when he gets a hold of guys,</v>

349
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.330
<v Speaker 1>he's getting ahold of guys that are really good and just ragdoll and I'm like,</v>

350
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:21.421
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

351
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:23.050
<v Speaker 1>He did the RDA GMC that fine.</v>

352
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen those fines.</v>

353
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:28.710
<v Speaker 1>I got to go back and look ragdolled rds and then she just beats the shit out of</v>

354
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

355
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 1>It gets you to the ground.</v>

356
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 1>I was a big fan at that and I'm like,</v>

357
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:32.004
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

358
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 1>he's something special.</v>

359
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Something special.</v>

360
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:39.230
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that he did that to Barboza he wants to move up to 72 shit.</v>

361
00:09:39.231 --> 00:09:40.064
<v Speaker 1>No he don't.</v>

362
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.363
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

363
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.490
<v Speaker 1>metabolic meals shit out and sit in and see my man.</v>

364
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Habib the pack.</v>

365
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:47.371
<v Speaker 1>Nutrition.</v>

366
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Is anybody out there?</v>

367
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:53.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm picking up the tab cycle as down to 55.</v>

368
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to see.</v>

369
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:55.470
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

370
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Could be right now.</v>

371
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

372
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.730
<v Speaker 1>he's making 55 easy now though,</v>

373
00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 1>so who knows?</v>

374
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 1>I think what I believe is going to happen is I think Connor's going to vacate.</v>

375
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to strip them because connor has got $100,000,000 in the</v>

376
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:08.560
<v Speaker 1>bank.</v>

377
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I think he's having fun and talking shit and he's going to keep training and</v>

378
00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 1>he's going to make a big fight in the future,</v>

379
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 1>but I think Khabib versus Tony is the big fight and fuck.</v>

380
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:18.570
<v Speaker 1>They might even do that one in Russia.</v>

381
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Would they do that one?</v>

382
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.250
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about doing a big fight in Russia that.</v>

383
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:22.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

384
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:23.610
<v Speaker 1>if that happens,</v>

385
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 1>well that's a good fight.</v>

386
00:10:24.871 --> 00:10:25.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

387
00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 1>everybody's been waiting to see that fight.</v>

388
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.391
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

389
00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:27.920
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
