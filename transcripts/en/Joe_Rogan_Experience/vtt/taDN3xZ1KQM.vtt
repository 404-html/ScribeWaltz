00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:04.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I got a new bit about,</v>

3
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>seeing a couple of fucking in the hotel room across from me.</v>

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>So I won't do the bit,</v>

7
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you the story,</v>

8
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>which is basically nears,</v>

9
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>even Portland.</v>

10
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>The hotel is like a horseshoe shape.</v>

11
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>So I'm on the 10th floor and I look across into a room and the curtains are</v>

12
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:22.441
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>

13
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:23.274
<v Speaker 1>lights are on,</v>

14
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>chick is on her back,</v>

15
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.171
<v Speaker 1>legs up.</v>

16
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:30.171
<v Speaker 1>And this dude who's ripped his fucking hour dinner and I'm just standing there</v>

17
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>looking at him like,</v>

18
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>like this is the greatest thing I've ever greatest things ever happened.</v>

19
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

20
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>I slept my bag in my hand and I'm just transfixed.</v>

21
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.351
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

22
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm like high five and the glass like go man had then.</v>

25
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>And so I had the curtain closed cause I didn't want them to see me,</v>

26
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.300
<v Speaker 1>but I popped my head through the curtain.</v>

27
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 2>I looked like a photographer from the 1930 [inaudible]</v>

28
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 1>and then I start thinking about what am I sound like?</v>

29
00:01:04.871 --> 00:01:06.070
<v Speaker 1>And this is where it gets creepy,</v>

30
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.830
<v Speaker 1>creepy year is I leave my room,</v>

31
00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:13.831
<v Speaker 1>I walked down the hall and I stand outside the room and I listen and I hear him</v>

32
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>grunting and I hear her go,</v>

33
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.573
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

34
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.451
<v Speaker 1>to my room,</v>

35
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:20.510
<v Speaker 1>and I call the room.</v>

36
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

37
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.270
<v Speaker 1>just watching them,</v>

38
00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:22.901
<v Speaker 1>waiting,</v>

39
00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>waiting,</v>

40
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't pick up.</v>

41
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.301
<v Speaker 1>But if he did,</v>

42
00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:26.134

43
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.350
