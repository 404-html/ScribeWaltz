1
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With live.</v>

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>What's up brother?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you man?</v>

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.230
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe?</v>

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Speaker 1>You got a little pocket hankie there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you,</v>

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.040
<v Speaker 2>so I'll tell you why I wear a pocket </v>
<v Speaker 2>square please,</v>

7
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.260
<v Speaker 2>because if you don't wear a pocket </v>
<v Speaker 2>square,</v>

8
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.650
<v Speaker 2>you have the appearance that you've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>squeezed into a sports jacket or a suit </v>

9
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.560
<v Speaker 2>for conventional reasons that your mom </v>
<v Speaker 2>put you in there or off the church or </v>

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to the office.</v>

11
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.710
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you put a pocket square in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

12
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.560
<v Speaker 2>you own the jacket if your idea and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else's idea.</v>

13
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Whoo</v>

14
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.410
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking several steps ahead.</v>

15
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll get to get into this outage.</v>

16
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>We we're going to get into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

17
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:53.781
<v Speaker 1>we were talking before the podcast about</v>
<v Speaker 1>these press junkets and about how you </v>

18
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>entertain yourself by forcing yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use a certain word.</v>

19
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the danger.</v>

20
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.660
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst thing in the film business is </v>

21
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 2>press junkets and as you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that rather ineffective and that's my </v>

22
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.241
<v Speaker 2>suspicion too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not that also inefficient and </v>

23
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 2>ineffective because you sit in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chair,</v>

24
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:14.420
<v Speaker 2>someone comes in and they ask you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

25
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.090
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

26
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.390
<v Speaker 2>how good an actor is David Beckman is </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't on independence or whatever it is,</v>

27
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 2>and you answer it and some facile </v>
<v Speaker 2>fashion.</v>

28
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 2>And on the full time you asked answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>that question,</v>

29
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.540
<v Speaker 2>your starting to Swat flies that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

30
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 2>You're starting to go mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens is you have to play </v>

31
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.391
<v Speaker 2>games with yourself so you get someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the side to throw different words </v>

32
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:41.120
<v Speaker 2>that you like valued in area and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Marissa militude.</v>

33
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.840
<v Speaker 2>And then that keeps you occupied because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking when someone asks me </v>

34
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.291
<v Speaker 2>about Beckman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his underpants have somehow got a stick </v>

35
00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 2>in a verisimilitude and I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy.</v>

36
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 2>And your answers become very creative.</v>

37
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Did they ask someone to be sincere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked the same questions over and over </v>

38
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.250
<v Speaker 1>and over again to them like they're half</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

39
00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Keep filing in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A new person comes in and as I us.</v>

40
00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:05.860
<v Speaker 1>So tell us about this film and how did </v>
<v Speaker 1>this get started?</v>

41
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 1>And so who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose idea was it?</v>

42
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.290
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

43
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 2>I sort of film jumbled medics caliber in</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 1990 and uh,</v>

44
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.200
<v Speaker 2>I was an impressionable young man of 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was the first light knights in </v>

45
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:25.631
<v Speaker 2>shining armor film I ever spoke to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't particularly interested in </v>

46
00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:25.631
<v Speaker 2>Errol Flynn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 2>or any inclination that they did in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties in the Shell Nhra.</v>

48
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.570
<v Speaker 2>But John Boorman's one was rather good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very aggressive and no one spoke to</v>

49
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.760
<v Speaker 2>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will shout it at one another.</v>

50
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 2>So it took some time before you realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it was so intense.</v>

51
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.100
<v Speaker 2>It's quite camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it had this sort of weird </v>

52
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.191
<v Speaker 2>juxtaposition of being camp yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously aggressive and you know,</v>

53
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.290
<v Speaker 2>they had a budget of $25 and the visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects and lots of very shiny 19th </v>

54
00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:02.471
<v Speaker 2>century armor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it made a real impression on me </v>

55
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a voice,</v>

56
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 2>it was a creative voice.</v>

57
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 2>So I made an impression on me and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in the attic of my mind,</v>

58
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:16.621
<v Speaker 2>I relegate it until the point where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had enough creative ideas in my </v>

59
00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 2>reservoir to bring it forward to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>film.</v>

60
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:23.551
<v Speaker 2>And then someone gave me money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>warner brothers wanted to make it and </v>

61
00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Yada Yada Yada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it was the challenge,</v>

62
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:28.831
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of trying to take us to join into this </v>

63
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fantasy epic fantasy,</v>

64
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 2>medieval he lord of the Rings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Econ of a world,</v>

65
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 2>and it's completely out of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheelhouse.</v>

66
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 2>So I find the challenge provocative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting as well.</v>

67
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.810
<v Speaker 3>That's a fascinating era or a genre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

68
00:03:44.811 --> 00:03:48.620
<v Speaker 3>the fascinating world of fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

69
00:03:48.621 --> 00:03:51.620
<v Speaker 3>nights and swords and bows and arrows </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

70
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.670
<v Speaker 3>that realm for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been intoxicating to people for a </v>

71
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.670
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

72
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an archetype.</v>

73
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 2>So you're interested in farm and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in nurses.</v>

74
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're interested in the superheroes </v>

75
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.730
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

76
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.760
<v Speaker 2>arguably Arthur was the first superhero </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's the guy that extracts the </v>

77
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.760
<v Speaker 2>sword.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Gallup,</v>

78
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.740
<v Speaker 2>we can do all sorts of wondrous things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this myth is 1200 years old,</v>

79
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.380
<v Speaker 2>1400 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's as relevant today as it was </v>

80
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:28.321
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because it's an archetype that </v>

81
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 2>somehow kids the dress up as firemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>policemen,</v>

82
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 2>soldiers or nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

83
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.520
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like we relived it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an outfit that we wore 1200 </v>

84
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you feel familiar in it.</v>

85
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just.</v>

86
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:47.401
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating that one genre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one sort of archetype is just </v>

87
00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:48.000
<v Speaker 3>locked into the site.</v>

88
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Give people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.440
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

90
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.660
<v Speaker 2>it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

91
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.900
<v Speaker 2>The other thing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite fun,</v>

92
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 2>is you can take these kind of mystical </v>
<v Speaker 2>rides into metaphor so you can symbolize</v>

93
00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:02.360
<v Speaker 2>things with 300,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four elephants,</v>

94
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 2>which you can't do in some version of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>realistic world.</v>

95
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 2>So it becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have broad poetic license to take </v>

96
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.980
<v Speaker 2>liberties are using CGI in this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it.</v>

97
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

98
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.020
<v Speaker 2>What's that like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm boring,</v>

99
00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:24.260
<v Speaker 2>but creative is three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bank,</v>

100
00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:27.770
<v Speaker 2>this movie I'm used to making movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that take three months to write,</v>

101
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.360
<v Speaker 2>three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three years.</v>

102
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three months to write from beginning to </v>

103
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Southern lot snatch was three months,</v>

104
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.590
<v Speaker 2>six weeks to shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two months to edit.</v>

105
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.440
<v Speaker 2>So it's was three months to do the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing or to write it,</v>

106
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.100
<v Speaker 2>to write it and to shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing from the beginning to </v>

107
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.260
<v Speaker 2>the way getting to the end of six </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

108
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then three months safer editing.</v>

109
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.530
<v Speaker 2>So you wrapped and packed in nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

110
00:05:51.531 --> 00:05:52.040
<v Speaker 2>10 months.</v>

111
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 3>So this is a totally different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>commitment as far as your and</v>

112
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I really knew what I was getting </v>

113
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.661
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have asked for double bubble on </v>

114
00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 2>the salary because you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it could be a year and a half is</v>

115
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 2>not a three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you play on a movie like this,</v>

116
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 2>a big epic movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have an actual schedule of when </v>

117
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.540
<v Speaker 2>you think it's going to begin and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to end or do you do,</v>

118
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:22.541
<v Speaker 2>but you know the terrain filmmaking has </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed exponentially.</v>

119
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:28.601
<v Speaker 2>Like everything with technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was pertinent last year is not </v>

120
00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 2>pertinent in this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So release dates are a real dog.</v>

121
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.330
<v Speaker 2>So we had a release date which was </v>
<v Speaker 2>projected a couple of years from when </v>

122
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.951
<v Speaker 2>you start the babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So get right is checkmate the movie </v>

123
00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 2>you're coming out in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

124
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 2>We were supposed to come out and exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year ago,</v>

125
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.720
<v Speaker 2>but then what happens is if you're not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>branded movie,</v>

126
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.420
<v Speaker 2>you get elbowed off that day.</v>

127
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Star Wars or something will come along </v>

128
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 2>and then you don't get to compete </v>
<v Speaker 2>without walls,</v>

129
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 2>so you got to move because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>compete,</v>

130
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 2>so you got a very crowded market with </v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of brands.</v>

131
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Now this isn't something that we used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>suffer because everyone was equal going </v>

132
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:13.061
<v Speaker 2>into the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You give yourself the advantage of </v>

133
00:07:13.061 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 2>having a movie star or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't exist anymore.</v>

134
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 2>What exists now is the brand is the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>brother,</v>

135
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.020
<v Speaker 2>so he comes muscling and bullies his way</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a weekend and that's why you can't </v>

136
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.491
<v Speaker 2>really get new films breaking through </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there was occupy those weekends </v>

137
00:07:27.491 --> 00:07:31.711
<v Speaker 2>are already occupied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so trying to break through is a real </v>

138
00:07:31.711 --> 00:07:34.390
<v Speaker 2>real struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to wait a year for a day and the </v>

139
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.821
<v Speaker 2>date that were coming out on one weekend</v>
<v Speaker 2>after guardians now got into be vast hit</v>

140
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:44.140
<v Speaker 2>and it's very dangerous being within the</v>
<v Speaker 2>parameters of a of a big movie.</v>

141
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 2>That's a really interesting thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>only movies have to go through these </v>

142
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

143
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the rare things where people</v>

144
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 2>are getting out and going to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's been made together in a</v>

145
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:55.380
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that you're,</v>

146
00:07:55.381 --> 00:07:58.490
<v Speaker 2>you're watching media like it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>live performance.</v>

147
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:02.780
<v Speaker 2>It's something that's been created and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to press play at 8:00</v>

148
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.780
<v Speaker 2>PM on Friday night and everybody's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to see it and you got to get as </v>

149
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:07.780
<v Speaker 2>many of those people together as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

150
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.090
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the rare things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

151
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 2>and it's becoming more polarized so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>means more now,</v>

152
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.520
<v Speaker 2>so you're opening weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is about.</v>

153
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:18.530
<v Speaker 2>They know what you're going to make by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thursday evening,</v>

154
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're coming.</v>

155
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.790
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be coming out on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday and everyone knows what you have </v>

156
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.790
<v Speaker 2>to make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By Sunday night on a Thursday evening,</v>

157
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.860
<v Speaker 2>there's enough clever people out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapping into clever little boxes and </v>

158
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.850
<v Speaker 2>computer says that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the data,</v>

159
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Speaker 2>and they're seldom wrong now.</v>

160
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Speaker 2>That never used to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Used to come out and films will get </v>

161
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Speaker 2>discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said platform,</v>

162
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 2>you start small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go big.</v>

163
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:45.341
<v Speaker 2>That sort of nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you just got to come out bold </v>

164
00:08:45.341 --> 00:08:45.440
<v Speaker 2>swinging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't come out ball swing and</v>

165
00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 2>people get very upset and they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is a failure,</v>

166
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:51.830
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't lived up to expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's a creative success,</v>

167
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 2>nobody likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

168
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:53.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

169
00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 2>there's a bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

170
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is an accepted set,</v>

171
00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:57.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>

172
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 2>good movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good movies find their own way,</v>

173
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.120
<v Speaker 2>usually in the end anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the financial aspect has become </v>

174
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:11.810
<v Speaker 2>polarized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too significant of a component in </v>

175
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 2>the equation because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 2>it's an art form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

177
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's entertainment and an art form.</v>

178
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:22.371
<v Speaker 2>And somehow you want to unify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reconcile that.</v>

179
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.230
<v Speaker 2>So because they're essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

180
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 2>reconcile those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in a nice little package.</v>

181
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:34.190
<v Speaker 2>So you put it in a pill with a sweet </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrapper around it and then you got both </v>

182
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.760
<v Speaker 2>and then you should be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should have the substance and you </v>

183
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 2>should have the flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

184
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 2>but then now the focus is all on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flavor and not in the substance.</v>

185
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.330
<v Speaker 2>And that's result orientated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you movie comes out and they go,</v>

186
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.900
<v Speaker 2>what am I not slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son?</v>

187
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:57.350
<v Speaker 2>What's the movie line?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question first of all should be </v>

188
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.350
<v Speaker 2>what's the movie like rather than what </v>
<v Speaker 2>did it mean?</v>

189
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

190
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.500
<v Speaker 2>it's become too competitive and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparative financially and I love a </v>

191
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.220
<v Speaker 2>dollar bill and I like things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>

192
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.780
<v Speaker 2>but it has to be secondary to what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary and primary is.</v>

193
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.130
<v Speaker 2>What's it like creatively?</v>

194
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a film like,</v>

195
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to shit on it,</v>

196
00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:17.630
<v Speaker 1>but fast and furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I heard about was how much money you</v>

197
00:10:17.631 --> 00:10:19.040
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you hear.</v>

198
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like the big story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big fast and the furious opening box</v>

199
00:10:22.011 --> 00:10:23.480
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of millions of dollars.</v>

200
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.550
<v Speaker 1>All you see is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to make a billion dollars.</v>

201
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does anybody who's watching that </v>

202
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:30.940
<v Speaker 1>give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna get any of that money.</v>

203
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so appealing that this movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>is made a billion dollars?</v>

204
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Because it's comparative and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive and it's why two people in </v>

205
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:38.890
<v Speaker 1>the audience</v>

206
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.710
<v Speaker 2>because it's voyeuristic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Voyeuristic.</v>

207
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can.</v>

208
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like spectator sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's the winner?</v>

209
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't really care about how they </v>

210
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.301
<v Speaker 2>won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just care about the fact that they </v>

211
00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:54.301
<v Speaker 2>did when</v>

212
00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:57.330
<v Speaker 1>or like a floyd mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to find out how much money he </v>

213
00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:57.330
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made $200,000,000</v>

214
00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:57.790
<v Speaker 1>at five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oo.</v>

215
00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.770
<v Speaker 1>People get excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an extra element.</v>

216
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a sort of,</v>

217
00:11:02.981 --> 00:11:07.981
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for carious life that people can have </v>

218
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 2>through sports stars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrities and success if they feel </v>

219
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.601
<v Speaker 2>somehow related to or they went on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opening weekend or they are invested in </v>

220
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.020
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's successful,</v>

221
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.900
<v Speaker 2>then somehow proliferate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm successful.</v>

222
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gets weird,</v>

223
00:11:21.461 --> 00:11:22.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does get weird.</v>

224
00:11:22.601 --> 00:11:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the</v>

225
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:29.270
<v Speaker 1>business of movies is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange business because you are a </v>

226
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.840
<v Speaker 1>creative business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also a business enterprise.</v>

227
00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:35.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a financial business and when </v>

228
00:11:35.841 --> 00:11:36.930
<v Speaker 1>know when it's a guy like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your movies have a certain flavor,</v>

229
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:41.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you start off with lock stock and </v>

230
00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:42.120
<v Speaker 1>two smoking barrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that movie has a flavor to it.</v>

231
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:47.300
<v Speaker 1>And then your other films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people want to go to see that kind </v>

232
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.021
<v Speaker 1>of flavor from your film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like pressure in that </v>

233
00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:51.510
<v Speaker 1>regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to live up to those expectations or</v>

234
00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 1>to conform to these ideas people have of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your movies?</v>

235
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>

236
00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.900
<v Speaker 2>It depends what mood you catch me in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

237
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like what I do and I'm going to do it </v>

238
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.741
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just liked it very much when people </v>

239
00:12:07.741 --> 00:12:07.741
<v Speaker 2>pay me to do it and give me the money to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go do it.</v>

240
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.200
<v Speaker 2>So I don't mind the financial aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

241
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind films having to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I what I'm,</v>

242
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.430
<v Speaker 2>what I'm after is a reconciliation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>

243
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.610
<v Speaker 2>the primary components,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be on the quality of the work.</v>

244
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:27.060
<v Speaker 2>That should be what's primary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't begrudge films being </v>

245
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:27.060
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like them to be successful.</v>

246
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.531
<v Speaker 2>I liked the competitive element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes when you're talking with </v>

247
00:12:31.531 --> 00:12:34.351
<v Speaker 2>executives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize my priorities are on the </v>

248
00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:39.511
<v Speaker 2>wrong thing here in the end it is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative medium and that is what has to </v>

249
00:12:39.511 --> 00:12:40.930
<v Speaker 2>be primary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they get in the way of a guy like you</v>

250
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:41.200
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

251
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Like I would imagine the guy like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give you a certain amount of </v>

252
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 2>leeway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give you all the leeway.</v>

253
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:46.740
<v Speaker 2>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

254
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.440
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

255
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:52.470
<v Speaker 2>my experience with studios will be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive and they tried to encourage </v>

256
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.400
<v Speaker 2>your hopefully what is your individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiosyncrasies?</v>

257
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:02.220
<v Speaker 2>They want you to put your imprint upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>the work and they've been nothing but </v>

258
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.930
<v Speaker 2>encouraging in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

259
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:09.390
<v Speaker 2>people betray their agendas whilst </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in light conversation or they </v>

260
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.501
<v Speaker 2>portray their priorities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want to trust the man because </v>

261
00:13:13.631 --> 00:13:17.500
<v Speaker 2>he's a man of substance and to a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independence.</v>

262
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.480
<v Speaker 2>So he's not looking to me to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself through me.</v>

263
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.540
<v Speaker 2>So you're not asking me to tell you who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>

264
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Speaker 2>And that's the ongoing battle of live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

265
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Where will asking other people to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>us who we are and independence from.</v>

266
00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:34.840
<v Speaker 2>That is a man that can be trusted.</v>

267
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:40.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anything from you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thereby I can be kind to you because I </v>

268
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:42.910
<v Speaker 2>don't need to manipulate you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're no longer a crutch,</v>

269
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's got to be very difficult when </v>

270
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:48.480
<v Speaker 2>you're in business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When someone like that,</v>

271
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.870
<v Speaker 2>especially like an executive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some slick character in a fine suit to </v>

272
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 2>find out exactly what is real motives </v>
<v Speaker 2>really are than never in find suits.</v>

273
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

274
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.170
<v Speaker 2>They dress in appalling suits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

275
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean business is never encourage.</v>

276
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Find suits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pocket squares,</v>

277
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.170
<v Speaker 2>occasionally you find the token pocket </v>
<v Speaker 2>square,</v>

278
00:14:08.171 --> 00:14:09.640
<v Speaker 2>but you can tell their heart's not in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

279
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.140
<v Speaker 2>The wife stuck it in there because she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>so someone on tv that Adam razzle dazzle</v>

280
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:19.270
<v Speaker 2>about them and they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

281
00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I quite fancy model man wearing them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stick it in.</v>

282
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:24.970
<v Speaker 2>The old man's bit embarrassed about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and tries to squeeze out of the way.</v>

283
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.630
<v Speaker 2>Suits are a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The death of the suit.</v>

284
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:33.810
<v Speaker 2>It was the death of the suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was the attitude toward ongoing.</v>

285
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

286
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.730
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

287
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.580
<v Speaker 2>we'll put a tie on and I don't want us </v>
<v Speaker 2>to cow.</v>

288
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.460
<v Speaker 2>That's how I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what's happened.</v>

289
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.400
<v Speaker 2>We've been brainwashed to not dress line</v>
<v Speaker 2>gentlemen,</v>

290
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.830
<v Speaker 2>but I see a guy like you and I say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's appealing.</v>

291
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.100
<v Speaker 2>Like look how you're dressed and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a conservative suit.</v>

292
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.290
<v Speaker 2>This is a nice,</v>

293
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.470
<v Speaker 3>like I'm sure you could wear any suit </v>
<v Speaker 3>you wanted,</v>

294
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.710
<v Speaker 3>but you chose assert that has a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>look to it.</v>

295
00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have spent some time asking around </v>

296
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.581
<v Speaker 2>with this Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a bit like that same reason that we </v>

297
00:15:05.581 --> 00:15:06.250
<v Speaker 2>spent time asking around with they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket square.</v>

298
00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.330
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking how much I found the</v>

299
00:15:10.331 --> 00:15:15.331
<v Speaker 2>suit repugnant and I became angry that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the suit had been robbed from us and so </v>

300
00:15:17.741 --> 00:15:22.741
<v Speaker 2>I had to create an alibi away in to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand why is that?</v>

301
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:28.410
<v Speaker 2>I'd like a suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was the magic of Ralph and in the </v>

302
00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.261
<v Speaker 2>magic of Ralph Lauren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice Jewish boy from New York called </v>

303
00:15:31.261 --> 00:15:34.231
<v Speaker 2>Lipschitz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>created a waspy empire is a wonderful </v>

304
00:15:34.231 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 2>expression that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

305
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:40.260
<v Speaker 2>think Yiddish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dress British and Ralph Lauren created </v>

306
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.170
<v Speaker 2>this great empire and resold the waspy </v>
<v Speaker 2>world back to the waspy world.</v>

307
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually not to the waspy world </v>

308
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.320
<v Speaker 2>because in England there was a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment about savile row traditional </v>

309
00:15:52.091 --> 00:15:53.950
<v Speaker 2>tailoring because it'd been robbed from </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

310
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:59.070
<v Speaker 2>The officers that come along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number crunchers that come along and</v>

311
00:15:59.201 --> 00:16:03.100
<v Speaker 2>there was no creativity in the suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A suit needs to be creative.</v>

312
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:05.560
<v Speaker 2>The person that puts it on can't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting it on,</v>

313
00:16:05.561 --> 00:16:08.590
<v Speaker 2>but because he's told to put it on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a one or put it on.</v>

314
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh Huh.</v>

315
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:15.310
<v Speaker 2>So what Ralph did is he fashioned up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there sort of cause I new England world </v>

316
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:17.260
<v Speaker 2>and salt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

317
00:16:17.261 --> 00:16:22.261
<v Speaker 2>he took on a trope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took on a cliche and he refashioned </v>

318
00:16:22.261 --> 00:16:23.210
<v Speaker 2>that cliche to give it a new sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

319
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.210
<v Speaker 2>a new sense of breath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd put black people in.</v>

320
00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:28.970
<v Speaker 2>The suits were traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a white man's suit.</v>

321
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.440
<v Speaker 2>He made it feel new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We gave it a take.</v>

322
00:16:31.441 --> 00:16:34.010
<v Speaker 2>So what he did is he tipped his hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old world,</v>

323
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.870
<v Speaker 2>but also tipped his hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new world.</v>

324
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:41.350
<v Speaker 2>And it allowed wasps to find their way </v>
<v Speaker 2>back into the world with an eloquent </v>

325
00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:43.460
<v Speaker 2>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was clever.</v>

326
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting fascinated by the way your </v>

327
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.411
<v Speaker 3>brain works because for you it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>important that the person wants to wear </v>

328
00:16:51.411 --> 00:16:51.690
<v Speaker 3>the suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have a feeling that that's.</v>

329
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.680
<v Speaker 3>So that's symbolic of how you feel about</v>
<v Speaker 3>life itself.</v>

330
00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Like the person has to want to be doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing.</v>

331
00:16:59.221 --> 00:17:03.030
<v Speaker 3>They have to want to wear that suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to be an authentic gesture.</v>

332
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:08.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you ever read a book called extreme </v>

333
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:08.570
<v Speaker 3>ownership written by a couple of navy </v>
<v Speaker 3>seals?</v>

334
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:09.840
<v Speaker 3>That's Jocko Willink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

335
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

336
00:17:10.831 --> 00:17:11.670
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>

337
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.150
<v Speaker 3>Is it your job was booked?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

338
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:13.860
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

339
00:17:13.861 --> 00:17:16.710
<v Speaker 3>But Jack on the show a bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Important Book.</v>

340
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.740
<v Speaker 3>Why I've got them on once before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I talking about a bunch of </v>

341
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:21.740
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met him once,</v>

342
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.850
<v Speaker 3>but it's an important book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

343
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Now there's lots of books that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>picked up on this theme,</v>

344
00:17:25.201 --> 00:17:28.860
<v Speaker 2>but they were very eloquent about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't own something,</v>

345
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.420
<v Speaker 2>you're not the boss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to take full responsibility for</v>

346
00:17:33.421 --> 00:17:36.360
<v Speaker 2>everything that you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why be subservient?</v>

347
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.660
<v Speaker 2>You must be the master of your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>kingdom.</v>

348
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.320
<v Speaker 2>I feel you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes a lot of sense.</v>

349
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.470
<v Speaker 2>You've got to own that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just walk into things with </v>

350
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 2>your eyes half open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will walk into things with your eyes</v>

351
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:57.561
<v Speaker 2>fully open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to know what you're getting </v>

352
00:17:57.561 --> 00:17:59.151
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to take possession of your </v>

353
00:17:59.151 --> 00:18:01.641
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this a thought process that you have </v>

354
00:18:01.641 --> 00:18:01.860
<v Speaker 2>to constantly reaffirm or is this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly that.</v>

355
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:06.890
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You drift on this point and it is </v>

356
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:11.510
<v Speaker 2>whatever form of meditation or Mantra </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you decided to espouse the needs to</v>

357
00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:17.391
<v Speaker 2>be some period in your day where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember that there's a world out there </v>

358
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.910
<v Speaker 2>trying to tell you who you are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a world in here that's trying to</v>

359
00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 2>tell you who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

360
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:30.531
<v Speaker 2>where do you want to put your x?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the world outside is very noisy </v>

361
00:18:30.531 --> 00:18:33.540
<v Speaker 2>and very tempting and as all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Razzmatazz as all the tents and,</v>

362
00:18:33.541 --> 00:18:34.290
<v Speaker 2>and all the glitter,</v>

363
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:41.120
<v Speaker 2>it's called the toys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's because you don't think </v>

364
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.820
<v Speaker 2>you're enough in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

365
00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.340
<v Speaker 2>you don't think you're enough in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>

366
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.550
<v Speaker 2>The whole idea of the world to sell your</v>
<v Speaker 2>staff is first of all,</v>

367
00:18:47.551 --> 00:18:49.320
<v Speaker 2>they have to make you feel bad about </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

368
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:54.350
<v Speaker 2>Less than in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't resent this system by the </v>

369
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.350
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the system,</v>

370
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.560
<v Speaker 2>but most of the expression about don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate,</v>

371
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.350
<v Speaker 2>don't hate the player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate the game.</v>

372
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Don't hate the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love the game because you're in it,</v>

373
00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:09.580
<v Speaker 2>mate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so own the game except the rules and </v>

374
00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:14.051
<v Speaker 2>move on into the rules so the world will</v>
<v Speaker 2>try and tell you who you are and you </v>

375
00:19:14.671 --> 00:19:19.671
<v Speaker 2>have to tell yourself who you are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this ongoing battle and somehow </v>

376
00:19:19.671 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Speaker 2>that there needs to be a reconciliation </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the two,</v>

377
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.360
<v Speaker 2>but in the end you've got to have all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the eggs in your basket.</v>

378
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.210
<v Speaker 2>There's also an ongoing internal battle </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

379
00:19:27.211 --> 00:19:27.530
<v Speaker 2>isn't there?</v>

380
00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:32.550
<v Speaker 3>There's the you that you want people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think you are and there's the you who </v>

381
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.260
<v Speaker 3>you are and trying to figure out like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I,</v>

382
00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:40.420
<v Speaker 3>how do I figure out who I am?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am I do I have a correct assumption of</v>

383
00:19:40.421 --> 00:19:45.421
<v Speaker 3>how the people are perceiving me and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually am objectively or am I </v>

384
00:19:45.421 --> 00:19:48.310
<v Speaker 3>bullshitting them world with this suit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and pocket square?</v>

385
00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that is exactly the scenario</v>

386
00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:56.160
<v Speaker 2>that we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The essentially one to two worlds is the</v>

387
00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:58.660
<v Speaker 2>inner world of energy in this email to </v>
<v Speaker 2>weld of energy.</v>

388
00:19:58.661 --> 00:20:00.130
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those two identities,</v>

389
00:20:00.131 --> 00:20:01.330
<v Speaker 2>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real ones falls.</v>

390
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.280
<v Speaker 2>The external world is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking you to tell me who I am.</v>

391
00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:12.060
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're all playing at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as you start playing that </v>

392
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:12.060
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we run into all sorts of trouble,</v>

393
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:12.160
<v Speaker 2>call it ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call it whatever you want to call it,</v>

394
00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.330
<v Speaker 2>but that's the dynamic that we're in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow we have to</v>

395
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:24.340
<v Speaker 2>give ourselves enough confidence to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reassure ourselves that we are enough.</v>

396
00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:29.490
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enter the game because I've got to </v>

397
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.951
<v Speaker 2>move on in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got crack on in the world and I know </v>

398
00:20:31.951 --> 00:20:31.951
<v Speaker 2>there's loads temptations that come </v>
<v Speaker 2>along the way,</v>

399
00:20:31.951 --> 00:20:33.860
<v Speaker 2>so I will own the suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to wear the suit.</v>

400
00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:38.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to Wyoming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The soup now don't mean by paying for </v>

401
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:39.430
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean by owning it,</v>

402
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.300
<v Speaker 2>it's now mine suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my idea to put on this suit.</v>

403
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:48.450
<v Speaker 2>I have to personalize it in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to understand a narrative that </v>

404
00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:52.201
<v Speaker 2>allows me to own that suit and thereby I</v>
<v Speaker 2>put on my suit of armor and I come out </v>

405
00:20:52.201 --> 00:20:56.701
<v Speaker 2>into the world and guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a good time because I'm owning </v>

406
00:20:56.701 --> 00:20:56.701
<v Speaker 2>the suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

407
00:20:56.701 --> 00:21:01.621
<v Speaker 2>This is a very rock solid philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this something you've ever written </v>

408
00:21:01.621 --> 00:21:04.940
<v Speaker 2>down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what the essence of narrative.</v>

409
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm storyteller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The essence of narrative is only about </v>

410
00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.711
<v Speaker 2>this dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing else in a story other </v>

411
00:21:14.711 --> 00:21:17.621
<v Speaker 2>than this dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the struggle between other people's </v>

412
00:21:18.141 --> 00:21:23.060
<v Speaker 2>perceptions and your own wants and </v>
<v Speaker 2>desires and who you truly are,</v>

413
00:21:23.061 --> 00:21:27.620
<v Speaker 2>your your significant real self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

414
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.620
<v Speaker 2>That's all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tell me a story that didn't,</v>

415
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.920
<v Speaker 2>that we engaged in that famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not about this journey.</v>

416
00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The political son</v>

417
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.940
<v Speaker 2>parable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian seems to religious doesn't </v>

418
00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:43.940
<v Speaker 2>really make much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know this story?</v>

419
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.840
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why don't you lay it out?</v>

420
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:51.680
<v Speaker 2>So there's a father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has two sons and all of a sudden the </v>

421
00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.501
<v Speaker 2>youngest son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he says to them who wants to spend </v>

422
00:21:54.501 --> 00:21:54.501
<v Speaker 2>their inheritance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The youngest has,</v>

423
00:21:54.501 --> 00:21:59.231
<v Speaker 2>has made that dog and spend it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the younger son takes all the dough </v>

424
00:21:59.231 --> 00:22:03.800
<v Speaker 2>and he runs off and sniff coke off </v>
<v Speaker 2>stripper's tits for a number of years </v>

425
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.300
<v Speaker 2>until he realizes this is getting pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>boring and I'm in a lot of trouble.</v>

426
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.270
<v Speaker 2>He ends up feeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing food pics.</v>

427
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:17.300
<v Speaker 2>That's his job and he couldn't even eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>the food that he gives to the pics.</v>

428
00:22:17.341 --> 00:22:18.570
<v Speaker 2>At which point he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dad,</v>

429
00:22:18.571 --> 00:22:19.530
<v Speaker 2>will you take me back?</v>

430
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.430
<v Speaker 2>That then goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't meet.</v>

431
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.940
<v Speaker 2>This somehow happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not through telephones.</v>

432
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.440
<v Speaker 2>It just happens at which point that goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the fatty carbs has killed the fatted</v>

433
00:22:32.441 --> 00:22:33.790
<v Speaker 2>calf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Older sons,</v>

434
00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:35.140
<v Speaker 2>his own dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

435
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I've stayed with you since the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>

436
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I've been loyal to you and I hear the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories of my younger brother coming </v>

437
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:47.941
<v Speaker 2>back who's been sniffing coke off </v>
<v Speaker 2>stripper's tits for the last God knows </v>

438
00:22:47.941 --> 00:22:49.030
<v Speaker 2>how many years and you're prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kill the fatted calf.</v>

439
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.520
<v Speaker 2>What's the spa that I want another </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

440
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.460
<v Speaker 2>This is your son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about that.</v>

441
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.950
<v Speaker 2>You take a little side step,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little step to the side.</v>

442
00:22:56.951 --> 00:22:58.300
<v Speaker 2>You'll always be with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a good boy.</v>

443
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.140
<v Speaker 2>At which point he goes out to meet the </v>
<v Speaker 2>product,</v>

444
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.730
<v Speaker 2>the wasteful son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the waste some returns,</v>

445
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 2>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will also know you're found.</v>

446
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.580
<v Speaker 2>That's the end of the story is quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to make sense of that.</v>

447
00:23:12.581 --> 00:23:13.710
<v Speaker 2>In a literal sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>

448
00:23:13.711 --> 00:23:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad was a bit unfair.</v>

449
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.240
<v Speaker 2>You should have been unkind to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oldest son because he never ran off and </v>

450
00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.551
<v Speaker 2>did anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the essence of the story is that you</v>

451
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:28.580
<v Speaker 2>are the father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are enough.</v>

452
00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Your oldest son is your intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

453
00:23:33.591 --> 00:23:34.070
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>danger.</v>

454
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.290
<v Speaker 2>There's danger that is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconcile,</v>

455
00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:38.900
<v Speaker 2>makes sense of a present and material </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

456
00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:44.650
<v Speaker 2>The younger son being the wild feral </v>
<v Speaker 2>entity that is wants to go out and find </v>

457
00:23:46.611 --> 00:23:47.360
<v Speaker 2>out what it's all about,</v>

458
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.280
<v Speaker 2>so when his recklessness and sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure,</v>

459
00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.220
<v Speaker 2>he finds that he can't escape himself,</v>

460
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:03.120
<v Speaker 2>so we have to return to himself and at </v>
<v Speaker 2>which point he has to accept who he is,</v>

461
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:08.510
<v Speaker 2>which button the intellect is left out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The equation pretty much is the older </v>

462
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:12.141
<v Speaker 2>brother because he can't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of the journey of the </v>

463
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.330
<v Speaker 2>wasteful brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any end,</v>

464
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:20.870
<v Speaker 2>you have to leave yourself to understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>the value of yourself.</v>

465
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:26.300
<v Speaker 2>You have to lose stuff before you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that all the stuff that you're </v>

466
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.960
<v Speaker 2>losing is a femoral and transitory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not yours.</v>

467
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.420
<v Speaker 2>You are enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are always enough,</v>

468
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.260
<v Speaker 2>but you've got to somehow prostitute </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself before you realized you were in</v>

469
00:24:34.261 --> 00:24:36.960
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the essence of all stories.</v>

470
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:38.880
<v Speaker 2>That's deep guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richie,</v>

471
00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.280
<v Speaker 2>is that something you think about all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time or is this.</v>

472
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is like a segmented </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy lip,</v>

473
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:49.350
<v Speaker 2>so king off stock you just made a man is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a king.</v>

474
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.090
<v Speaker 2>As a son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the son,</v>

475
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.530
<v Speaker 2>the father is runs into a bit of aggro.</v>

476
00:24:56.070 --> 00:25:00.570
<v Speaker 2>The son jumps into a little boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little skillet,</v>

477
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.910
<v Speaker 2>and he's not scale it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you got your chops on,</v>

478
00:25:02.911 --> 00:25:04.470
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A skiff.</v>

479
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Little skiff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The skiff takes off down the river.</v>

480
00:25:07.231 --> 00:25:10.290
<v Speaker 2>He gets found by prostitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's bought up in a brothel.</v>

481
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:15.030
<v Speaker 2>He understands the ways that the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he becomes a king on the street.</v>

482
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:20.480
<v Speaker 2>He works his way out that different </v>
<v Speaker 2>ladders and then he pulls a soul from a </v>

483
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.280
<v Speaker 2>stone at a certain point in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain point of evolution,</v>

484
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:26.280
<v Speaker 2>and then from there he goes on to be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>king as a bit of a tussle over along the</v>

485
00:25:26.281 --> 00:25:31.281
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of wrestling matches in the </v>

486
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:31.281
<v Speaker 2>endophyte,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his demons,</v>

487
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:33.951
<v Speaker 2>and he becomes the king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's the significance of this </v>

488
00:25:33.951 --> 00:25:36.681
<v Speaker 2>narrative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That every man and himself is irs </v>

489
00:25:36.681 --> 00:25:37.230
<v Speaker 2>socratic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he is his own king.</v>

490
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.230
<v Speaker 2>He takes the sojourn into the material </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

491
00:25:40.231 --> 00:25:45.231
<v Speaker 2>has climb up all the different runs on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ladder and ultimately has to return </v>

492
00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:45.231
<v Speaker 2>to himself.</v>

493
00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:47.190
<v Speaker 2>The significance of the extraction from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sword,</v>

494
00:25:47.191 --> 00:25:50.820
<v Speaker 2>from the stone is the stone is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>material world,</v>

495
00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:56.450
<v Speaker 2>the material world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seems all solid because it </v>

496
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:57.120
<v Speaker 2>controls you whilst you're projecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>your sense of identity upon it.</v>

497
00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.990
<v Speaker 2>The extraction of the stone is taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>back your own authority.</v>

498
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.490
<v Speaker 2>You're Rhone divinity around authority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around identity,</v>

499
00:26:05.491 --> 00:26:07.590
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that you've got to call </v>
<v Speaker 2>it your own power.</v>

500
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.040
<v Speaker 2>You will no longer looking for a sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of self outside of yourself and then you</v>

501
00:26:11.041 --> 00:26:16.041
<v Speaker 2>have to face the demons that you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>created and your history by facing them </v>

502
00:26:16.081 --> 00:26:21.081
<v Speaker 2>and fighting them and owning them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put them in the face of who you are </v>

503
00:26:21.081 --> 00:26:25.520
<v Speaker 2>and that's a wrestling match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to take away all these </v>

504
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.090
<v Speaker 2>crutches and that's all that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggled from in life is taken away,</v>

505
00:26:27.091 --> 00:26:29.100
<v Speaker 2>are crutches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

506
00:26:29.101 --> 00:26:30.660
<v Speaker 2>please tell me who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

507
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:35.670
<v Speaker 2>please give me a bit more money so the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people think I'm clever or when they're </v>

508
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:35.670
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

509
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:35.720
<v Speaker 2>Have a nice cut horn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People think I'm clever.</v>

510
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
<v Speaker 2>You got to take away all these crutches </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stand as the man that you are and </v>

511
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.110
<v Speaker 2>you're liberated from your whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the story of King Arthur,</v>

512
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:44.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's not just the story of King </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arthur.</v>

513
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:49.790
<v Speaker 2>It's the story of all narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that most people that are </v>

514
00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:49.790
<v Speaker 2>watching the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get that though.</v>

515
00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.300
<v Speaker 2>They're just going to get an </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertaining story.</v>

516
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:52.920
<v Speaker 2>They're just going to see a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool stuff,</v>

517
00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:57.921
<v Speaker 2>some drama play out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is fascinating that you're </v>

518
00:26:57.921 --> 00:26:59.340
<v Speaker 2>operating so many levels underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bought him a storyteller on business,</v>

519
00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:04.341
<v Speaker 2>so if I'm in the business of store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might as well understand story and do </v>

520
00:27:04.341 --> 00:27:05.940
<v Speaker 2>you need to understand a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if you do.</v>

521
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.000
<v Speaker 2>Depends where you on the ladder so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can just go along.</v>

522
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I have a nice bit of entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good guy,</v>

523
00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:11.940
<v Speaker 2>bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is literal.</v>

524
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.360
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with literalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is what it is.</v>

525
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:20.420
<v Speaker 2>It's the game you can glean what you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>glean when you're ready to glean what </v>

526
00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.870
<v Speaker 2>you're ready to glean or you Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 2>Campbell Fan.</v>

527
00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:24.320
<v Speaker 2>I am a Joseph Campbell Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

528
00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

529
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a reoccurring theme in his work,</v>

530
00:27:28.081 --> 00:27:29.910
<v Speaker 2>the hero's journey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hero's journey,</v>

531
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:34.930
<v Speaker 2>these underlying sort of narrative that </v>
<v Speaker 2>just really guides all,</v>

532
00:27:35.161 --> 00:27:40.161
<v Speaker 2>all stories and all ancient tales and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's something inherently human </v>

533
00:27:40.161 --> 00:27:43.461
<v Speaker 2>about them important about these stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they resonate with our wants and </v>

534
00:27:43.531 --> 00:27:48.531
<v Speaker 2>needs and goals and even also maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure that we really truly need in </v>

535
00:27:48.531 --> 00:27:50.400
<v Speaker 2>our own life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

536
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean all the stories from whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

537
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm sympathetic to this particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

538
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.520
<v Speaker 2>to Joseph Campbell's philosophy on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not the only one.</v>

539
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The weird thing about religion is </v>

540
00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.011
<v Speaker 2>religion has done to this spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of narrative.</v>

541
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the businessman did to the suit.</v>

542
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.870
<v Speaker 2>He's literalized it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't realize that putting on a suit</v>

543
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.240
<v Speaker 2>is putting on a suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama,</v>

544
00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.150
<v Speaker 2>he's putting on something that's rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular.</v>

545
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.030
<v Speaker 2>It's just doing it for convention you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing for others.</v>

546
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:27.510
<v Speaker 2>You're not doing it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in all literal mind,</v>

547
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:32.690
<v Speaker 2>we look at a narrative and we see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative for what we believe it to be,</v>

548
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:38.010
<v Speaker 2>the exterior aspect of the narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we completely,</v>

549
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.800
<v Speaker 2>we see the world upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>

550
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.040
<v Speaker 2>We're not actually interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>essence of the narrative because we're </v>

551
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.490
<v Speaker 2>so busy pandering after the approval of </v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

552
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:52.230
<v Speaker 2>So everything that we see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every narrative that we listened to,</v>

553
00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:57.390
<v Speaker 2>every film that you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not really interested in its </v>

554
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:01.190
<v Speaker 2>soul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're interested in it's body because </v>

555
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:05.091
<v Speaker 2>that's what we correspond to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating that you're comparing </v>

556
00:29:05.091 --> 00:29:07.941
<v Speaker 2>it to suits because it resonates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you think of a guy showing up </v>

557
00:29:07.941 --> 00:29:12.861
<v Speaker 2>for work or getting ready for work and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't want to go and he's putting </v>

558
00:29:12.861 --> 00:29:16.041
<v Speaker 2>on the suit and it's just dredging </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it and putting it on and or you </v>

559
00:29:16.041 --> 00:29:20.301
<v Speaker 2>think about a guy who was crisply </v>
<v Speaker 2>tucking in his collars and putting on </v>

560
00:29:20.301 --> 00:29:24.741
<v Speaker 2>his cuff links and tightening up his tie</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he feels empowered by the whole </v>

561
00:29:24.741 --> 00:29:25.320
<v Speaker 2>process of it.</v>

562
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.360
<v Speaker 2>It's very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very appealing.</v>

563
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.340
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you seen in a film too?</v>

564
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.140
<v Speaker 2>It's very exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a man of purpose.</v>

565
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.770
<v Speaker 2>They didn't mean streets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

566
00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:36.020
<v Speaker 2>You remember harvey cartel and getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>dressed to go up on a Friday,</v>

567
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:41.120
<v Speaker 2>getting dressed to go out Friday night </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it affected a whole generation of </v>

568
00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:41.120
<v Speaker 2>people about the way they dress because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

569
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.600
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

570
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.010
<v Speaker 2>I never really thought about that until </v>
<v Speaker 2>this conversation because I just,</v>

571
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't really wear suits occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

572
00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:52.360
<v Speaker 2>very occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you'd been robbed.</v>

573
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:53.850
<v Speaker 2>I've been robbed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been world.</v>

574
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.920
<v Speaker 2>There are so many aspects of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Food for a long time got robbed from us </v>

575
00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.930
<v Speaker 2>and we've slowly managed to claw that </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

576
00:30:00.931 --> 00:30:02.360
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

577
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:07.530
<v Speaker 2>but clothes really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a 45 year old geezer and you </v>

578
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:10.870
<v Speaker 2>still dressing like an 18 year old cast </v>
<v Speaker 2>is all about.</v>

579
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people like to be comfortable </v>

580
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:16.170
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

581
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:16.170
<v Speaker 2>I get that by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they liked that look.</v>

582
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your students comfortable.</v>

583
00:30:17.811 --> 00:30:22.811
<v Speaker 2>It's comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get pulled into this completely </v>

584
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:23.740
<v Speaker 2>deconstructed on the inside maybe by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chap called Brunello,</v>

585
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.290
<v Speaker 2>knows what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are all handmade.</v>

586
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it won't be handmade,</v>

587
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.250
<v Speaker 2>tailored a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

588
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I bought this off the shelf and I had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of things tweet,</v>

589
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's as comfortable as a pair of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pajamas.</v>

590
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

591
00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.850
<v Speaker 2>See again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to broker a deal.</v>

592
00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:42.760
<v Speaker 2>You can't put on things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable because guess what happens</v>

593
00:30:42.761 --> 00:30:43.950
<v Speaker 2>in the morning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're looking through your suit.</v>

594
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.440
<v Speaker 2>You'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

595
00:30:44.441 --> 00:30:46.420
<v Speaker 2>I like that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One with a comfortable one,</v>

596
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.800
<v Speaker 2>so they all have to be comfortable while</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you don't get to play the </v>

597
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:52.800
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here.</v>

598
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.980
<v Speaker 2>I have a thing about ties though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go on,</v>

599
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:59.100
<v Speaker 2>I'd kill someone with a tie on for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can kill some 100 percent if I get </v>

600
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:03.571
<v Speaker 2>ahold of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tie Your Dead Joe is conversation needs </v>

601
00:31:03.571 --> 00:31:04.210
<v Speaker 2>to go on for longer.</v>

602
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Zip ties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're wearing a rope around your neck.</v>

603
00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.370
<v Speaker 2>If someone just gets a deep grab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

604
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:13.960
<v Speaker 2>what are you thinking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twist.</v>

605
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to have a fight with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone,</v>

606
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you would have to in a deep </v>

607
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.421
<v Speaker 2>disagreement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to wrestle that sucker loose </v>

608
00:31:24.421 --> 00:31:27.070
<v Speaker 2>and take it off to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to indulge this,</v>

609
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:28.850
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should.</v>

610
00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.740
<v Speaker 2>That's my own personal problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like someone with a tie on,</v>

611
00:31:32.741 --> 00:31:35.440
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do is grab that thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a wrap.</v>

612
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:38.500
<v Speaker 2>Like if you went into a Jujitsu match </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you had a rope around your neck,</v>

613
00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:40.030
<v Speaker 2>your Jujitsu practitioner,</v>

621
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.310
<v Speaker 2>reason I've come back to the gate is I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can quite tasty with the gay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>couple moves.</v>

623

<v Speaker 2>gay.</v>

625
00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:21.180

<v Speaker 2>which somehow elegantly segues from the </v>

626
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:25.681
<v Speaker 2>tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm all about creating what I </v>

<v Speaker 2>bottom of your gay.</v>

628
00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Turning that into a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're one of those guys that pull </v>

629
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:31.620
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of that canyon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wraps up.</v>

630
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm that guy out there and I played this</v>
<v Speaker 2>game for a long time,</v>

631
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.710
<v Speaker 2>which is the wrapping around the wrist </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

632
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.710
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so your arms out of action.</v>

635
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.830

<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

<v Speaker 1>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking like towards is on the </v>

638
00:32:54.821 --> 00:32:57.551
<v Speaker 1>inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside crack of his elbow and once it </v>

639
00:32:57.551 --> 00:32:57.551
<v Speaker 1>comes in the inside</v>

640
00:32:57.551 --> 00:32:59.630
<v Speaker 2>you can't get that hand out again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

641
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Basically the font server from the,</v>

644
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.060
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should have a little roller on it.</v>

645
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This job.</v>

646
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.710
<v Speaker 1>How long have you been trained?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In?</v>

647
00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Twenty years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about 20 years from Enza.</v>

648
00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's legit man.</v>

649
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:21.850
<v Speaker 1>That's seriously legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think most people know that </v>

650
00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:21.850
<v Speaker 1>you've managed to keep that on the dl?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit?</v>

651
00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so much,</v>

652
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.760
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

653
00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I think if you asked the average person </v>
<v Speaker 1>the street,</v>

654
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.430
<v Speaker 1>this Guy Ritchie a black belt in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

655
00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.600
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

656
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.140
<v Speaker 1>but just the average man in the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no black belt in Jujitsu is anyway.</v>

657
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I think they do now more than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

658
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.040
<v Speaker 1>probably more now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

659
00:33:38.041 --> 00:33:40.830
<v Speaker 1>that's why when I see a guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced as you were in a tie,</v>

660
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.100
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

661
00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just super confident about no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to get to that time.</v>

662
00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Joe was scaring off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

663
00:33:47.851 --> 00:33:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm a ridiculous person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on.</v>

664
00:33:49.681 --> 00:33:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your own ridiculous ideas about</v>

665
00:33:51.931 --> 00:33:53.580
<v Speaker 1>owning suits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my ideas.</v>

666
00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Ideas about getting choked to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing a tie.</v>

667
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to indulge your fishing.</v>

668
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.760
<v Speaker 1>I love fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm honestly,</v>

669
00:34:02.761 --> 00:34:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do have an issue with ties.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it looks wonderful on you.</v>

672
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.470

<v Speaker 1>it's very elegant appearance,</v>

673
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.030
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing from the top to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>

<v Speaker 2>for a long time.</v>

689
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:55.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fancy the idea that because if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>stayed with karate I realized I would </v>

690
00:34:56.081 --> 00:34:58.990
<v Speaker 2>not be on the mat at 84.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

691
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.110
<v Speaker 2>and back then there was no Jujitsu in </v>
<v Speaker 2>London.</v>

692
00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:05.260
<v Speaker 2>That was judo and they had what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the Waza,</v>

693
00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.080
<v Speaker 2>which is the ground game and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty tasty.</v>

694
00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.760
<v Speaker 2>We got some good judo players.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

695
00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:15.840
<v Speaker 2>so I went from crotty to judo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was only interested in the ground </v>

696
00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.991
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Roger Gracie came to live in </v>

697
00:35:18.991 --> 00:35:21.811
<v Speaker 2>the UK about 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Roger Gracie went onto become the </v>

698
00:35:21.811 --> 00:35:26.551
<v Speaker 2>world champion eight times and I started</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking lessons with him and his Dad </v>

699
00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Maricio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I ended up in New York for,</v>

700
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:34.190
<v Speaker 2>I think we lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived in New York for awhile.</v>

701
00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:39.350
<v Speaker 2>My ex wife and I went to the Zos gym </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it was above the Methadone clinic </v>

702
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:45.890
<v Speaker 2>and I fell in love with pencil and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>fell in love with Jujitsu in a sort of </v>

703
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:50.630
<v Speaker 2>serious way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I became obsessed with it for a </v>

704
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Speaker 2>number of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hence I get me a lot belts.</v>

705
00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:52.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

706
00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean I should've got black belt 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

707
00:35:54.971 --> 00:35:57.280
<v Speaker 2>I say I should've got a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

708
00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became lazy to a degree.</v>

709
00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.480
<v Speaker 2>So I've got a black belt when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>should've got a black belt.</v>

710
00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.090
<v Speaker 2>And as you and I know there's some tasty</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue belts out there,</v>

711
00:36:04.091 --> 00:36:06.940
<v Speaker 2>can I have a lot of fun with me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

712
00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.340
<v Speaker 2>but I sort of drifted a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came in and out,</v>

713
00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.810
<v Speaker 2>sustained a few injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I was training hard,</v>

714
00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.570
<v Speaker 2>you train hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get black pound five years on you,</v>

715
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:20.140
<v Speaker 1>you got to be obsessed with kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

716
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.660
<v Speaker 1>the kids are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

717
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a brown belt for eight years,</v>

718
00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.220
<v Speaker 1>so he talked to them and I know that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as you.</v>

719
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.950
<v Speaker 1>I was praying about for eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a.</v>

720
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.400
<v Speaker 1>If you're a real fanatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could get it in five years,</v>

721
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:35.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's super rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Bj Penn got it in three.</v>

722
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.480
<v Speaker 1>That's almost unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few people that</v>

723
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:38.420
<v Speaker 2>done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

724
00:36:38.421 --> 00:36:43.010
<v Speaker 2>There's some guys in our gym in London </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Roger's place that they're there five</v>

725
00:36:43.011 --> 00:36:44.390
<v Speaker 2>days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three hours a day.</v>

726
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:49.130
<v Speaker 2>They mean it and within six months </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're at proper pain in the ass.</v>

727
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

728
00:36:50.311 --> 00:36:55.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you become obsessed with the </v>

729
00:36:55.311 --> 00:36:55.311
<v Speaker 1>movements and you start studying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>various positions and the possibilities,</v>

730
00:36:55.311 --> 00:36:57.930
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a part of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a part of your.</v>

731
00:36:57.931 --> 00:37:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Almost like your your operating system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you see these guys reinforce that</v>

732
00:37:02.401 --> 00:37:03.790
<v Speaker 1>operating system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see their,</v>

733
00:37:03.791 --> 00:37:06.390
<v Speaker 1>their game becoming more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex and the beetle,</v>

734
00:37:06.391 --> 00:37:10.890
<v Speaker 1>that chain attack after attack and being</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to anticipate the defenses of those</v>

735
00:37:10.891 --> 00:37:14.160
<v Speaker 1>attacks and plan two and three steps </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead and you see all this play out.</v>

736
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 1>It's an uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may I,</v>

737
00:37:15.211 --> 00:37:20.211
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really enjoy watching someone go from </v>

738
00:37:20.211 --> 00:37:20.340
<v Speaker 1>being a beginning student to being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>killer.</v>

739
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:25.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating process because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are literally watching someone develop </v>

740
00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:30.140
<v Speaker 1>their comprehension of a language of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting and that language of fighting </v>

741
00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:34.431
<v Speaker 1>is analogous to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps them in every single aspect of </v>

742
00:37:34.431 --> 00:37:38.181
<v Speaker 1>their life because it's one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult things that a person will do </v>

743
00:37:38.181 --> 00:37:38.181
<v Speaker 1>in their day.</v>

744
00:37:38.181 --> 00:37:38.950
<v Speaker 1>When you walk into a Jujitsu school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

745
00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:44.010
<v Speaker 1>you park your car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in this normal realm of normal </v>

746
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:45.900
<v Speaker 1>people with normal problems and bills </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stresses and issues.</v>

747
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:51.110
<v Speaker 1>But once you go into that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he put on that Gi or no gi or whatever </v>

748
00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:51.270
<v Speaker 1>you're doing and you'd go into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

749
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.450
<v Speaker 1>Once you engage in these sparring </v>
<v Speaker 1>sessions,</v>

750
00:37:54.451 --> 00:37:58.140
<v Speaker 1>he's sparring sessions with skilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>practitioners.</v>

751
00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:00.150
<v Speaker 1>You're doing one of the most difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

752
00:38:00.151 --> 00:38:05.151
<v Speaker 1>Any person within a hundred mile radius </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you that's not fighting for their </v>

753
00:38:05.151 --> 00:38:07.230
<v Speaker 1>life is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by doing that on a regular basis and</v>

754
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:12.530
<v Speaker 1>constantly reinforcing this language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it enhances the all your possibilities </v>

755
00:38:12.931 --> 00:38:15.360
<v Speaker 1>and your potential possibilities as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

756
00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Very eloquent comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't,</v>

757
00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:24.180
<v Speaker 2>couldn't agree with you more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the great things I found about </v>

758
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.641
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is whenever I came to a city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just tap into a computer where the </v>

759
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.220
<v Speaker 2>next Jim was and we wrote down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually,</v>

760
00:38:30.221 --> 00:38:32.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually with two or three people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been out there.</v>

761
00:38:32.051 --> 00:38:34.170
<v Speaker 2>He's also a black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

762
00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a chaplet.</v>

763
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with called bobby the tits,</v>

764
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:42.480
<v Speaker 2>who was an Olympic judo player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can usually say the chest on this </v>

765
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.601
<v Speaker 2>gaze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least that's why I'm so across </v>

766
00:38:47.131 --> 00:38:48.730
<v Speaker 2>through and Ivan the terrible and bobby </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tits.</v>

767
00:38:48.731 --> 00:38:53.230
<v Speaker 2>We used to hit these gyms and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone,</v>

768
00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.460
<v Speaker 2>there's a guest complete substructure </v>
<v Speaker 2>thereof.</v>

769
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.570
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be looked after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll give you a gap fellow mate as it</v>

770
00:38:58.571 --> 00:39:03.571
<v Speaker 2>going into the Brotherhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it's probably the same for </v>

771
00:39:03.571 --> 00:39:03.571
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to church,</v>

772
00:39:03.571 --> 00:39:07.051
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a brotherhood that I found </v>

773
00:39:07.051 --> 00:39:09.721
<v Speaker 2>amongst fighters where everyone's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>game and friendly come around at the </v>

774
00:39:09.721 --> 00:39:12.380
<v Speaker 2>barbecue and everyone's as whole sub </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure there that everyone will look </v>

775
00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:16.381
<v Speaker 2>after everyone else and I've never in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 20 years of fighting in different </v>

776
00:39:16.381 --> 00:39:19.960
<v Speaker 2>gyms have I lost my temper or I had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason to lose my temper.</v>

777
00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Is anyone ever been a bully?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people a bit clumsy got bit carried </v>

778
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.400
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's such a system of accountancy</v>

779
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:33.210
<v Speaker 2>that you can't get away with being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bully because there's always a bigger </v>

780
00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:34.270
<v Speaker 2>bullying and you know you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get found out and I liked that aspect of</v>

781
00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:35.830
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone gets found out.</v>

782
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially over time.</v>

783
00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're training consistently </v>

784
00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.760
<v Speaker 2>with really difficult trading partners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your characters going to be tested.</v>

785
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:46.690
<v Speaker 2>There's just nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing.</v>

786
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:51.720
<v Speaker 2>There's no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes I ended up training quite </v>

787
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:51.720
<v Speaker 2>a lot in at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

788
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:52.570
<v Speaker 2>I got five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six mates to come around there.</v>

789
00:39:52.571 --> 00:39:56.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same as going to a new gym </v>
<v Speaker 2>with new players.</v>

790
00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've got to get out there.</v>

791
00:39:58.391 --> 00:40:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I know a few rich guys that have got </v>
<v Speaker 2>trainers and they not bad players,</v>

792
00:40:02.591 --> 00:40:05.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the train is good and the is a good,</v>

793
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:11.400
<v Speaker 2>but because they don't get outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their comfort zone and go to a federal </v>

794
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.841
<v Speaker 2>jim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim on the street there that it's very </v>

795
00:40:15.841 --> 00:40:17.050
<v Speaker 2>hard for them to really evolve.</v>

796
00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to keep putting yourself in an </v>

797
00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:22.480
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable spot in uncomfortable gyms</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

798
00:40:22.481 --> 00:40:24.280
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do that though,</v>

799
00:40:24.281 --> 00:40:27.460
<v Speaker 2>you do see the kind of the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again.</v>

800
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.620
<v Speaker 2>The same type of human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

801
00:40:29.621 --> 00:40:33.130
<v Speaker 2>you just see them in London or you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in New York or Los Angeles.</v>

802
00:40:33.131 --> 00:40:38.131
<v Speaker 2>You see that same type of human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the great thing about a sport in </v>

803
00:40:38.131 --> 00:40:42.331
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's be specific because it's </v>

804
00:40:42.331 --> 00:40:43.810
<v Speaker 2>something that you and I can relate to </v>
<v Speaker 2>is there are no barriers in Jujitsu.</v>

805
00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.760
<v Speaker 2>No one's looking at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're poor,</v>

806
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:46.480
<v Speaker 2>you're black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're white.</v>

807
00:40:46.481 --> 00:40:51.481
<v Speaker 2>It's completely irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You come to the mat and if you get on </v>

808
00:40:51.481 --> 00:40:51.481
<v Speaker 2>with the gays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fight,</v>

809
00:40:51.481 --> 00:40:52.210
<v Speaker 2>you get on with the gaze that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

810
00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a complete clarity of vision</v>

811
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.270
<v Speaker 2>when you fighting so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just finding them and then you rate them</v>

812
00:40:58.271 --> 00:40:59.590
<v Speaker 2>on their ability of how they fight.</v>

813
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you carry that social hierarchy,</v>

814
00:41:02.291 --> 00:41:07.291
<v Speaker 2>like what the wood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's important in that school is that </v>

815
00:41:07.291 --> 00:41:11.970
<v Speaker 2>it is like who is proficient?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is very good that that's the best </v>

816
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.140
<v Speaker 2>currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ultimate currency.</v>

817
00:41:13.141 --> 00:41:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

818
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:14.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

819
00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:19.590
<v Speaker 2>I had a name when I used to train out </v>
<v Speaker 2>here or in New York that they used to </v>

820
00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.940
<v Speaker 2>call me Hollywood because I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said Liberty it person that you come</v>

821
00:41:21.941 --> 00:41:22.500
<v Speaker 2>in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

822
00:41:22.501 --> 00:41:24.070
<v Speaker 2>well I only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you find that it roll around?</v>

823
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:26.410
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

824
00:41:26.411 --> 00:41:28.210
<v Speaker 2>in a couple of people initially went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

825
00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:33.220
<v Speaker 2>that gazer and that lasted all of 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds and then everything gets washed.</v>

826
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Can you have no currency on the map </v>
<v Speaker 2>other than your currency on the mat?</v>

827
00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:40.070
<v Speaker 2>And there's a wonderful clarity in that.</v>

828
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:45.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For a guy like you or any any big time </v>

829
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:47.941
<v Speaker 3>celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably one of the only few </v>

830
00:41:47.941 --> 00:41:47.941
<v Speaker 3>places where you really truly </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced that,</v>

831
00:41:47.941 --> 00:41:52.090
<v Speaker 3>like there's no bullshit in that role,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in someone's going after you and </v>

832
00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:53.800
<v Speaker 3>you're going after them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 100 percent.</v>

833
00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:54.810
<v Speaker 3>It is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

834
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.330
<v Speaker 3>there's all the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

835
00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:59.590
<v Speaker 3>the bullshit veil of society has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>removed.</v>

836
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean on Monday the water a bit now.</v>

837
00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:08.150
<v Speaker 2>So harking back to what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about previously,</v>

838
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:13.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm aware that you become less </v>
<v Speaker 2>adventurous as your ego grows in </v>

839
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

840
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Particularly with the guy that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>tap tap.</v>

841
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:24.610
<v Speaker 2>You don't ever want to be the guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't tap and you hung up when you </v>

842
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:25.970
<v Speaker 2>become a boring fighter and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

843
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:31.300
<v Speaker 2>You know those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of guys that I can </v>

844
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.631
<v Speaker 2>think of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One in particular that if you get the </v>

845
00:42:34.631 --> 00:42:34.631
<v Speaker 2>better of him and by and large is better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than me,</v>

846
00:42:34.631 --> 00:42:37.950
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden you realize is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble just before I'm about to tap.</v>

847
00:42:37.951 --> 00:42:38.620
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

848
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.830
<v Speaker 2>stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once I go.</v>

849
00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.450
<v Speaker 2>If you just moved a little bit to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>instruction,</v>

850
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:48.470
<v Speaker 2>those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their alibi to get out them </v>

851
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.610
<v Speaker 2>losing face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what phase is it they're losing is </v>

852
00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:54.760
<v Speaker 2>the crutch that they actually think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a Jujitsu player has an identity </v>

853
00:42:56.181 --> 00:42:57.140
<v Speaker 2>in itself and it doesn't.</v>

854
00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.860
<v Speaker 2>You cannot use it as a crutch and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the essence of all martial arts.</v>

855
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Martial arts was about find yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>within that framework and be honest </v>

856
00:43:07.101 --> 00:43:12.101
<v Speaker 2>about it and you meet the opponent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his condo will tell you you're finding </v>

857
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:18.250
<v Speaker 2>it's about you fighting you in the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What your other part of the mind to the </v>

858
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:23.711
<v Speaker 2>other bottom on that we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about once I say it's about your </v>

859
00:43:23.711 --> 00:43:24.910
<v Speaker 2>reputation in the gym and what people </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of it.</v>

860
00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to find an identity from </v>

861
00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.441
<v Speaker 2>outside of yourself by not tapping and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that feeling and by the way I </v>

862
00:43:32.441 --> 00:43:33.320
<v Speaker 2>suffered myself because I didn't like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tap either,</v>

863
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:35.300
<v Speaker 2>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes my game.</v>

864
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:38.210
<v Speaker 2>It inhibits my game and it stops me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being creative.</v>

865
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.240
<v Speaker 3>Marcella Garcia has always been very </v>
<v Speaker 3>adamant about that,</v>

866
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:46.270
<v Speaker 3>that you have to open up your game in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the gym and it's the only way to really </v>

867
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:47.600
<v Speaker 3>truly progress and don't worry about </v>
<v Speaker 3>being tapped and don't have that ego and</v>

868
00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:52.070
<v Speaker 3>there's a great video of him and Damien </v>
<v Speaker 3>Maia Rolling and they're rolling.</v>

869
00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.910
<v Speaker 3>They have like they're putting almost no</v>
<v Speaker 3>like kinetic strength,</v>

870
00:43:55.911 --> 00:43:57.890
<v Speaker 3>no explosive energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>

871
00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.270
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing athletic.</v>

872
00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:04.450
<v Speaker 3>They're just going through the movements</v>
<v Speaker 3>and exchanging positions and they're </v>

873
00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.320
<v Speaker 3>tapping each other left and right and </v>
<v Speaker 3>left and right with no ego.</v>

874
00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:11.380
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting to watch because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see like Marcello Catch Damien and </v>

875
00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:15.911
<v Speaker 3>they brought to a position and Damien </v>
<v Speaker 3>taps and then they go through another </v>

876
00:44:15.911 --> 00:44:15.911
<v Speaker 3>position and Marcello does it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>

877
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:19.280
<v Speaker 3>It's really fascinating because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing they're truly flowing.</v>

878
00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.320
<v Speaker 3>There's no like real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh here we go right there.</v>

879
00:44:21.321 --> 00:44:24.500
<v Speaker 3>You can see them do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like when these guys would do it,</v>

880
00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:29.501
<v Speaker 3>like as they're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're obviously using strength and </v>

881
00:44:29.501 --> 00:44:32.501
<v Speaker 3>they're countering with skill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everything is very smooth</v>

882
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:37.580
<v Speaker 1>and controlled and you're looking at two</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the very best black belts to ever do </v>

883
00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:38.820
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at Damien Maia,</v>

884
00:44:38.821 --> 00:44:43.821
<v Speaker 1>who right now is arguably the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>contender in the UFC welterweight </v>

885
00:44:43.821 --> 00:44:47.841
<v Speaker 1>division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be fighting Jorge Mas </v>

886
00:44:47.841 --> 00:44:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Vidar next weekend actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really intense fight because </v>

887
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:53.980
<v Speaker 1>monster killer and then Marcello Garcia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's probably one of the all time great</v>

888
00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:56.880
<v Speaker 1>strangulation experts has ever walked </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face of the planet.</v>

889
00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:02.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really revolutionized a lot of </v>

890
00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:04.161
<v Speaker 1>aspects of the good team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rear naked choke and I was in </v>

891
00:45:04.161 --> 00:45:07.851
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Sao Paulo in 2003 when he burst onto </v>

892
00:45:07.851 --> 00:45:09.340
<v Speaker 1>the scene when he choked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chao Lin.</v>

893
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:15.230
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see these two guys rolling together </v>

894
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:18.201
<v Speaker 1>is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting because this is </v>

895
00:45:18.201 --> 00:45:18.201
<v Speaker 1>really kind of how you have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just do it.</v>

896
00:45:18.201 --> 00:45:18.201
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

897
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.420
<v Speaker 1>there's no one is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tap,</v>

898
00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

899
00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:27.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't put myself in a bad position </v>

900
00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.271
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're exchanging positions to like </v>

901
00:45:29.271 --> 00:45:31.311
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Damian gets under hooks and these </v>

902
00:45:31.311 --> 00:45:31.311
<v Speaker 1>goes for the deep half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marcel was just rolling with it.</v>

903
00:45:31.311 --> 00:45:32.470
<v Speaker 1>They're just flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

904
00:45:32.471 --> 00:45:36.650
<v Speaker 1>but you need two to tango.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have one with an ego and who's</v>

905
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.390
<v Speaker 1>not going to play the game and bunkers </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and screws himself down.</v>

906
00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.280
<v Speaker 1>It makes the whole thing very hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

907
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.020
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You both got to be complicit.</v>

908
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

909
00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:45.540
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

910
00:45:45.541 --> 00:45:50.541
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting watching like to </v>

911
00:45:50.541 --> 00:45:51.390
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really high level guys like this role or</v>

912
00:45:51.391 --> 00:45:56.391
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydro Gracie and Braulio a steamer or </v>

913
00:45:56.391 --> 00:45:59.721
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>England's got a great scene and there's </v>

914
00:45:59.721 --> 00:46:01.110
<v Speaker 1>so much top level Jujitsu over in </v>
<v Speaker 1>England right now.</v>

915
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:02.430
<v Speaker 1>It's go some good players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

916
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:07.610
<v Speaker 1>He used to be a time just a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades ago where if you wanted to </v>

917
00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:11.411
<v Speaker 1>train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very difficult to find really </v>

918
00:46:11.411 --> 00:46:12.370
<v Speaker 1>proficient instruction and groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>training part 20 years ago.</v>

919
00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember because I was first into it </v>

920
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 1>when we made snatch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 18 years ago,</v>

921
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:20.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how'd you first came to town?</v>

922
00:46:20.161 --> 00:46:23.130
<v Speaker 1>And before then it was just you to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Waza yeah.</v>

923
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can certainly get something </v>

924
00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:28.280
<v Speaker 1>out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

925
00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:32.120
<v Speaker 1>it seems like the level of A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some people that have </v>

926
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:37.041
<v Speaker 1>just one rock solid attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Rhonda Rousey at that rock solid </v>

927
00:46:37.041 --> 00:46:38.310
<v Speaker 1>attack with the arm bar and she comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that judo background.</v>

928
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a Jambo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

929
00:46:40.261 --> 00:46:42.840
<v Speaker 1>it's nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her arm bar to this day I believe is one</v>

930
00:46:42.841 --> 00:46:45.660
<v Speaker 1>of the best arm bars I've ever seen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mma.</v>

931
00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Not just because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

932
00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:50.250
<v Speaker 1>she's successful with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you watch her transitions,</v>

933
00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:52.420
<v Speaker 1>you watch how she's able to adjust and </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

934
00:46:52.421 --> 00:46:55.230
<v Speaker 1>And like the cat Zingano fight is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect example of that.</v>

935
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Cat Zingano just charges out or like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking bat out of hell.</v>

936
00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:02.450
<v Speaker 1>And they have this mad scramble and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda realizes a position that she's,</v>

937
00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.460
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't even utilize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's,</v>

938
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.330
<v Speaker 1>she understands armbar so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knows what.</v>

939
00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:12.340
<v Speaker 1>I could just throw my hip over this way </v>
<v Speaker 1>and kick back here and I'll catch that </v>

940
00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.921
<v Speaker 1>arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just overall understanding of </v>

941
00:47:15.921 --> 00:47:16.770
<v Speaker 1>the position is so high level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

942
00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:22.730
<v Speaker 1>When someone has a movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I used to find a bit with a Hickson </v>

943
00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:28.260
<v Speaker 1>and Hixon use that thing where he ties </v>
<v Speaker 1>his hands behind his back and you try </v>

944
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.970
<v Speaker 1>and do something to it and you can't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to</v>

945
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:35.260
<v Speaker 2>the level of sophistication when it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

946
00:47:35.261 --> 00:47:35.940
<v Speaker 2>He's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

947
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.430
<v Speaker 2>so technical hixon that it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

948
00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.960
<v Speaker 2>what I understand about Jujitsu is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really rather primitive.</v>

949
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm aware I'm primitive and I'm </v>

950
00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:53.200
<v Speaker 2>aware that my understanding of Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>is really quite primitive.</v>

951
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:58.500
<v Speaker 2>And then when you see something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that arm bar come sneaking out of </v>

952
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.330
<v Speaker 2>nowhere always said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a magnificent thing to behold,</v>

953
00:48:01.331 --> 00:48:02.310
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

954
00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The when and what you're saying is kind </v>

955
00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:07.920
<v Speaker 2>of interesting because that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to this and go,</v>

956
00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.520
<v Speaker 2>how has a black belt primitive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you not primitive?</v>

957
00:48:09.521 --> 00:48:14.521
<v Speaker 2>You're an expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I understand totally because I'm </v>

958
00:48:14.521 --> 00:48:14.650
<v Speaker 2>also primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

959
00:48:14.651 --> 00:48:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I know what I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I understand like there's what,</v>

960
00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:23.020
<v Speaker 2>what Hickson's languages is a series of </v>
<v Speaker 2>words that you've never heard before,</v>

961
00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:28.141
<v Speaker 2>spoken perfectly in the right order with</v>
<v Speaker 2>no pauses or ums or no filler and the </v>

962
00:48:29.411 --> 00:48:31.480
<v Speaker 2>way he flows with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

963
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:36.510
<v Speaker 2>he's got a level of proficiency that </v>
<v Speaker 2>very few other than Marcello and Damien </v>

964
00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Maia can really appreciate the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the true beauty of it all because they </v>

965
00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:42.160
<v Speaker 2>just don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't,</v>

966
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.280
<v Speaker 2>I won't see things coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be there.</v>

967
00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.570
<v Speaker 2>They're too complex as it's completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different language.</v>

968
00:48:46.571 --> 00:48:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

969
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.420
<v Speaker 2>But you know enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm already good lines on my,</v>

970
00:48:50.421 --> 00:48:53.350
<v Speaker 2>the other day that someone had enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>brains to know that they didn't have any</v>

971
00:48:53.351 --> 00:48:55.960
<v Speaker 2>brains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

972
00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:01.540
<v Speaker 2>so you know enough to know that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>in treacherous in deep waters here.</v>

973
00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>

974
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:08.160
<v Speaker 2>your average gazes styles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>styles running around with one of these </v>

975
00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.150
<v Speaker 2>good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad guys,</v>

976
00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.140
<v Speaker 2>jovial guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be the same.</v>

977
00:49:11.141 --> 00:49:13.180
<v Speaker 2>They got the same color belt on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's have a go with that.</v>

978
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

979
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just get manhandled now.</v>

980
00:49:18.251 --> 00:49:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said you had your knee fixed,</v>

981
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.870
<v Speaker 2>you a blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you blow out an acl acl?</v>

982
00:49:22.871 --> 00:49:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Done it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

983
00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Did you get um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cadaver replacement or no?</v>

984
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Hamstring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Patella hamstrings,</v>

985
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:32.010
<v Speaker 2>patella second to task stream blew out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

986
00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things blow out a lot.</v>

987
00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:34.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

988
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Eventually gave in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the first one that was about 21.</v>

989
00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the second one down was about </v>

990
00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:42.210
<v Speaker 2>31 and it was held together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they own needs a bit knackered.</v>

991
00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Do you know about stem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

992
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:46.960
<v Speaker 2>How are you feeling about the great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was that close to shoulder surgery and</v>

993
00:49:46.961 --> 00:49:50.650
<v Speaker 2>I had some placental stem cells shot </v>
<v Speaker 2>into my shoulder and it's amazing.</v>

994
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.660
<v Speaker 2>And where did you have that done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas.</v>

995
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:53.740
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

996
00:49:53.741 --> 00:49:57.400
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy named Dr Rodney Mcgee was </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the tip of the spear when it comes to</v>

997
00:49:57.401 --> 00:49:59.690
<v Speaker 2>the technology that's involved today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the issue?</v>

998
00:49:59.691 --> 00:50:02.650
<v Speaker 2>And to show the punch of tears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just stuff,</v>

999
00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.550
<v Speaker 2>just years and years of abuse at my </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartilage is gone on the shoulder now.</v>

1000
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:11.551
<v Speaker 2>My college has gone on the knee and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't really know anything about stem </v>

1001
00:50:11.551 --> 00:50:12.730
<v Speaker 2>cell about two weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now that's what I'm hearing about.</v>

1002
00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I have a podcast.</v>

1003
00:50:14.291 --> 00:50:19.291
<v Speaker 2>I'll send you and it was me and Dr </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda Magee that we did about a month </v>

1004
00:50:19.291 --> 00:50:19.390
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fabulous.</v>

1005
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:24.750
<v Speaker 2>He's amazing and again he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's well up to date with the latest </v>

1006
00:50:25.091 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 2>technology and he's also very </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative in his approach to it,</v>

1007
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:33.130
<v Speaker 1>but what he's saying is that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to regenerate cartilage and </v>

1008
00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:37.121
<v Speaker 1>meniscus tissue and this is the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time anything has ever come along that </v>

1009
00:50:37.121 --> 00:50:40.721
<v Speaker 1>actually regenerates these tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been able to trim it and do </v>

1010
00:50:40.721 --> 00:50:43.991
<v Speaker 1>things to it to mitigate pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now they can literally regenerate </v>

1011
00:50:43.991 --> 00:50:45.860
<v Speaker 1>tissue there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even injecting it into people's discs.</v>

1012
00:50:45.861 --> 00:50:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Now the discs in the spine and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that they can regrow disc tissue</v>

1013
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:54.080
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've just nailed my three issues.</v>

1014
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.610
<v Speaker 1>This issue and cartilage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1015
00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:01.540
<v Speaker 1>that's the only issue is of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>meniscus and cartilage and disk and what</v>

1016
00:51:01.541 --> 00:51:06.541
<v Speaker 1>have you got going on with your back is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the traditional issue with those three </v>

1017
00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.200
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the ankles at the bottom of the</v>

1018
00:51:09.201 --> 00:51:14.201
<v Speaker 1>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you something else </v>

1019
00:51:14.201 --> 00:51:14.201
<v Speaker 1>that you're gonna need and you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get after we have this conversation.</v>

1020
00:51:14.201 --> 00:51:17.630
<v Speaker 1>I have a machine out back called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse hyper and it was created by this</v>

1021
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:22.930
<v Speaker 1>mad genius named Louie Simmons and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reverse hypers and machine that </v>

1022
00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.580
<v Speaker 1>decompresses your back and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengthens at the same time.</v>

1023
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.880
<v Speaker 1>It decompresses it on the downswing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then on the upswing it,</v>

1024
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:32.120
<v Speaker 1>it strengthens all those muscles around </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1025
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:36.260
<v Speaker 1>but it literally pulls the back apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the compressed discs,</v>

1026
00:51:36.261 --> 00:51:40.610
<v Speaker 1>which is bad posture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>load a generation.</v>

1027
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:41.840
<v Speaker 1>You can look up at the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1028
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:47.170
<v Speaker 1>this guy's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the craziest people I've </v>

1029
00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:50.231
<v Speaker 1>ever interviewed who was hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a old time power lifter has </v>

1030
00:51:50.231 --> 00:51:51.770
<v Speaker 1>been doing it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's got fake shoulders,</v>

1031
00:51:51.771 --> 00:51:53.810
<v Speaker 1>fake knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's blown out.</v>

1032
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.050
<v Speaker 1>He has no biceps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Biceps are completely severed off of his</v>

1033
00:51:57.051 --> 00:51:58.010
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

1034
00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.840
<v Speaker 1>What was he saying like He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

1035
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:04.900
<v Speaker 1>he had his friends were making a Max out</v>
<v Speaker 1>bench like five days after his shoulder </v>

1036
00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:05.540
<v Speaker 1>replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking maniac,</v>

1037
00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:10.810
<v Speaker 1>but they were trying to fuse his discs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he came up with this machine and </v>

1038
00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:13.190
<v Speaker 1>you see as it swings down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she's swinging down,</v>

1039
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:15.860
<v Speaker 1>it's pulling her back apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like go to the.</v>

1040
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Here you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it's going down,</v>

1041
00:52:17.751 --> 00:52:22.751
<v Speaker 1>it's pulling the back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an active decompression and as she's </v>

1042
00:52:22.751 --> 00:52:24.770
<v Speaker 1>swinging up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's strengthening all those muscles in</v>

1043
00:52:24.771 --> 00:52:28.550
<v Speaker 1>the spine in a real weird way where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really can't get at them.</v>

1044
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:30.720
<v Speaker 1>And was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the efficient because you can do</v>

1045
00:52:30.721 --> 00:52:32.900
<v Speaker 1>the suit might superficially I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling there,</v>

1046
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:37.250
<v Speaker 1>but the coal underneath the superficial </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles to had the MRI.</v>

1047
00:52:37.251 --> 00:52:41.590
<v Speaker 1>You could see all the fat in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounding muscle,</v>

1048
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:46.690
<v Speaker 1>a muscle around the discs and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the fat in it and then as soon as </v>

1049
00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:47.930
<v Speaker 1>you hit the superficial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went,</v>

1050
00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:48.560
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fun.</v>

1051
00:52:48.561 --> 00:52:49.850
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>superficial,</v>

1052
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.360
<v Speaker 1>so it's a need away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot this year.</v>

1053
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Just buy one of those men were you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to beast through.</v>

1054
00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:00.230
<v Speaker 1>You'll superficial muscles to get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your colon muscles.</v>

1055
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just it.</v>

1056
00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:07.110
<v Speaker 1>It forces that area of the body to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're sustaining a load and you </v>

1057
00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:10.410
<v Speaker 1>can you lift it up and you hold it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that position and then as you let it go,</v>

1058
00:53:10.411 --> 00:53:15.411
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's decompressing and in the </v>

1059
00:53:15.411 --> 00:53:15.411
<v Speaker 1>decompressed cycle you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1060
00:53:15.411 --> 00:53:19.581
<v Speaker 1>you're feeling your muscles relaxed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually feel it pulling like </v>

1061
00:53:19.581 --> 00:53:21.170
<v Speaker 1>you feel in the lower back in a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1062
00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:26.380
<v Speaker 1>You feel it kind of polling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>separating and then a couple of seconds </v>

1063
00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:29.411
<v Speaker 1>later you're and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you pull the and separated and </v>

1064
00:53:29.411 --> 00:53:32.391
<v Speaker 1>you're strengthened again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I have another thing out back </v>

1065
00:53:32.391 --> 00:53:35.061
<v Speaker 1>that I bend over from the waist on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it allows my lower back to just </v>

1066
00:53:35.061 --> 00:53:39.891
<v Speaker 1>completely relax and my upper body pulls</v>
<v Speaker 1>down on my lower body and it separates </v>

1067
00:53:40.711 --> 00:53:42.870
<v Speaker 1>and decompresses the lower spine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1068
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:44.940
<v Speaker 1>it's been tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A huge,</v>

1069
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:49.941
<v Speaker 1>huge asset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of things they can </v>

1070
00:53:49.941 --> 00:53:49.941
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1071
00:53:49.941 --> 00:53:49.941
<v Speaker 1>If you heard a Regena cane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know what that is?</v>

1072
00:53:49.941 --> 00:53:50.280
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regena.</v>

1073
00:53:50.281 --> 00:53:55.281
<v Speaker 1>Kina is something that was developed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany that a lot of professional </v>

1074
00:53:55.281 --> 00:53:58.491
<v Speaker 1>athletes like coby Brian Mann and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>went over there and it's a blood </v>

1075
00:53:58.491 --> 00:54:00.240
<v Speaker 1>spinning procedures similar to platelet </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich plasma,</v>

1076
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:03.930
<v Speaker 1>but they take the blood and as they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>spinning it,</v>

1077
00:54:03.931 --> 00:54:06.210
<v Speaker 1>they heated it up and when they heat it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1078
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:11.430
<v Speaker 1>the blood has a reaction to the extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>heat like it thinks you have a fever,</v>

1079
00:54:11.431 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 1>so it produces is very intense anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory response.</v>

1080
00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Obviously if you're a scientist or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor,</v>

1081
00:54:17.101 --> 00:54:22.101
<v Speaker 1>I'm butchering this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they take this yellow serum </v>

1082
00:54:22.101 --> 00:54:24.150
<v Speaker 1>which is this an anti inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>response and they can inject it into all</v>

1083
00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:29.151
<v Speaker 1>these areas that you have massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation like bulging discs and it </v>

1084
00:54:29.151 --> 00:54:33.111
<v Speaker 1>has incredible effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had incredible effect for Peyton </v>

1085
00:54:33.111 --> 00:54:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Manning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed them to get back to football </v>

1086
00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.551
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a bulging disc that was making my </v>

1087
00:54:37.551 --> 00:54:39.741
<v Speaker 1>hands go numb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally went away through decompression </v>

1088
00:54:39.741 --> 00:54:40.170
<v Speaker 1>and through this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1089
00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.680
<v Speaker 1>I heard this added 10 years to Kobe's </v>
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

1090
00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Am I thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1091
00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.260
<v Speaker 1>that's what he thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1092
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:47.430
<v Speaker 1>she didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't up until I'm 48,</v>

1093
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:49.530
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 49,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 50.</v>

1094
00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't think about any of these </v>

1095
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:55.670
<v Speaker 1>things until this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I accepted a acl,</v>

1096
00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:56.580
<v Speaker 1>has bit of a nuisance</v>

1097
00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:02.360
<v Speaker 2>except the garb of a creaky bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the last month I went to my,</v>

1098
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:09.470
<v Speaker 2>something happened to my knee and I went</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the doctor a little a x ray and he </v>

1099
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:12.160
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1100
00:55:12.161 --> 00:55:16.350
<v Speaker 2>it cut up right for the 10th time I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>had an operation on that knee,</v>

1101
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:22.280
<v Speaker 2>but you better off now waiting of </v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting for what to like if you knew </v>

1102
00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:25.950
<v Speaker 2>what a canal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's talking about a replacement.</v>

1103
00:55:25.951 --> 00:55:29.010
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about replacement now </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying just hold on.</v>

1104
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying in 15 years from now or</v>

1105
00:55:31.501 --> 00:55:34.350
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it all changed.</v>

1106
00:55:34.351 --> 00:55:36.180
<v Speaker 2>And then a month after I went and had </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shoulder,</v>

1107
00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:37.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>x,</v>

1108
00:55:37.111 --> 00:55:38.850
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he looked at it and went,</v>

1109
00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:41.190
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could operate under,</v>

1110
00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:46.320
<v Speaker 2>knew where we would go in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better apply until I give you a new </v>

1111
00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:46.320
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1112
00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.220
<v Speaker 2>now that Giza were</v>

1113
00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:52.720
<v Speaker 1>talking about fixing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>told you about giving me new ones right </v>

1114
00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:52.720
<v Speaker 1>now I hadn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1115
00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Ivan out there knows exactly what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

1116
00:55:55.700 --> 00:56:00.700
<v Speaker 1>To me the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't a vessel to receive this </v>

1117
00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:02.801
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in the last month I'm ready to </v>

1118
00:56:02.801 --> 00:56:07.721
<v Speaker 1>receive this information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the next three months I will know </v>

1119
00:56:07.721 --> 00:56:12.150
<v Speaker 1>of what you talk about immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to connect you with Dr Rodney </v>

1120
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Mcgee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as we get off the phone or off </v>

1121
00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.281
<v Speaker 1>the podcast here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to connect you with them and </v>

1122
00:56:18.281 --> 00:56:18.281
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll be able to keep you abreast of all</v>

1123
00:56:18.281 --> 00:56:20.150
<v Speaker 1>the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it changes constantly.</v>

1124
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Like when I first went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I first got a shot in July of last year</v>

1125
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:27.850
<v Speaker 3>and I was that close to surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to figure,</v>

1126
00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:29.350
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was planning my time.</v>

1127
00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:29.890
<v Speaker 3>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1128
00:56:29.891 --> 00:56:34.891
<v Speaker 3>if I get the surgery I essentially can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>use this arm for at least a few weeks </v>

1129
00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:37.240
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to be pretty weak for at </v>
<v Speaker 3>least three months.</v>

1130
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.910
<v Speaker 3>And I was really accepting that and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1131
00:56:39.911 --> 00:56:44.911
<v Speaker 3>well let's just give this a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And within a couple of weeks of getting </v>

1132
00:56:44.911 --> 00:56:44.911
<v Speaker 3>the shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1133
00:56:44.911 --> 00:56:49.500
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing feels better than it's ever </v>

1134
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:50.350
<v Speaker 3>felt before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so through a series of exercises,</v>

1135
00:56:50.351 --> 00:56:55.351
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of rotator cuff strengthening</v>
<v Speaker 3>exercises and I'm a bottoms up kettle </v>

1136
00:56:56.741 --> 00:57:01.741
<v Speaker 3>bells like where you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to stabilize the kettlebells </v>

1137
00:57:01.741 --> 00:57:01.741
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are those.</v>

1138
00:57:01.741 --> 00:57:02.620
<v Speaker 3>Those are fantastic for stabilization </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscles.</v>

1139
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:07.890
<v Speaker 3>And then it also made me realize that if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to do something along the </v>

1140
00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:07.960
<v Speaker 3>lines of Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1141
00:57:07.961 --> 00:57:10.960
<v Speaker 3>it's very physically demanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to strengthen your machine.</v>

1142
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.240
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just keep going to Jujitsu,</v>

1143
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:14.850
<v Speaker 3>which is what I was doing for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>

1144
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:17.770
<v Speaker 3>That was my exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's adequate.</v>

1145
00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:22.830
<v Speaker 3>I think you have to strengthen the </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine and I think yoga is also a </v>

1146
00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:26.220
<v Speaker 3>really big and important part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>strengthening that machine because it's </v>

1147
00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:29.920
<v Speaker 3>lengthening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decompressing the spine and it's making </v>

1148
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:33.040
<v Speaker 3>you strong in these static positions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very similar to the load that's</v>

1149
00:57:33.041 --> 00:57:36.810
<v Speaker 3>going to be pushed on those joints.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on your back when you're doing job</v>

1150
00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:39.370
<v Speaker 2>to a traunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go for a year.</v>

1151
00:57:39.371 --> 00:57:44.371
<v Speaker 2>I tried every day because usually I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get into anything at some point or </v>

1152
00:57:44.371 --> 00:57:44.371
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to keep throwing enough hours</v>

1153
00:57:44.371 --> 00:57:48.271
<v Speaker 2>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one thing I couldn't get into </v>

1154
00:57:48.271 --> 00:57:48.790
<v Speaker 2>couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe my approach was wrong.</v>

1155
00:57:48.791 --> 00:57:50.560
<v Speaker 2>I was doing the [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ex wife,</v>

1156
00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:54.220
<v Speaker 2>and it was incredibly painful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly challenging,</v>

1157
00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:58.300
<v Speaker 2>but while on come out and fight is </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive element of it,</v>

1158
00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.680
<v Speaker 2>there's my enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can have a role around.</v>

1159
00:58:00.681 --> 00:58:01.580
<v Speaker 2>With Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a tap,</v>

1160
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:06.600
<v Speaker 2>there's winners and losers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for some reason that keeps me </v>

1161
00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:06.600
<v Speaker 2>motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea,</v>

1162
00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:11.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean in essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine it's the what I was talking </v>

1163
00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:11.620
<v Speaker 2>about in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1164
00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.060
<v Speaker 2>it's self again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self.</v>

1165
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:18.510
<v Speaker 2>With Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just haven't made it that far to </v>

1166
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:22.530
<v Speaker 2>access that struggle and enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm always running on fumes </v>

1167
00:58:23.021 --> 00:58:23.530
<v Speaker 2>and yoga.</v>

1168
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:25.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you got to run on fumes,</v>

1169
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:27.340
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's building a house,</v>

1170
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:30.110
<v Speaker 3>one layer of paint at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's.</v>

1171
00:58:30.111 --> 00:58:32.920
<v Speaker 3>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not an easy thing to do and I think</v>

1172
00:58:32.921 --> 00:58:37.921
<v Speaker 3>that competitive element that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about is an internal struggle </v>

1173
00:58:37.921 --> 00:58:39.430
<v Speaker 3>and that internal struggle is you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your breath.</v>

1174
00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Keeping your breath and calm and check </v>
<v Speaker 3>and focusing entirely on your breath </v>

1175
00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:50.040
<v Speaker 3>while managing the positions and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>slowly but surely developing more </v>

1176
00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.240
<v Speaker 3>proficiency in those positions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More range of motion,</v>

1177
00:58:52.241 --> 00:58:57.241
<v Speaker 3>more dexterity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep going over and over again and then </v>

1178
00:58:57.241 --> 00:59:00.500
<v Speaker 3>one day you get to a point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me it was like maybe a year and a </v>

1179
00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:01.900
<v Speaker 3>half into doing it pretty regularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>while I'm like,</v>

1180
00:59:01.901 --> 00:59:05.170
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I can finally hold this position for</v>

1181
00:59:05.171 --> 00:59:10.171
<v Speaker 3>30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas before I would literally count </v>

1182
00:59:10.171 --> 00:59:12.670
<v Speaker 3>to 10 and just try to get to 10 and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd fall down and then I get back up and</v>

1183
00:59:12.671 --> 00:59:13.380
<v Speaker 3>try again.</v>

1184
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:16.210
<v Speaker 3>Try to get to 10 and try to get my feet </v>
<v Speaker 3>would buckle,</v>

1185
00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:19.450
<v Speaker 3>my knee wouldn't be locked out and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd try again.</v>

1186
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Once you develop a certain of </v>
<v Speaker 3>proficiency,</v>

1187
00:59:22.371 --> 00:59:27.371
<v Speaker 3>then you can concentrate entirely on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>breath and that's where the real </v>

1188
00:59:27.371 --> 00:59:29.570
<v Speaker 3>struggle is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then keeping the mind on track.</v>

1189
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:34.690
<v Speaker 3>Not Thinking about other bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now thinking about the just just the </v>

1190
00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:38.831
<v Speaker 3>struggle of life and all the different </v>
<v Speaker 3>variables that you have to deal with on </v>

1191
00:59:38.831 --> 00:59:38.990
<v Speaker 3>a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thinking only of the breath,</v>

1192
00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:44.170
<v Speaker 3>the posture and the breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult to keep on track so that </v>

1193
00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:45.260
<v Speaker 3>invariant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the competitive struggle.</v>

1194
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:46.160
<v Speaker 3>It's in your home.</v>

1195
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:49.490
<v Speaker 2>See a consistency with the theme though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That theme is this,</v>

1196
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:54.730
<v Speaker 2>that that's all there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the outside world of the noise and </v>

1197
00:59:54.730 --> 00:59:57.260
<v Speaker 2>what comes with that and there's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>internal self,</v>

1198
00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:02.770
<v Speaker 2>but everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is subject to these rules and</v>

1199
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:07.990
<v Speaker 2>yoga in this sense is no difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu's no different narrative is no </v>

1200
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:10.580
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's being aware of what the dynamic is.</v>

1201
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.560
<v Speaker 2>It's being aware of what's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

1202
01:00:12.561 --> 01:00:14.990
<v Speaker 2>That I think is fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1203
01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.580
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pattern recognition.</v>

1204
01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Recognizing that it's the same for yoga </v>
<v Speaker 2>is for the essence of a narrative.</v>

1205
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1206
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:27.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and those things become a vehicle for </v>

1207
01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:30.041
<v Speaker 3>developing your human potential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's yoga or whether it's </v>

1208
01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:32.711
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu and I think pattern recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's they take place in bold things in </v>

1209
01:00:32.711 --> 01:00:33.170
<v Speaker 3>yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>

1210
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.520
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been here before,</v>

1211
01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:36.230
<v Speaker 3>I know where this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I know what to do,</v>

1212
01:00:36.231 --> 01:00:39.530
<v Speaker 3>and you go right back into that thing of</v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on controlling the breath.</v>

1213
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.800
<v Speaker 3>These big long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep breaths and these big long exhales </v>

1214
01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.390
<v Speaker 3>and then the focus is entirely on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>breath and those patterns,</v>

1215
01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:51.050
<v Speaker 3>they come up in Jujitsu as well that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that ability to maintain breath.</v>

1216
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've recognized that in a </v>

1217
01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.420
<v Speaker 3>person who just starts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one of the things you see about </v>

1218
01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:58.420
<v Speaker 3>someone who's just starting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they're athletic,</v>

1219
01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.990
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They started hyperventilating.</v>

1220
01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.430
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start breathing weird and they.</v>

1221
01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:07.460
<v Speaker 3>The breath is like the first thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you lose control over and Hickson from </v>

1222
01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:11.651
<v Speaker 3>the movie choke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was the big thing that </v>

1223
01:01:11.651 --> 01:01:12.380
<v Speaker 3>separated Hickson from all the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu players is yoga.</v>

1224
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His Yoga.</v>

1225
01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:14.810
<v Speaker 2>He made yoga sexy.</v>

1226
01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1227
01:01:15.841 --> 01:01:16.260
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1228
01:01:16.261 --> 01:01:20.010
<v Speaker 3>he was the first guy to make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>appealing at all to martial artists.</v>

1229
01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was with your wife did.</v>

1230
01:01:21.631 --> 01:01:24.270
<v Speaker 3>That's what your mom does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what the housewives do.</v>

1231
01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.480
<v Speaker 3>It's not something that a man does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially not the top Jujitsu killer </v>

1232
01:01:29.761 --> 01:01:30.180
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

1233
01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:35.290
<v Speaker 2>It was a seminal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a seminal documentary that </v>

1234
01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:37.530
<v Speaker 2>changed a lot of people's lives and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of turned hixon into a rockstar.</v>

1235
01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1236
01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:40.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had him in here.</v>

1237
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.450
<v Speaker 3>He's an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an amazing guy to talk to.</v>

1238
01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:45.120
<v Speaker 3>I've had him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've talked to him several times,</v>

1239
01:01:45.121 --> 01:01:50.121
<v Speaker 3>but having him in here and sitting down </v>
<v Speaker 3>with him and talking to him about </v>

1240
01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:50.121
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1241
01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:52.800
<v Speaker 3>it's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like sitting down with Michelangelo</v>

1242
01:01:52.801 --> 01:01:57.801
<v Speaker 3>and talking about art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're talking about there's </v>

1243
01:01:57.801 --> 01:02:01.700
<v Speaker 3>masters and then there's the master of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the masters and if you talk to any </v>

1244
01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu master,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all just go.</v>

1245
01:02:02.581 --> 01:02:04.980
<v Speaker 3>Hixon is the number one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no dispute,</v>

1246
01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:08.100
<v Speaker 3>which is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's very few,</v>

1247
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:13.160
<v Speaker 3>like there's soccer players that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>just elite and there's basketball </v>

1248
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.200
<v Speaker 3>players that are elite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to like who's the best</v>

1249
01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 3>in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was always this one and while</v>

1250
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>he was competitive and especially while </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was young,</v>

1251
01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.320
<v Speaker 1>it was always Hixon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to me amazing that he was able </v>

1252
01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:31.191
<v Speaker 1>to maintain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the things about him </v>

1253
01:02:31.191 --> 01:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>was his physicality and his mind and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think those two things in many ways were</v>

1254
01:02:36.301 --> 01:02:41.301
<v Speaker 1>enhanced by yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got some disc issues now </v>

1255
01:02:41.301 --> 01:02:41.301
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has quite a few.</v>

1256
01:02:41.301 --> 01:02:42.000
<v Speaker 1>He has quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1257
01:02:42.001 --> 01:02:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I think he has eight bulging discs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is horrific.</v>

1258
01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should send him to your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1259
01:02:46.591 --> 01:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1260
01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to him about a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1261
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Hixon those are a bit reluctant for </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of treatment,</v>

1262
01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:54.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1263
01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:59.810
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just gonna eat mangoes and fucking </v>

1264
01:02:59.810 --> 01:02:59.810
<v Speaker 1>meditate and Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

1265
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1266
01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1267
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:04.710
<v Speaker 1>what he's tried or what he's willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try.</v>

1268
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:06.710
<v Speaker 1>But I would love to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1269
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see him rolling again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1270
01:03:08.161 --> 01:03:13.161
<v Speaker 1>that would be amazing if they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>regenerate this tissue to the point </v>

1271
01:03:13.161 --> 01:03:13.740
<v Speaker 1>where he would be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1272
01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>that's the fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fear for the first time for me is </v>

1273
01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.740
<v Speaker 1>that I've never felt any version of age </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the mat.</v>

1274
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:23.160
<v Speaker 1>But when people are starting to tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1275
01:03:23.161 --> 01:03:24.900
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna wait until we give you a new</v>

1276
01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1277
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:28.980
<v Speaker 1>What side of the this night and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying that about your knee,</v>

1278
01:03:28.981 --> 01:03:30.750
<v Speaker 1>what is the issue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a meniscus issue?</v>

1279
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a meniscus issue,</v>

1280
01:03:33.361 --> 01:03:36.420
<v Speaker 1>but I've lost 75 percent of the meniscus</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the cartilage.</v>

1281
01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I get confused between the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>cartilage or meniscus.</v>

1282
01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:43.020
<v Speaker 1>What is the different cartilage is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>covers the outside of the bone?</v>

1283
01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Meniscus has the padding essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in between the two bones that </v>

1284
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.990
<v Speaker 1>keeps them from touching each other.</v>

1285
01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1286
01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:53.130
<v Speaker 1>So they have both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it goes bone,</v>

1287
01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.320
<v Speaker 1>meniscus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cartilage,</v>

1288
01:03:55.321 --> 01:03:56.460
<v Speaker 1>cartilage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meniscus,</v>

1289
01:03:57.570 --> 01:03:59.940
<v Speaker 1>the Meniscus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can cut some of it out.</v>

1290
01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.780
<v Speaker 1>But when you didn't have had that done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1291
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.200
<v Speaker 1>my left knee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1292
01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:05.150
<v Speaker 1>they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1293
01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:10.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go in arthroscopically and they </v>

1294
01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:10.170
<v Speaker 1>trim some of the torn meniscus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1295
01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:10.170
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1296
01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:12.750
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it's less stable,</v>

1297
01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:17.900
<v Speaker 1>there's less tissue in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more subject to inflammation and </v>

1298
01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.560
<v Speaker 1>swelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't handle the load as well.</v>

1299
01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:23.430
<v Speaker 1>But I got stem cell shot into there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a problem since.</v>

1300
01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:25.500
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a problem with it for.</v>

1301
01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean I tore it for the first time a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 20 years ago and had an </v>

1302
01:04:31.741 --> 01:04:36.741
<v Speaker 1>operation I think in [inaudible] 95,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around there and then I had </v>

1303
01:04:36.741 --> 01:04:40.590
<v Speaker 1>another operation on it in 2001,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2002 and it was.</v>

1304
01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:41.940
<v Speaker 1>It's always been an issue since then.</v>

1305
01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:44.280
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of those things that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets sore.</v>

1306
01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:49.281
<v Speaker 1>I just deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's kickboxing or whether it's </v>

1307
01:04:49.281 --> 01:04:49.560
<v Speaker 1>lifting weights or whether it's Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets sore.</v>

1308
01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I just deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take glucosamine and Chondroitin and a</v>

1309
01:04:53.761 --> 01:04:56.850
<v Speaker 1>lot of fish oil and antiinflammatories </v>
<v Speaker 1>and changing.</v>

1310
01:04:56.851 --> 01:05:01.851
<v Speaker 1>My Diet helped quite a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was always that thing until </v>

1311
01:05:01.851 --> 01:05:05.420
<v Speaker 1>they shot the stem cells in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then literally within a few months it's </v>

1312
01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:06.960
<v Speaker 1>nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think I have this need that</v>

1313
01:05:06.961 --> 01:05:09.540
<v Speaker 1>acts up anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have a knee that never acts up.</v>

1314
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:12.390
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't bother me anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is very exciting stuff.</v>

1315
01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:17.420
<v Speaker 1>It's very exciting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Tell me how thin I'm on the wedge in</v>

1316
01:05:17.441 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>terms of</v>

1317
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.050
<v Speaker 3>this being new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1318
01:05:20.051 --> 01:05:25.051
<v Speaker 3>they've been doing it and experimenting </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it for a couple of decades </v>

1319
01:05:25.051 --> 01:05:28.291
<v Speaker 3>apparently according to Dr Mcgee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the understanding of the potential </v>

1320
01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:32.251
<v Speaker 3>and the possibilities and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>practical application as over the last </v>

1321
01:05:32.251 --> 01:05:33.850
<v Speaker 3>10 years has really come to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>forefront.</v>

1322
01:05:33.851 --> 01:05:36.640
<v Speaker 3>It's really become something very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very viable.</v>

1323
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000
<v Speaker 3>It's not just theoretical anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're actually seeing people </v>

1324
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.211
<v Speaker 3>regenerating tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're seeing people where you have a </v>

1325
01:05:45.211 --> 01:05:46.150
<v Speaker 3>tear in your shoulder or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and then go out and you're probably</v>

1326
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.650
<v Speaker 3>going to have to get surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1327
01:05:47.651 --> 01:05:52.651
<v Speaker 3>Then they shoot it in there and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>next thing you know it a couple months </v>

1328
01:05:52.651 --> 01:05:55.740
<v Speaker 3>later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I still got some floating tissue </v>

1329
01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:56.110
<v Speaker 3>that like pops and crunches and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>and my shoulder.</v>

1330
01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.480
<v Speaker 3>But when it comes to like the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength in my shoulder,</v>

1331
01:05:58.481 --> 01:06:01.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't worry about it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't bother me.</v>

1332
01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:06.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's occasionally some light </v>

1333
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:08.641
<v Speaker 3>soreness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as far as like the functional </v>

1334
01:06:08.641 --> 01:06:09.250
<v Speaker 3>strength of the shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like 100 percent.</v>

1335
01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:14.280
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is this the thin end of the wage </v>

1336
01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:14.280
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is this gonna,</v>

1337
01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:17.380
<v Speaker 3>is this gonna turn into one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>exponential?</v>

1338
01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:18.670
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1339
01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:19.750
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

1340
01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:20.990
<v Speaker 3>They're already generating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>

1341
01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:23.200
<v Speaker 3>They built this woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is very exciting.</v>

1342
01:06:23.201 --> 01:06:25.300
<v Speaker 3>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's as exciting as it gets.</v>

1343
01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:28.240
<v Speaker 3>The regenerating tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're real regenerate body parts.</v>

1344
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Speaker 3>They built this woman a bladder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had a.</v>

1345
01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:34.920
<v Speaker 3>They took skin cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stem cells from the skin and they with a</v>

1346
01:06:34.921 --> 01:06:38.050
<v Speaker 3>p in a petri dish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They started this off and then built her</v>

1347
01:06:38.051 --> 01:06:43.051
<v Speaker 3>a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had bladder cancer and they built </v>

1348
01:06:43.051 --> 01:06:43.600
<v Speaker 3>her a bladder and then put it in her </v>
<v Speaker 3>body and it's functional.</v>

1349
01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:49.050
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is all state of the art now </v>

1350
01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:50.320
<v Speaker 3>and when we're looking at like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>

1351
01:06:50.321 --> 01:06:55.321
<v Speaker 3>30 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're looking at potentially </v>

1352
01:06:55.321 --> 01:06:57.661
<v Speaker 3>regenerating all sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regenerating bone from people who have </v>

1353
01:06:57.661 --> 01:07:01.621
<v Speaker 3>bone cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regenerating lungs and liver and spleen </v>

1354
01:07:01.621 --> 01:07:01.621
<v Speaker 3>and heart.</v>

1355
01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:06.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be able to make body </v>

1356
01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:06.720
<v Speaker 3>parts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've created an artificial heart that</v>

1357
01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.981
<v Speaker 3>beats like with stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've actually constructed a human </v>

1358
01:07:10.981 --> 01:07:13.060
<v Speaker 3>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a subject,</v>

1359
01:07:13.061 --> 01:07:13.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>selling,</v>

1360
01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:15.430
<v Speaker 3>you're bound to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinated by it,</v>

1361
01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:20.520
<v Speaker 3>fascinated by it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because what they're able to do now is </v>

1362
01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:20.520
<v Speaker 3>just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1363
01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:25.501
<v Speaker 3>you're just looking into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get a window into this and it seems </v>

1364
01:07:25.501 --> 01:07:28.510
<v Speaker 3>like it's exponentially exploding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean all over the world.</v>

1365
01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:33.511
<v Speaker 3>There's people experimenting with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and trying to figure out new ways </v>

1366
01:07:33.511 --> 01:07:36.601
<v Speaker 3>to improve things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the fact that I'm having that </v>

1367
01:07:36.601 --> 01:07:39.021
<v Speaker 3>conversation and this isn't the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation I've had in the last month </v>

1368
01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:39.021
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1369
01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:40.240
<v Speaker 3>it's pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's aunt gus.</v>

1370
01:07:40.241 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1371
01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:45.871
<v Speaker 3>it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are understanding it and people </v>

1372
01:07:45.871 --> 01:07:45.871
<v Speaker 3>know people that have had issues with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1373
01:07:45.871 --> 01:07:46.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't get it in America,</v>

1374
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:49.540
<v Speaker 3>but in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know people that go over there and get</v>

1375
01:07:49.541 --> 01:07:52.840
<v Speaker 3>it done intravenously and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1376
01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:55.630
<v Speaker 3>boss route and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boss boss route and the way he described</v>

1377
01:07:55.631 --> 01:07:56.970
<v Speaker 3>on this big character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like.</v>

1378
01:07:57.310 --> 01:08:00.010
<v Speaker 3>And it was like I had energy coming off </v>
<v Speaker 3>my fingertips.</v>

1379
01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:06.180
<v Speaker 3>I had some pretty significant problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got fused disks in his neck and he </v>

1380
01:08:07.391 --> 01:08:12.391
<v Speaker 3>had major atrophy in his arm because his</v>
<v Speaker 3>disc was compressed and they.</v>

1381
01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 3>It was pushing on the nerves so the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nerves</v>

1382
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>weren't getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't firing correctly,</v>

1383
01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:24.340
<v Speaker 1>so his right arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he calls baby arm because his right arm </v>

1384
01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.530
<v Speaker 1>has kind of shrunk and so he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>experimented with a lot of these things.</v>

1385
01:08:25.531 --> 01:08:27.080
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of been ahead of the curve </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this stuff.</v>

1386
01:08:28.530 --> 01:08:31.710
<v Speaker 2>You should get Jason Statham and I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>love to you,</v>

1387
01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:35.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1388
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:40.430
<v Speaker 1>It's very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These go a couple of tweaks here and </v>

1389
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.430
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met him.</v>

1390
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:44.290
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a bunch of stuff going on with </v>

1391
01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:44.290
<v Speaker 1>his body too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he's a martial artist.</v>

1392
01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Better condition now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to be an Olympic diver.</v>

1393
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:50.020
<v Speaker 2>You should die for England.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know one of those,</v>

1394
01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:55.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fabulous athlete and he takes care </v>

1395
01:08:56.361 --> 01:08:57.440
<v Speaker 2>of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>

1396
01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.690
<v Speaker 2>A good name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know he's got tweaks,</v>

1397
01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:02.960
<v Speaker 2>got their own knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just never quite goes away.</v>

1398
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Little thing that he does his much and </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1399
01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:09.260
<v Speaker 2>get him on diet and he's off to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>races.</v>

1400
01:09:09.261 --> 01:09:10.990
<v Speaker 2>You can't shut him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got,</v>

1401
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:13.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave him there for three hours,</v>

1402
01:09:13.461 --> 01:09:17.780
<v Speaker 2>come back kind of cutlet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We still banging on about it.</v>

1403
01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:22.960
<v Speaker 2>It's something that he cares profoundly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can tell you now we're sitting in </v>

1404
01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.550
<v Speaker 2>now there'll be a battle about you </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't.</v>

1405
01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Who was good to say what to whom because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd talk over one another.</v>

1406
01:09:29.370 --> 01:09:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should get him in,</v>

1407
01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:33.530
<v Speaker 2>in a way he relate to best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1408
01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1409
01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Do you watch your diet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you a healthy eater?</v>

1410
01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Not as healthy as I'd like to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd go up and down.</v>

1411
01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:45.040
<v Speaker 2>I play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also liked with 30 pounds of extra </v>

1412
01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:45.280
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on.</v>

1413
01:09:45.350 --> 01:09:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1414
01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:50.810
<v Speaker 2>now I'm weighing 190.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I should get one 92 actually today.</v>

1415
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:54.770
<v Speaker 2>And I should be creeping around a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and weigh about one slash 78.</v>

1416
01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:57.810
<v Speaker 2>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a booze Buddhist thing?</v>

1417
01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:03.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not the booze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The booze isn't the issue in terms of </v>

1418
01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.801
<v Speaker 2>the canneries itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The booze is the window to the calories </v>

1419
01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:05.801
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pizza,</v>

1420
01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:10.300
<v Speaker 2>the pizza pizza man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do love a pub or a pub or they </v>

1421
01:10:10.771 --> 01:10:12.680
<v Speaker 2>love a pump and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pack of crisps.</v>

1422
01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:14.800
<v Speaker 2>You don't really have packet kitty corn </v>
<v Speaker 2>chips over here.</v>

1423
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Not Quite the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

1424
01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:21.760
<v Speaker 2>they don't know an English,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an English crisp is a heavyweight chip.</v>

1425
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they worked particularly well in </v>

1426
01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:30.641
<v Speaker 2>pop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's two pints of Guinness and a </v>

1427
01:10:30.641 --> 01:10:32.431
<v Speaker 2>couple of packs of crisps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've it in a thousand calories is </v>

1428
01:10:32.431 --> 01:10:33.350
<v Speaker 2>complete nonsense in all about 22 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

1429
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm the salt to is very appealing where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're drinking a cold thing,</v>

1430
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:42.590
<v Speaker 2>just work chances each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't take long before.</v>

1431
01:10:42.591 --> 01:10:44.450
<v Speaker 2>There's a heavy price tag that comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

1432
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I train the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognized train weights three times a </v>

1433
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:53.180
<v Speaker 2>week and finding bread on the three </v>
<v Speaker 2>times a week.</v>

1434
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:58.750
<v Speaker 2>I love training Kebab and it's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow reconcile that.</v>

1435
01:11:01.941 --> 01:11:06.941
<v Speaker 2>And every now and then I'll behave </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself a stay at the pub style off the </v>

1436
01:11:06.941 --> 01:11:08.300
<v Speaker 2>booze for three months and I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get myself down to one 78.</v>

1437
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:10.610
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been five,</v>

1438
01:11:10.611 --> 01:11:15.611
<v Speaker 2>six years since I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I dropped eight pounds the other </v>

1439
01:11:15.611 --> 01:11:20.061
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strictly I was strict with myself off </v>

1440
01:11:20.061 --> 01:11:22.470
<v Speaker 2>the booze because I'm off the booze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at food in the same way.</v>

1441
01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:25.320
<v Speaker 2>The thing that the whole purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 2>boozers to relax trouble is as well.</v>

1442
01:11:25.321 --> 01:11:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Also reluctance to the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1443
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:30.560
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1444
01:11:30.561 --> 01:11:33.050
<v Speaker 3>when you're dealing with all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>injuries,</v>

1445
01:11:33.051 --> 01:11:38.051
<v Speaker 3>how are you able to train through all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stuff you've got to shoulder they </v>

1446
01:11:38.051 --> 01:11:38.690
<v Speaker 3>think in one day might need to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>replaced and needs that might need to be</v>

1447
01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:39.190
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>

1448
01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Crack on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1449
01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:44.390
<v Speaker 2>I found that and I'm sure you've had the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same through Jujitsu.</v>

1450
01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Whenever I get an injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a font,</v>

1451
01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:49.690
<v Speaker 2>if you stop messing around with it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying too much attention to it,</v>

1452
01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:54.260
<v Speaker 2>it kind of don't go on for longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nine or 10 million injuries are just try</v>

1453
01:11:54.261 --> 01:11:59.261
<v Speaker 2>and through and there's almost a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bluffing game that you have with the </v>

1454
01:11:59.261 --> 01:12:02.981
<v Speaker 2>injury who was in charge had mailed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>injury and once the injury knows that </v>

1455
01:12:02.981 --> 01:12:03.490
<v Speaker 2>you mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tends to move,</v>

1456
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:06.590
<v Speaker 2>walk out the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are more fundamental ones like</v>

1457
01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:11.710
<v Speaker 2>the shoulder and then the next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I shouldn't say that actually has </v>

1458
01:12:11.710 --> 01:12:13.430
<v Speaker 2>been giving me a bit of aggro recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1459
01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:15.430
<v Speaker 2>so there were a few things that you need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take it serious.</v>

1460
01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Now I can see you're onto this job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see you're focused on this.</v>

1461
01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1462
01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:20.970
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot about this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1463
01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:24.000
<v Speaker 2>But you're invested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1464
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you need to be invested.</v>

1465
01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.730
<v Speaker 2>If you mean it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ownership again,</v>

1466
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:30.200
<v Speaker 2>your investment is ownership.</v>

1467
01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my good friend Eddie Bravo just at his </v>

1468
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.261
<v Speaker 3>disc replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had to replace with a titanium </v>

1469
01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:40.321
<v Speaker 3>articulating lower back disc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he had some pretty significant disc </v>

1470
01:12:40.321 --> 01:12:42.400
<v Speaker 3>decompression or compression issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1471
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:47.430
<v Speaker 3>in deterioration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it got to the point where his lower </v>

1472
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.430
<v Speaker 3>back was just constantly inflamed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1473
01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.100
<v Speaker 3>Eddie's worldclass blackpoll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1474
01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:52.380
<v Speaker 3>He just couldn't come anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't you send them to you?</v>

1475
01:12:52.381 --> 01:12:57.381
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it was before they were actually </v>

1476
01:12:57.381 --> 01:12:57.381
<v Speaker 3>shooting it into the desk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had it done about a year ago,</v>

1477
01:12:57.381 --> 01:12:58.090
<v Speaker 3>about a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>

1478
01:12:58.091 --> 01:12:59.250
<v Speaker 3>nine months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1479
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.870
<v Speaker 3>So this might be one that whether you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just hang on.</v>

1480
01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:04.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say with stem cells,</v>

1481
01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:05.530
<v Speaker 3>with a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hang on,</v>

1482
01:13:05.531 --> 01:13:09.790
<v Speaker 3>what some things you can hang on like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>acl tears once the tear,</v>

1483
01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:13.260
<v Speaker 3>once the ligament is removed you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing you can do.</v>

1484
01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:15.100
<v Speaker 3>You have to ever replace a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1485
01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The acl and it's such a common injury,</v>

1486
01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:20.380
<v Speaker 3>but you know what's interesting is once </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get it replaced.</v>

1487
01:13:20.381 --> 01:13:23.530
<v Speaker 3>Like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a Patella tendon graft on the left</v>

1488
01:13:23.531 --> 01:13:28.531
<v Speaker 3>knee and then a cadaver graft on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right knee and had all sorts of things </v>

1489
01:13:28.811 --> 01:13:29.060
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>

1490
01:13:29.061 --> 01:13:32.020
<v Speaker 3>I've done it all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but neither one of them bother me at all</v>

1491
01:13:32.021 --> 01:13:33.340
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're stronger.</v>

1492
01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.380
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1493
01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.600
<v Speaker 3>When they do a cadaver graft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they use the Achilles tendon,</v>

1494
01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:42.220
<v Speaker 3>which is a 150 plus percent stronger </v>
<v Speaker 3>than your original acl.</v>

1495
01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.100
<v Speaker 3>So it actually makes it a stronger </v>
<v Speaker 3>joint,</v>

1496
01:13:46.290 --> 01:13:47.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Melinda's.</v>

1497
01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:47.600
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1498
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1499
01:13:49.021 --> 01:13:54.021
<v Speaker 3>the Patella tendon graft is still </v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger than when they use a Patella </v>

1500
01:13:54.021 --> 01:13:57.111
<v Speaker 3>tendon graft that is still strong in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your patella tendon is a very huge </v>

1501
01:13:57.111 --> 01:14:00.351
<v Speaker 3>tendon and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can operate with a third of it </v>

1502
01:14:00.351 --> 01:14:04.161
<v Speaker 3>missing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is essentially what they cut out </v>

1503
01:14:04.161 --> 01:14:04.161
<v Speaker 3>when they</v>

1504
01:14:04.161 --> 01:14:05.280
<v Speaker 2>my right leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has had the two acl,</v>

1505
01:14:05.281 --> 01:14:10.281
<v Speaker 2>so I've noticed is atrophied and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very little I can do to beef up that </v>

1506
01:14:10.281 --> 01:14:12.250
<v Speaker 2>quad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably because you're favoring</v>

1507
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.730
<v Speaker 1>your left side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1508
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:16.180
<v Speaker 1>But then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated and I'm beast the thing,</v>

1509
01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:20.170
<v Speaker 1>but I just can't engage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get it flat leg like a can on my</v>

1510
01:14:20.171 --> 01:14:21.760
<v Speaker 1>left leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it completely flat.</v>

1511
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Standard it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it bends.</v>

1512
01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Age or your courts does some stem cells </v>

1513
01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.070
<v Speaker 1>in that bad boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very exciting.</v>

1514
01:14:30.071 --> 01:14:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1515
01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.200
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the real deal.</v>

1516
01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:37.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's something special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's the years I've been living with </v>

1517
01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:37.260
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1518
01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:37.870
<v Speaker 1>They can fix you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a fixture up.</v>

1519
01:14:37.871 --> 01:14:42.871
<v Speaker 1>But diet is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things about diet is </v>

1520
01:14:42.871 --> 01:14:45.421
<v Speaker 1>inflammation and I never really wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in my head and to see about three </v>

1521
01:14:45.421 --> 01:14:49.861
<v Speaker 1>or four years ago I had a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant back injury and then just </v>

1522
01:14:49.861 --> 01:14:53.680
<v Speaker 1>say in my hands were numb and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was ignoring it because I </v>

1523
01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:54.840
<v Speaker 1>would pinch it in Jujitsu and then I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1524
01:14:54.841 --> 01:14:56.080
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still going to roll light.</v>

1525
01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.080
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go in there and roll light and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then after awhile it was getting bad to </v>

1526
01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.291
<v Speaker 1>the point in my back was locking up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my hand started going numb and I give </v>

1527
01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:07.351
<v Speaker 1>this pretty significant elbow pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I started really researching all the </v>

1528
01:15:07.451 --> 01:15:12.451
<v Speaker 1>options and what's really going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the big ones that I've found was </v>

1529
01:15:12.451 --> 01:15:13.690
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That when you have too many inflammation</v>

1530
01:15:13.691 --> 01:15:18.691
<v Speaker 1>causing foods in your diet and reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much sugar and bread and booze and </v>

1531
01:15:18.691 --> 01:15:20.420
<v Speaker 1>all these different things that affects </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1532
01:15:20.490 --> 01:15:24.340
<v Speaker 1>It affects like how your body carries </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

1533
01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:29.580
<v Speaker 1>but it also affects where your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>holds onto inflammation and joints in </v>

1534
01:15:29.681 --> 01:15:31.330
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the injuries,</v>

1535
01:15:31.331 --> 01:15:34.690
<v Speaker 1>spots were waste sore when I had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty diet.</v>

1536
01:15:34.691 --> 01:15:36.280
<v Speaker 1>So give me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me the evils.</v>

1537
01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Laird Hamilton calls them the three </v>

1538
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:42.430
<v Speaker 1>white devils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugar bread.</v>

1539
01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.280
<v Speaker 1>What's the other one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1540
01:15:45.281 --> 01:15:46.900
<v Speaker 1>what is the other one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Booze.</v>

1541
01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:52.080
<v Speaker 1>The kind of white foam on bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White.</v>

1542
01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.030
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should know what?</v>

1543
01:15:55.031 --> 01:15:57.310
<v Speaker 1>The three white flour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pasta,</v>

1544
01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:58.510
<v Speaker 1>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1545
01:15:58.511 --> 01:15:59.650
<v Speaker 1>What is either one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dairy.</v>

1546
01:15:59.651 --> 01:16:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mary.</v>

1547
01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:01.220
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1548
01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I like cheese though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you don't drink alcohol?</v>

1549
01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1550
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we try not to drink too much.</v>

1551
01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like all things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>moderation,</v>

1552
01:16:09.641 --> 01:16:11.690
<v Speaker 1>including moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1553
01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big drinker.</v>

1554
01:16:13.781 --> 01:16:15.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not drinking every night,</v>

1555
01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:17.550
<v Speaker 1>but if I go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1556
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:21.160
<v Speaker 1>and I have a drink or have a glass of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine with dinner or a couple of glasses,</v>

1557
01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:21.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm cool.</v>

1558
01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just a matter of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling yourself.</v>

1559
01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:26.320
<v Speaker 1>That's really the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1560
01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three white devils,</v>

1561
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:33.910
<v Speaker 1>you do subscribe to three white devils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I occasionally will allow myself to </v>

1562
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.960
<v Speaker 1>dance with the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the little three of them.</v>

1563
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1564
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:43.810
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit like last night I had some </v>

1565
01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:43.810
<v Speaker 1>linguine with clams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1566
01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:48.090
<v Speaker 1>I go on an 80 slash 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means 80 percent of my diet is </v>

1567
01:16:48.090 --> 01:16:49.120
<v Speaker 1>very clean and then 20 percent off fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

1568
01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:51.640
<v Speaker 1>like whether it's Saturday or Friday or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1569
01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Had you feel about rural milk on </v>
<v Speaker 1>posturized love.</v>

1570
01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I Love Rob Melton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm opening.</v>

1571
01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm opening a little raw milk dairy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you really?</v>

1572
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having,</v>

1573
01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm very interested in this health </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1574
01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:08.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm more from a culinary point of view </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I am from a nutritional point of </v>

1575
01:17:08.531 --> 01:17:09.650
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1576
01:17:09.651 --> 01:17:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I suspect,</v>

1577
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.070
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that there's a sweet spot </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1578
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:16.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm opening a brewery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love a beer.</v>

1579
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:18.770
<v Speaker 2>You're opening a brewery to brewery?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1580
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much do you know about making beer?</v>

1581
01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a lot actually.</v>

1582
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Have you been doing it on your own?</v>

1583
01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:28.280
<v Speaker 2>Done all that sort of asking around </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath the stairs routine for years.</v>

1584
01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is great fun.</v>

1585
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:33.650
<v Speaker 2>I like any sort of form of caveman </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemistry,</v>

1586
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Francis Mammon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mammon is,</v>

1587
01:17:36.670 --> 01:17:41.670
<v Speaker 2>it's big fan of that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bit of a caveman when it comes to </v>

1588
01:17:41.670 --> 01:17:42.920
<v Speaker 2>anything to do with food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I do like a nice steak outside.</v>

1589
01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:48.360
<v Speaker 2>I'll take my uncle if I say so myself.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1610
01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.800
<v Speaker 1>and apparent is the easiest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirits to mix all my little swing on </v>

<v Speaker 1>Arizona.</v>

1615
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not in a place in Arizona that's </v>

1616
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:58.611
<v Speaker 1>known for growing wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he had to manipulate the soil and a </v>

1617
01:18:58.611 --> 01:18:59.910
<v Speaker 1>baby's having a lovely time.</v>

1619
01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:02.100
<v Speaker 1>lovely time though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1620
01:19:02.190 --> 01:19:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he's making money with it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's.</v>

1621
01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:10.040
<v Speaker 1>He's like a legitimate genius and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those guys that he cannot be </v>

1622
01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.490
<v Speaker 1>stagnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even an option.</v>

1623
01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:16.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean his mind works a thousand miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour and when you're talking to him </v>

1624
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:20.421
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of kind of jumped on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>train and hang on there with them as </v>

1625
01:19:20.421 --> 01:19:20.421
<v Speaker 1>long as you can jump off and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

1627
01:19:21.961 --> 01:19:24.180
<v Speaker 1>very intense guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his,</v>

1628
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:29.510
<v Speaker 1>his particular brand of intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity led him to start experimenting</v>

1629
01:19:30.781 --> 01:19:35.781
<v Speaker 1>with one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His wine is absolutely fantastic and </v>

1630
01:19:35.781 --> 01:19:38.331
<v Speaker 1>these are legitimate wine expert like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit here and talk to them the same </v>

1631
01:19:38.331 --> 01:19:40.400

<v Speaker 1>Chechnya or Hadzic,</v>

1632
01:19:40.450 --> 01:19:41.240
<v Speaker 1>racier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henzel.</v>

1633
01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:46.250

<v Speaker 1>also a purple belt in Jujitsu to so he </v>

1634
01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:47.220
<v Speaker 1>can talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an intense guy.</v>

1635
01:19:47.670 --> 01:19:50.640
<v Speaker 1>I liked the sound of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one business I do find interesting.</v>

1636
01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:52.180
<v Speaker 1>There's something happen.</v>

1637
01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Learning with the whole craft movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>

1638
01:19:55.270 --> 01:20:00.270
<v Speaker 2>that's very exciting that we are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to local stuff and people to a </v>

1639
01:20:02.111 --> 01:20:03.760
<v Speaker 2>degree it's ownership again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1640
01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:08.820
<v Speaker 2>It's take ownership of your food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take ownership of everything to do with </v>

1641
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:14.970
<v Speaker 2>the important components of your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it'll got robbed from us.</v>

1642
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1643
01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:19.590
<v Speaker 2>what happened in the seventies in the UK</v>
<v Speaker 2>is all these breweries bought up all the</v>

1644
01:20:19.591 --> 01:20:24.591
<v Speaker 2>pumps and they brought up all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>small breweries and used to have all </v>

1645
01:20:24.591 --> 01:20:27.531
<v Speaker 2>these breweries with their own little </v>
<v Speaker 2>crafty beer going on and then they have </v>

1646
01:20:27.531 --> 01:20:31.401
<v Speaker 2>merchandised it and then he sold it back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to us and they gave it back to us with </v>

1647
01:20:31.401 --> 01:20:32.580
<v Speaker 2>that character and we just bought it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we were stupid.</v>

1648
01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1649
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:39.110
<v Speaker 2>And then what's happening is we realized</v>
<v Speaker 2>that character is important and local </v>

1650
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:41.550
<v Speaker 2>character is important and ownership is </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

1651
01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:44.720
<v Speaker 2>So there's this movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1652
01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:48.030
<v Speaker 2>and to a degree things like instagram </v>
<v Speaker 2>may have a dark side,</v>

1653
01:20:48.031 --> 01:20:53.031
<v Speaker 2>but it was as a light side is given a </v>
<v Speaker 2>voice to the craft movement on like a </v>

1654
01:20:53.941 --> 01:20:55.230
<v Speaker 2>man that makes his own knives.</v>

1655
01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And followed any of that stuff.</v>

1656
01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.000
<v Speaker 1>What are handmade knives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>

1657
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:03.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what I use to like cut my food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they feel good.</v>

1658
01:21:03.421 --> 01:21:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely different experience.</v>

1659
01:21:05.551 --> 01:21:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I have exactly the same thing.</v>

1660
01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:11.980
<v Speaker 2>We order a lot of army knives and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're cutting your food with a handmade</v>

1661
01:21:11.981 --> 01:21:14.650
<v Speaker 2>knife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not what it used to be.</v>

1662
01:21:14.651 --> 01:21:16.700
<v Speaker 2>You realize a knife should be a thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing</v>

1663
01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:21.990
<v Speaker 1>and it got robbed from us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Steve Kramer is a number of </v>

1664
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:24.470
<v Speaker 1>days a guy who makes knives with media </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights?</v>

1665

<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know I've seen him.</v>

1666

<v Speaker 1>Anthony Bourdain.</v>

1667
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000

<v Speaker 1>people dynamic he takes a chunk of it </v>

1668

<v Speaker 1>came from space.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1671
01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.090
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a feeling that might have been the</v>

1672
01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:41.020
<v Speaker 1>genesis of my interest in knowledge with</v>
<v Speaker 1>antibody thing.</v>

1673
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:44.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mousy fire arts,</v>

1674
01:21:44.001 --> 01:21:49.001
<v Speaker 1>find that on Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he just made me this Damascus steel </v>

1675
01:21:49.001 --> 01:21:49.880
<v Speaker 1>cutting knife and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a hunting knife to go with it.</v>

1676
01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:51.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1677
01:21:51.771 --> 01:21:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I cut with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's this.</v>

1678
01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:55.880
<v Speaker 1>I stare at it for minutes before I cut </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

1679
01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:01.120
<v Speaker 1>I look at the blade and the handle's </v>
<v Speaker 1>made out a thousand year old bog would </v>

1680
01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:04.220
<v Speaker 1>like wood that was preserved from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bhag,</v>

1681

<v Speaker 1>this is interesting.</v>

1704
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:00.920
<v Speaker 1>off there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be waiting to receive this sword.</v>

1705
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:02.520
<v Speaker 1>How much does it weigh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1706
01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:04.460
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker had to get in shape </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that thing,</v>

1707
01:23:04.461 --> 01:23:04.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1708
01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:05.760
<v Speaker 1>always in good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick.</v>

1709
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:08.230
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever do those?</v>

1710
01:23:08.231 --> 01:23:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1711
01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:14.250
<v Speaker 1>like a shield cast with a steel club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize how difficult it is to </v>

1712
01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:16.390
<v Speaker 1>manipulate even a 15 pound club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1713
01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Bit of hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very hard work.</v>

1714
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:23.640
<v Speaker 1>If those guys like sword fighters must </v>
<v Speaker 1>have had intense shoulder strength and </v>

1715
01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:24.010
<v Speaker 1>core strength.</v>

1716
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they think these guys are in the UK.</v>

1717
01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.560
<v Speaker 2>They every now and then they stumbled </v>
<v Speaker 2>across a body that's a thousand 500 </v>

1718
01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.170
<v Speaker 2>years old and they realized the </v>
<v Speaker 2>deformity in the shoulders,</v>

1719
01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:37.690
<v Speaker 2>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you call that.</v>

1720
01:23:37.691 --> 01:23:39.190
<v Speaker 2>When you pull a biobank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1721
01:23:39.191 --> 01:23:44.191
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they used to be in English law that </v>

1722
01:23:44.191 --> 01:23:47.200
<v Speaker 2>every Englishman had to practice for </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight hours a week to pull back above.</v>

1723
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:52.470
<v Speaker 2>So you've go these skeletons that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>deformed from the enormous strength of </v>

1724
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:53.080
<v Speaker 2>the soldiers to these on the shelf</v>

1725
01:23:53.190 --> 01:23:54.210
<v Speaker 1>deformed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How so,</v>

1726
01:23:54.211 --> 01:23:55.800
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the issue with it?</v>

1727
01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:59.150
<v Speaker 2>It was the sheer Yolanda Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1728
01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:01.330
<v Speaker 2>a lot more about this than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1729
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:06.910
<v Speaker 2>they had become deformed through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>development of the muscle,</v>

1730
01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:10.460
<v Speaker 2>which in some way then changed the bone </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

1731
01:24:10.461 --> 01:24:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Bone structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1732
01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These massive,</v>

1733
01:24:13.431 --> 01:24:15.440
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right arms.</v>

1734
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if,</v>

1735
01:24:17.111 --> 01:24:17.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UK,</v>

1736
01:24:17.751 --> 01:24:19.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country you do this,</v>

1737
01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:22.490
<v Speaker 2>the finger is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the single finger in the UK.</v>

1738
01:24:22.491 --> 01:24:23.270
<v Speaker 2>It's two fingers,</v>

1739
01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why is that?</v>

1740
01:24:24.311 --> 01:24:25.860
<v Speaker 1>It's for bows and arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1741
01:24:25.890 --> 01:24:30.890
<v Speaker 2>Comes from the English wars and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>French was um,</v>

1742
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:37.910
<v Speaker 2>and the Englishman we're famous for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>long bows and the famous battle of </v>

1743
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:40.290
<v Speaker 2>agincourt where there was a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred of us and it was 10,000</v>

1744
01:24:40.291 --> 01:24:42.780
<v Speaker 2>of them and they're liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1745
01:24:43.050 --> 01:24:48.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had crossbows back then and we had </v>

1746
01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:48.050
<v Speaker 2>this long boat along the way was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>

1747
01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the a bow and Arrow world.</v>

1748
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:53.970
<v Speaker 2>And because the Brits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they did,</v>

1749
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.200
<v Speaker 2>they were a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a week,</v>

1750
01:24:55.201 --> 01:25:00.201
<v Speaker 2>every Englishman have to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were pretty lethal with these </v>

1751
01:25:00.201 --> 01:25:00.201
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1752
01:25:00.201 --> 01:25:03.441
<v Speaker 2>they annihilated the entire French army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a famous battle of the French </v>

1753
01:25:03.441 --> 01:25:05.560
<v Speaker 2>have conveniently forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1754
01:25:06.150 --> 01:25:09.090
<v Speaker 2>so what the French did thereafter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they have recorded Englishman,</v>

1755
01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:13.140
<v Speaker 2>was they chopped off two of his fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull back the bow.</v>

1756
01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:16.350
<v Speaker 2>So whenever a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1757
01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:20.430
<v Speaker 2>as history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm made eloquent,</v>

1758
01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:25.730
<v Speaker 2>is that whenever you saw a freshmen used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to waive the two fingers up at him and </v>

1759
01:25:25.730 --> 01:25:30.441
<v Speaker 2>then since then it's now just become </v>
<v Speaker 2>ubiquitous fuck off sign.</v>

1760
01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the way the Mongols did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

1761
01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:39.280
<v Speaker 1>The Mongols,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had these incredibly powerful </v>

1762
01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.240
<v Speaker 1>recurve bows and would take 160 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull back and they use their thumb.</v>

1763
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:44.390
<v Speaker 1>They would have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thumb ring made out of bone.</v>

1764
01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1765
01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I have a bungalow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They therapy.</v>

1766
01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:53.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a fantastic audio documentary on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of the Mongols,</v>

1767
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:56.060
<v Speaker 1>the wrath of the con with Dan Carlin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listen to that.</v>

1768
01:25:56.061 --> 01:25:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

1769
01:25:57.410 --> 01:25:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll even out there.</v>

1770
01:25:58.821 --> 01:26:03.821
<v Speaker 1>There's a bit of a fan of yours that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps me up to date on the different </v>

1771
01:26:03.821 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 1>things that you're in because he's</v>

1772
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:09.100
<v Speaker 3>interested in the same things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know about the knives and </v>

1773
01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:09.100
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of other things I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know that you knew about,</v>

1774
01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:10.670
<v Speaker 3>but he's a big fan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got me onto this.</v>

1775
01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:11.590
<v Speaker 3>See those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We might,</v>

1776
01:26:11.591 --> 01:26:14.840
<v Speaker 3>I think he got onto this because you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>got them onto I'm sure,</v>

1777
01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:16.660
<v Speaker 3>but once you hear Dan Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1778
01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:20.510
<v Speaker 3>it is absolutely addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is the ring that they would put</v>

1779
01:26:20.511 --> 01:26:25.010
<v Speaker 3>on their thumb and they would pull back </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and then they would wrap their</v>

1780
01:26:25.011 --> 01:26:27.620
<v Speaker 3>index finger over the thing where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1781
01:26:27.650 --> 01:26:31.100
<v Speaker 3>the thumb nail is and then pull it back </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

1782
01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:36.130
<v Speaker 3>And then release.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how they would release their </v>

1783
01:26:36.130 --> 01:26:36.130
<v Speaker 3>arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1784
01:26:36.130 --> 01:26:36.320
<v Speaker 3>it didn't get very far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did it?</v>

1785
01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it did for a long time until gang is </v>

1786
01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Kahn died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1787
01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.220
<v Speaker 3>they killed 10 percent of the population</v>
<v Speaker 3>they killed.</v>

1788
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:44.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was kidding.</v>

1789
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:50.000
<v Speaker 3>Joking around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They killed so many people that change </v>

1790
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:50.840
<v Speaker 3>the carbon footprint of earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a New York Times article about</v>

1791
01:26:50.841 --> 01:26:53.510
<v Speaker 3>how many people died during gingiss </v>
<v Speaker 3>Khan's reign.</v>

1792
01:26:53.690 --> 01:26:56.780
<v Speaker 3>That it was so significant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could see it in the carbon data.</v>

1793
01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.180
<v Speaker 3>You're kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1794
01:26:58.230 --> 01:26:59.150
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not kidding.</v>

1795
01:26:59.210 --> 01:27:04.210
<v Speaker 3>See if he could pull that article that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he killed between 50 and 70 million </v>

1796
01:27:04.671 --> 01:27:09.671
<v Speaker 3>people during his lifetime were directly</v>
<v Speaker 3>attributed to his army and his </v>

1797
01:27:10.221 --> 01:27:13.010
<v Speaker 3>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifty to 70 million people died.</v>

1798
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:18.310
<v Speaker 3>The conservative estimate is somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>around 30 to liberal estimate is </v>

1799
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.650
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around 70.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody really knows what they think.</v>

1800
01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:23.700
<v Speaker 3>It's between that Mongol invasion in </v>
<v Speaker 3>1200 altered carbon dioxide levels.</v>

1801
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:28.560
<v Speaker 3>It killed so many fucking people at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1802
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Earth where there was probably only a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million people kicking around on it.</v>

1803
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:37.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many people there were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought there was a lot more than a </v>

1804
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.400
<v Speaker 3>million because they killed a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in China.</v>

1805
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:43.450
<v Speaker 3>They killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They killed people in numbers that we </v>

1806
01:27:43.450 --> 01:27:43.670
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even in Jen,</v>

1807
01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:48.700
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Jen China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they showed up and this was part of the </v>

1808
01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Dan Carlin series,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1809
01:27:49.881 --> 01:27:51.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the show,</v>

1810
01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:55.640
<v Speaker 3>the corpsmen and shaw sent a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an envoy,</v>

1811
01:27:55.641 --> 01:27:59.330
<v Speaker 3>like a party to go search this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a city in China.</v>

1812
01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:04.480
<v Speaker 3>And as they pulled up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought what they saw in the </v>

1813
01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:05.870
<v Speaker 3>distance was a snow covered mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As they got closer,</v>

1814
01:28:05.871 --> 01:28:10.871
<v Speaker 3>they realized it was a stack of bones </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the roads were so deteriorated from </v>

1815
01:28:11.331 --> 01:28:14.450
<v Speaker 3>human bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just rotting human bodies.</v>

1816
01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:19.540
<v Speaker 3>They had abandoned the roads because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't get their cars through </v>

1817
01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:22.590
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their wheels rather through because </v>

1818
01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:23.780
<v Speaker 3>their wheels were getting bogged down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their horses were getting bogged down in</v>

1819
01:28:23.781 --> 01:28:27.200
<v Speaker 3>the muck of deteriorating bodies as so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many people.</v>

1820
01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:32.201
<v Speaker 3>The Mongols killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the Fuck I was at?</v>

1821
01:28:33.711 --> 01:28:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Just the design for empire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a real good question.</v>

1822
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:40.370
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the dehumanization of the enemy.</v>

1823
01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:45.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his idea was that everybody who doesn't </v>

1824
01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.651
<v Speaker 3>live in a tent and anybody who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>live the way they do these fools that </v>

1825
01:28:47.651 --> 01:28:47.651
<v Speaker 3>live in cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't even human.</v>

1826
01:28:47.651 --> 01:28:52.151
<v Speaker 3>There were sheep like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a certain disconnect between </v>

1827
01:28:52.151 --> 01:28:53.900
<v Speaker 3>them and the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is imperative.</v>

1828
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:58.930
<v Speaker 3>It's the most important thing in war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to decide that that person's </v>

1829
01:28:58.930 --> 01:28:58.930
<v Speaker 3>not you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1830
01:28:58.930 --> 01:29:03.050
<v Speaker 3>You have decided that there the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the Vietnamese or the </v>

1831
01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:03.050
<v Speaker 3>Germans,</v>

1832
01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:04.440
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese like whatever it is,</v>

1833
01:29:04.441 --> 01:29:09.441
<v Speaker 1>you have to decide that they are less </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you and they had this thing about </v>

1834
01:29:09.441 --> 01:29:12.120
<v Speaker 1>people that did not live like they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were pussies,</v>

1835
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:17.600
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these weak people that lived in these </v>

1836
01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:17.600
<v Speaker 1>cities with their walls and so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would just find,</v>

1837
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:22.790
<v Speaker 1>find these cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd stroll up and they would just </v>

1838
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:24.951
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to start attacking them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would light bodies on fire and </v>

1839
01:29:24.951 --> 01:29:26.820
<v Speaker 1>launched them with catapults onto the </v>
<v Speaker 1>roofs of these buildings.</v>

1840
01:29:27.210 --> 01:29:30.450
<v Speaker 1>But what was the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the motivation?</v>

1841
01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:32.640
<v Speaker 1>It was just conquering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just conquering.</v>

1842
01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just wanted to expand their empire </v>

1843
01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:37.900
<v Speaker 1>and take over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1844
01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:38.910
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no noble pursuit and there is no</v>

1845
01:29:38.911 --> 01:29:40.290
<v Speaker 1>religious pursuit either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1846
01:29:40.291 --> 01:29:41.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a expansion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1847
01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just wanted to own it all.</v>

1848
01:29:43.381 --> 01:29:45.780
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they felt like everyone they encountered</v>

1849
01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.160
<v Speaker 1>was subject to their rule and they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1850
01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:53.100
<v Speaker 1>They had to establish that sip very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very intense series.</v>

1851
01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Now remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I caught into about five </v>

1852
01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:58.160
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the bone thing with the</v>

1853
01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.060
<v Speaker 1>bone thing in off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've got mountains of bone.</v>

1854
01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

1855
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1856
01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I do remember some of that food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How things drift.</v>

1857
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:11.590
<v Speaker 1>You'd appreciate this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a legitimate Samurai sword from </v>

1858
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:12.810
<v Speaker 1>the 15 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1859
01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real one.</v>

1860
01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's quite sexy time.</v>

1861
01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Was this shock skin going on up here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1862
01:30:18.931 --> 01:30:19.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the,</v>

1863
01:30:19.941 --> 01:30:21.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the case is probably a,</v>

1864
01:30:21.721 --> 01:30:24.810
<v Speaker 1>a modern case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that blade itself,</v>

1865
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:29.870
<v Speaker 1>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a blade from somewhere around </v>

1866
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.870
<v Speaker 1>1511.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think.</v>

1867
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:34.220
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get your hands on this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a gift from my business </v>

1868
01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:35.130
<v Speaker 1>associate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aubrey Marcus,</v>

1869
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:36.830
<v Speaker 1>a good buddy of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1870
01:30:37.050 --> 01:30:39.420
<v Speaker 1>we're in business at onnit together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave me this.</v>

1871
01:30:39.570 --> 01:30:41.040
<v Speaker 1>That's quite a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1872
01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:42.960
<v Speaker 1>it's quite a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real thing.</v>

1873
01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:45.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not one of these blades that once </v>
<v Speaker 1>you take out,</v>

1874
01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:46.800
<v Speaker 1>you go to draw blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

1875
01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:47.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1876
01:30:47.371 --> 01:30:48.280
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>

1877
01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:53.560
<v Speaker 1>We go this a military unit in the UK </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the workers that come from the </v>

1878
01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:58.161
<v Speaker 1>poll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been a tradition for a couple of </v>

1879
01:30:58.161 --> 01:30:58.161
<v Speaker 1>hundred years and they have these funded</v>
<v Speaker 1>little knives hooks on.</v>

1880
01:30:58.161 --> 01:30:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're weird.</v>

1881
01:30:58.590 --> 01:31:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ate the lives and once they draw </v>

1882
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:05.931
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they're at the sheath that they're </v>

1883
01:31:05.931 --> 01:31:08.721
<v Speaker 1>not allowed to put them back into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got Blood on him so they have to cut </v>

1884
01:31:08.721 --> 01:31:08.721
<v Speaker 1>themselves and the Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody,</v>

1885
01:31:08.721 --> 01:31:13.020
<v Speaker 1>anybody Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like a weird excuse to cut </v>

1886
01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:13.130
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1887
01:31:13.810 --> 01:31:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean doesn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a pretty rigid requirement.</v>

1888
01:31:16.831 --> 01:31:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Don't draw unless you're going to draw </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>

1889
01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:20.360
<v Speaker 1>What can I tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1890
01:31:20.610 --> 01:31:21.900
<v Speaker 1>being a soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tufts stuff,</v>

1891
01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:24.410
<v Speaker 1>it is as tough as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1892
01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Now that says something about your film </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure is you're dealing with a a </v>

1893
01:31:29.731 --> 01:31:34.731
<v Speaker 1>different time and that life back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although always precious.</v>

1894
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:39.780
<v Speaker 1>The finite aspect of life is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>solidified.</v>

1895
01:31:39.781 --> 01:31:41.370
<v Speaker 1>It's more obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more.</v>

1896
01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:46.420
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a daily basis as opposed to the way </v>

1897
01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:46.420
<v Speaker 1>we live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1898
01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I think there's all sorts of advantages </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

1899
01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:49.410
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking down the barrel of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun,</v>

1900
01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:54.950
<v Speaker 1>nothing so busy looking down the barrel </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a gun and we've managed to distract </v>

1901
01:31:55.771 --> 01:32:00.190
<v Speaker 1>ourselves by be comfortable</v>

1902
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:05.220
<v Speaker 2>liberal lives that we lead and that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>price for that is that we don't really </v>

1903
01:32:05.831 --> 01:32:10.831
<v Speaker 2>accept the full accountancy of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we do give ourselves crutches where </v>

1904
01:32:10.831 --> 01:32:13.360
<v Speaker 2>you look down the barrel of a gun or </v>
<v Speaker 2>your crutches and taken away.</v>

1905
01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:19.020
<v Speaker 2>So I suppose in different periods of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time you didn't have to.</v>

1906
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:24.270
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have the indulgence of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to worry about what people thought </v>

1907
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:28.600
<v Speaker 2>of you because there were more important</v>
<v Speaker 2>things to worry about.</v>

1908
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1909
01:32:29.811 --> 01:32:32.360
<v Speaker 1>There were more important things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about than social media.</v>

1910
01:32:32.361 --> 01:32:34.820
<v Speaker 1>You have to worry about arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swords,</v>

1911
01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:36.130
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1912
01:32:36.170 --> 01:32:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Constant.</v>

1913
01:32:37.210 --> 01:32:40.350
<v Speaker 2>The thing is that even come back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mongols,</v>

1914
01:32:40.770 --> 01:32:45.210
<v Speaker 2>so what was his desire for gain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His desire for gain with the more people</v>

1915
01:32:45.211 --> 01:32:47.400
<v Speaker 2>appreciate and respect me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the more I'll be,</v>

1916
01:32:48.450 --> 01:32:52.470
<v Speaker 2>is there anything else that kills people</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than that motivation?</v>

1917
01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1918
01:32:56.151 --> 01:32:57.860
<v Speaker 2>not even like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just doing about murder,</v>

1919
01:32:57.970 --> 01:33:02.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole genesis of murder is based on </v>

1920
01:33:02.970 --> 01:33:04.640
<v Speaker 2>the principle that someone has more </v>
<v Speaker 2>power than me,</v>

1921
01:33:04.641 --> 01:33:09.641
<v Speaker 2>so I have to take that power away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or my comparative sense of self feels </v>

1922
01:33:10.311 --> 01:33:13.730
<v Speaker 2>augmented if I can take that life away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1923
01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:15.050
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comes back to the same thing.</v>

1924
01:33:15.051 --> 01:33:20.051
<v Speaker 2>You're really asking someone to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you are and if you have </v>

1925
01:33:20.051 --> 01:33:22.100
<v Speaker 2>paradoxically and ironically if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed them,</v>

1926
01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:25.550
<v Speaker 2>that makes you more powerful than them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although they can no longer bear witness</v>

1927
01:33:25.551 --> 01:33:30.551
<v Speaker 2>or they did bear witness for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what does bear witness is the story </v>

1928
01:33:30.551 --> 01:33:33.260
<v Speaker 2>in your mind that somehow you are now </v>
<v Speaker 2>more powerful</v>

1929
01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:36.980
<v Speaker 1>or just fucking hate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want them around anymore,</v>

1930
01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:39.290
<v Speaker 1>but why did you hate them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're threatening.</v>

1931
01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Threatening to some way a threatening in</v>

1932
01:33:42.891 --> 01:33:47.891
<v Speaker 1>some way that somehow they can diminish </v>
<v Speaker 1>your idea of who you are or you find </v>

1933
01:33:48.411 --> 01:33:49.760
<v Speaker 1>them repugnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their actions,</v>

1934
01:33:49.761 --> 01:33:53.940
<v Speaker 1>repugnant dangers to their society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something then that's not murder,</v>

1935
01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:56.550
<v Speaker 1>then it's just eliminating an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1936
01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Or eliminating a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1937
01:33:59.690 --> 01:34:04.690
<v Speaker 1>If you could go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've often thought about this as </v>

1938
01:34:04.690 --> 01:34:08.291
<v Speaker 1>technology evolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like will there be come a point in time </v>

1939
01:34:08.291 --> 01:34:09.020
<v Speaker 1>where you can have a window to a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>era,</v>

1940
01:34:09.230 --> 01:34:14.230
<v Speaker 1>like we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll time machines ever be a thing </v>

1941
01:34:14.230 --> 01:34:17.540
<v Speaker 1>where there's a time where you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually go back and view the past.</v>

1942
01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Is there a period?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1943
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:21.350
<v Speaker 1>zero period that you wanted to quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot</v>

1944
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:26.150
<v Speaker 2>because of google earth on one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a good porn on google earth,</v>

1945
01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:30.320
<v Speaker 2>so where I live in wheelchair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guard house in English,</v>

1946
01:34:30.321 --> 01:34:35.321
<v Speaker 2>countryside next door to stonehenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go on Google plus where they </v>

1947
01:34:35.331 --> 01:34:40.331
<v Speaker 2>plowed the fields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see where there had been burial </v>

1948
01:34:40.331 --> 01:34:41.450
<v Speaker 2>sites for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

1949
01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:46.500
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stonehenge is about five and a half </v>

1950
01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:46.640
<v Speaker 2>thousand years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all around that area,</v>

1951
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:49.190
<v Speaker 2>in these plow fields you can see they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>still got married,</v>

1952
01:34:49.191 --> 01:34:54.191
<v Speaker 2>old bounds and a burial mounds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatnot and the whole earth is littered </v>

1953
01:34:57.170 --> 01:35:02.170
<v Speaker 2>with prehistorical earthworks and burial</v>
<v Speaker 2>sites and there were burial sites that </v>

1954
01:35:05.150 --> 01:35:07.880
<v Speaker 2>we have this thing called Ordinance </v>
<v Speaker 2>survey which registers.</v>

1955
01:35:07.881 --> 01:35:08.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you will have the same thing.</v>

1956
01:35:08.991 --> 01:35:10.630
<v Speaker 2>He was registered is everything on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>

1957
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:12.830
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everything of any historical value,</v>

1958
01:35:12.831 --> 01:35:17.831
<v Speaker 2>there's a map and they tell you what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>foot paths are and the roads are and </v>

1959
01:35:17.831 --> 01:35:19.130
<v Speaker 2>everything's been highly detailed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how high the mountains are and the roads</v>

1960
01:35:19.131 --> 01:35:24.131
<v Speaker 2>and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a bit of an Anorak for that.</v>

1961
01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:27.080
<v Speaker 2>You know the expression and right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a geek.</v>

1962
01:35:27.310 --> 01:35:30.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know those guys at trains and planes</v>

1963
01:35:30.261 --> 01:35:32.240
<v Speaker 2>and they usually wear those jackets go </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1964
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Anorexia is where the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>counseling,</v>

1965
01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:38.470
<v Speaker 2>so I'm a bit of an Anorak for </v>
<v Speaker 2>typography.</v>

1966
01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.810
<v Speaker 2>The history of typography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you go and Google Earth.</v>

1967
01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.840
<v Speaker 2>This was a bit of a wet dream as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was concerned because I could spend </v>

1968
01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.960
<v Speaker 2>hours and hours pouring over landscape </v>
<v Speaker 2>and around my house.</v>

1969
01:35:51.261 --> 01:35:53.900
<v Speaker 2>You can find these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these burial sites that no one knows</v>

1970
01:35:53.901 --> 01:35:55.820
<v Speaker 2>existed and is only as good as google </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

1971
01:35:55.850 --> 01:36:00.850
<v Speaker 2>It's just an arm confident that still </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only person that knows these </v>

1972
01:36:00.850 --> 01:36:01.730
<v Speaker 2>burial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These burial sites exist.</v>

1973
01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.770
<v Speaker 2>So how do you know their barriers sites?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you seeing?</v>

1974
01:36:03.850 --> 01:36:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Because you can build up a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an understanding of pattern recognition.</v>

1975
01:36:09.591 --> 01:36:14.591
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see an established burial site </v>

1976
01:36:14.591 --> 01:36:15.770
<v Speaker 2>which is seen as a prehistorical </v>
<v Speaker 2>parasite bronze age or whatever it is,</v>

1977
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:21.250
<v Speaker 2>and then you get step a mile to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right and then you can find one under a </v>

1978
01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:25.310
<v Speaker 2>plowed field where they've got rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mounds,</v>

1979
01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:30.460
<v Speaker 2>but you can still see the depressions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't exactly the same shape as </v>

1980
01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:32.120
<v Speaker 2>the depression's a mile to the right.</v>

1981
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:35.420
<v Speaker 2>And then you can build up a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern.</v>

1982
01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:38.780
<v Speaker 2>So this is the area where you get crop </v>
<v Speaker 2>circles.</v>

1983
01:36:39.010 --> 01:36:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1984
01:36:39.891 --> 01:36:44.480
<v Speaker 2>And then you can build up a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture which is a much bigger picture.</v>

1985
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:49.810
<v Speaker 2>And then you can start to predict where </v>
<v Speaker 2>one burial site is going to be and it's </v>

1986
01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:52.490
<v Speaker 2>a bit like finding treasure and you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to 100 yards that direction,</v>

1987
01:36:52.491 --> 01:36:55.940
<v Speaker 2>$200 and it should be about a bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

1988
01:36:55.941 --> 01:37:00.230
<v Speaker 2>You can see half of these depressions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it runs into a word or whatever</v>

1989
01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:05.231
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this staff that exists and you </v>

1990
01:37:05.231 --> 01:37:06.080
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have known before Google Earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>came along.</v>

1991
01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:09.220
<v Speaker 2>How much work has been done on like </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to study those things?</v>

1992
01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is on Joel quite a lot,</v>

1993
01:37:11.271 --> 01:37:12.730
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is prehistorical,</v>

1994
01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:15.560
<v Speaker 2>so they're really the only thing that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is arrowheads,</v>

1995
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:18.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And burial mounts and every now and then</v>

1996
01:37:18.141 --> 01:37:23.141
<v Speaker 2>they dig one up and then they find a </v>
<v Speaker 2>boat buried with a lot of gold and that </v>

1997
01:37:23.141 --> 01:37:24.020
<v Speaker 2>happens every now and then.</v>

1998
01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there isn't much evidence that was </v>

1999
01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:29.930
<v Speaker 2>left behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2000
01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:34.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of these things are just amount of </v>

2001
01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:34.960
<v Speaker 2>earth with few bones it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's kind of crazy because that's an</v>

2002
01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:37.070
<v Speaker 2>area where people have been living for </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>

2003
01:37:37.071 --> 01:37:40.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not like people went away and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>came back and now you're trying to,</v>

2004
01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:45.500
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have consistently lived in that </v>

2005
01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:45.500
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2006
01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:45.650
<v Speaker 2>and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see things like that horse,</v>

2007
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:48.200
<v Speaker 2>that stone horse in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the countryside.</v>

2008
01:37:48.201 --> 01:37:53.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The course was a big man with a big </v>

2009
01:37:53.201 --> 01:37:55.991
<v Speaker 2>willie to who's made that chalk chalk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can look him up.</v>

2010
01:37:56.031 --> 01:38:00.210
<v Speaker 2>He is a man with the big white willie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2011
01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:05.340
<v Speaker 2>anyone in that area that you have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different emblems of what represented </v>

2012
01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:10.230
<v Speaker 2>tribes or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we now live in the UK,</v>

2013
01:38:10.231 --> 01:38:15.231
<v Speaker 2>which is the United Kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a legacy that,</v>

2014
01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:17.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean you'll have the same here.</v>

2015
01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:22.440
<v Speaker 2>There is a legacy there that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can trace back step by step for </v>

2016
01:38:24.091 --> 01:38:26.260
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years and we get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2017
01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:31.280
<v Speaker 2>get my not around the Romans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a couple of thousand years ago </v>

2018
01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:34.821
<v Speaker 2>and the Romans been kicking around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>UK a couple of thousand years and then </v>

2019
01:38:34.821 --> 01:38:36.840
<v Speaker 2>they went and then in came the saxons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2020
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:39.720
<v Speaker 2>and then after the saxons than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>French came in.</v>

2021
01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:43.350
<v Speaker 2>And then the French basically took over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the UK in 10,</v>

2022
01:38:43.351 --> 01:38:48.351
<v Speaker 2>66.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have the culture that we </v>

2023
01:38:48.351 --> 01:38:48.900
<v Speaker 2>have now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can see,</v>

2024
01:38:48.930 --> 01:38:53.930
<v Speaker 2>you somehow you forget that it go that </v>
<v Speaker 2>your culture goes on for thousands of </v>

2025
01:38:55.530 --> 01:38:59.490
<v Speaker 2>years and you accept really what we see </v>
<v Speaker 2>as history is the last 6,000</v>

2026
01:38:59.491 --> 01:39:00.600
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>5,000</v>

2027
01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:03.510
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you can have a connection to it</v>

2028
01:39:03.511 --> 01:39:05.910
<v Speaker 2>and it goes back further than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to get.</v>

2029
01:39:05.911 --> 01:39:09.510
<v Speaker 2>You're not around the Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nevermind the bronze age.</v>

2030
01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and almost what is that?</v>

2031
01:39:12.031 --> 01:39:13.860
<v Speaker 2>There's the guy with the big willie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2032
01:39:14.670 --> 01:39:16.380
<v Speaker 2>What an odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old is that?</v>

2033
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Then I say I'm old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2034
01:39:19.770 --> 01:39:24.770
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of that that goes on around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy running that you fully erect </v>

2035
01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:28.890
<v Speaker 2>with a giant club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How strange and there's a bunch of these</v>

2036
01:39:28.891 --> 01:39:33.891
<v Speaker 2>and they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They understand the origins of these </v>

2037
01:39:33.891 --> 01:39:33.891
<v Speaker 2>things and they know where they came </v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

2038
01:39:33.891 --> 01:39:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I have no is the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are later.</v>

2039
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:40.560
<v Speaker 2>They look quite primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think these are later.</v>

2040
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:46.430
<v Speaker 2>How strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that whole area is littered in this </v>

2041
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:49.300
<v Speaker 2>sort of paraphernalia if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2042
01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:53.520
<v Speaker 2>and they don't necessarily know who did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it or why now,</v>

2043
01:39:53.521 --> 01:39:58.521
<v Speaker 2>but what's exciting to someone like me </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you aren't going through any </v>

2044
01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:02.370
<v Speaker 2>other conduit and I suppose it's what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2045
01:40:02.371 --> 01:40:07.110
<v Speaker 2>It's the mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the mythology of all of this,</v>

2046
01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:10.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's your road into it as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

2047
01:40:10.710 --> 01:40:12.540
<v Speaker 2>You're not cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any history books,</v>

2048
01:40:13.050 --> 01:40:15.570
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing it and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovering treasure.</v>

2049
01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.550
<v Speaker 2>You can access it on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Google Earth,</v>

2050
01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:23.190
<v Speaker 2>and you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is anyone else doing this?</v>

2051
01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:28.560
<v Speaker 2>Why would they be doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started doing it because I wanted to </v>

2052
01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:31.011
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember some aspects on some </v>

2053
01:40:31.011 --> 01:40:31.011
<v Speaker 2>poem Atlanta before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2054
01:40:31.011 --> 01:40:31.011
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a burial site.</v>

2055
01:40:31.011 --> 01:40:31.770
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a little look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then before,</v>

2056
01:40:31.771 --> 01:40:36.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breadcrumbs lead to bakeries and you </v>

2057
01:40:36.771 --> 01:40:37.770
<v Speaker 2>find yourself filling your boots with </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the pastries in the world.</v>

2058
01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's something very exciting about </v>

2059
01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:45.951
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in reference to what it was that you </v>

2060
01:40:45.951 --> 01:40:45.951
<v Speaker 2>said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I could go back to any time,</v>

2061
01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:50.970
<v Speaker 2>a lot of cut back for a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I'd go back for for long.</v>

2062
01:40:51.310 --> 01:40:56.310
<v Speaker 2>I see that the period that we're living </v>
<v Speaker 2>in is the most exciting period to live </v>

2063
01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.620
<v Speaker 2>on this planet.</v>

2064
01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:05.220
<v Speaker 2>And not not least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because of what we've been talking </v>

2065
01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:09.781
<v Speaker 2>about stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that going to be the thing that </v>

2066
01:41:09.781 --> 01:41:13.740
<v Speaker 2>allows you and I to age more gracefully </v>
<v Speaker 2>and without so much pain?</v>

2067
01:41:15.130 --> 01:41:20.130
<v Speaker 2>We have enough wealth that we can live a</v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable life.</v>

2068
01:41:21.101 --> 01:41:26.101
<v Speaker 2>If you decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you choose to live a comfortable </v>

2069
01:41:26.101 --> 01:41:28.411
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have medicine that we'd never had </v>

2070
01:41:28.411 --> 01:41:29.920
<v Speaker 2>before this period in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2071
01:41:30.490 --> 01:41:33.490
<v Speaker 2>We are still complaining was still </v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining,</v>

2072
01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:38.140
<v Speaker 2>but if we could just remember what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>are comparatively,</v>

2073
01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:41.290
<v Speaker 2>where the position we are in history </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparatively.</v>

2074
01:41:41.890 --> 01:41:43.330
<v Speaker 2>It's an end to all complaints.</v>

2075
01:41:44.190 --> 01:41:45.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comparatively for sure.</v>

2076
01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:48.060
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting too when you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>

2077
01:41:48.090 --> 01:41:53.090
<v Speaker 3>the use of technology and how what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can do now with stem cells in </v>

2078
01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:53.470
<v Speaker 3>comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pesticide,</v>

2079
01:41:53.490 --> 01:41:58.490
<v Speaker 3>because it's really exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emerging time but similar like the use </v>

2080
01:41:58.490 --> 01:42:01.030
<v Speaker 3>of google earth to discover these mounds</v>
<v Speaker 3>and things and we see what's going on in</v>

2081
01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:06.080
<v Speaker 3>the Amazon now they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're discovering evidence of </v>

2082
01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:08.190
<v Speaker 3>civilizations that were just rumors and </v>
<v Speaker 3>myths like the gold city,</v>

2083
01:42:08.191 --> 01:42:13.191
<v Speaker 3>the ancient gold city that there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that movie that there is a lost </v>

2084
01:42:13.191 --> 01:42:13.191
<v Speaker 3>city of Z.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2085
01:42:13.410 --> 01:42:18.410
<v Speaker 3>They're finding these established </v>
<v Speaker 3>irrigation paths and city grids in the </v>

2086
01:42:20.611 --> 01:42:24.180
<v Speaker 3>Amazon jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thousands and thousands of years old and</v>

2087
01:42:24.181 --> 01:42:27.030
<v Speaker 3>they don't know the origins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know who was there.</v>

2088
01:42:27.090 --> 01:42:30.240
<v Speaker 3>They don't know why they're constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the culture was like,</v>

2089
01:42:30.450 --> 01:42:35.450
<v Speaker 3>but this was all at one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just mythological and now they're </v>

2090
01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:36.200
<v Speaker 3>realizing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2091
01:42:36.210 --> 01:42:36.510
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2092
01:42:36.511 --> 01:42:38.220
<v Speaker 3>this is history and this is.</v>

2093
01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:43.220
<v Speaker 3>They've been told and passed down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these fables and now we understand </v>

2094
01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:46.701
<v Speaker 3>there's an actual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a concrete physical grid rather </v>

2095
01:42:46.701 --> 01:42:47.010
<v Speaker 3>that you can go and you could see like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2096
01:42:47.011 --> 01:42:51.300
<v Speaker 3>these are real cities that did exist and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the jungle is sort of engulfed them.</v>

2097
01:42:51.301 --> 01:42:53.430
<v Speaker 3>It's taken over them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing,</v>

2098
01:42:53.770 --> 01:42:55.650
<v Speaker 3>eh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a thing bulaff oh,</v>

2099
01:42:55.651 --> 01:42:57.270
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's allowing,</v>

2100
01:42:57.310 --> 01:43:02.310
<v Speaker 3>and this is only step one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Google Earth is going to give </v>

2101
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:05.391
<v Speaker 3>way to some sort of a magnetic resonance</v>
<v Speaker 3>type thing where they're going to be </v>

2102
01:43:05.391 --> 01:43:06.960
<v Speaker 3>able to look deep into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what we're seeing now is you're,</v>

2103
01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:08.220
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

2104
01:43:08.221 --> 01:43:13.221
<v Speaker 3>Now we're exploring the surface of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth and we're finding all these </v>

2105
01:43:13.221 --> 01:43:13.230
<v Speaker 3>characteristics that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2106
01:43:13.231 --> 01:43:16.740
<v Speaker 3>this is a body or this is a a burial </v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

2107
01:43:16.741 --> 01:43:19.560
<v Speaker 3>This is a pathway that was probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>irrigation,</v>

2108
01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:24.860
<v Speaker 3>but I think they're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with technology that allows you </v>

2109
01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:27.540
<v Speaker 3>to do the same thing but look deep into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground and then I think you're gonna</v>

2110
01:43:27.541 --> 01:43:32.541
<v Speaker 3>be able to find all kinds of crazy shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same way they can understand like </v>

2111
01:43:32.541 --> 01:43:35.430
<v Speaker 3>the complete topography of the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ocean now and if you look at some of</v>

2112
01:43:35.431 --> 01:43:40.431
<v Speaker 3>those maps that show the ocean and </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally shows the depths at every </v>

2113
01:43:40.431 --> 01:43:44.001
<v Speaker 3>stage you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're going to be able to do </v>

2114
01:43:44.001 --> 01:43:44.001
<v Speaker 3>that deep into the surface of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

2115
01:43:44.001 --> 01:43:44.760
<v Speaker 3>They're going to be able to discover all</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of crazy stuff.</v>

2116
01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Someone keeps opening that door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you saying?</v>

2117
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:49.980
<v Speaker 3>We got to get going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why I don't allow people to come</v>

2118
01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:51.950
<v Speaker 3>ruined into a perfect God damn </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

2119
01:43:51.951 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

2120
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.840
<v Speaker 1>all I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I haven't.</v>

2121
01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:56.210
<v Speaker 1>It's great because you biggest fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>

2123
01:43:58.730 --> 01:43:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2124
01:44:00.090 --> 01:44:02.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm selling a film and I'll show you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and say it.</v>

2125

2134
01:44:18.970 --> 01:44:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not this weekend,</v>

2135
01:44:21.351 --> 01:44:23.690
<v Speaker 1>it's next weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that may the twelfth?</v>

2136
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:26.990
<v Speaker 1>It's the weekend after guardians of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy is.</v>

2137
01:44:26.991 --> 01:44:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I believe that is may the twelfth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2138
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2139
01:44:31.461 --> 01:44:36.461
<v Speaker 1>I love the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it was a tough out there that </v>

2140
01:44:36.461 --> 01:44:36.461
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

2141
01:44:36.461 --> 01:44:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I bet it is tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a crazy business when you </v>

2142
01:44:39.670 --> 01:44:39.670
<v Speaker 1>decide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll just leave you with this.</v>

2143
01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:42.680
<v Speaker 1>When you decide like to commit to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

2144
01:44:42.681 --> 01:44:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you have a gang of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>bouncing around your head.</v>

2145
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Like what makes you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2146
01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:49.010
<v Speaker 1>this is the one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's run with it.</v>

2147
01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Telling how changing and it changes by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the year.</v>

2148
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:55.250
<v Speaker 1>My next movie is Aladdin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

2149
01:44:55.251 --> 01:44:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the magic lamp.</v>

2150
01:44:56.630 --> 01:44:58.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the one really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2151
01:44:59.930 --> 01:45:01.700
<v Speaker 1>And in no small part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

2152
01:45:01.701 --> 01:45:06.701
<v Speaker 1>you get a weekend a right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that plays a little bit of a factor </v>

2153
01:45:06.701 --> 01:45:08.120
<v Speaker 1>in your motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to,</v>

2154
01:45:08.121 --> 01:45:10.670
<v Speaker 1>you don't spend three years on a movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>and no one hear about it.</v>

2155
01:45:10.730 --> 01:45:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Right a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll buy you would be very </v>

2156
01:45:15.730 --> 01:45:15.730
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll find it.</v>

2157
01:45:15.730 --> 01:45:20.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the idea of taking the genres </v>

2158
01:45:20.301 --> 01:45:22.420
<v Speaker 1>that I don't know anything about retail.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this King Arthur thing and in this </v>

2160
01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:30.701
<v Speaker 1>fantasy genre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is sort of a changed your </v>

2161
01:45:30.701 --> 01:45:31.010
<v Speaker 1>expectations for possibly considering </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:35.750
<v Speaker 1>And then Sherlock Holmes don't stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing those though.</v>

2164
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Gangster films has to be TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be TV.</v>
