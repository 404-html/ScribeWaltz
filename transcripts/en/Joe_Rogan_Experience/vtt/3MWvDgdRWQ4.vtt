<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.510
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for being here man.</v>

5
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my pleasure and honor and uh,</v>

6
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:14.880
<v Speaker 1>on the day were bill cosby goes to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pokey,</v>

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad story that a sad for some people,</v>

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>happy for others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sad that he's only going away for,</v>

9
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's a death sentence for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a man at his age.</v>

10
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Essentially it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:29.214
<v Speaker 1>He's like 81 or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be weird if justice took into </v>

12
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:33.990
<v Speaker 1>account like your health status and </v>
<v Speaker 1>awarding.</v>

13
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have done that though.</v>

14
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:37.074
<v Speaker 1>Didn't they do that with that guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was speaker Hassard who was speaker of </v>

15
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:47.661
<v Speaker 1>the house who was convicted for </v>
<v Speaker 1>molesting a large number of boys when he</v>

16
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 1>was a wrestling coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

17
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 months.</v>

19
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>15 months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine they might,</v>

20
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pure insanity in a wheelchair and</v>

21
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>he was cool.</v>

22
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have been.</v>

23
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

24
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.173
<v Speaker 1>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he was a 25 year old able bodied man </v>

25
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>who had done the exact same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have gone to jail for 15 months</v>

26
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.690
<v Speaker 1>for a admitting to Molesta a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of kids who are under his care.</v>

27
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>When he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a wrestling coach,</v>

28
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:19.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

30
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:23.140
<v Speaker 1>here's the guy in the movie was made of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

31
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.170
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A different guy now is that,</v>

32
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>that was dupont.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dupont was not a child molester.</v>

33
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 1>He was just a psychopath who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>hired a wrestlers to come live with him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wrestle with them.</v>

35
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

36
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I know one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

38
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the main guy in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

39
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:42.834
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.010
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

41
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>the two brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave and Mark Schultz,</v>

42
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers who were completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>misrepresented in the movie.</v>

44
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:53.424
<v Speaker 1>They made him out to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved this weird gay relationship </v>

45
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:56.604
<v Speaker 1>with him and doing cocaine and all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they added all sorts of shit to that </v>

46
00:01:58.981 --> 00:01:59.814
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

47
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How they do that.</v>

48
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Screenwriters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to dramatize it.</v>

49
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's sentence wasn't for child </v>
<v Speaker 1>abuse.</v>

50
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it was that.</v>

51
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.510
<v Speaker 1>It says that says the judge said it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been higher,</v>

52
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>he would have gotten more if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>statutes didn't run out.</v>

53
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>The limitation for accident in 1960s and</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies ran out to the judge,</v>

54
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>noted the punishment for such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conviction would have been far worse.</v>

55
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>I think he actually got convicted for </v>
<v Speaker 1>big transactions keeping stuff secret.</v>

56
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I had to pay fines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Statutes of limitations.</v>

58
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were talking about bill cosby that</v>

59
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:36.534
<v Speaker 1>a psychology professors and experts were</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously stating that he had some sort </v>

60
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>of problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

61
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because the media will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>have a certain narrative they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>promote and they'll sort of find,</v>

63
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>the psychologist will say the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fits that.</v>

64
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think most clinical psychologists </v>

65
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never talked to the guy,</v>

66
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going entire to diagnose him</v>

67
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.813
<v Speaker 2>from a distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what his condition is or </v>

68
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:04.264
<v Speaker 2>what his issue is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's the handful who are </v>

69
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 2>willing to kind of stick their necks out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and say something.</v>

70
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.563
<v Speaker 2>And Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's embarrassing to be a psych </v>

71
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 2>professor for that reason because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

72
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.343
<v Speaker 2>you're always kind of being represented </v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly by the people who are kind of </v>

73
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 2>being least professional about those </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of diagnoses.</v>

74
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 3>That is a real problem today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

75
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of,</v>

76
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>identity politics and this,</v>

77
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:28.954
<v Speaker 3>this inclination to draw conclusions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>to lean towards one side or the other </v>

78
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 3>instead of just looking at the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation objectively.</v>

79
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 3>And if you're not talking to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

80
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming bill cosby's a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of shit as a human being.</v>

81
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm assuming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're looking at all this,</v>

82
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:45.904
<v Speaker 3>but I've never talked to the man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what kind of crazy shit </v>

83
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:49.324
<v Speaker 3>he's got going on in his head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if all these women are telling the </v>

84
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 3>truth and seems super unlikely that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all lying.</v>

85
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean wizard and it like zero for 50 of</v>

86
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

87
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.930
<v Speaker 3>With the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

88
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.560
<v Speaker 2>He's got a deep dark streak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

89
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

90
00:04:05.181 --> 00:04:06.014
<v Speaker 2>the weird thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of people who are successful </v>

91
00:04:07.431 --> 00:04:08.264
<v Speaker 2>have a little bit of that dark streak </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have a little bit of that </v>

92
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:10.844
<v Speaker 2>sociopathy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they can kind of step back from </v>

93
00:04:13.221 --> 00:04:17.540
<v Speaker 2>normal human relations and they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>either turn it into,</v>

94
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>abuse and exploitation like cosby did or</v>

95
00:04:20.151 --> 00:04:23.120
<v Speaker 2>they can kind of civilized themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

96
00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 2>And they can harness that to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's good and,</v>

97
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:31.100
<v Speaker 2>and where they're kind of using their </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to take a different viewpoint on</v>

98
00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 2>things to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

99
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 2>analyze human behavior or invent things </v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

100
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:39.380
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

101
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.430
<v Speaker 2>propose new policies or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

102
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.830
<v Speaker 2>so I think that kind of dark streak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:49.664
<v Speaker 2>if you have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to recognize it and kind of </v>

104
00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:55.940
<v Speaker 2>tame it and work with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the people who do,</v>

105
00:04:55.941 --> 00:04:56.774
<v Speaker 2>I think can often do great things for </v>
<v Speaker 2>society and the people who don't end up </v>

106
00:05:00.141 --> 00:05:00.974
<v Speaker 2>in jail.</v>

107
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.333
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the reasons why I wanted </v>

108
00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:06.360
<v Speaker 3>to bring this up to you as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary psych professor,</v>

109
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.343
<v Speaker 3>looking at the human mind in looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior patterns and what's clearly </v>

110
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:12.743
<v Speaker 3>some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I I hesitate to call crime and </v>

111
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:17.334
<v Speaker 3>addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like an addictive pattern </v>

112
00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:20.754
<v Speaker 3>that he has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a compulsion to doing this </v>

113
00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:24.534
<v Speaker 3>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's not as simple as he wants </v>

114
00:05:27.601 --> 00:05:29.790
<v Speaker 3>women to have sex with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to have sex with them.</v>

115
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:32.040
<v Speaker 3>So he drugs them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's that simple.</v>

116
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:34.650
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some getting away with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it thing.</v>

117
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.723
<v Speaker 3>There's gotta be some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's better than everyone thing because </v>

118
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:39.000
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

119
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.770
<v Speaker 3>he's royalty in the t in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood,</v>

120
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.230
<v Speaker 3>in terms of show business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of standup comedy,</v>

121
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.900
<v Speaker 3>he's always been treated as royalty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

122
00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:52.410
<v Speaker 3>he's been allowed to essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticize anyone who wants.</v>

123
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.430
<v Speaker 3>He's rarely is there a rebuttal to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that he and</v>

124
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.083
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been criticizing the black </v>

125
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:00.734
<v Speaker 1>community for its use of bad words and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for its use of sexually explicit </v>

126
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>language and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and depictions.</v>

127
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile the entire time he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>raping people.</v>

128
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fucking</v>

129
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.333
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one thing that might happen is </v>

130
00:06:14.831 --> 00:06:15.664
<v Speaker 2>if you've got this public image as being</v>
<v Speaker 2>like squeaky clean family values and </v>

131
00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:22.360
<v Speaker 2>you've got the burden of kind of being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral exemplar like that,</v>

132
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like um,</v>

133
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.473
<v Speaker 2>televangelists right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or anybody who has a big religious </v>

134
00:06:28.451 --> 00:06:29.284
<v Speaker 2>following,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the pressure to be good all the </v>

135
00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:33.280
<v Speaker 2>time I think can kind of tip people into</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

136
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.300
<v Speaker 2>The thrill of transgression I imagine </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be quite,</v>

137
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.740
<v Speaker 2>quite kind of addictive and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real danger.</v>

138
00:06:41.741 --> 00:06:42.574
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypocrisy is why we should be really </v>

139
00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:47.194
<v Speaker 2>careful about kind of idolizing anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that degree kind of morally and </v>

140
00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:52.660
<v Speaker 2>putting that burden on them.</v>

141
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

142
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.480
<v Speaker 1>I could only imagine like being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>evangelist,</v>

143
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.020
<v Speaker 1>being someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who preached about the word of God,</v>

144
00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:04.570
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile having this weird hooker </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing like,</v>

145
00:07:04.571 --> 00:07:07.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember what was his name?</v>

146
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.953
<v Speaker 1>Ted?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ran a giant church and I believe it </v>

147
00:07:13.481 --> 00:07:16.120
<v Speaker 1>was Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the entire time.</v>

148
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.983
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a bit about them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire time we smoke in math and having </v>

149
00:07:19.421 --> 00:07:23.620
<v Speaker 1>sex with gay prostitutes and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>while he's going on about,</v>

150
00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:26.800
<v Speaker 1>it's always the guys who go on about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful gay people are.</v>

151
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.170
<v Speaker 1>They're secretly gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so common.</v>

152
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.280
<v Speaker 1>There's a little research on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not definitive,</v>

153
00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:37.890
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like a lot of Ted haggerty </v>
<v Speaker 1>like film haggard,</v>

154
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.010
<v Speaker 1>cause a lot of people,</v>

155
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.843
<v Speaker 2>well a lot of guys who are pretty like </v>
<v Speaker 2>outspokenly homophobic and like you put </v>

156
00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:48.350
<v Speaker 2>them in a sex research situation and see</v>
<v Speaker 2>what actually rouses them.</v>

157
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.190
<v Speaker 2>You show them straight or gay porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

158
00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:52.780
<v Speaker 2>And you'll have a plethysmograph and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

159
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.663
<v Speaker 2>you sensed it.</v>

160
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.960
<v Speaker 1>What's the graph?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it is my graph?</v>

161
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.910
<v Speaker 1>What does that sense is blood flow in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the penis?</v>

162
00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need one of those.</v>

163
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.163
<v Speaker 1>I need one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have it in the background of every </v>

164
00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:04.740
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you come and do the podcast,</v>

165
00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:05.574
<v Speaker 1>you had to put these electrodes on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>penis and then we were just going to </v>

166
00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:11.290
<v Speaker 1>talk about Japanese vomit porn and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tentacles.</v>

167
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the playthrough graphs don't lie because</v>

168
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm still not the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The heart lies.</v>

169
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Not those put his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my graphs.</v>

170
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.150
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

171
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.840
<v Speaker 2>the people who are often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

172
00:08:24.841 --> 00:08:27.330
<v Speaker 2>most hostile to something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have some,</v>

173
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.110
<v Speaker 2>some little issue inside that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating some conflict.</v>

174
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean normally makes sense.</v>

175
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:33.640
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

176
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.640
<v Speaker 1>the conflicted dots of the human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>who has this ideal of who they'd like to</v>

177
00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:40.800
<v Speaker 1>project and what they'd like people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they are.</v>

178
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.063
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile has this thing below the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface that is literally everything </v>

179
00:08:45.421 --> 00:08:47.580
<v Speaker 1>they despise and everything they rally </v>
<v Speaker 1>against.</v>

180
00:08:47.581 --> 00:08:49.320
<v Speaker 1>And that is their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their true nature.</v>

181
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

182
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.160
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be the office feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

183
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 1>I've known several who were closeted</v>

184
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.750
<v Speaker 3>gay men and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an awful existence.</v>

185
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.890
<v Speaker 3>They just live in this perpetual state </v>
<v Speaker 3>of just adjuncts and unease.</v>

186
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.950
<v Speaker 3>And meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

187
00:09:09.951 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 3>if this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think for the most part,</v>

188
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.953
<v Speaker 3>especially if you live in an urban </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and most part people don't </v>

189
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:18.750
<v Speaker 3>give a shit anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a almost a self imposed prison.</v>

190
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 3>And the people that do give a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the real problem.</v>

191
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:21.881
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

192
00:09:21.881 --> 00:09:23.490
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who are not gay,</v>

193
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:24.324
<v Speaker 3>who really care if someone's gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless they're trying to do a cause </v>

194
00:09:26.531 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 3>behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why do you care?</v>

195
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

196
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.870
<v Speaker 2>if somebody wants to be in the closet </v>
<v Speaker 2>about their sexuality,</v>

197
00:09:34.871 --> 00:09:35.704
<v Speaker 2>like they want to be discreet for </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional reasons or because </v>

198
00:09:38.291 --> 00:09:41.620
<v Speaker 2>investors would panic or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's totally cool.</v>

199
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:42.483
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so hard to be authentic to </v>

200
00:09:45.131 --> 00:09:45.964
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's okay to sort of acknowledge I </v>

201
00:09:48.431 --> 00:09:51.950
<v Speaker 2>have this sexuality or these </v>
<v Speaker 2>predilections and,</v>

202
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.630
<v Speaker 2>and it's up to me to kind of harness </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and deal with them and manage them.</v>

203
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.330
<v Speaker 2>And if you want to do that privately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

204
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.160
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should have that freedom.</v>

205
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.263
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't work out those little </v>

206
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.580
<v Speaker 2>demons and if you can't acknowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's authentic,</v>

207
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.800
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where you get these </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

208
00:10:08.801 --> 00:10:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Like the cosby case.</v>

209
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.653
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I believe there's a difference </v>

210
00:10:11.201 --> 00:10:12.034
<v Speaker 3>between discretion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not wanting to discuss your sexuality </v>

211
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:19.540
<v Speaker 3>and out and out hypocrisy there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are completely different thing.</v>

212
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.950
<v Speaker 3>It's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

213
00:10:20.951 --> 00:10:24.160
<v Speaker 3>like say if a guy's a ceo of some major </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporation and he happens to be gay and</v>

214
00:10:24.161 --> 00:10:24.994
<v Speaker 3>he's just not interested in all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>political nonsense and all the social </v>

215
00:10:27.551 --> 00:10:29.140
<v Speaker 3>nonsense it goes along with discussing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

216
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:29.921
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

217
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to keep it discreet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

218
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.470
<v Speaker 3>Like why should he have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if he lies to his friends,</v>

219
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:36.903
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

220
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.850
<v Speaker 3>or if he goes on the attack and media </v>
<v Speaker 3>ass that is,</v>

221
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.790
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is damnation in hell fire.</v>

222
00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.120
<v Speaker 3>We are so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

223
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.163
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a race and I have talked many times </v>

224
00:10:51.041 --> 00:10:51.874
<v Speaker 3>about how bizarre it is that we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>become really comfortable with seeing </v>

225
00:10:55.931 --> 00:10:59.640
<v Speaker 3>people have sex like on phones and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

226
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:00.563
<v Speaker 3>I pads and laptops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is such a massive part of </v>

227
00:11:04.811 --> 00:11:06.250
<v Speaker 3>Internet consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

228
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.293
<v Speaker 3>But yet so dirty and so forbidden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone comes in the room and you're </v>

229
00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:14.210
<v Speaker 3>watching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you slam the laptop shut in disgust,</v>

230
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.640
<v Speaker 3>total embarrassment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>

231
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's weird on so many levels.</v>

232
00:11:22.471 --> 00:11:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't do research on whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the psychology of porn,</v>

233
00:11:25.711 --> 00:11:26.544
<v Speaker 2>but I know people who do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that you can study it and </v>

234
00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:31.554
<v Speaker 2>everyone watches it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't even show clips at a </v>

235
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:36.540
<v Speaker 2>scientific conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

236
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:39.810
<v Speaker 2>Of what people are watching is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre.</v>

237
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.150
<v Speaker 2>A second thing that's bizarre is if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd asked people seven years ago,</v>

238
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 50s or whatever,</v>

239
00:11:48.181 --> 00:11:49.014
<v Speaker 2>what do you think will happen if there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlimited free online pornography that </v>

240
00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:53.394
<v Speaker 2>has every possible genre of humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all sexes interacting with each </v>

241
00:11:58.811 --> 00:11:59.644
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including cartoon dragons and whatever </v>

242
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.780
<v Speaker 2>they would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization will have fallen.</v>

243
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.890
<v Speaker 2>Like it would be chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It that sounds post-apocalyptic.</v>

244
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.753
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet we're living in that era and </v>

245
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.673
<v Speaker 2>people are still driving their kids to </v>
<v Speaker 2>school and seeing like morally </v>

246
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:22.471
<v Speaker 2>judgmental about politics and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to carp compartmentalize is kind</v>

247
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:27.070
<v Speaker 2>of all inspiring actually.</v>

248
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really is.</v>

249
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.383
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also our ability to adjust to </v>

250
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:34.084
<v Speaker 4>the times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of awe inspiring to you think </v>

251
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:39.070
<v Speaker 4>about the different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I've often talked about,</v>

252
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:39.933
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was in high school is I was in </v>

253
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:45.940
<v Speaker 4>high school in 1981 my freshman year of </v>
<v Speaker 4>high school.</v>

254
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.013
<v Speaker 4>And that was literally around the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>that vh one tape was introduced into </v>

255
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:52.630
<v Speaker 4>modern America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what was the,</v>

256
00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:55.150
<v Speaker 4>what was the exact year vh one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tapes were invented.</v>

257
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:55.984
<v Speaker 4>We got them in my house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in an 82 like maybe I was a </v>

258
00:12:58.991 --> 00:12:59.824
<v Speaker 4>sophomore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is right when you're about the </v>

259
00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:03.200
<v Speaker 4>horniest and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

260
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.980
<v Speaker 4>that's when porn made it into people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>houses.</v>

261
00:13:05.981 --> 00:13:08.950
<v Speaker 4>And you had to go through those beads in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the video store.</v>

262
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.100
<v Speaker 4>Do you get to the porn section?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody was like everybody but had</v>

263
00:13:12.101 --> 00:13:15.530
<v Speaker 4>blinders on and nobody looked at anybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>else and it was just terrifying.</v>

264
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:16.363
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you saw your name are there in the late </v>

265
00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:19.240
<v Speaker 4>fees?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like should I bring it back today?</v>

266
00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:20.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he paid,</v>

267
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:21.790
<v Speaker 4>I'll just keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep it bucks.</v>

268
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.240
<v Speaker 4>Three bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he just stole it costs 30 steel.</v>

269
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:26.170
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you don't have to look,</v>

270
00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:31.171
<v Speaker 4>look the guy in the face and in the 70s,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies really,</v>

271
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.550
<v Speaker 4>and her home use in the 70s on the Wiki </v>
<v Speaker 4>it says,</v>

272
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.410
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies and early eighties.</v>

273
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.433
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well maybe it was late seventies or </v>

274
00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:39.010
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My house,</v>

275
00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:42.370
<v Speaker 4>we got it around 1980 I want to say 82 </v>
<v Speaker 4>ish,</v>

276
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.650
<v Speaker 4>but it changed the world and it changed </v>
<v Speaker 4>it in a real sneaky way where nobody saw</v>

277
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:49.990
<v Speaker 4>it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the difference between the access to</v>

278
00:13:49.991 --> 00:13:54.991
<v Speaker 4>sex to the looking at sex from 1960 to </v>
<v Speaker 4>1980 20 years,</v>

279
00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.551
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

280
00:13:57.551 --> 00:13:58.384
<v Speaker 4>in terms of historically is a very short</v>
<v Speaker 4>period of time at any other time other </v>

281
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:04.780
<v Speaker 4>than today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Today it's a massive change.</v>

282
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:05.643
<v Speaker 4>Or if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you had to anticipate what it would </v>

283
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:08.830
<v Speaker 4>be like in 2038,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd be like,</v>

284
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:09.890
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

285
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.030
<v Speaker 4>all of you on mucks inventions have come</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fruition.</v>

286
00:14:13.031 --> 00:14:13.864
<v Speaker 4>We'll be living in tunnels underground </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the surface of the earth would be </v>

287
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:19.630
<v Speaker 4>190 degrees and there'll be no more </v>
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>

288
00:14:19.631 --> 00:14:20.464
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

289
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people always overestimate how much it's</v>

290
00:14:23.601 --> 00:14:26.100
<v Speaker 2>going to change in the next 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to the last 20.</v>

291
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

292
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.180
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you'd asked a bunch of,</v>

293
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.913
<v Speaker 2>let's say psychology researchers who </v>
<v Speaker 2>study like marriages and longterm </v>

294
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:36.563
<v Speaker 2>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask them in 1980 what's going to happen </v>

295
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.193
<v Speaker 2>when you have unlimited vhs porn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them might've said that'll save </v>

296
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.810
<v Speaker 2>American marriages.</v>

297
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 4>How many do you think would go with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

298
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:48.993
<v Speaker 4>All the hippies.</v>

299
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.593
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of folks would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's the way you can get your </v>

300
00:14:52.431 --> 00:14:55.880
<v Speaker 2>sexual variety needs mat and a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual fake way.</v>

301
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.073
<v Speaker 2>And so that'll reduce the pressure for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like infidelities and other folks would </v>

302
00:15:00.671 --> 00:15:01.670
<v Speaker 2>have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

303
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:03.410
<v Speaker 2>it will remind people what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing.</v>

304
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.630
<v Speaker 2>And so it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll nuke marriages.</v>

305
00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 2>The divorce rate will go to 80%</v>

306
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.590
<v Speaker 4>but then there's the third option,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the sort of the cosby ask thing</v>

307
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.290
<v Speaker 4>is that the addiction that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

308
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.250
<v Speaker 4>and maybe I can ask you about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what is it about things,</v>

309
00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:22.450
<v Speaker 4>whether it is gambling or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever video games,</v>

310
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.463
<v Speaker 4>there are things that people get </v>
<v Speaker 4>obsessed with and those things become </v>

311
00:15:27.791 --> 00:15:31.930
<v Speaker 4>almost a part of who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes over their minds so much.</v>

312
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.860
<v Speaker 4>Like if you had a pie chart of the human</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain with some folks,</v>

313
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.440
<v Speaker 4>there's a giant chunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This just porn.</v>

314
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.250
<v Speaker 4>It's like 40% of the brain's porn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

315
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.840
<v Speaker 4>Like what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is,</v>

316
00:15:43.841 --> 00:15:47.200
<v Speaker 4>what is it about the mind that makes one</v>
<v Speaker 4>obsessed,</v>

317
00:15:47.201 --> 00:15:50.050
<v Speaker 4>whether it's with gambling or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

318
00:15:50.051 --> 00:15:51.170
<v Speaker 4>the vice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the,</v>

319
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.050
<v Speaker 4>the thing that makes you</v>

320
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.140
<v Speaker 2>dick did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

321
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

322
00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.490
<v Speaker 2>one issue is people differ in their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their conscientiousness,</v>

323
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.383
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their degree of self control and their </v>

324
00:16:02.501 --> 00:16:06.370
<v Speaker 2>ability to kind of resist temptations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and keep their eyes on the target.</v>

325
00:16:06.371 --> 00:16:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Like career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>

326
00:16:08.171 --> 00:16:09.220
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

327
00:16:09.221 --> 00:16:11.410
<v Speaker 2>do the right stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

328
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.440
<v Speaker 2>other people like I just can't control </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself in any domain of life,</v>

329
00:16:16.481 --> 00:16:18.790
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>video games,</v>

330
00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:20.110
<v Speaker 2>porn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

331
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.820
<v Speaker 2>doing my homework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

332
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:23.703
<v Speaker 2>But I think we also have to cut people </v>
<v Speaker 2>some slack because remember now if </v>

333
00:16:27.221 --> 00:16:29.260
<v Speaker 2>you're a teenager and you're really into</v>
<v Speaker 2>video games,</v>

334
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.450
<v Speaker 2>call of duty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

335
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.133
<v Speaker 2>there are literally thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>designing that game to be as addictive </v>

336
00:16:36.251 --> 00:16:40.810
<v Speaker 2>as possible and Beta testing it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>refining it and,</v>

337
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.540
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the level design.</v>

338
00:16:43.541 --> 00:16:46.930
<v Speaker 2>So it gives you just the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforcers at the right pace.</v>

339
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:52.770
<v Speaker 2>And of course we're not going to be very</v>
<v Speaker 2>good at resisting that because the power</v>

340
00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:58.471
<v Speaker 2>of capitalism and tech and innovation to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of exploit our brains is,</v>

341
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.950
<v Speaker 2>is pretty awesome.</v>

342
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:06.640
<v Speaker 4>Am I being naive or are they just trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be entertaining?</v>

343
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:07.913
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to make an amazing game </v>

344
00:17:09.221 --> 00:17:11.140
<v Speaker 4>that's totally immersive and sucks you </v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

345
00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.030
<v Speaker 4>Or are they really thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

346
00:17:13.031 --> 00:17:13.864
<v Speaker 4>this Jeffrey Miller guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get him fucked up on </v>

347
00:17:15.731 --> 00:17:18.610
<v Speaker 4>battlefield earth now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the John Travolta movie,</v>

348
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That that did not succeed.</v>

349
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just say unreal tournament.</v>

350
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:24.483
<v Speaker 4>I want to get him fucked up on unreal </v>
<v Speaker 4>tournament and get him completely </v>

351
00:17:26.741 --> 00:17:30.490
<v Speaker 4>addicted to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just maximizing sales and profit</v>

352
00:17:30.491 --> 00:17:33.400
<v Speaker 4>and what are they doing it consciously </v>
<v Speaker 4>or are they just trying to make the best</v>

353
00:17:33.401 --> 00:17:36.910
<v Speaker 4>possible game that's so entertaining and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it just as a side effect,</v>

354
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.440
<v Speaker 4>it becomes a addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's s</v>

355
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

356
00:17:43.611 --> 00:17:44.444
<v Speaker 2>If you're running a video game company </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the folks actually doing the </v>

357
00:17:47.481 --> 00:17:48.710
<v Speaker 2>programming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

358
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Character design level design and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

359
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.003
<v Speaker 2>they want it to be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want it to just pick the best game </v>

360
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is just so fun to play,</v>

361
00:17:57.571 --> 00:18:01.110
<v Speaker 2>but the management knows we have to sell</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

362
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.550
<v Speaker 2>We have to make it compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to make people excited about the</v>

363
00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:07.980
<v Speaker 2>next version and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

364
00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:08.814
<v Speaker 2>the add ons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's kind of like a super </v>

365
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:18.330
<v Speaker 2>ego and ed issue going on even within </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>

366
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.193
<v Speaker 2>whether the designers just want it to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool and management just once a viable </v>

367
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 2>commercial product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

368
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.060
<v Speaker 4>doesn't that just come with something?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

369
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:29.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

370
00:18:29.501 --> 00:18:32.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm just playing devil's advocate here </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm not exactly sure how.</v>

371
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm friends with a few guys who make </v>
<v Speaker 4>video games.</v>

372
00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.220
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cliffy B who,</v>

373
00:18:37.221 --> 00:18:38.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>worked for epic games,</v>

374
00:18:38.811 --> 00:18:41.710
<v Speaker 4>who makes a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he showed us unreal way back in the day,</v>

375
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:42.583
<v Speaker 4>even before Jamie worked here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We get to see them making unreal </v>

376
00:18:46.131 --> 00:18:47.540
<v Speaker 4>tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as it was be made.</v>

377
00:18:47.541 --> 00:18:48.320
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

378
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.280
<v Speaker 4>I went to the aid offices when they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>working on quake three,</v>

379
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.430
<v Speaker 4>which are just these amazing games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it seemed to me,</v>

380
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.840
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could be naive,</v>

381
00:18:56.841 --> 00:18:59.420
<v Speaker 4>but it seemed to me that all they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it was just trying to make awesome</v>

382
00:18:59.421 --> 00:19:00.890
<v Speaker 4>shit that they like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

383
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.200
<v Speaker 4>And then it became addictive just cause </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so good.</v>

384
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.450
<v Speaker 2>I think that's most of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

385
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this summer,</v>

386
00:19:07.861 --> 00:19:09.690
<v Speaker 2>like my girlfriend and I were each </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

387
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 2>working on our next book proposals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we each got a little bit addicted to age</v>

388
00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:16.980
<v Speaker 2>of empires hd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like back in the day,</v>

389
00:19:16.981 --> 00:19:20.370
<v Speaker 2>20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really fun because we learned a</v>

390
00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 2>lot about each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just watching each other play.</v>

391
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:28.250
<v Speaker 2>Like we had such different strategies </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in terms of like what you build,</v>

392
00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:30.630
<v Speaker 2>what you prioritize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you deal with enemies.</v>

393
00:19:30.631 --> 00:19:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing kind of personality test</v>

394
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.200
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] its own right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

395
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.980
<v Speaker 2>and we each got a little bit addicted </v>
<v Speaker 2>temporarily and in our own way.</v>

396
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.080
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think that's an intention of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the designers.</v>

397
00:19:46.081 --> 00:19:49.560
<v Speaker 2>It's just if you make anything awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's music,</v>

398
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.980
<v Speaker 2>whether it's standup comedy or sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's sex,</v>

399
00:19:52.981 --> 00:19:56.080
<v Speaker 2>whether it's long form TV drama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

400
00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.780
<v Speaker 2>like Ozark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then people want that.</v>

401
00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works.</v>

402
00:20:02.491 --> 00:20:04.230
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's brain candy.</v>

403
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw you quote you,</v>

404
00:20:06.641 --> 00:20:09.380
<v Speaker 4>you posted about Ozark after I posted </v>
<v Speaker 4>about how amazing it is.</v>

405
00:20:09.381 --> 00:20:11.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm completely wrapped up in this second</v>
<v Speaker 4>season.</v>

406
00:20:11.751 --> 00:20:13.970
<v Speaker 4>So incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you were saying how they always make</v>

407
00:20:13.971 --> 00:20:15.680
<v Speaker 4>the kids bratty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

408
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.540
<v Speaker 4>You don't have kids Dhea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll have a daughter.</v>

409
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.860
<v Speaker 4>You do 22.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

410
00:20:18.861 --> 00:20:21.080
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think she was bratty at all.</v>

411
00:20:21.081 --> 00:20:21.914
<v Speaker 4>I think she kept it remarkably together </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a teenager who's parents are </v>

412
00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:28.490
<v Speaker 4>murderers and drug dealers spoil alert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was,</v>

413
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.533
<v Speaker 4>I think she's Jimmy and she needs some </v>
<v Speaker 4>time alone where they need to talk to </v>

414
00:20:32.541 --> 00:20:32.991
<v Speaker 4>her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

415
00:20:32.991 --> 00:20:35.690
<v Speaker 4>you can't just let her go through life </v>
<v Speaker 4>hanging out with some kid who lives in a</v>

416
00:20:35.691 --> 00:20:38.240
<v Speaker 4>trailer smoking weed and steel and </v>
<v Speaker 4>books.</v>

417
00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.040
<v Speaker 2>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of warmed up to it after,</v>

418
00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:41.874
<v Speaker 2>like I'd watch the first couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>episodes and she seemed kind of Bratty </v>

419
00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:46.320
<v Speaker 2>the daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And really and that,</v>

420
00:20:46.321 --> 00:20:48.370
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then be amazing.</v>

421
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:50.280
<v Speaker 2>My kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

422
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.123
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know why all kids aren't </v>

423
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:54.310
<v Speaker 2>like her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

424
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think screenwriters get lazy about</v>

425
00:20:58.481 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>

426
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.593
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a family you need marital </v>

427
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:03.904
<v Speaker 2>conflict and you need parent offspring </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict and you need secrets and lies </v>

428
00:21:08.081 --> 00:21:09.040
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

429
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.053
<v Speaker 4>but I think the way they're handling it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is amazing because the kid doesn't have </v>

430
00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Speaker 4>that kind of conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The kid has,</v>

431
00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.000
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

432
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:16.853
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a typical sort of a relationship with </v>

433
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 4>his father where he admires his father </v>
<v Speaker 4>and his father's abilities and,</v>

434
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he seems to be,</v>

435
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.760
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think that shows fucking great.</v>

436
00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:30.490
<v Speaker 4>It's just so well read a written rather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

437
00:21:30.491 --> 00:21:33.910
<v Speaker 4>so it's so twisted and there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>

438
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 4>So many different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I get anxiety,</v>

439
00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:39.630
<v Speaker 4>I start sweating and I feel like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>buried body.</v>

440
00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that you don't really know what's</v>

441
00:21:43.071 --> 00:21:46.070
<v Speaker 2>going to happen and legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

442
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>game of thrones,</v>

443
00:21:48.321 --> 00:21:51.980
<v Speaker 2>you had that thing where any character </v>
<v Speaker 2>could die at any time.</v>

444
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what that was one of the </v>

445
00:21:55.101 --> 00:21:58.130
<v Speaker 2>major things that people watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

446
00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.473
<v Speaker 2>and I think with really good TV drama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get that kind of engagement where </v>

447
00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:05.000
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like real life.</v>

448
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:05.871
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

449
00:22:05.871 --> 00:22:08.780
<v Speaker 2>the series will continue but you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know any particular character.</v>

450
00:22:08.781 --> 00:22:09.614
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

451
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.800
<v Speaker 4>we didn't have that for most of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's really interesting.</v>

452
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:14.963
<v Speaker 4>It was through most of mass media </v>
<v Speaker 4>fiction that you saw on television in </v>

453
00:22:20.281 --> 00:22:22.260
<v Speaker 4>the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the good guy one.</v>

454
00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

455
00:22:23.311 --> 00:22:27.240
<v Speaker 4>and it was real predictable and there </v>
<v Speaker 4>was always like a little bit of drama.</v>

456
00:22:27.241 --> 00:22:29.370
<v Speaker 4>Like he might lose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he might lose.</v>

457
00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.500
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wins occasionally.</v>

458
00:22:31.501 --> 00:22:32.334
<v Speaker 4>You had something crazy like Thelma and </v>
<v Speaker 4>louise driving off the cliff and you're </v>

459
00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.960
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

460
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.200
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

461
00:22:37.201 --> 00:22:39.150
<v Speaker 4>There's off themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the end of the movie.</v>

462
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.410
<v Speaker 4>And he would leave the movie theater </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

463
00:22:40.411 --> 00:22:41.520
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

464
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.500
<v Speaker 2>what a gangster move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

465
00:22:44.501 --> 00:22:46.810
<v Speaker 2>there was a few movies like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part,</v>

466
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:47.913
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well starting in like the golden age of </v>

467
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:51.610
<v Speaker 2>cinema in the 70s the counterculture </v>
<v Speaker 2>cinema,</v>

468
00:22:51.611 --> 00:22:55.480
<v Speaker 2>you sometimes got those really profound </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprise endings.</v>

469
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:59.620
<v Speaker 2>But one thing that made an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hustler vanishing point.</v>

470
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:00.881
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

471
00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:02.880
<v Speaker 2>That was the one with the challenger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy had the challenger.</v>

472
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I forgot to suicide by storm.</v>

473
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I remember the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome car.</v>

474
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.410
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that makes me optimistic about</v>

475
00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:12.244
<v Speaker 2>America is that the same adults who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>being completely insane to each other </v>

476
00:23:17.501 --> 00:23:18.334
<v Speaker 2>about politics on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever are watching this really </v>

477
00:23:23.141 --> 00:23:24.880
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

478
00:23:24.881 --> 00:23:28.600
<v Speaker 2>emotionally insightful netflix stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

479
00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.530
<v Speaker 2>And I can't connect those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those two things.</v>

480
00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:37.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like when people aren't talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about certain issues to capable of,</v>

481
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really in appreciating really insightful</v>

482
00:23:41.141 --> 00:23:41.974
<v Speaker 2>drama that's about the subtleties of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human relationships and moral ambiguous </v>

483
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.003
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they go into the voting booth </v>

484
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.003
<v Speaker 2>or get on twitter and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like there's black and there's </v>

485
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:53.260
<v Speaker 2>white and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

486
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.820
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hate those people and I love these</v>

487
00:23:55.821 --> 00:23:59.900
<v Speaker 2>people and I can't connect the dots </v>
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>

488
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entertainment media that we </v>

489
00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:09.161
<v Speaker 2>appreciate versus the kind of ideologies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we over simplify.</v>

490
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think twitter and I think,</v>

491
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:18.810
<v Speaker 3>well twitter in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but blogs as well.</v>

492
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.673
<v Speaker 3>I think it is a horrible way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate when you are saying </v>

493
00:24:22.771 --> 00:24:25.110
<v Speaker 3>something that's in dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

494
00:24:25.111 --> 00:24:28.740
<v Speaker 3>because you're not challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's also,</v>

495
00:24:28.741 --> 00:24:31.230
<v Speaker 3>whether it's 140 characters or 280 </v>
<v Speaker 3>characters,</v>

496
00:24:31.231 --> 00:24:36.231
<v Speaker 3>I just think this limited way of writing</v>
<v Speaker 3>in text without talking to someone,</v>

497
00:24:37.141 --> 00:24:37.974
<v Speaker 3>without being in front of them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating with them and the </v>

498
00:24:39.631 --> 00:24:40.464
<v Speaker 3>subtleties of human interaction and </v>
<v Speaker 3>social cues and recognizing people's </v>

499
00:24:43.651 --> 00:24:45.390
<v Speaker 3>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just,</v>

500
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.150
<v Speaker 3>it's a piss poor way of getting your </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts out.</v>

501
00:24:48.151 --> 00:24:50.520
<v Speaker 3>And it's very non human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

502
00:24:50.521 --> 00:24:51.780
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

503
00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

504
00:24:53.191 --> 00:24:54.024
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it tends to gravitate towards cruelty </v>

505
00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.480
<v Speaker 3>because there's no consequences for </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying cruel things.</v>

506
00:25:00.481 --> 00:25:01.314
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like you're throwing a bomb </v>
<v Speaker 3>over a wall and you don't know who's </v>

507
00:25:04.201 --> 00:25:05.130
<v Speaker 3>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

508
00:25:05.131 --> 00:25:05.990
<v Speaker 3>like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

509
00:25:05.991 --> 00:25:07.530
<v Speaker 3>you're not there seeing it.</v>

510
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.350
<v Speaker 3>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something about that that I just</v>

511
00:25:10.351 --> 00:25:13.670
<v Speaker 3>think is alien to the human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's,</v>

512
00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.093
<v Speaker 3>it's having a real effect on our </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization and our culture and how we </v>

513
00:25:18.931 --> 00:25:21.810
<v Speaker 3>communicate with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's galvanizing the,</v>

514
00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:26.811
<v Speaker 3>the polar opposites and it's making </v>
<v Speaker 3>people go towards these extreme left and</v>

515
00:25:27.091 --> 00:25:30.270
<v Speaker 3>extreme rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially people that are easily led or</v>

516
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.780
<v Speaker 3>maybe not so thoughtful about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

517
00:25:33.781 --> 00:25:38.280
<v Speaker 3>the objective way that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpreting these events and not,</v>

518
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.173
<v Speaker 3>not being introspective and not looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at themselves with a critical eye and </v>

519
00:25:42.901 --> 00:25:43.734
<v Speaker 3>just engaging in this sort of back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth tribal shit with people that I </v>

520
00:25:49.081 --> 00:25:49.914
<v Speaker 3>just think is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so strange to watch and </v>

521
00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:56.430
<v Speaker 3>particularly with when you read </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and it's really well written,</v>

522
00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:57.503
<v Speaker 3>like you could tell this is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent person that's written a </v>

523
00:25:59.221 --> 00:26:03.390
<v Speaker 3>bunch of nonsense and called people </v>
<v Speaker 3>outright and Nazis.</v>

524
00:26:03.391 --> 00:26:06.180
<v Speaker 3>And what's the most recent one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

525
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.930
<v Speaker 3>that box voc speaks about the radical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

526
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.000
<v Speaker 3>This is a new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the radical,</v>

527
00:26:12.001 --> 00:26:13.280
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reactionary,</v>

528
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.130
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>

529
00:26:14.131 --> 00:26:15.570
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reactionary,</v>

530
00:26:15.571 --> 00:26:16.500
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the new one.</v>

531
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.570
<v Speaker 3>We have a new one now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's new.</v>

532
00:26:18.571 --> 00:26:20.280
<v Speaker 3>It's only like a couple of weeks old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reactionary,</v>

533
00:26:20.281 --> 00:26:21.300
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a baby.</v>

534
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's time to,</v>

535
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:25.663
<v Speaker 2>I mean the weird thing is people do have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hunger for this more primal engaged </v>

536
00:26:31.171 --> 00:26:32.004
<v Speaker 2>kind of long form discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why podcasts like this are </v>

537
00:26:34.771 --> 00:26:37.230
<v Speaker 2>really popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My people are willing to listen to,</v>

538
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to reasonably smart people talking for </v>

539
00:26:41.461 --> 00:26:46.461
<v Speaker 2>an hour three about cool topics because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the natural condition.</v>

540
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine our ancestors a hundred thousand</v>

541
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:54.030
<v Speaker 2>years ago around the campfire having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion about some fraud issue.</v>

542
00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:54.864
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would talk it through until it was </v>

543
00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:58.770
<v Speaker 2>more or less resolved or unless they at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least identified,</v>

544
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.143
<v Speaker 2>here's the things we can agree on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the things we can agree to </v>

545
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:05.240
<v Speaker 2>disagree on both twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

546
00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:08.970
<v Speaker 2>it's just the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not sitting around the campfire,</v>

547
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:10.303
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's lobbing these hand grenades over </v>

548
00:27:12.601 --> 00:27:13.434
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an infinite number of hand </v>

549
00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:16.560
<v Speaker 2>grenades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you have 30,000</v>

550
00:27:16.561 --> 00:27:18.240
<v Speaker 2>followers or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

551
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:19.074
<v Speaker 2>that's 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that might be lobbing hand </v>

552
00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:24.480
<v Speaker 2>grenades and then they might retweet to </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of other people and oh Jesus.</v>

553
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Then kier comes some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

554
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:26.783
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's on some hot button </v>
<v Speaker 2>topic that they would like to chime in </v>

555
00:27:29.491 --> 00:27:30.510
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

556
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.020
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is strange.</v>

557
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think,</v>

558
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human social psychology is,</v>

559
00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:39.564
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to reach any agreement </v>
<v Speaker 2>without a certain amount of back and </v>

560
00:27:43.201 --> 00:27:44.034
<v Speaker 2>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>preferably face to face in person with </v>

561
00:27:47.761 --> 00:27:49.350
<v Speaker 2>as much time as you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

562
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.460
<v Speaker 2>And this is why things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

563
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.370
<v Speaker 2>the sort of time limited presidential </v>
<v Speaker 2>debates drive me nuts.</v>

564
00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:01.700
<v Speaker 2>I would love to just have 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 hours of candidates.</v>

565
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:03.623
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talking it through and people can tune </v>

566
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 2>in and just here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

567
00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.430
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's six hours about foreign policy.</v>

568
00:28:11.431 --> 00:28:12.264
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what they really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then voters could have an informed </v>

569
00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:15.924
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine candidates actually learning </v>

570
00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:20.590
<v Speaker 2>something from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

571
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:21.503
<v Speaker 2>And being open and honest about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead they have to pretend that </v>

572
00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:25.104
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their ideas are rock solid and </v>

573
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:30.690
<v Speaker 2>completely well thought out and rigid </v>
<v Speaker 2>and impossible to evolve.</v>

574
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.690
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got it and you're wrong.</v>

575
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.920
<v Speaker 2>And more what my opponent wants is some </v>
<v Speaker 2>something terrible for America.</v>

576
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.150
<v Speaker 2>And God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

577
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:42.960
<v Speaker 2>when we've seen this hustle so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>times and yet it's the same hustle every</v>

578
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:45.310
<v Speaker 2>four years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

579
00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:50.780
<v Speaker 2>I hope we get to a future where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are allowed to be epistemically humble.</v>

580
00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Like here's what I don't know and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know a lot about most things.</v>

581
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Even if politicians or scientists or </v>
<v Speaker 2>media figures,</v>

582
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.770
<v Speaker 2>we're able to take that attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

583
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:01.973
<v Speaker 2>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of gets back to the hypocrisy </v>

584
00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:04.734
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

585
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Everybody inwardly knows about most </v>
<v Speaker 2>topics.</v>

586
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I know virtually nothing or I've heard a</v>
<v Speaker 2>few things third hand that I can kind of</v>

587
00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:16.720
<v Speaker 2>regurgitate at a party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

588
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.970
<v Speaker 2>But we're all kind of expected to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>an informed view about everything.</v>

589
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.830
<v Speaker 2>And this is something I try to model for</v>
<v Speaker 2>my students.</v>

590
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Like if they ask a question and I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know the answer,</v>

591
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.640
<v Speaker 2>I try to make a point of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

592
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:34.560
<v Speaker 2>let's look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

593
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.530
<v Speaker 2>That's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that you should know everything</v>

594
00:29:37.531 --> 00:29:40.170
<v Speaker 2>about everything is preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

595
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.060
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your 20 year old underground,</v>

596
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.480
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what the typical 50 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old knows,</v>

597
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:48.010
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

598
00:29:48.011 --> 00:29:50.800
<v Speaker 2>they've probably mastered most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wisdom and the world already.</v>

599
00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Or he might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

600
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:54.111
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

601
00:29:54.111 --> 00:29:57.760
<v Speaker 2>there's like gigabytes of stuff and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't possibly know at all.</v>

602
00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.123
<v Speaker 3>There's such a spectrum to the average </v>
<v Speaker 3>person that has a like a very intensive </v>

603
00:30:02.701 --> 00:30:03.534
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like say if you're involved in </v>

604
00:30:04.351 --> 00:30:06.420
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a computer coding,</v>

605
00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.430
<v Speaker 3>electronics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's 10,</v>

606
00:30:08.431 --> 00:30:11.040
<v Speaker 3>12 hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're engrossed,</v>

607
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.730
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a lot of time to focus on</v>
<v Speaker 3>other areas.</v>

608
00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:15.743
<v Speaker 3>You don't really have a lot of time to </v>
<v Speaker 3>expand your understanding of whether </v>

609
00:30:19.681 --> 00:30:21.540
<v Speaker 3>it's biology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mathematics,</v>

610
00:30:21.541 --> 00:30:22.374
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't apply to what you do for a </v>

611
00:30:23.191 --> 00:30:25.140
<v Speaker 3>living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really have very little time.</v>

612
00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.170
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this notion that you,</v>

613
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.660
<v Speaker 3>like people are embarrassed about things</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know.</v>

614
00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.810
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's really unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

615
00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:34.693
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the main stumbling points </v>

616
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.620
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to like open and honest </v>
<v Speaker 3>discourse.</v>

617
00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:41.983
<v Speaker 3>There's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not dumb if you don't know some </v>

618
00:30:43.291 --> 00:30:44.820
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

619
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.520
<v Speaker 3>you just don't know some things and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

620
00:30:47.521 --> 00:30:48.121
<v Speaker 3>no way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

621
00:30:48.121 --> 00:30:48.954
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

622
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:51.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a great point.</v>

623
00:30:51.081 --> 00:30:56.081
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have these cognitively </v>
<v Speaker 2>demanding jobs and that's not just white</v>

624
00:30:56.181 --> 00:30:59.360
<v Speaker 2>collar workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of manual trades.</v>

625
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:00.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to think about what you're </v>

626
00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:02.984
<v Speaker 2>doing and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard mental labor and then you get </v>

627
00:31:05.871 --> 00:31:06.704
<v Speaker 2>home and you have dinner and you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids and their homework and your </v>

628
00:31:09.861 --> 00:31:11.990
<v Speaker 2>family life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what are you going to do?</v>

629
00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.320
<v Speaker 2>By the time you finally have some alone </v>
<v Speaker 2>time at whatever 9:00</v>

630
00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.950
<v Speaker 2>PM are you gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

631
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.330
<v Speaker 2>turn on the nature channel and watch a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really hardcore David attenborough,</v>

632
00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal behavior documentary or you're </v>

633
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:24.490
<v Speaker 2>going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

634
00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.140
<v Speaker 2>just rewatch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

635
00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbranded or whatever.</v>

636
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

637
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:31.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

638
00:31:31.831 --> 00:31:34.050
<v Speaker 3>people want escape at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

639
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.870
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough time in the day.</v>

640
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:39.050
<v Speaker 3>One of the most beautiful things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts,</v>

641
00:31:39.051 --> 00:31:39.884
<v Speaker 3>it was completely unexpected for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that it gives me this very unusual </v>

642
00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:44.034
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to sit down and talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody without any interruptions for </v>

643
00:31:45.901 --> 00:31:48.150
<v Speaker 3>three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I could never ask someone to do in</v>

644
00:31:48.151 --> 00:31:50.370
<v Speaker 3>real life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why it never came up before.</v>

645
00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.470
<v Speaker 3>Like even to have dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you and I went out to dinner,</v>

646
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.210
<v Speaker 3>we'd be talking in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

647
00:31:54.211 --> 00:31:57.930
<v Speaker 3>maybe someone else would be with us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different conversations to be eating all</v>

648
00:31:57.931 --> 00:31:59.280
<v Speaker 3>this amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you try that?</v>

649
00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:00.163
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is good.</v>

650
00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:01.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you have to blah,</v>

651
00:32:01.111 --> 00:32:01.590
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

652
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.750
<v Speaker 3>This is like little simple </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations.</v>

653
00:32:03.751 --> 00:32:04.584
<v Speaker 3>It's fun and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not completely locked in like </v>

654
00:32:06.751 --> 00:32:10.230
<v Speaker 3>this with the headphones on through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>microphone.</v>

655
00:32:10.231 --> 00:32:13.110
<v Speaker 3>The knowledge that other people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening and that these,</v>

656
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:14.063
<v Speaker 3>these subjects that you're discussing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're allowing these ideas to play </v>

657
00:32:18.511 --> 00:32:19.344
<v Speaker 3>themselves out and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sort of moving them around and </v>

658
00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.450
<v Speaker 3>asking questions and you're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>them from different angles.</v>

659
00:32:24.451 --> 00:32:25.284
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to have that liberty and freedom to </v>

660
00:32:26.881 --> 00:32:30.930
<v Speaker 3>do that is a very rare thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for people that get to listen.</v>

661
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.943
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy Sam Harris's podcast in </v>

662
00:32:33.871 --> 00:32:35.830
<v Speaker 3>particular radio labs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite,</v>

663
00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:38.430
<v Speaker 3>but one of the th there's so many good </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones out there,</v>

664
00:32:38.431 --> 00:32:39.264
<v Speaker 3>but what's really good about them is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you get a chance to listen to </v>

665
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:48.761
<v Speaker 3>discourse uninterrupted and uncensored </v>
<v Speaker 3>undirected.</v>

666
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:51.643
<v Speaker 3>And this is something that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorely missing from the rest of our </v>

667
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:56.264
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's one of the reasons why these </v>

668
00:32:56.871 --> 00:32:58.220
<v Speaker 3>things have caught on so well.</v>

669
00:32:58.790 --> 00:32:59.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you respect the ideas that </v>

670
00:33:00.961 --> 00:33:03.900
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be willing to give time yes.</v>

671
00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.030
<v Speaker 2>And attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

672
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:05.963
<v Speaker 2>And let them kind of breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like opening a bottle of wine and just </v>

673
00:33:09.811 --> 00:33:12.030
<v Speaker 2>letting it do the aeration thing before </v>
<v Speaker 2>you pour it.</v>

674
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.073
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

675
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.060
<v Speaker 2>it's funny how much of a thirst there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

676
00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:18.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you'd asked me 10 years ago,</v>

677
00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:22.490
<v Speaker 2>would anybody ever spend three hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to a podcast,</v>

678
00:33:22.491 --> 00:33:23.211
<v Speaker 2>I would have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

679
00:33:23.211 --> 00:33:24.044
<v Speaker 2>there's just this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one way out acceleration of </v>

680
00:33:26.811 --> 00:33:31.811
<v Speaker 2>culture that's going to be faster and </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster and nobody will watch more than a</v>

681
00:33:31.971 --> 00:33:33.630
<v Speaker 2>92nd clip on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

682
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.610
<v Speaker 2>that'll be it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

683
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.013
<v Speaker 2>And instead it's the opposite way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people have a yearning for a </v>

684
00:33:39.651 --> 00:33:40.484
<v Speaker 2>more relaxed pace of dialogue that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a break from the frenetic pace </v>

685
00:33:47.061 --> 00:33:49.070
<v Speaker 2>of their work life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

686
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

687
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.680
<v Speaker 3>I think even like leaning towards things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are like tech reviews,</v>

688
00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:00.560
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are getting longer and longer when</v>

689
00:34:00.561 --> 00:34:01.430
<v Speaker 3>people are just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

690
00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.293
<v Speaker 3>there was never a television show where </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone would discuss cell phones in </v>

691
00:34:06.921 --> 00:34:10.040
<v Speaker 3>depth with no interruption for over an </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour.</v>

692
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:10.903
<v Speaker 3>That's very common now where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where someone will go over all the </v>

693
00:34:14.631 --> 00:34:16.880
<v Speaker 3>different details of a phone and let you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

694
00:34:16.881 --> 00:34:17.714
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

695
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.080
<v Speaker 3>here's what's new about the galaxy note </v>
<v Speaker 3>nine and,</v>

696
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.193
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gift fucking hundreds of thousands </v>

697
00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:24.830
<v Speaker 3>of views.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like clearly someone's missed something.</v>

698
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

699
00:34:26.721 --> 00:34:27.554
<v Speaker 2>even on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can get 25 minute reviews of </v>

700
00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.870
<v Speaker 2>like an ar 15 accessory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

701
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Not just like the rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like the red dot scope or whatever.</v>

702
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.230
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you,</v>

703
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there long but wanting reviews </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

704
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot.</v>

705
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them all.</v>

706
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:47.720
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

707
00:34:47.721 --> 00:34:49.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that's just a more natural pace </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

708
00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:53.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human human discourse because no bear in</v>

709
00:34:53.511 --> 00:34:54.950
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a hundred thousand years ago,</v>

710
00:34:54.951 --> 00:34:56.750
<v Speaker 2>sitting around the fire with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

711
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.290
<v Speaker 2>no smartphones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no video,</v>

712
00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:02.240
<v Speaker 2>no TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no movies,</v>

713
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:07.300
<v Speaker 2>no recorded music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The entertainment is each other and it's</v>

714
00:35:07.821 --> 00:35:09.890
<v Speaker 2>not rushed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the sun,</v>

715
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.233
<v Speaker 2>the sun went down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of us are going to sleep for four </v>

716
00:35:13.281 --> 00:35:14.680
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

717
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.990
<v Speaker 2>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Entertain each other with jokes.</v>

718
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

719
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:21.530
<v Speaker 2>break out the Ukulele.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't have done standup comedy,</v>

720
00:35:21.531 --> 00:35:23.420
<v Speaker 2>but there would have done sit down </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>

721
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody's probably stood up.</v>

722
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

723
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.660
<v Speaker 2>held court told some good stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

724
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good story is always valued.</v>

725
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:33.463
<v Speaker 2>Good storyteller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what my anthropologist </v>

726
00:35:35.241 --> 00:35:37.410
<v Speaker 2>colleagues tell me is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

727
00:35:37.411 --> 00:35:39.870
<v Speaker 2>your status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a tribal society,</v>

728
00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:40.704
<v Speaker 2>a small scale society is heavily </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent on not just how good a hunter </v>

729
00:35:45.451 --> 00:35:47.490
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many kids you have.</v>

730
00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:50.430
<v Speaker 2>It's how entertaining are you in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evenings.</v>

731
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.383
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the people who are just break the </v>

732
00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:56.730
<v Speaker 2>monotony or just gold there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their treasured.</v>

733
00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They give you fuel to give you energy.</v>

734
00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:00.963
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're around someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really hilarious to telling great </v>

735
00:36:03.011 --> 00:36:04.840
<v Speaker 3>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he like everyone around it was like,</v>

736
00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.240
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get fired up by it.</v>

737
00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

738
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

739
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:15.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have a rosy view of the future.</v>

740
00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:20.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm very optimistic and I think that all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chaos that we're going through right</v>

741
00:36:20.471 --> 00:36:22.870
<v Speaker 3>now politically and socially in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>

742
00:36:22.871 --> 00:36:23.704
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like this is just an adolescent </v>

743
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.640
<v Speaker 3>period of communication that we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing this,</v>

744
00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:33.840
<v Speaker 3>this open flood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we've opened up the,</v>

745
00:36:33.841 --> 00:36:34.674
<v Speaker 3>the barriers for communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can communicate now and it's </v>

746
00:36:37.691 --> 00:36:38.524
<v Speaker 3>just k and it's going to take a while </v>
<v Speaker 3>before the discourse levels out and </v>

747
00:36:44.861 --> 00:36:48.520
<v Speaker 3>you've got a lot of loud noises on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on all sides.</v>

748
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:52.060
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of people fighting for</v>
<v Speaker 3>power and fighting,</v>

749
00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:54.790
<v Speaker 3>fighting for virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting for,</v>

750
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:56.323
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever Social Brownie points they get </v>

751
00:36:58.061 --> 00:36:58.894
<v Speaker 3>by pointing out their position being </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct and your position being foolish </v>

752
00:37:02.561 --> 00:37:05.050
<v Speaker 3>and silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is the future and this is done.</v>

753
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.390
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

754
00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.950
<v Speaker 3>there's this cruel aspect to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting.</v>

755
00:37:08.951 --> 00:37:09.784
<v Speaker 3>Like when if someone missed steps and </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone says something that they regret </v>

756
00:37:12.731 --> 00:37:15.100
<v Speaker 3>and then they delete it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this cancel culture,</v>

757
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.120
<v Speaker 3>get rid of 'em off with his head because</v>
<v Speaker 3>people realize the immediacy of all this</v>

758
00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.900
<v Speaker 3>and there was terrified of it happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>to them.</v>

759
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.790
<v Speaker 3>So it's like they're just throwing rocks</v>
<v Speaker 3>at whoever might be the accused.</v>

760
00:37:27.791 --> 00:37:30.320
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

761
00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:31.653
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're going to need a whole new </v>
<v Speaker 2>set of social norms where people just </v>

762
00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.253
<v Speaker 2>calm the fuck down about this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's kind of analogist like </v>

763
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:43.490
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite books about kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social history is called dog,</v>

764
00:37:43.491 --> 00:37:47.660
<v Speaker 2>the bourgeois virtues by Deidre </v>
<v Speaker 2>mccloskey and economic historian.</v>

765
00:37:47.661 --> 00:37:48.494
<v Speaker 2>And she points out when you switch from </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Middle Ages where everyone's a </v>

766
00:37:51.431 --> 00:37:56.431
<v Speaker 2>peasant to this urbanized commercial </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture where people are mostly um,</v>

767
00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:57.663
<v Speaker 2>traders and they have little shops and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they needed to learn how to </v>

768
00:38:00.881 --> 00:38:01.714
<v Speaker 2>interact with strangers to provide value</v>
<v Speaker 2>for money and they needed a whole new </v>

769
00:38:06.221 --> 00:38:11.221
<v Speaker 2>set of virtues that had to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>reliability and thinking,</v>

770
00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.113
<v Speaker 2>what am I making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what goods or services in my providing </v>

771
00:38:15.221 --> 00:38:17.980
<v Speaker 2>that actually are useful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it took,</v>

772
00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:19.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of generations for people to </v>

773
00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:22.803
<v Speaker 2>enter that kind of capitalist mode of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what can I do that's helpful to others </v>

774
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.810
<v Speaker 2>that can support my family.</v>

775
00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:32.290
<v Speaker 2>And I think now we have a cultural shift</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we realize,</v>

776
00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:34.413
<v Speaker 2>given social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we cope with the fact that </v>

777
00:38:36.581 --> 00:38:37.414
<v Speaker 2>everybody virtue signals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody sometimes says things that </v>

778
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:41.374
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are mean and stupid and everyone's </v>

779
00:38:43.661 --> 00:38:48.661
<v Speaker 2>fallible and anything you say will be on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a permanent record basically.</v>

780
00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we cope with that?</v>

781
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:52.391
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

782
00:38:52.391 --> 00:38:53.224
<v Speaker 2>we're used to a sort of public culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>where everything is very polished and </v>

783
00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:02.190
<v Speaker 2>edited and curated and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that time has gone.</v>

784
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.753
<v Speaker 2>So we need a new set of kind of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>and moral norms that cut each other a </v>

785
00:39:08.651 --> 00:39:10.750
<v Speaker 2>lot more slack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

786
00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.193
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would agree with you and I would say </v>

787
00:39:13.401 --> 00:39:14.234
<v Speaker 3>that the inclination towards tightness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and communication and understanding </v>

788
00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.520
<v Speaker 3>should be rewarded and that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

789
00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:24.373
<v Speaker 3>we need to reward that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't want to say ostracized </v>

790
00:39:27.851 --> 00:39:31.430
<v Speaker 3>people that are inclined to go towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>this cancel culture idea,</v>

791
00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.980
<v Speaker 3>but we need to let people be aware of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

792
00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.173
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking before the podcast that </v>

793
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.090
<v Speaker 3>I have like all these emails that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't catch up on because I was gone.</v>

794
00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.230
<v Speaker 3>I was in the mountains for six days with</v>
<v Speaker 3>no cell phone service at all.</v>

795
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.320
<v Speaker 3>I felt better when I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just did.</v>

796
00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:49.453
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety that comes with being connected </v>

797
00:39:52.371 --> 00:39:53.204
<v Speaker 3>to all these people all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly checking your mentions and </v>

798
00:39:56.570 --> 00:40:00.380
<v Speaker 3>constantly looking at Google news to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find out what chaos is coming our way.</v>

799
00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.213
<v Speaker 3>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think that that's healthy </v>

800
00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.353
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I do my very best to mitigate </v>

801
00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.920
<v Speaker 3>the negative effects of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my very best is not good.</v>

802
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:17.510
<v Speaker 3>So don't think we're doing a great job </v>
<v Speaker 3>because when it's taken away from me,</v>

803
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:20.270
<v Speaker 3>and I've had this happen twice over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last few months,</v>

804
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:22.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Lanai,</v>

805
00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.173
<v Speaker 3>this small island off of why one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hawaiian islands and I broke my phone </v>

806
00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.030
<v Speaker 3>and it took a few days for them to send </v>
<v Speaker 3>me a new one and I was like,</v>

807
00:40:29.031 --> 00:40:30.170
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do I feel so good?</v>

808
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:33.740
<v Speaker 3>I feel so present and it feels so </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>

809
00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.520
<v Speaker 3>And then this last past week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing,</v>

810
00:40:37.521 --> 00:40:39.890
<v Speaker 3>no cell phone service for all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

811
00:40:39.891 --> 00:40:41.510
<v Speaker 3>And so I just felt better.</v>

812
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.473
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a funny thing even that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it happened with burning man culture </v>

813
00:40:45.431 --> 00:40:46.264
<v Speaker 2>where like when it got started in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>early nineties it was let's all come </v>

814
00:40:49.091 --> 00:40:52.510
<v Speaker 2>together and have this excitement of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interacting more.</v>

815
00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:53.883
<v Speaker 2>And now since burning man is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>few places where you don't get cell </v>

816
00:40:56.711 --> 00:40:58.960
<v Speaker 2>phone service and you can't really be </v>
<v Speaker 2>online,</v>

817
00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:00.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

818
00:41:00.281 --> 00:41:04.570
<v Speaker 2>this is such a relief because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally can't stay connected.</v>

819
00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:08.020
<v Speaker 2>And the community we're in is only </v>
<v Speaker 2>70,000</v>

820
00:41:08.021 --> 00:41:11.260
<v Speaker 2>people instead of 331</v>

821
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:14.110
<v Speaker 3>it was almost boulder that's almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>boulder,</v>

822
00:41:14.111 --> 00:41:14.944
<v Speaker 3>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think boulder's a little bit over 100 </v>

823
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.990
<v Speaker 3>so 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

824
00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:23.970
<v Speaker 3>that's a fucking big city of freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

825
00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.153
<v Speaker 2>city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it feels intimate compared to </v>

826
00:41:26.261 --> 00:41:27.710
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

827
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:28.653
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

828
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.150
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

829
00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by burning man.</v>

830
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

831
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.750
<v Speaker 1>can't go because hippies will drive me </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy and there's too much dust.</v>

832
00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:39.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I love the idea and I'm up fully </v>

833
00:41:41.181 --> 00:41:42.530
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was like a fun do,</v>

834
00:41:42.531 --> 00:41:45.650
<v Speaker 1>you could write a check like to support </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning man.</v>

835
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:48.740
<v Speaker 1>I supported as a project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an idea.</v>

836
00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.753
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily want to go there </v>
<v Speaker 1>until they got it really polished and </v>

837
00:41:51.501 --> 00:41:52.334
<v Speaker 1>worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think what the idea behind it is </v>

838
00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:56.240
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the people saying,</v>

839
00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like where this is going.</v>

840
00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to do something different.</v>

841
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Let's just try it out for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just everybody,</v>

842
00:42:07.071 --> 00:42:07.904
<v Speaker 1>let's agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get together through these days </v>

843
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:10.753
<v Speaker 1>and let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just fucking dance and we'll have </v>

844
00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:16.220
<v Speaker 1>glow sticks and where pastries and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy and do ecstasy.</v>

845
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:19.550
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>

846
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:20.563
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

847
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:25.490
<v Speaker 1>And then this thing happens and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is only a few years old.</v>

848
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:26.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

849
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:29.690
<v Speaker 1>a decade and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many years have they been doing it?</v>

850
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:31.800
<v Speaker 1>The night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first burning man.</v>

851
00:42:31.801 --> 00:42:32.634
<v Speaker 1>It was like the late eighties but it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a couple dozen people and now </v>

852
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:40.510
<v Speaker 1>it gradually grew and it really became a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty solidified subculture by probably</v>

853
00:42:41.871 --> 00:42:46.871
<v Speaker 1>the late nineties and no leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there is guy behind it.</v>

854
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.610
<v Speaker 1>There's behind the scenes leadership of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

855
00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:50.653
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's another fascinating thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is depending on the political lenses </v>

856
00:42:56.421 --> 00:42:57.254
<v Speaker 1>that you wear when you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's either like a libertarian paradise </v>

857
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.390
<v Speaker 1>or it's a communist paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

858
00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Or it's pantonium self organization of </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort.</v>

859
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:07.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

860
00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:11.030
<v Speaker 1>there certainly are people who are kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of coordinating it.</v>

861
00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:11.864
<v Speaker 1>It's just they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's tickets now you have two </v>

862
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.220
<v Speaker 1>tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get,</v>

863
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:17.660
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get tickets.</v>

864
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.750
<v Speaker 1>It's even hard to get a parking pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is my point.</v>

865
00:43:20.751 --> 00:43:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Like why would they want to limit this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

866
00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Like who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is like a bit coin thing.</v>

867
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:26.654
<v Speaker 1>Like you're arbitrarily limiting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of bitcoin or deciding there's </v>

868
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:32.740
<v Speaker 1>only a certain number and they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this with humans are just saying,</v>

869
00:43:32.741 --> 00:43:35.480
<v Speaker 1>well I can't really go over 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just,</v>

870
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what if they did?</v>

871
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:39.830
<v Speaker 1>What if they just opened up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>floodgates and said,</v>

872
00:43:39.831 --> 00:43:41.590
<v Speaker 1>anybody who wants to come to burning man</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

873
00:43:41.591 --> 00:43:43.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get get fucking crazy.</v>

874
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Just come on down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many things,</v>

875
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.990
<v Speaker 1>how many things would come?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

876
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:52.190
<v Speaker 1>half million pool boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it would be chaos,</v>

877
00:43:52.191 --> 00:43:53.024
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it would like who supplies the </v>

878
00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.693
<v Speaker 1>porter potties and the emergency medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>services and the therapists for people </v>

879
00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.970
<v Speaker 1>having bad trips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

880
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.333
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you need some infrastructure and </v>

881
00:44:08.241 --> 00:44:09.140
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

882
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:10.543
<v Speaker 1>Nevada state police have to kind of make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure there's not like murderers and </v>

883
00:44:13.791 --> 00:44:15.440
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do they come around?</v>

884
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wander around.</v>

885
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:22.100
<v Speaker 1>They police how fast you drive and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>must be so annoyed.</v>

886
00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:23.293
<v Speaker 1>Like what did they have been dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with up until Bernie man fucking </v>

887
00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:27.560
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

888
00:44:27.561 --> 00:44:30.200
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit of mass hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their cow got loose.</v>

889
00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Someone blew up a trailer</v>

890
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.090
<v Speaker 4>cause they got their mixture wrong.</v>

891
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:36.730
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

892
00:44:36.731 --> 00:44:39.200
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

893
00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:44.050
<v Speaker 2>how quickly it went from not being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing at all to being its own subculture</v>

894
00:44:44.051 --> 00:44:49.051
<v Speaker 2>with its own mooch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll moral norms and dress styles and</v>

895
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:53.590
<v Speaker 2>systems of virtue signaling and um,</v>

896
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:56.860
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

897
00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:01.860
<v Speaker 2>sort of political expectations about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what beliefs are the right ones to have,</v>

898
00:45:02.231 --> 00:45:04.930
<v Speaker 2>even though it didn't start out </v>
<v Speaker 2>political at all.</v>

899
00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:06.243
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever you get freaky you go left </v>

900
00:45:07.151 --> 00:45:07.984
<v Speaker 4>wing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you get freedom and freaky and </v>

901
00:45:10.421 --> 00:45:12.640
<v Speaker 4>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's left wing period.</v>

902
00:45:12.641 --> 00:45:14.140
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's no real,</v>

903
00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean unless it's some eyes wide shut </v>
<v Speaker 4>type shit.</v>

904
00:45:16.601 --> 00:45:19.090
<v Speaker 4>We were wearing masks and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 4>got a</v>

905
00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.470
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

906
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:25.590
<v Speaker 2>You don't typically hear people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I went to burning man,</v>

907
00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:26.443
<v Speaker 2>I dropped acid and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I realized like Mormon monogamy has </v>

908
00:45:31.081 --> 00:45:32.550
<v Speaker 2>really the proper way to live.</v>

909
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:37.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're nice people though.</v>

910
00:45:37.191 --> 00:45:39.010
<v Speaker 4>They might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

911
00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.053
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mormons are the nicest called of all </v>

912
00:45:41.361 --> 00:45:43.130
<v Speaker 4>time there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are.</v>

913
00:45:43.131 --> 00:45:44.540
<v Speaker 4>Some of the nicest folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

914
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:49.690
<v Speaker 4>If I had to say if like there's one </v>
<v Speaker 4>religion or I had to say like what are,</v>

915
00:45:50.241 --> 00:45:51.074
<v Speaker 4>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are your expectations of </v>

916
00:45:52.371 --> 00:45:54.800
<v Speaker 4>friendliness and niceness?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like wait,</v>

917
00:45:54.801 --> 00:45:56.750
<v Speaker 4>where's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where's the highest expectation?</v>

918
00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:57.920
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Mormons.</v>

919
00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.610
<v Speaker 4>That's one religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I think it's nonsense.</v>

920
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.710
<v Speaker 4>I think Joseph Smith was a little con </v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

921
00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:04.573
<v Speaker 4>1820 when he found golden tablets that </v>
<v Speaker 4>contain the loss work of Jesus and only </v>

922
00:46:08.151 --> 00:46:10.850
<v Speaker 4>he could read him cause you had a magic </v>
<v Speaker 4>rock and all that crazy shit.</v>

923
00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.013
<v Speaker 4>It is absolutely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the end result is a bunch of really </v>

924
00:46:16.191 --> 00:46:18.530
<v Speaker 4>nice folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they have a wonderful community.</v>

925
00:46:18.531 --> 00:46:19.364
<v Speaker 4>They're really nice to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once they got rid of all that polygamy </v>

926
00:46:21.321 --> 00:46:22.510
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

927
00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.760
<v Speaker 4>once they got rid of the 90 wives and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

928
00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:27.430
<v Speaker 4>dressing up like a pilgrim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

929
00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:30.650
<v Speaker 4>they became like a really nice community</v>
<v Speaker 4>of people.</v>

930
00:46:30.651 --> 00:46:32.720
<v Speaker 4>They're like generally really friendly.</v>

931
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:36.840
<v Speaker 2>So my Granddad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a business school professor,</v>

932
00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the forties,</v>

933
00:46:38.071 --> 00:46:38.904
<v Speaker 2>he moved his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his little family to Salt Lake City and </v>

934
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:41.694
<v Speaker 2>they live there for a while and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really inspired by the kind of family </v>

935
00:46:43.861 --> 00:46:44.694
<v Speaker 2>values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that was one reason he sort </v>

936
00:46:46.421 --> 00:46:51.330
<v Speaker 2>of went on to have 12 kids of his own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not that he turned mormon,</v>

937
00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:56.360
<v Speaker 2>but he thought they're onto something in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of how seriously they take,</v>

938
00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future,</v>

939
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.910
<v Speaker 2>both on earth and in the afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believe in the afterlife,</v>

940
00:47:02.911 --> 00:47:04.560
<v Speaker 2>don't they get a plan and have their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they die?</v>

941
00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:05.731
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

942
00:47:05.731 --> 00:47:07.590
<v Speaker 2>this is something I loved about the TV </v>
<v Speaker 2>series,</v>

943
00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:09.390
<v Speaker 2>the expanse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've seen it.</v>

944
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:12.210
<v Speaker 4>We keep hearing about it and I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>gotten into it yet.</v>

945
00:47:12.211 --> 00:47:14.970
<v Speaker 4>It's just too many damn shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're awesome to watch these days.</v>

946
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.010
<v Speaker 4>But as soon as I'm done with Ozark,</v>

947
00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:17.883
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna jump in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I loved about it is it's maybe a </v>

948
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:21.463
<v Speaker 2>couple of hundred years in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we've colonized Mars and the </v>

949
00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.073
<v Speaker 2>asteroid belt and there's one group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are building the first ship </v>

950
00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:29.683
<v Speaker 2>to</v>

951
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.090
<v Speaker 1>the distant star system and who's doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

952
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.070
<v Speaker 1>The Mormons of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

953
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:36.933
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it's going to be a religion </v>

954
00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.173
<v Speaker 1>that has a farsighted approach and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of pro natalist and that's </v>

955
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:50.280
<v Speaker 1>all about family values and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing their numbers and,</v>

956
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it's going to be that.</v>

957
00:47:52.481 --> 00:47:53.314
<v Speaker 1>I'm not</v>

958
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:54.343
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

959
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:58.850
<v Speaker 1>What's the social justice warriors </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting together and star ship?</v>

960
00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the um,</v>

961
00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:04.813
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Osman family photograph from one of </v>

962
00:48:08.061 --> 00:48:08.894
<v Speaker 1>their albums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early albums where they all got </v>

963
00:48:10.041 --> 00:48:13.550
<v Speaker 1>their own planet because they think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you die you get your own planet.</v>

964
00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:14.413
<v Speaker 1>And so the album was based on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept and like if you open up the </v>

965
00:48:18.621 --> 00:48:19.580
<v Speaker 1>album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

966
00:48:19.581 --> 00:48:20.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a fun planet.</v>

967
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Donnie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

968
00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Murray's got her own little asteroid </v>
<v Speaker 1>belt.</v>

969
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third,</v>

970
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:27.340
<v Speaker 1>they're totally locked and loaded to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

971
00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.950
<v Speaker 1>the interstellar colonization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's strange though.</v>

972
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's strange the blinders that people go</v>

973
00:48:34.401 --> 00:48:38.420
<v Speaker 1>on that people put on and that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would put those blinders on.</v>

974
00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Like it's almost like if you just can </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

975
00:48:42.231 --> 00:48:43.064
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just all admit Joseph Smith was </v>

976
00:48:44.481 --> 00:48:45.314
<v Speaker 1>full of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we got a good thing going on here </v>

977
00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:47.924
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>

978
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:49.063
<v Speaker 1>We're all real nice to each other and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be some real positive </v>

979
00:48:51.321 --> 00:48:52.154
<v Speaker 1>energy involved and believing in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher power and this greater good and </v>

980
00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.740
<v Speaker 1>this overwhelming sense of community </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we all have.</v>

981
00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.233
<v Speaker 1>And they have a sense of humor about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way they reacted to the South </v>

982
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Park guys doing book of Mormon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fantastic.</v>

983
00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:04.523
<v Speaker 1>It's like fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took that Hillary page ad in the </v>

984
00:49:07.431 --> 00:49:09.110
<v Speaker 1>playbook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

985
00:49:09.111 --> 00:49:09.944
<v Speaker 1>that and that is a brutal musical in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of like the way they're depicted </v>

986
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:16.303
<v Speaker 1>buffoons believing in nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to recruit these indigenous </v>

987
00:49:20.031 --> 00:49:21.200
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of,</v>

988
00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:24.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's ruthless and hilarious at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time and they're like,</v>

989
00:49:24.441 --> 00:49:26.570
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to find out more about being</v>

990
00:49:26.571 --> 00:49:28.250
<v Speaker 1>a mormon here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come,</v>

991
00:49:28.251 --> 00:49:29.150
<v Speaker 1>come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to our website.</v>

992
00:49:29.151 --> 00:49:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Come check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

993
00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:35.540
<v Speaker 1>I think having that humility and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of humor about what you're doing,</v>

994
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:41.290
<v Speaker 1>I wish we saw more of that in like </v>
<v Speaker 1>academia because there's a lot of fields</v>

995
00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:47.570
<v Speaker 1>that are very bad and don't do good </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

996
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:50.120
<v Speaker 1>but that are terribly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly serious about it.</v>

997
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Like what gender studies or dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social psychology,</v>

998
00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.613
<v Speaker 1>gender studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I posted something on instagram </v>

999
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.290
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1000
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I was at a bookstore and there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist baby.</v>

1001
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.193
<v Speaker 1>A book says feminist baby finds her </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice and it's a baby screaming into a </v>

1002
00:50:12.881 --> 00:50:14.050
<v Speaker 1>bull horn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this picture,</v>

1003
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:20.250
<v Speaker 1>baby screaming into a bull horn and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said that the lines between parody</v>

1004
00:50:21.941 --> 00:50:24.880
<v Speaker 1>and reality have never been blurrier and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people laugh,</v>

1005
00:50:24.881 --> 00:50:28.030
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people call me a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and I</v>

1006
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.920
<v Speaker 3>is one of the rare times I dove into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>comments just to take a little look,</v>

1007
00:50:30.921 --> 00:50:33.770
<v Speaker 3>see into the gates of hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look,</v>

1008
00:50:33.771 --> 00:50:34.604
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking parody folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is the baby screaming into a bull </v>

1009
00:50:37.581 --> 00:50:39.710
<v Speaker 3>horn?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What voice does she have?</v>

1010
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:40.603
<v Speaker 3>Did what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What oppression is she rallying against </v>

1011
00:50:42.911 --> 00:50:43.744
<v Speaker 3>at three months old?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is she screaming about the patriarchy </v>

1012
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.240
<v Speaker 3>when she can't even fucking talk yet and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hears more parody?</v>

1013
00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Why she fat and ugly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What kind of baby is that?</v>

1014
00:50:52.941 --> 00:50:55.010
<v Speaker 3>Baby looks like a thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't even have a chin.</v>

1015
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:57.290
<v Speaker 3>This is chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even a real baby.</v>

1016
00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.160
<v Speaker 3>It's like an m and m with legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1017
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:02.053
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she got fucked up hair and they've </v>

1018
00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:05.180
<v Speaker 3>already gendered her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put a bow on her,</v>

1019
00:51:05.181 --> 00:51:07.250
<v Speaker 3>which is really fucked up to do to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>baby.</v>

1020
00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:09.800
<v Speaker 3>You've decided that she's a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare you?</v>

1021
00:51:09.801 --> 00:51:13.100
<v Speaker 3>You piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You transphobic asshole</v>

1022
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:16.300
<v Speaker 2>and the [inaudible] is a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

1023
00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1024
00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:20.970
<v Speaker 3>she's got horror makeup on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She dressed up like a fuck clown already</v>

1025
00:51:20.971 --> 00:51:23.520
<v Speaker 3>as a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucked up hair.</v>

1026
00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Child abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big nutty eyes.</v>

1027
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:29.010
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finds her voice.</v>

1028
00:51:29.011 --> 00:51:30.660
<v Speaker 3>She found her voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic.</v>

1029
00:51:30.661 --> 00:51:33.510
<v Speaker 3>She can't talk yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a baby.</v>

1030
00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.510
<v Speaker 3>What we should all listen to the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give the baby a bull horn.</v>

1031
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Let's all gather round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got poop.</v>

1032
00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.170
<v Speaker 3>What does the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it baby saying?</v>

1033
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:45.050
<v Speaker 3>She finds her voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1034
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.730
<v Speaker 3>it's parody even at the book is </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful.</v>

1035
00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a great book.</v>

1036
00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:50.723
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a silly book that's parody </v>

1037
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:54.743
<v Speaker 3>that fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be a goddamn character on </v>

1038
00:51:56.311 --> 00:51:57.144
<v Speaker 3>south park.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A baby feminist with a bow that screams </v>

1039
00:52:00.361 --> 00:52:03.300
<v Speaker 3>at the top of her lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does this free the nipple.</v>

1040
00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:04.323
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1041
00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:07.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right now I'm hungry.</v>

1042
00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:08.800
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1043
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that from the book?</v>

1044
00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:11.950
<v Speaker 2>That's from the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess feminist baby,</v>

1045
00:52:11.951 --> 00:52:13.660
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's satire,</v>

1046
00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1047
00:52:15.581 --> 00:52:16.414
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in a field where you </v>

1048
00:52:17.711 --> 00:52:21.010
<v Speaker 2>can't tell whether something is from it </v>
<v Speaker 2>or it's city Oracle,</v>

1049
00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:21.873
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you need to lighten up about your </v>

1050
00:52:23.261 --> 00:52:24.250
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1051
00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:29.050
<v Speaker 2>And just gender studies in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

1052
00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:31.330
<v Speaker 2>in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1053
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Speaker 3>but what is it about it that leans </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself towards foolishness?</v>

1054
00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:41.343
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very hard to do good work </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a field where you have to everyday </v>

1055
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:49.063
<v Speaker 2>systematically denying common sense and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and deny the evidence of your own eyes </v>

1056
00:52:54.261 --> 00:52:56.390
<v Speaker 2>and ears about what's right in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1057
00:52:56.391 --> 00:52:57.224
<v Speaker 2>Like how sex differences work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that creates a habit of </v>

1058
00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.213
<v Speaker 2>interacting with the world in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>says what I study is going to beat </v>

1059
00:53:08.301 --> 00:53:09.134
<v Speaker 2>completely divorced from every aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 2>day to day life and everybody else I </v>

1060
00:53:14.371 --> 00:53:17.210
<v Speaker 2>encounter who's not in my field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if,</v>

1061
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:21.500
<v Speaker 2>if you allow any crosstalk between like,</v>

1062
00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.823
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1063
00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:28.140
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of blank slate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender ideology and the real world,</v>

1064
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.633
<v Speaker 2>the ideology crumbles so you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only maintain it behind this </v>

1065
00:53:34.111 --> 00:53:34.944
<v Speaker 2>wall of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of insulation and that's a terrible </v>

1066
00:53:38.701 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Speaker 2>position to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't envy the people who,</v>

1067
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:42.810
<v Speaker 2>who live their lives that way.</v>

1068
00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.613
<v Speaker 4>It all grows inside the walled gardens </v>
<v Speaker 4>of academia and outside of that it's </v>

1069
00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:50.830
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1070
00:53:50.831 --> 00:53:51.664
<v Speaker 4>you get Internet groups from people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of were indoctrinated into these </v>

1071
00:53:55.241 --> 00:53:57.130
<v Speaker 4>ideas in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in college or,</v>

1072
00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.980
<v Speaker 4>and it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in some ways there's a,</v>

1073
00:53:59.981 --> 00:54:00.814
<v Speaker 4>a leveling of the playing field that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of these ideologies present some </v>

1074
00:54:04.901 --> 00:54:07.630
<v Speaker 4>people where they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>

1075
00:54:07.631 --> 00:54:08.530
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not a freak.</v>

1076
00:54:08.531 --> 00:54:10.390
<v Speaker 4>You're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know this,</v>

1077
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.553
<v Speaker 4>there was some silly article on fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>acceptance the other day and it was </v>

1078
00:54:15.161 --> 00:54:17.350
<v Speaker 4>talking and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they got proposed,</v>

1079
00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.193
<v Speaker 4>which is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I accept people who drink except I've </v>

1080
00:54:21.421 --> 00:54:25.030
<v Speaker 4>except all kinds of unhealthy choices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But let's don't lie to me,</v>

1081
00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:25.920
<v Speaker 2>just</v>

1082
00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 4>don't lie about the physical reality of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you've done to your body.</v>

1083
00:54:29.371 --> 00:54:31.230
<v Speaker 4>If you reach 400 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>

1084
00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:33.240
<v Speaker 4>that's not healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying it's healthy.</v>

1085
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.530
<v Speaker 4>You're saying it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1086
00:54:34.531 --> 00:54:37.770
<v Speaker 4>you're just not dead yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you lost 200 pounds,</v>

1087
00:54:37.771 --> 00:54:40.650
<v Speaker 4>you would feel wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be healthier.</v>

1088
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:42.990
<v Speaker 4>Like if you smoke every day and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1089
00:54:42.991 --> 00:54:43.351
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1090
00:54:43.351 --> 00:54:45.180
<v Speaker 4>cancer smoking is healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1091
00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:46.014
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just,</v>

1092
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.960
<v Speaker 4>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body is dealing with it.</v>

1093
00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:52.200
<v Speaker 4>Your body's processing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It won't be able to forever.</v>

1094
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:53.333
<v Speaker 4>That is exactly what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're morbidly obese and for you to </v>

1095
00:54:56.131 --> 00:54:56.964
<v Speaker 4>pretend any differently and to just go </v>
<v Speaker 4>on about this fat acceptance movement </v>

1096
00:55:01.741 --> 00:55:02.574
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big beautiful this and that and </v>

1097
00:55:05.041 --> 00:55:05.431
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1098
00:55:05.431 --> 00:55:07.860
<v Speaker 4>you're obese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've eaten too much food.</v>

1099
00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:11.580
<v Speaker 4>If you see a fat guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how come he doesn't get the same sort of</v>

1100
00:55:11.581 --> 00:55:12.414
<v Speaker 4>treatment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you see a morbidly obese man in his </v>

1101
00:55:14.581 --> 00:55:15.414
<v Speaker 4>underwear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one's saying he's beautiful because </v>

1102
00:55:17.341 --> 00:55:20.970
<v Speaker 4>he's disgusting and he's fat and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>lazy and he's,</v>

1103
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.550
<v Speaker 4>he's addicted to food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all know it.</v>

1104
00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:24.683
<v Speaker 4>But if it's a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're so inclined to like acts such as </v>

1105
00:55:28.111 --> 00:55:29.070
<v Speaker 4>the care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let her go.</v>

1106
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.870
<v Speaker 4>She's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're wonderful,</v>

1107
00:55:30.871 --> 00:55:33.420
<v Speaker 4>you're beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're amazing.</v>

1108
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:38.600
<v Speaker 4>Like kid give her her space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we treat them as if they're incapable of</v>

1109
00:55:39.331 --> 00:55:43.950
<v Speaker 4>recognizing the absolute reality of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their physical being.</v>

1110
00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.250
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1111
00:55:47.251 --> 00:55:48.084
<v Speaker 2>to address both the kind of individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice level and also the kind of </v>

1112
00:55:53.461 --> 00:55:54.294
<v Speaker 2>systemic level like the food industry </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what is being promoted and what the </v>

1113
00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:01.290
<v Speaker 2>federal government promoted for ages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1114
00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:06.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was this terrible situation where you</v>

1115
00:56:07.321 --> 00:56:08.154
<v Speaker 2>could have followed exactly what the FDA</v>
<v Speaker 2>recommended and it would have been bad </v>

1116
00:56:11.551 --> 00:56:12.384
<v Speaker 2>for you for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because of lobbying and because of </v>

1117
00:56:16.891 --> 00:56:17.724
<v Speaker 2>the powers that be and an influence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the level to </v>

1118
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:24.490
<v Speaker 2>criticize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1119
00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:25.533
<v Speaker 2>If you have a systemic problem like </v>
<v Speaker 2>promotion of tobacco products and you </v>

1120
00:56:30.341 --> 00:56:32.830
<v Speaker 2>want to say for alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1121
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.950
<v Speaker 2>then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to address the tobacco industry.</v>

1122
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:40.930
<v Speaker 2>We have this bizarre situation for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1123
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.983
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where like a lot of people in my </v>

1124
00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:46.450
<v Speaker 2>department work on alcoholism treatment </v>
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>

1125
00:56:46.451 --> 00:56:47.284
<v Speaker 2>How do you get people to drink less or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they work on how do you get people to </v>

1126
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 2>stop taking opiates?</v>

1127
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:56.320
<v Speaker 2>How do you deal with opiate addiction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you make a suggestion like,</v>

1128
00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.560
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's some awesome new research showing</v>

1129
00:56:59.561 --> 00:57:02.200
<v Speaker 2>that if people switch from opiates to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabis,</v>

1130
00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.380
<v Speaker 2>it like dramatically lowers the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

1131
00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Or if they switch from alcohol to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabis,</v>

1132
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:09.303
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has all these health benefits </v>

1133
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.393
<v Speaker 2>relatively to like being an alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of considered to bu to </v>

1134
00:57:17.321 --> 00:57:22.321
<v Speaker 2>raise that and a lot of medicine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology and so forth.</v>

1135
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:25.090
<v Speaker 2>Well it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1136
00:57:25.091 --> 00:57:25.924
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're giving into people being self </v>

1137
00:57:27.551 --> 00:57:28.690
<v Speaker 2>indulgent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you say,</v>

1138
00:57:28.691 --> 00:57:29.524
<v Speaker 2>they said they should switch from one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to another in a kind of harm </v>

1139
00:57:32.411 --> 00:57:36.400
<v Speaker 2>reduction mode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like Methadone type solution.</v>

1140
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of them come out of a kind of </v>

1141
00:57:39.851 --> 00:57:43.900
<v Speaker 2>12 step program mentality where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have a disease.</v>

1142
00:57:43.901 --> 00:57:47.530
<v Speaker 2>If you ever do anything that is bad for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1143
00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:51.070
<v Speaker 2>then you've relapsed and that's feeding </v>
<v Speaker 2>your disease.</v>

1144
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I think that's idiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not the evidence shows,</v>

1145
00:57:55.781 --> 00:57:59.170
<v Speaker 2>that's not the way to treat any of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical addictions.</v>

1146
00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.240
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1147
00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:08.340
<v Speaker 2>something like cannabis as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative is it's totally marginalized</v>

1148
00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:14.290
<v Speaker 2>in academia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you really can't talk about it as a</v>

1149
00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:15.124
<v Speaker 2>valid alternative where people could </v>
<v Speaker 2>come home and they can drink or they </v>

1150
00:58:19.361 --> 00:58:20.194
<v Speaker 2>could come home and they could get high </v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe getting high for a lot of </v>

1151
00:58:22.211 --> 00:58:26.680
<v Speaker 2>people might be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's is that changing though?</v>

1152
00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:29.440
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen any evidence that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing,</v>

1153
00:58:29.441 --> 00:58:30.274
<v Speaker 2>at least within academia really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think that that would be one of </v>

1154
00:58:32.981 --> 00:58:33.814
<v Speaker 2>the first places where it does change </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the influence of the </v>

1155
00:58:36.311 --> 00:58:41.311
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical industry isn't so deeply </v>
<v Speaker 2>entwined in the system itself.</v>

1156
00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:42.513
<v Speaker 2>It's not like pharmaceutical industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are dropping off pamphlets on </v>

1157
00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:47.890
<v Speaker 2>talking points when you're giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>lectures.</v>

1158
00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the problem.</v>

1159
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:52.540
<v Speaker 2>Who gives you the research funding to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look into this?</v>

1160
00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:53.493
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>National Institute of Alcohol and </v>

1161
00:58:55.811 --> 00:58:58.570
<v Speaker 2>alcoholism or National Institute of Drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abuse.</v>

1162
00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:03.960
<v Speaker 2>If you do a grant proposal that says </v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an alternative that might work,</v>

1163
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.350
<v Speaker 2>they will shut it down because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>federal government does not.</v>

1164
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Those agencies don't want to blow back </v>
<v Speaker 2>of some senators saying,</v>

1165
00:59:13.001 --> 00:59:17.590
<v Speaker 2>how dare you fund this research that </v>
<v Speaker 2>says this is a valid alternative.</v>

1166
00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:18.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everyone who works in these areas is </v>

1167
00:59:20.441 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 2>kind of locked into a system</v>

1168
00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:23.623
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of grant funding that subject to kind </v>

1169
00:59:26.421 --> 00:59:27.470
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1170
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:30.860
<v Speaker 1>political censorship by the funding </v>
<v Speaker 1>agencies.</v>

1171
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.353
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A talking dog commercials of about 10 </v>

1172
00:59:35.001 --> 00:59:39.740
<v Speaker 1>years ago where there was a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she comes home from school and the dog's</v>

1173
00:59:39.741 --> 00:59:40.574
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lindsey really wish you wouldn't smoke </v>

1174
00:59:42.711 --> 00:59:44.660
<v Speaker 1>putt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He not the same when you do.</v>

1175
00:59:44.661 --> 00:59:48.230
<v Speaker 1>And I miss my friend and the girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there stoned out of her mind,</v>

1176
00:59:48.231 --> 00:59:49.064
<v Speaker 1>her dogs talking to her dog runs away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that the organization that </v>

1177
00:59:53.511 --> 00:59:58.460
<v Speaker 1>funded those commercials was funded by </v>
<v Speaker 1>tobacco,</v>

1178
00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:01.880
<v Speaker 1>alcohol and pharmaceutical companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1179
01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Like they're drug dealers who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>against drugs.</v>

1180
01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.220
<v Speaker 1>It's literally like hookers doing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial against strippers.</v>

1181
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:15.730
<v Speaker 1>That's literally what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we just accepted this and it was all</v>

1182
01:00:16.011 --> 01:00:18.080
<v Speaker 1>over television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was everywhere you look,</v>

1183
01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:20.570
<v Speaker 1>it became parody and he became </v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous.</v>

1184
01:00:20.571 --> 01:00:22.640
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is your brain on drugs.</v>

1185
01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.260
<v Speaker 1>You remember the eggs and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1186
01:00:24.261 --> 01:00:25.094
<v Speaker 1>I'm hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a meat million comedians had </v>

1187
01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>jokes on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me the Munchies,</v>

1188
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:29.834
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just insanity that this is </v>

1189
01:00:33.561 --> 01:00:34.394
<v Speaker 1>allowed to take place is that drugs that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill enormous numbers of people are </v>

1190
01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:44.681
<v Speaker 1>allowed to demonize drugs that kill no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one ever in the history of use.</v>

1191
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:46.303
<v Speaker 1>If you looked at that rationally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were something from some other </v>

1192
01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:49.664
<v Speaker 1>planet that was studying the human race </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you saw the way we program people </v>

1193
01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:55.933
<v Speaker 1>and the way we spend enormous sums of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to project a certain idea and get </v>

1194
01:01:02.901 --> 01:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>it into people's heads through these </v>
<v Speaker 1>very influential short,</v>

1195
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>memorable videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

1196
01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>this is a culture and a civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1197
01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an org,</v>

1198
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:17.420
<v Speaker 1>an organism that is matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is madness.</v>

1199
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often asked myself,</v>

1200
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.310
<v Speaker 1>how is this going to look in 50 or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years to whatever my,</v>

1201
01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.400
<v Speaker 1>my great grandkids or future people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>stumble upon my books or this podcast or</v>

1202
01:01:31.101 --> 01:01:31.550
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1203
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:32.383
<v Speaker 1>And I think if this would make zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense and would it be totally </v>

1204
01:01:36.081 --> 01:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing both intellectually and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethically,</v>

1205
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>then don't take it seriously and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular issue,</v>

1206
01:01:45.051 --> 01:01:45.884
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really important for </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens to understand how much of </v>

1207
01:01:49.191 --> 01:01:50.024
<v Speaker 1>science is constrained by what can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>funded by the federal government and </v>

1208
01:01:54.741 --> 01:01:55.574
<v Speaker 1>that we are not actually supported to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of research that might be </v>

1209
01:01:59.991 --> 01:02:03.860
<v Speaker 1>really helpful to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing with sex research,</v>

1210
01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:04.903
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is virtually impossible to get </v>

1211
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:10.730
<v Speaker 1>federal funding to do any kind of sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>research in America these days.</v>

1212
01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:12.373
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You write a grant to do something else </v>

1213
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:16.573
<v Speaker 1>and then you kind of do this x research </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the side using like some of the </v>

1214
01:02:19.801 --> 01:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

1215
01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do this,</v>

1216
01:02:22.051 --> 01:02:24.690
<v Speaker 2>but everybody I know does sex research </v>
<v Speaker 2>does it,</v>

1217
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.033
<v Speaker 4>is it because they're concerned that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>image of funding sex research versus </v>

1218
01:02:32.401 --> 01:02:36.260
<v Speaker 4>funding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's obesity or hunger,</v>

1219
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.210
<v Speaker 4>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

1220
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.313
<v Speaker 4>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not enough resources to go </v>

1221
01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:42.654
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would you spend any money studying </v>

1222
01:02:43.771 --> 01:02:44.604
<v Speaker 4>this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You must be</v>

1223
01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.100
<v Speaker 2>pervert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's partly that,</v>

1224
01:02:47.101 --> 01:02:48.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's partly,</v>

1225
01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:51.363
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individuals in Washington who </v>

1226
01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:58.680
<v Speaker 2>administer these grants don't want the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political flack.</v>

1227
01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:01.350
<v Speaker 2>If some politician discovers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1228
01:03:01.351 --> 01:03:03.030
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing funding on,</v>

1229
01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:07.260
<v Speaker 2>on like how women can have more orgasms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Outrageous.</v>

1230
01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1231
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:10.343
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like one of the most cost </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective ways to increase human </v>

1232
01:03:12.631 --> 01:03:15.220
<v Speaker 2>happiness I've ever heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1233
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:17.003
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people are embarrassed of or glare </v>

1234
01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.600
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Embarrassing of all sex.</v>

1235
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1236
01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.460
<v Speaker 2>marital therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>research you can do,</v>

1237
01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:27.323
<v Speaker 2>like if you want to research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you make a monogamous </v>

1238
01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:32.760
<v Speaker 2>relationship less full of stress and </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>

1239
01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:36.270
<v Speaker 2>you can get some money to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even there,</v>

1240
01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.153
<v Speaker 2>like the kind of suggestions you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>make are quite restricted in terms of </v>

1241
01:03:42.841 --> 01:03:45.990
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of therapy you're allowed to,</v>

1242
01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:51.130
<v Speaker 2>to research or talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1243
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.353
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish citizens understood this because </v>

1244
01:03:55.651 --> 01:04:00.651
<v Speaker 2>their tax dollars are not being </v>
<v Speaker 2>allocated in the best way to deliver the</v>

1245
01:04:01.081 --> 01:04:01.914
<v Speaker 2>benefits in their real lives to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>families and their relationships that </v>

1246
01:04:04.801 --> 01:04:06.330
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they could do.</v>

1247
01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:09.610
<v Speaker 4>So to bring it all back to obesity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

1248
01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:10.863
<v Speaker 4>what I would like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I bet I could say the same about </v>

1249
01:04:12.761 --> 01:04:13.594
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is we'd like to take some of these sort </v>

1250
01:04:16.331 --> 01:04:17.164
<v Speaker 4>of influential videos that we've seen </v>
<v Speaker 4>done that demonize innocuous drugs like </v>

1251
01:04:22.991 --> 01:04:23.824
<v Speaker 4>marijuana and put those on sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put those on how upbeat people are </v>

1252
01:04:28.751 --> 01:04:29.584
<v Speaker 4>addicted to sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are addicted to so many things </v>

1253
01:04:32.051 --> 01:04:32.884
<v Speaker 4>that are causing obesity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So many things that are causing us to </v>

1254
01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:37.750
<v Speaker 4>have this epidemic of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1255
01:04:37.751 --> 01:04:38.584
<v Speaker 4>If you go to Disneyland,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the saddest things in the </v>

1256
01:04:39.971 --> 01:04:40.804
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see how many people are on scooters </v>

1257
01:04:41.891 --> 01:04:45.400
<v Speaker 4>because they've eaten themselves out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their ability to be mobile on their own.</v>

1258
01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:48.760
<v Speaker 4>They're just overflowing out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>off the side of these scooters.</v>

1259
01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:50.103
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very depressing and then you see </v>

1260
01:04:51.881 --> 01:04:52.511
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're eating,</v>

1261
01:04:52.511 --> 01:04:57.511
<v Speaker 4>they're drinking slushies and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating fucking nonsense.</v>

1262
01:04:58.540 --> 01:04:59.680
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a,</v>

1263
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:04.930
<v Speaker 4>and again it's another addiction and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the availability of it is so,</v>

1264
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:05.823
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine if you were a heroin addict and </v>

1265
01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.313
<v Speaker 4>everywhere you went has heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's like to be a sugar </v>

1266
01:05:12.671 --> 01:05:14.140
<v Speaker 4>addict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're a sugar addict,</v>

1267
01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 4>every store you go into is filled with </v>
<v Speaker 4>your drug every</v>

1268
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.930
<v Speaker 1>seven 11 right when you go to pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your gas or whatever you're doing,</v>

1269
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:24.190
<v Speaker 1>it's filled with your drug right there </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of you,</v>

1270
01:05:24.191 --> 01:05:27.940
<v Speaker 1>your drugs everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1271
01:05:27.941 --> 01:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do something alternative,</v>

1272
01:05:30.221 --> 01:05:31.054
<v Speaker 1>like I've been involved in the Paleo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Movement for a few years and like my </v>

1273
01:05:34.061 --> 01:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend's Vegan and if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find good Paleo or Vegan food,</v>

1274
01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:38.824
<v Speaker 1>it's like getting a little easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not mainstream enough that </v>

1275
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>there's like a whole island walmart </v>
<v Speaker 1>devoted to it and this is a shitty I'll,</v>

1276
01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:54.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know,</v>

1277
01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:55.493
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food system is a pretty hard nut to </v>

1278
01:05:58.331 --> 01:06:02.500
<v Speaker 1>crack because there's an awful lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money at stake and the profit margins on</v>

1279
01:06:02.501 --> 01:06:05.110
<v Speaker 1>junk food are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high and it's also,</v>

1280
01:06:05.111 --> 01:06:07.150
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to keep things on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shelf.</v>

1281
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Things go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you have real fresh food,</v>

1282
01:06:09.371 --> 01:06:10.720
<v Speaker 1>it goes bad very quickly.</v>

1283
01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.050
<v Speaker 1>It's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's supposed to do.</v>

1284
01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.050
<v Speaker 1>And Good luck keeping a supermarket </v>
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>

1285
01:06:17.051 --> 01:06:19.240
<v Speaker 1>If you could only keep your vegetables </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of days.</v>

1286
01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Now if there was like long life Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be pretty sad about that.</v>

1287
01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:25.083
<v Speaker 1>But that would be sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some sort of artificial turf type </v>

1288
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Kale and stuff goes bad quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1289
01:06:33.251 --> 01:06:34.630
<v Speaker 1>it gets funky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1290
01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1291
01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of excited about new </v>
<v Speaker 1>developments like clean meat,</v>

1292
01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:41.330
<v Speaker 1>lunch meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am too,</v>

1293
01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.193
<v Speaker 1>because I think like ethically that'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be awesome and we'll see what kind of </v>

1294
01:06:44.591 --> 01:06:46.390
<v Speaker 1>monsters they make out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1295
01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:51.790
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be strange to see headless</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat slabs,</v>

1296
01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:55.460
<v Speaker 1>no central nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just grow and,</v>

1297
01:06:55.461 --> 01:06:58.720
<v Speaker 1>and trying to figure out how do they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to have like a muscle consistency,</v>

1298
01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:01.870
<v Speaker 1>like a philemon yawn or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1299
01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:02.733
<v Speaker 1>you gotta realize an animal like </v>
<v Speaker 1>different cuts of meat have a different </v>

1300
01:07:06.401 --> 01:07:07.234
<v Speaker 1>texture to them because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>different muscle density because the </v>

1301
01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:11.290
<v Speaker 1>animals use their body.</v>

1302
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.990
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll have to electrically </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulate the muscles issue.</v>

1303
01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:18.340
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of has to twitch and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

1304
01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:20.470
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people go,</v>

1305
01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did have nerves?</v>

1306
01:07:21.851 --> 01:07:24.340
<v Speaker 1>That's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would make the argument then that</v>

1307
01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:28.120
<v Speaker 1>it could feel somehow or another in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighboring dimension.</v>

1308
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.033
<v Speaker 1>It'll have like fake fake nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm excited about is you could </v>

1309
01:07:33.491 --> 01:07:37.450
<v Speaker 1>potentially have meat that's not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>from like the top three species.</v>

1310
01:07:37.451 --> 01:07:39.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could eat meat from people's pigs and</v>

1311
01:07:39.401 --> 01:07:40.380
<v Speaker 1>chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1312
01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.020
<v Speaker 1>you can eat people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeffrey.</v>

1313
01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:43.413
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my edgier tweets was like </v>

1314
01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:47.043
<v Speaker 1>celebrities will start selling pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves that can turn into like a </v>

1315
01:07:51.491 --> 01:07:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Ryan gosling stake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want,</v>

1316
01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:56.350
<v Speaker 1>encourage that bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>

1317
01:07:56.351 --> 01:07:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go down that road.</v>

1318
01:07:58.450 --> 01:07:59.290
<v Speaker 1>You're too delicious.</v>

1319
01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1320
01:08:02.321 --> 01:08:03.154
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should encourage </v>

1321
01:08:04.601 --> 01:08:07.060
<v Speaker 1>because what if people are delicious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be a real problem.</v>

1322
01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I think the lab grown people always be </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaper than like,</v>

1323
01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1324
01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.633
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could buy someone real cheap and some </v>

1325
01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:18.930
<v Speaker 1>sort of third world country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1326
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:20.180
<v Speaker 1>For food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1327
01:08:20.181 --> 01:08:22.610
<v Speaker 1>there was a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not terrible in a bad way,</v>

1328
01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:27.940
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of its revelations a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a documentary piece from vice on</v>

1329
01:08:28.431 --> 01:08:29.264
<v Speaker 1>Liberia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things about it was that </v>

1330
01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:34.400
<v Speaker 1>they were selling human meat and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1331
01:08:34.401 --> 01:08:37.670
<v Speaker 1>this guy recognized it because he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>eaten humans before.</v>

1332
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:41.750
<v Speaker 1>And so when there was a stand that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling meat on the side of the road and</v>

1333
01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:42.584
<v Speaker 1>he turned them in for selling human meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason why he knew his cause he </v>

1334
01:08:46.011 --> 01:08:46.850
<v Speaker 1>had eaten people.</v>

1335
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:48.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1336
01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>when's the next flight out of here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the Fuck Cube?</v>

1337
01:08:52.701 --> 01:08:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1338
01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.140
<v Speaker 1>if you gave me a piece of lamb and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't tell me what it was,</v>

1339
01:08:57.141 --> 01:08:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

1340
01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

1341
01:08:59.631 --> 01:09:00.464
<v Speaker 1>how many people you have to eat before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you absolutely know that somethings </v>

1342
01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:04.640
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

1343
01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.033
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of lamp chops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not bet 100% on my ability to </v>

1344
01:09:09.561 --> 01:09:14.561
<v Speaker 1>distinguished a lamb chop from say of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>veal chop or a venison chop.</v>

1345
01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:23.010
<v Speaker 1>But all of this stuff is going to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>some real moral quandaries.</v>

1346
01:09:24.951 --> 01:09:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Like there'll be this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1347
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:28.670
<v Speaker 1>what Jonathan Haidt calls moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumbfounding where you go,</v>

1348
01:09:28.671 --> 01:09:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Yuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is disgusting.</v>

1349
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

1350
01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:33.890
<v Speaker 1>It just is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1351
01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:35.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't give you a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1352
01:09:35.691 --> 01:09:36.524
<v Speaker 1>robot brothels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the more recent </v>

1353
01:09:38.421 --> 01:09:39.254
<v Speaker 1>discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ethical implications of robot </v>

<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it is.</v>

1357

<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1362
01:10:04.971 --> 01:10:05.804
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's real or one of they </v>

1380
01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:50.773
<v Speaker 1>from from old stripper style clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lap dance where they actually </v>

1381
01:10:53.781 --> 01:10:55.950
<v Speaker 1>touched you in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually started in the,</v>

1382
01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:56.923
<v Speaker 1>in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So either this is a show room where </v>

1383
01:10:58.281 --> 01:11:02.630
<v Speaker 1>customers can test and rent dolls before</v>
<v Speaker 1>deciding to purchase one.</v>

1384
01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He imagine,</v>

1385
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:07.040
<v Speaker 1>you know how like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1386
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:09.620
<v Speaker 1>they have certain cars that had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1387
01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.513
<v Speaker 1>on the lot for a while and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you thinking about buying an m for </v>

1388
01:11:12.591 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Mike Cologne?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the</v>

1389
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.120
<v Speaker 3>sucker for a spin.</v>

1390
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>y'all should read the essay.</v>

1391
01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:21.560
<v Speaker 2>My girlfriend Diana Fleischmann wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>about sex bots,</v>

1392
01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.200
<v Speaker 2>which got her a little bit of notoriety </v>
<v Speaker 2>a few months ago.</v>

1393
01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:25.280
<v Speaker 2>What was her take on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It?</v>

1394
01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Did it would be really good on balance </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a lot of guys who,</v>

1395
01:11:31.281 --> 01:11:35.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>

1396
01:11:35.021 --> 01:11:35.854
<v Speaker 2>like a sexual release and if it kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes them away from doing some like </v>

1397
01:11:42.191 --> 01:11:46.960
<v Speaker 2>exploiter to bill cosby style behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>into just doing something like this,</v>

1398
01:11:46.961 --> 01:11:49.510
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of weird and gross but </v>
<v Speaker 2>innocuous,</v>

1399
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:52.560
<v Speaker 2>like it's not hurting anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1400
01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.860
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a net win.</v>

1401
01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:57.070
<v Speaker 3>Do you make that connection because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1402
01:11:57.071 --> 01:11:59.020
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a tricky connection,</v>

1403
01:11:59.021 --> 01:12:02.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because most people who think of rape,</v>

1404
01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:07.410
<v Speaker 3>they don't think of it as an act of </v>
<v Speaker 3>arousal or sex or intimacy rather.</v>

1405
01:12:08.651 --> 01:12:11.470
<v Speaker 3>It's a thing of power at some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>creepy,</v>

1406
01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:14.140
<v Speaker 3>sociopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychopathic behavior trait.</v>

1407
01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I know that's a standard view in gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminism,</v>

1408
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.600
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's well supported by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence.</v>

1409
01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1410
01:12:22.311 --> 01:12:24.110
<v Speaker 2>there's a big problem with rape in </v>
<v Speaker 2>India,</v>

1411
01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:27.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Porn as far as I understand,</v>

1412
01:12:27.171 --> 01:12:30.590
<v Speaker 2>is illegal in India now accessible </v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

1413
01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Or is it that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's even like,</v>

1414
01:12:33.081 --> 01:12:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty hard to access porn </v>
<v Speaker 2>websites from India,</v>

1415
01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:42.010
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you legalized porn there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I predict the rate of sexual abuse would</v>

1416
01:12:43.371 --> 01:12:44.510
<v Speaker 2>drop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Willing.</v>

1417
01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

1418
01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:46.843
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a weird sort of </v>

1419
01:12:48.501 --> 01:12:53.501
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing about robots and sex is</v>

1420
01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:03.190
<v Speaker 3>they're going to get so good that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be like a person and then we're</v>

1421
01:13:03.191 --> 01:13:07.240
<v Speaker 3>going to be in this weird x Mokena sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of situation where,</v>

1422
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:09.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how would you feel?</v>

1423
01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:10.413
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if you were dancing around with </v>

1424
01:13:11.401 --> 01:13:12.234
<v Speaker 3>that really hot Japanese girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an x Mokena she starts taking off your </v>

1425
01:13:15.461 --> 01:13:16.750
<v Speaker 3>clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what do we do here?</v>

1426
01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Like she feels warm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's beautiful.</v>

1427
01:13:19.391 --> 01:13:21.280
<v Speaker 3>She smells good like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1428
01:13:21.281 --> 01:13:24.730
<v Speaker 3>all my senses are telling me this is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person and she's a good listener.</v>

1429
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:25.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's pretty,</v>

1430
01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.490
<v Speaker 3>she doesn't Nag you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't give a whole Nag.</v>

1431
01:13:27.491 --> 01:13:28.840
<v Speaker 3>You owe you man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He man's planning.</v>

1432
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.943
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not yet.</v>

1433
01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:34.590
<v Speaker 3>That's my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're correct and you have a penis,</v>

1434
01:13:34.591 --> 01:13:35.424
<v Speaker 3>you're a mansplainer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gotta be real careful about your </v>

1435
01:13:37.321 --> 01:13:38.154
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you distribute it to two ladies </v>

1436
01:13:39.571 --> 01:13:40.404
<v Speaker 3>these days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It used to be close to words being </v>

1437
01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:44.580
<v Speaker 3>patronizing and you've got this to do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1438
01:13:44.581 --> 01:13:47.940
<v Speaker 3>It also could be called being correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1439
01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:48.883
<v Speaker 3>If sometimes you correct it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to be [inaudible] explaining </v>

1440
01:13:51.631 --> 01:13:54.090
<v Speaker 3>true things as a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1441
01:13:54.091 --> 01:13:56.370
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to gender studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we circle back to this,</v>

1442
01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.233
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1443
01:13:57.570 --> 01:14:01.110
<v Speaker 3>denial of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know that there's,</v>

1444
01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:06.710
<v Speaker 3>there's this sort of really broad </v>
<v Speaker 3>spectrum of sexuality in terms of male,</v>

1445
01:14:07.531 --> 01:14:09.260
<v Speaker 3>female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of,</v>

1446
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:10.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the,</v>

1447
01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:12.500
<v Speaker 3>the obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1448
01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:17.140
<v Speaker 1>the rock on one side and Kate Upton on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

1449
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:17.711
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1450
01:14:17.711 --> 01:14:20.290
<v Speaker 1>these Super Uber female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber,</v>

1451
01:14:20.291 --> 01:14:22.450
<v Speaker 1>males.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all these,</v>

1452
01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:24.123
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the guy who was in the hobbit </v>

1453
01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.660
<v Speaker 1>illogical?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that guy he started in this sort of</v>

1454
01:14:28.661 --> 01:14:31.180
<v Speaker 1>weird space in between the two of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1455
01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And draw in this hobby.</v>

1456
01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not really androgynous,</v>

1457
01:14:34.301 --> 01:14:37.540
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you compare him to,</v>

1458
01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:39.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank,</v>

1459
01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Herschel Walker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that manly,</v>

1460
01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:43.510
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>

1461
01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:44.373
<v Speaker 1>there's women that don't feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented by these standard views of </v>

1462
01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:49.563
<v Speaker 1>female sexuality as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this just speak to the variability </v>

1463
01:14:51.851 --> 01:14:55.270
<v Speaker 1>of the human genome and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just DNA in general.</v>

1464
01:14:55.271 --> 01:14:56.104
<v Speaker 1>There's different people that breed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>different people in different shapes </v>

1465
01:14:58.931 --> 01:15:01.240
<v Speaker 1>come out until we figured out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate those shapes,</v>

1466
01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:05.470
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be right around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner with the robot fuck dolls.</v>

1467
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.333
<v Speaker 1>It seems like they're both gonna arrive </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably at the same time where you're </v>

1468
01:15:09.101 --> 01:15:10.870
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to choose from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1469
01:15:10.871 --> 01:15:12.970
<v Speaker 1>having sex with a robot or having sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the hulk.</v>

1470
01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:14.013
<v Speaker 1>Like there's going to be real </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities that everyone's going to </v>

1471
01:15:16.301 --> 01:15:17.800
<v Speaker 1>look like thor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1472
01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:20.110
<v Speaker 1>this seems like this is not too far </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

1473
01:15:20.111 --> 01:15:21.010
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

1474
01:15:21.011 --> 01:15:21.844
<v Speaker 1>three generations maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly inside of our lifetime will </v>

1475
01:15:24.581 --> 01:15:25.414
<v Speaker 1>have mastered the human form to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where the world's going to be </v>

1476
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:29.764
<v Speaker 1>preposterous and it's going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Star Wars Cantina scene everywhere </v>

1477
01:15:31.901 --> 01:15:33.130
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1478
01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:34.413
<v Speaker 1>well this is what happens whenever you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a biological innovation that opens </v>

1479
01:15:37.871 --> 01:15:41.890
<v Speaker 1>up new possibilities in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution of bodies or behaviors.</v>

1480
01:15:41.891 --> 01:15:46.540
<v Speaker 1>As you get this adaptive radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this explosion of possibilities like the</v>

1481
01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Cambrian explosion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1482
01:15:48.431 --> 01:15:49.264
<v Speaker 1>530 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals finally figured out how do you </v>

1483
01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:54.903
<v Speaker 1>program a multicellular body with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system and as soon as they got </v>

1484
01:15:58.781 --> 01:16:01.450
<v Speaker 1>that boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got all this,</v>

1485
01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:04.360
<v Speaker 1>these bizarre new forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get,</v>

1486
01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs and mammals in us.</v>

1487
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:08.223
<v Speaker 1>I think once we can program the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>genome and you have parents who are </v>

1488
01:16:12.431 --> 01:16:14.440
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

1489
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:19.470
<v Speaker 1>I want to select for kids who were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>really tall and really religious,</v>

1490
01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And other parents are like,</v>

1491
01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.513
<v Speaker 1>I want cute little hobbit babies who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hardcore atheist with furry feet </v>

1492
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:30.910
<v Speaker 1>and then you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a divergence.</v>

1493
01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if your parents decided to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>you a Hobbit,</v>

1494
01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.750
<v Speaker 1>like they could have done anything they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

1495
01:16:35.210 --> 01:16:36.043
<v Speaker 1>Remember like the first early adopters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine it's going to be about fetal </v>

1496
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:40.743
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about taking something that's in the </v>

1497
01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:43.864
<v Speaker 1>womb and manipulating it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then as it emerges and evolves and </v>

1498
01:16:47.741 --> 01:16:49.780
<v Speaker 1>grows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're gonna see what it is.</v>

1499
01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:50.763
<v Speaker 1>If you fucking parents were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic Jrr tolkien fans and you have </v>

1500
01:16:55.121 --> 01:16:57.340
<v Speaker 1>heard furry feet and two feet tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1501
01:16:57.341 --> 01:17:00.280
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck mom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you asshole.</v>

1502
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted a hobbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did want to pay me like who's either a</v>

1503
01:17:04.121 --> 01:17:06.340
<v Speaker 1>hobbit or a cave troll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you should call your boss.</v>

1504
01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's entirely possible.</v>

1505
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.963
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the sex bots will come a lot </v>

1506
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:13.760
<v Speaker 2>quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1507
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we look like?</v>

1508
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:19.520
<v Speaker 2>What do we look like right now in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of sex bots?</v>

1509
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:22.550
<v Speaker 2>What are we looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say state of the art type?</v>

1510
01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:23.384
<v Speaker 2>Google state of the art sex robot </v>
<v Speaker 2>started talking to and see what they </v>

1511
01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:28.910
<v Speaker 2>have there in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they look pretty good,</v>

1512
01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:30.350
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not good at.</v>

1513
01:17:30.351 --> 01:17:31.184
<v Speaker 2>We're good at like language or </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with eye contact or </v>

1514
01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:35.053
<v Speaker 2>handjobs movement or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there will be this tipping </v>

1515
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:42.920
<v Speaker 2>point where they can do conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good enough.</v>

1516
01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.073
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be quite as smart as </v>

1517
01:17:47.301 --> 01:17:51.500
<v Speaker 2>an actual lover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can be a hell of a lot nicer than</v>

1518
01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:52.334
<v Speaker 2>an actual lover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can have better memory for all your </v>

1519
01:17:54.081 --> 01:17:54.914
<v Speaker 2>preferences and your desires and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like it will also be more trainable </v>

1520
01:17:59.871 --> 01:18:00.704
<v Speaker 2>in terms of it'll kind of register.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh the last time I asked this question </v>

1521
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.193
<v Speaker 2>like you didn't respond much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this other question you talked for </v>

1522
01:18:09.681 --> 01:18:11.090
<v Speaker 2>five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask more of that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Be Nice.</v>

1529
01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:31.820
<v Speaker 3>First set of expecting this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>robot to just take care of your Dick and</v>

01:18:31.821 --> 01:18:32.654
<v Speaker 3>balls and just be nice to you all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and remember all the stuff you </v>

<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about it?</v>

1532
01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:41.680
<v Speaker 3>He would develop into total narcissist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sociopath with robots that we could just</v>

1533
01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:44.720
<v Speaker 3>get to do whatever we want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We bring them to the mall on a leash.</v>

1534
01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:46.543
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there are two different ways I could </v>

1535
01:18:47.721 --> 01:18:48.320
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1536
01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.550
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand,</v>

1537
01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.990
<v Speaker 2>like if there's a woman I'm interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in let's say,</v>

1538
01:18:53.991 --> 01:18:54.824
<v Speaker 2>and she has access to a male sex bot </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's like really funny cause it's like </v>

1539
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:05.470
<v Speaker 2>it's a little neural network has learned</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all of your standup routines or um,</v>

1540
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:08.930

<v Speaker 2>how to riff on today's news and,</v>

1541
01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:09.913
<v Speaker 2>and it's a great listener and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>remembers everything about her </v>

1542
01:19:13.011 --> 01:19:16.140
<v Speaker 2>backstory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can either be like,</v>

1544
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.883
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to say you're not allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see him anymore or all have to level up </v>

1545
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:29.150

<v Speaker 5>maybe day three.</v>

1607
01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.650
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1608
01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:35.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That dead chicken by buddy lilly.</v>

1609
01:22:35.370 --> 01:22:37.170
<v Speaker 5>He's realistic though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Died.</v>

1610
01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:43.110
<v Speaker 5>We just tried to open up this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Paid bottle.</v>

1611
01:22:43.111 --> 01:22:44.970
<v Speaker 5>Just celebrate by retruded coby.</v>

1612
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:52.303
<v Speaker 4>So this kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but see what I love about this is it's </v>

1613
01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.720
<v Speaker 4>so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1614
01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:57.410
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1615
01:22:57.410 --> 01:22:58.243
<v Speaker 4>this is essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean most he has them out of the </v>

1616
01:22:59.991 --> 01:23:02.000
<v Speaker 4>little sketches that he does on his </v>
<v Speaker 4>instagram page,</v>

1617
01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:05.770
<v Speaker 4>but most of his stuff is this face </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

1618
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.240
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1619
01:23:07.241 --> 01:23:08.074
<v Speaker 3>relatively new technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When one was face swap invented less </v>

1620
01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:12.860
<v Speaker 3>than a decade ago or so on your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1621
01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:14.170
<v Speaker 3>that good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty soon,</v>

1622
01:23:14.171 --> 01:23:19.171
<v Speaker 3>just a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's become this new form of comedy,</v>

1623
01:23:19.391 --> 01:23:20.650
<v Speaker 3>of sketch comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1624
01:23:20.651 --> 01:23:24.190
<v Speaker 3>and and with a guy like him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was such a good impressionist,</v>

1625
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.863
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is crude and obvious and how </v>

1626
01:23:29.951 --> 01:23:32.350
<v Speaker 3>long is it going to be before someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>can actually,</v>

1627
01:23:32.351 --> 01:23:36.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean they already have that machine </v>
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of the technology that allows</v>

1628
01:23:36.641 --> 01:23:37.474
<v Speaker 3>you to take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially someone like me who's talked </v>

1629
01:23:39.251 --> 01:23:41.740
<v Speaker 3>for countless hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take your voice,</v>

1630
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:44.630
<v Speaker 3>you take all of the recordings that I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever done,</v>

1631
01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:49.120
<v Speaker 3>this more than a thousand podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You throw them into this machine and you</v>

1632
01:23:49.121 --> 01:23:51.550
<v Speaker 3>basically have all my various </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflections,</v>

1633
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:53.590
<v Speaker 3>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sadness,</v>

1634
01:23:53.591 --> 01:23:57.820
<v Speaker 3>laughter or giddiness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perplexed,</v>

1635
01:23:58.270 --> 01:24:00.580
<v Speaker 3>all the different words that I have in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my vernacular,</v>

1636
01:24:00.730 --> 01:24:04.660
<v Speaker 3>and you put them all into this thing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of morph it around.</v>

1637
01:24:04.661 --> 01:24:09.160
<v Speaker 3>It's photoshop for voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you have the video where you can face</v>

1638
01:24:09.161 --> 01:24:09.994
<v Speaker 3>swap and manipulate people's images and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's getting better and federal at the </v>

1639
01:24:12.461 --> 01:24:13.990
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have photoshop for voice.</v>

1640
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.033
<v Speaker 3>You can essentially make movies with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people where they just do whatever you </v>

1641
01:24:17.741 --> 01:24:18.580
<v Speaker 3>want them to do.</v>

1642
01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be pretty soon,</v>

1643
01:24:21.450 --> 01:24:26.430
<v Speaker 2>totally impossible to tell a fake audio </v>
<v Speaker 2>recording from real and yeah.</v>

1644
01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:31.520
<v Speaker 2>And then fake video from real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do we do then?</v>

1645
01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:37.220
<v Speaker 2>It means we can't really trust digital </v>
<v Speaker 2>records of people in the same way.</v>

1646
01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also means you can,</v>

1647
01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:44.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be good.</v>

1648
01:24:44.011 --> 01:24:44.844
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means you can digitally sample </v>

1649
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:51.030
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's a good communicator and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do an unlimited number of,</v>

1650
01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:54.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have David Attenborough,</v>

1651
01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:56.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural history videos forever,</v>

1652
01:24:56.911 --> 01:24:57.810
<v Speaker 2>even after he's dead.</v>

1653
01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:58.893
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he could also be doing Nazi </v>

1654
01:25:00.071 --> 01:25:02.120
<v Speaker 3>propaganda videos as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1655
01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:04.930
<v Speaker 3>That's what's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could essentially,</v>

1656
01:25:04.931 --> 01:25:06.550
<v Speaker 3>it would be up to the user.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1657
01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:07.593
<v Speaker 3>So someone like kyle done again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but an evil version could take David </v>

1658
01:25:11.171 --> 01:25:13.540
<v Speaker 3>attenborough and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1659
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.280
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do whatever you want.</v>

1660
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:18.223
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like what we're saying about </v>

1661
01:25:19.141 --> 01:25:23.880
<v Speaker 3>communication that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this open floodgate of communication.</v>

1662
01:25:23.881 --> 01:25:26.430
<v Speaker 3>We're learning how to manage all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>implications of this.</v>

1663
01:25:26.490 --> 01:25:28.080
<v Speaker 3>It's really recent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1664
01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:30.330
<v Speaker 3>And I think with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1665
01:25:31.890 --> 01:25:33.420
<v Speaker 3>human relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1666
01:25:33.421 --> 01:25:35.430
<v Speaker 3>we'll have to figure out kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ethically</v>

1667
01:25:37.150 --> 01:25:37.983
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say once somebody can make like a </v>

1668
01:25:41.051 --> 01:25:45.400
<v Speaker 2>deep fake video porn of their ex lover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1669
01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.473
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the wife wife catches them </v>

1670
01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:49.060
<v Speaker 2>watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1671
01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

1672
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:53.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1673
01:25:53.981 --> 01:25:57.550
<v Speaker 2>the wife buys a sex Bot and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps it at work.</v>

1674
01:25:57.710 --> 01:25:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

1675
01:26:00.250 --> 01:26:03.010
<v Speaker 3>she didn't come home from work </v>
<v Speaker 3>exhausted,</v>

1676
01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 3>all busted</v>

1677
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.220
<v Speaker 4>up and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to watch ozark.</v>

1678
01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.353
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to hear anyone talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of her shoes broken fucking </v>

1679
01:26:11.890 --> 01:26:13.580
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1680
01:26:13.581 --> 01:26:14.660
<v Speaker 4>Is that cheating?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1681
01:26:14.661 --> 01:26:17.060
<v Speaker 4>Some people think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1682
01:26:17.061 --> 01:26:19.400
<v Speaker 4>some people think looking at porn is </v>
<v Speaker 4>cheating.</v>

1683
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:21.500
<v Speaker 4>There's that argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

1684
01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:25.670
<v Speaker 4>people have standards vary varying </v>
<v Speaker 4>levels of standards</v>

1685
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:29.540
<v Speaker 2>and they don't negotiate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't talk about it.</v>

1686
01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:32.720
<v Speaker 2>This is something my friend David Ley </v>
<v Speaker 2>points out in his book,</v>

1687
01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:34.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical porn for decks,</v>

1688
01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:38.480
<v Speaker 2>which is about responsible porn </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewership for men.</v>

1689
01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1690
01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:43.190
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in a relationship with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman and you're a straight guy,</v>

1691
01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:47.570
<v Speaker 2>you need to have the talk about what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>your girlfriend.</v>

1692
01:26:47.571 --> 01:26:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Consider cheating in terms of porn </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching.</v>

1693
01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Most guys don't have the guts to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that conversation.</v>

1694
01:26:54.861 --> 01:26:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Most women don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>

1695
01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:59.260
<v Speaker 4>there is it the guts or you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to open up that door.</v>

1696
01:26:59.261 --> 01:27:03.280
<v Speaker 4>It just keep it on the sneak tip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She can't complain and then no one knows</v>

1697
01:27:03.281 --> 01:27:05.530
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we're all good.</v>

1698
01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:06.573
<v Speaker 4>Everybody finds out yes and mile and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to the movies and y'all hold hands </v>

1699
01:27:09.671 --> 01:27:14.590
<v Speaker 4>Jeffrey and everything's fine and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>keeps push the secrets to the grave.</v>

1700
01:27:14.591 --> 01:27:15.424
<v Speaker 4>Shut down into the why you're watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Romcom you think of someone with a </v>

1701
01:27:17.861 --> 01:27:22.861
<v Speaker 4>ball gag tied up in a basement covered </v>
<v Speaker 4>in baby oil,</v>

1702
01:27:24.190 --> 01:27:26.260
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1703
01:27:26.261 --> 01:27:28.960
<v Speaker 4>Some people into a happy place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll have to go there.</v>

1704
01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:30.760
<v Speaker 4>You got to go there all day sometimes.</v>

1705
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:32.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the people have to talk about this </v>

1706
01:27:33.951 --> 01:27:35.660
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like grownups.</v>

1707
01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:41.230
<v Speaker 2>And as the technology keeps advancing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and becomes more and more,</v>

1708
01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:46.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the line between like</v>

1709
01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.593
<v Speaker 4>porn and real life gets fuzzier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And fuzzier right with robots and </v>

1710
01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:57.820
<v Speaker 4>virtual reality is going to be very </v>
<v Speaker 4>strange.</v>

1711
01:27:58.100 --> 01:27:58.933
<v Speaker 4>I think that probably what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen is there's going to be some sort </v>

1712
01:28:01.751 --> 01:28:06.751
<v Speaker 4>of a merger between virtual reality and </v>
<v Speaker 4>robots like that would be like the,</v>

1713
01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:07.953
<v Speaker 4>the real ultimate brothel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you wouldn't be as confused by the </v>

1714
01:28:14.681 --> 01:28:15.514
<v Speaker 4>uncanny valley because there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>closer in a visual sense of replicating </v>

1715
01:28:19.151 --> 01:28:19.984
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you've seen like some of the </v>

1716
01:28:21.371 --> 01:28:22.204
<v Speaker 4>more recent video games like God of war </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a bunch of these like really high </v>

1717
01:28:25.061 --> 01:28:28.030
<v Speaker 4>end games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The graphics are so intense,</v>

1718
01:28:28.031 --> 01:28:30.160
<v Speaker 4>especially in the um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1719
01:28:30.161 --> 01:28:32.660
<v Speaker 4>the little scenes that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether they're there,</v>

1720
01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:35.080
<v Speaker 4>have promo clips and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looked at it like,</v>

1721
01:28:35.081 --> 01:28:37.950
<v Speaker 4>is this real end game video that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at these,</v>

1722
01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:40.210
<v Speaker 4>this is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like I'm watching a movie.</v>

1723
01:28:40.450 --> 01:28:41.283
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That this in combination like some sort </v>

1724
01:28:43.841 --> 01:28:48.841
<v Speaker 4>of real four k age d virtual reality in </v>
<v Speaker 4>combination with a sex robot is probably</v>

1725
01:28:50.411 --> 01:28:51.310
<v Speaker 4>where people are going to go.</v>

1726
01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:53.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1727
01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the other question is like what</v>

1728
01:28:57.291 --> 01:28:58.124
<v Speaker 2>happens with that technology in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>education and college and how people </v>

1729
01:29:01.441 --> 01:29:04.830
<v Speaker 2>acquire skills and knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 2>insight?</v>

1730
01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

1731
01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:10.860
<v Speaker 2>really hard to imagine that people still</v>
<v Speaker 2>think in 15 years.</v>

1732
01:29:10.861 --> 01:29:11.694
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to a physical classroom and </v>

1733
01:29:12.991 --> 01:29:14.310
<v Speaker 2>sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1734
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:15.263
<v Speaker 2>listening to the average community </v>
<v Speaker 2>college like adjunct professor talking </v>

1735
01:29:20.641 --> 01:29:21.474
<v Speaker 2>about human sexuality or gender feminism</v>
<v Speaker 2>or political science that they'll think </v>

1736
01:29:26.881 --> 01:29:28.950
<v Speaker 2>that's a state of the art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way we should do that.</v>

1737
01:29:30.650 --> 01:29:33.210
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what happens?</v>

1738
01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems kind of unlikely that </v>
<v Speaker 2>university is,</v>

1739
01:29:39.721 --> 01:29:40.554
<v Speaker 2>as we know them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will keep existing in anything close to </v>

1740
01:29:43.351 --> 01:29:47.670
<v Speaker 2>their current form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet no one's talking about this.</v>

1741
01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:50.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1742
01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:51.563
<v Speaker 2>like I wouldn't be that surprised if </v>
<v Speaker 2>half the universities in America go </v>

1743
01:29:53.971 --> 01:29:55.830
<v Speaker 2>bankrupt within 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>

1744
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:59.450
<v Speaker 4>So do you think that people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be getting their education and some sort</v>

1745
01:29:59.451 --> 01:30:00.284
<v Speaker 4>of an online form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of virtual classroom form or </v>

1746
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:07.400
<v Speaker 4>some maybe new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not yet created version,</v>

1747
01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:11.450
<v Speaker 2>some new virtual reality form that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot more interactive?</v>

1748
01:30:11.451 --> 01:30:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it will be just watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos and then taking quizzes.</v>

1749
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:16.183
<v Speaker 2>Have you paid attention to what Elon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Musk has been saying about as neuro </v>

1750
01:30:18.861 --> 01:30:20.900
<v Speaker 2>link?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bit.</v>

1751
01:30:20.901 --> 01:30:21.734
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1752
01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:22.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about what you've </v>

1753
01:30:23.421 --> 01:30:26.600
<v Speaker 2>heard so far?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it will be very,</v>

1754
01:30:26.601 --> 01:30:29.570
<v Speaker 2>very hard technically to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1755
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:31.940
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you know about it?</v>

1756
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:33.223
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could explain it to people that </v>

1757
01:30:34.071 --> 01:30:37.790
<v Speaker 2>don't know what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I understand correctly,</v>

1758
01:30:37.791 --> 01:30:40.910
<v Speaker 2>having watched like you interview Ilan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera.</v>

1759
01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:41.993
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just concerned that the bandwidth </v>

1760
01:30:44.121 --> 01:30:44.954
<v Speaker 2>that connects the brain to the world or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain to the Internet is quite </v>

1761
01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:49.633
<v Speaker 2>narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can get a lot of information </v>

1762
01:30:51.441 --> 01:30:52.274
<v Speaker 2>quickly through your eyes and ears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your speed of like typing and </v>

1763
01:30:55.251 --> 01:30:58.150
<v Speaker 2>controlling things is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're speaking is,</v>

1764
01:30:58.151 --> 01:30:59.210
<v Speaker 2>is kind of limited.</v>

1765
01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:01.093
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's a push to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>open up that that bandwidth and the </v>

1766
01:31:06.471 --> 01:31:07.304
<v Speaker 2>speed of communication between the human</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain and digital reality and other </v>

1767
01:31:11.691 --> 01:31:15.380
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they figured out a way to do that,</v>

1768
01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:18.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a total game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1769
01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:20.173
<v Speaker 2>in terms of how people interact with not</v>
<v Speaker 2>just social media but in general with </v>

1770
01:31:26.121 --> 01:31:26.954
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it means basically you have a </v>

1771
01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:34.480
<v Speaker 2>global telepathy system if you want and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then everything changes because it means</v>

1772
01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.393
<v Speaker 2>the ease with which one part of my brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>communicates with another part isn't </v>

1773
01:31:44.721 --> 01:31:45.554
<v Speaker 2>that much higher than the ease with </v>
<v Speaker 2>which that part communicates with </v>

1774
01:31:47.751 --> 01:31:50.570
<v Speaker 2>somebody else's other brain part.</v>

1775
01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:52.973
<v Speaker 4>What I've been thinking about is some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of universal language in that if </v>

1776
01:31:55.591 --> 01:31:56.424
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they bridge the gap between cultures </v>

1777
01:32:00.461 --> 01:32:01.294
<v Speaker 4>and civilizations and w the way people </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate and doing so do it through </v>

1778
01:32:04.931 --> 01:32:05.764
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a digital interface and </v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of like very simple characters </v>

1779
01:32:08.831 --> 01:32:09.664
<v Speaker 4>that equal words that you put into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>linguistic disc dictionary and you have </v>

1780
01:32:14.141 --> 01:32:15.850
<v Speaker 4>an understanding of what this person's </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

1781
01:32:15.851 --> 01:32:18.700
<v Speaker 4>Instead of that you get like real clear </v>
<v Speaker 4>concepts,</v>

1782
01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:19.534
<v Speaker 4>maybe even like an Emoji form or </v>
<v Speaker 4>hieroglyphic form or some sort of form </v>

1783
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:25.833
<v Speaker 4>where we figure out over x amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>years how to communicate through agreed </v>

1784
01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:32.134
<v Speaker 4>upon imagery or agreed upon data in some</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a way that it lets people </v>

1785
01:32:36.341 --> 01:32:41.341
<v Speaker 4>express emotions and perhaps even more </v>
<v Speaker 4>engrossing and more complicated than the</v>

1786
01:32:44.711 --> 01:32:46.660
<v Speaker 4>actual language that we're enjoying </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

1787
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll,</v>

1788
01:32:47.710 --> 01:32:48.543
<v Speaker 2>it'll be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the evolutionary backstory to </v>

1789
01:32:51.221 --> 01:32:51.791
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1790
01:32:51.791 --> 01:32:54.670
<v Speaker 2>as you basically have the whole history </v>
<v Speaker 2>of life on earth,</v>

1791
01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:56.313
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before humans invent language where </v>

1792
01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:03.160
<v Speaker 2>animal communication is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>primitive.</v>

1793
01:33:03.190 --> 01:33:04.023
<v Speaker 2>Like all you really have at the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated as like nightingale's </v>

1794
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:10.570
<v Speaker 2>producing complicated bird song to track</v>
<v Speaker 2>mates.</v>

1795
01:33:10.810 --> 01:33:12.210
<v Speaker 2>That's about as much as you get.</v>

1796
01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.153
<v Speaker 4>What about like chimps that have certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>sounds for tigers and other sounds for </v>

1797
01:33:16.071 --> 01:33:16.890
<v Speaker 4>eagles</v>

1798
01:33:16.890 --> 01:33:19.780
<v Speaker 2>that have like a maximum of maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dozen different sounds.</v>

1799
01:33:20.250 --> 01:33:21.083
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with human language it compared to </v>

1800
01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:24.964
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is suddenly like having </v>

1801
01:33:26.261 --> 01:33:29.260
<v Speaker 2>telepathy where you can communicate so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

1802
01:33:29.261 --> 01:33:32.170
<v Speaker 2>so quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so efficiently and yet,</v>

1803
01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:35.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1804
01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:36.153
<v Speaker 2>of neuro link works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be as far in advance of </v>

1805
01:33:39.221 --> 01:33:42.520
<v Speaker 2>language as languages of kind of animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>signaling.</v>

1806
01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's hard.</v>

1807
01:33:45.190 --> 01:33:49.630
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to imagine what that world </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like because</v>

1808
01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:51.340
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

1809
01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:55.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine a form of twitter where it's not</v>

1810
01:33:55.871 --> 01:33:58.630
<v Speaker 2>just through your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1811
01:33:58.631 --> 01:34:03.070
<v Speaker 2>your thumbs on a key pad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a direct brain interface.</v>

1812
01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:05.733
<v Speaker 2>And then when people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just saying something mean or </v>

1813
01:34:09.581 --> 01:34:11.850
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's even thinking something meaner,</v>

1814
01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:13.750
<v Speaker 2>stupid that could immediately get </v>
<v Speaker 2>posted.</v>

1815
01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:17.193
<v Speaker 2>And once you kind of start sharing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole subconscious with people through </v>

1816
01:34:24.341 --> 01:34:28.180
<v Speaker 2>neurolink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then well,</v>

1817
01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:29.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have to level up with some new </v>

1818
01:34:29.971 --> 01:34:30.804
<v Speaker 2>social norms about what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that means and sort of how much </v>

1819
01:34:34.831 --> 01:34:37.410
<v Speaker 2>radical honesty we can take from each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

1820
01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:43.280
<v Speaker 4>That seems to be where the future is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The complete desolving of all boundaries</v>

1821
01:34:45.691 --> 01:34:50.691
<v Speaker 4>between people and information people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and their lives and that some sort of a,</v>

1822
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:53.903
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a way of recording your actual </v>

1823
01:34:55.621 --> 01:34:59.780
<v Speaker 4>experiences or letting people share them</v>
<v Speaker 4>in real time.</v>

1824
01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:00.793
<v Speaker 4>Like imagine if people decided to let </v>
<v Speaker 4>people through some virtual reality </v>

1825
01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:09.620
<v Speaker 4>scenario put on headsets and experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are having sex with your girlfriend.</v>

1826
01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:10.701
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1827
01:35:10.701 --> 01:35:13.220
<v Speaker 4>we're going to fuck on periscope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on,</v>

1828
01:35:13.221 --> 01:35:14.054
<v Speaker 4>join in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody just puts on their neuro </v>

1829
01:35:16.821 --> 01:35:17.654
<v Speaker 4>link and their augmented reality headset</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they put on their haptic feedback </v>

1830
01:35:21.471 --> 01:35:22.880
<v Speaker 4>suit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1831
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:24.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now and you know,</v>

1832
01:35:24.831 --> 01:35:27.140
<v Speaker 4>like iphone 10 level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1833
01:35:27.141 --> 01:35:28.970
<v Speaker 4>you'd go back to iphone once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>piece of shit,</v>

1834
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:31.730
<v Speaker 4>haptic feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10,</v>

1835
01:35:31.731 --> 01:35:34.520
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be silky smooth.</v>

1836
01:35:34.521 --> 01:35:35.354
<v Speaker 4>It's going to feel like real touch and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be able to have sex </v>

1837
01:35:38.601 --> 01:35:41.180
<v Speaker 4>along with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can have a digital orgy.</v>

1838
01:35:42.330 --> 01:35:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's coming within 50 years.</v>

1839
01:35:46.530 --> 01:35:47.363
<v Speaker 2>Maybe earlier.</v>

1840
01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:50.430
<v Speaker 4>That's a very conservative guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1841
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:52.590
<v Speaker 4>100% is come up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There it is.</v>

1842
01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:54.150
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

1843
01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:57.660
<v Speaker 4>there's a haptic feedback system looking</v>
<v Speaker 4>around in there.</v>

1844
01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:58.980
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It?</v>

1845
01:35:59.250 --> 01:36:02.100
<v Speaker 4>Oh this couple sexy as fuck to take your</v>
<v Speaker 4>clothes off folks.</v>

1846
01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:04.920
<v Speaker 4>Why are you wearing these goofy outfits?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretend you superheroes.</v>

1847
01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:07.200
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1848
01:36:07.230 --> 01:36:09.720
<v Speaker 4>what are these things for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Climate control systems,</v>

1849
01:36:09.721 --> 01:36:14.190
<v Speaker 4>biometric systems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>motion capture and avatar system.</v>

1850
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:15.590
<v Speaker 4>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're fucked.</v>

1851
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:18.210
<v Speaker 4>Jeffrey Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ar and Mr.</v>

1852
01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:21.120
<v Speaker 4>So this is all happening while we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>chit chatting about it,</v>

1853
01:36:21.121 --> 01:36:22.410
<v Speaker 4>these people have already engineered it</v>

1854
01:36:23.370 --> 01:36:26.160
<v Speaker 2>and society is going to be totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>blindsided by this.</v>

1855
01:36:26.190 --> 01:36:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause everybody thinks,</v>

1856
01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:28.913
<v Speaker 2>oh well I saw it on Black Mirror but I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that it's not even my like so I </v>

1857
01:36:33.001 --> 01:36:35.060
<v Speaker 2>don't have to worry about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>minoration yet,</v>

1858
01:36:35.061 --> 01:36:37.680
<v Speaker 2>cause it's only science fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

1859
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:39.583
<v Speaker 4>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something on Sam Harris has show that </v>

1860
01:36:40.551 --> 01:36:43.280
<v Speaker 4>gave me a little bit of hope that turned</v>
<v Speaker 4>out to not be true.</v>

1861
01:36:43.670 --> 01:36:44.503
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He sits up that you were talking about </v>

1862
01:36:45.681 --> 01:36:48.890
<v Speaker 4>asteroids about our ability to recognize</v>
<v Speaker 4>asteroids and,</v>

1863
01:36:48.891 --> 01:36:51.020
<v Speaker 4>and stop the impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

1864
01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:54.350
<v Speaker 4>According to Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need at least 10 years.</v>

1865
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:55.723
<v Speaker 4>We need to know that they're 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to hit in 10 years and </v>

1866
01:36:57.711 --> 01:37:01.400
<v Speaker 4>then maybe we could do something that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not comforting,</v>

1867
01:37:01.401 --> 01:37:01.800
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

1868
01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1869
01:37:02.851 --> 01:37:03.684
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be really good to invest at </v>

1870
01:37:06.901 --> 01:37:11.901
<v Speaker 2>least a few tens of billions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>in doing that for sure as insurance,</v>

1871
01:37:12.810 --> 01:37:13.643
<v Speaker 2>but like the probability of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant asteroid impact within the </v>

1872
01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:20.490
<v Speaker 2>next century is pretty low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I understand it correctly.</v>

1873
01:37:20.730 --> 01:37:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I think he's just guesswork.</v>

1874
01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:25.240
<v Speaker 4>Does motherfuckers just whizz by all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time?</v>

1875
01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:26.493
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the probability of us getting hit </v>

1876
01:37:31.331 --> 01:37:33.040
<v Speaker 4>eventually is 100%</v>

1877
01:37:33.170 --> 01:37:34.003
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll happen probably in a few million </v>

1878
01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:38.310
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1879
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:40.560
<v Speaker 4>but why do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that to make yourself feel better?</v>

1880
01:37:40.561 --> 01:37:41.910
<v Speaker 4>I'll be long gone.</v>

1881
01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:43.420
<v Speaker 2>It'll be my great quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>

1882
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.841
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>

1883
01:37:43.841 --> 01:37:44.450
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>

1884
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.871
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>

1885
01:37:44.871 --> 01:37:45.291
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>

1886
01:37:45.291 --> 01:37:45.711
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>

1887
01:37:45.711 --> 01:37:46.311
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great,</v>

1888
01:37:46.311 --> 01:37:47.144
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great grandchildren have to worry about </v>

1889
01:37:48.381 --> 01:37:48.831
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1890
01:37:48.831 --> 01:37:50.150
<v Speaker 2>you got to play the odds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1891
01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean we could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1892
01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:53.173
<v Speaker 2>we could be exterminated by a gamma ray </v>
<v Speaker 2>burst from like a Supernova at any time </v>

1893
01:37:57.530 --> 01:38:01.080
<v Speaker 2>with zero with no warning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's pretty unlikely.</v>

1894
01:38:01.230 --> 01:38:05.370
<v Speaker 2>And it hasn't happened before in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of life on earth.</v>

1895
01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.950
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it happens constantly.</v>

1896
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:09.263
<v Speaker 4>All throughout the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a documentary I watched once </v>

1897
01:38:11.611 --> 01:38:12.444
<v Speaker 4>the freak me the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all about hyper Novas and they </v>

1898
01:38:16.381 --> 01:38:17.214
<v Speaker 4>were talking about when they first </v>
<v Speaker 4>started discovering them that they were </v>

1899
01:38:18.661 --> 01:38:23.661
<v Speaker 4>really actually concerned that there was</v>
<v Speaker 4>a war going on in space.</v>

1900
01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:27.120
<v Speaker 4>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they recognize that all these explosions</v>

1901
01:38:27.121 --> 01:38:27.954
<v Speaker 4>were happening all day long and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought there was a war going on in the </v>

1902
01:38:30.931 --> 01:38:31.764
<v Speaker 4>cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really fascinating because I </v>

1903
01:38:33.721 --> 01:38:34.554
<v Speaker 4>think this is like when they just got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say it as a sixties and they </v>

1904
01:38:37.861 --> 01:38:40.080
<v Speaker 4>discovered this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>

1905
01:38:40.810 --> 01:38:41.643
<v Speaker 2>In a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of surprising that we haven't </v>

1906
01:38:42.821 --> 01:38:46.330
<v Speaker 2>seen evidence of that happening already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1907
01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:47.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1908
01:38:47.970 --> 01:38:50.350
<v Speaker 2>when I wrote my piece about the Fermi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paradox,</v>

1909
01:38:50.351 --> 01:38:53.170
<v Speaker 2>which is why don't we have evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens already?</v>

1910
01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:55.690
<v Speaker 2>My solution was basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1911
01:38:56.230 --> 01:39:00.190
<v Speaker 2>most species that are intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that invent technology get wrapped up in</v>

1912
01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:01.953
<v Speaker 2>video games and virtual reality and sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology and it just distracts them </v>

1913
01:39:06.581 --> 01:39:11.581
<v Speaker 2>and they kind of dropped the ball on </v>
<v Speaker 2>staying alive and exploring anything.</v>

1914
01:39:12.041 --> 01:39:13.670
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1915
01:39:13.690 --> 01:39:17.260
<v Speaker 2>I think it's still quite likely that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens to most intelligent species</v>

1916
01:39:17.770 --> 01:39:20.200
<v Speaker 2>that they just kind of disappear up </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own buttholes</v>

1917
01:39:21.150 --> 01:39:21.983
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or they create some sort of an </v>

1918
01:39:22.981 --> 01:39:23.814
<v Speaker 4>artificial life form that's far more </v>
<v Speaker 4>advanced than anything that it's </v>

1919
01:39:25.771 --> 01:39:29.250
<v Speaker 4>biological and has no desire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>need or,</v>

1920
01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no instincts to reproduce.</v>

1921
01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:33.070
<v Speaker 4>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we see,</v>

1922
01:39:33.130 --> 01:39:33.471
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

1923
01:39:33.471 --> 01:39:34.304
<v Speaker 4>I've said this to many times that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that we are essentially some sort </v>

1924
01:39:38.431 --> 01:39:40.750
<v Speaker 4>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of,</v>

1925
01:39:40.751 --> 01:39:41.584
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>electronic caterpillar that gives birth </v>

1926
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:47.670
<v Speaker 4>to a technological butterfly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're making a coon right now.</v>

1927
01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:48.533
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're about to create artificial </v>

1928
01:39:50.221 --> 01:39:51.054
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we're doing it through our </v>

1929
01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:56.120
<v Speaker 4>intense desire for innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Constantly want newer,</v>

1930
01:39:56.190 --> 01:39:57.023
<v Speaker 4>better things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's televisions and cars or </v>

1931
01:39:58.891 --> 01:40:00.780
<v Speaker 4>phones were never like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one's perfect.</v>

1932
01:40:00.810 --> 01:40:02.520
<v Speaker 4>Let's just stop here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never.</v>

1933
01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:05.730
<v Speaker 4>The desire is always towards every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1934
01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:08.520
<v Speaker 4>fill in the time period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want a new version,</v>

1935
01:40:08.610 --> 01:40:11.460
<v Speaker 4>a better version with improvements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we keep getting those.</v>

1936
01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:16.760
<v Speaker 4>And this is what fuels in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it fuels our desire for me.</v>

1937
01:40:17.130 --> 01:40:19.050
<v Speaker 4>Materialism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>materialism.</v>

1938
01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:22.980
<v Speaker 4>IMBA is embodied by technological </v>
<v Speaker 4>innovation.</v>

1939
01:40:23.010 --> 01:40:26.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean what you're always wanting when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get past jewels,</v>

1940
01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.010
<v Speaker 4>you always want the newest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest innovations.</v>

1941
01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:30.203
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1942
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I think at a certain point humanity's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have to bite the bullet and say</v>

1943
01:40:35.490 --> 01:40:39.510
<v Speaker 2>we should plan which innovations come </v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

1944
01:40:39.570 --> 01:40:40.403
<v Speaker 2>what happens next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we might even have to have like </v>

1945
01:40:42.931 --> 01:40:47.931
<v Speaker 2>regulation or social taboos that say we </v>
<v Speaker 2>really shouldn't go down that path until</v>

1946
01:40:49.770 --> 01:40:50.603
<v Speaker 2>we do this other thing first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes us ready to do that thing in </v>

1947
01:40:54.761 --> 01:40:56.740
<v Speaker 2>a safer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more rational,</v>

1948
01:40:56.741 --> 01:40:57.290
<v Speaker 2>more ethical.</v>

1949
01:40:57.290 --> 01:40:58.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's the big word,</v>

1950
01:40:58.251 --> 01:40:59.084
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rational like we're not really rational </v>

1951
01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:01.993
<v Speaker 4>and competition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when it's a dealing with </v>

1952
01:41:04.941 --> 01:41:05.774
<v Speaker 4>different countries that have different </v>
<v Speaker 4>human rights laws and standards of </v>

1953
01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:09.613
<v Speaker 4>behavior and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this is a problem with regulating </v>

1954
01:41:12.681 --> 01:41:16.730
<v Speaker 4>like artificial intelligence is how'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get China to play ball?</v>

1955
01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:19.160
<v Speaker 4>That was going to say China,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to seem racist.</v>

1956
01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:22.840
<v Speaker 4>Well they're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Russia too.</v>

1957
01:41:23.050 --> 01:41:24.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm already doing it.</v>

1958
01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.013
<v Speaker 2>China's a threat because they are smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>and organized and future oriented and </v>

1959
01:41:28.261 --> 01:41:29.850
<v Speaker 2>they can do long term planning and</v>

1960
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:32.540
<v Speaker 4>technologically they're incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>advanced.</v>

1961
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:33.681
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1962
01:41:33.681 --> 01:41:35.030
<v Speaker 4>so far advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're,</v>

1963
01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:39.110
<v Speaker 4>or this government rather it's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep the best phones from China,</v>

1964
01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:40.220
<v Speaker 4>from getting to America.</v>

1965
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:43.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:41:43.710 --> 01:41:44.543
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Huawei probably has some pretty </v>

1967
01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.730
<v Speaker 2>close links to the Chinese millage.</v>

1968
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:51.670
<v Speaker 4>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1969
01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:52.593
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>

1970
01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:54.700
<v Speaker 4>To the Chinese government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Communist dictatorship.</v>

1971
01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:55.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1972
01:41:55.530 --> 01:41:56.363
<v Speaker 2>And of course it's a lovely system if </v>
<v Speaker 2>Huawei phones how backdoors it allowed </v>

1973
01:42:00.651 --> 01:42:01.484
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese to learn a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans and our culture and our </v>

1974
01:42:04.951 --> 01:42:07.440
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the concern.</v>

1975
01:42:07.650 --> 01:42:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1976
01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:13.140
<v Speaker 2>that's actually more of a concern to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>than like,</v>

1977
01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:17.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>military spying in the strict sense.</v>

1978
01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.433
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think China has so many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>working on cyber warfare that we </v>

1979
01:42:24.991 --> 01:42:27.930
<v Speaker 2>probably don't even have any idea what </v>
<v Speaker 2>their capabilities are.</v>

1980
01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:30.450
<v Speaker 2>But I think if they have insight into </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1981
01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:34.830
<v Speaker 2>here's the American psyche and here's </v>
<v Speaker 2>how their political thinking works,</v>

1982
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:38.340
<v Speaker 2>it will be quite a bit easier to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulate,</v>

1983
01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:40.013
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of our geopolitics because we </v>

1984
01:42:45.961 --> 01:42:50.540
<v Speaker 2>don't have anything analogists I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where like,</v>

1985
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:55.110
<v Speaker 2>is the Pentagon trying to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 2>could we nudge Chinese social media use?</v>

1986
01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:56.513
<v Speaker 2>You don't think they know our interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be surprised if they're doing it </v>

1987
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:00.833
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1988
01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:01.873
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's fascinating is Google's take on </v>

1989
01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:04.363
<v Speaker 4>China is that they're willing to censor </v>
<v Speaker 4>video or internet searches because they </v>

1990
01:43:09.861 --> 01:43:13.160
<v Speaker 4>feel like if they don't try to just </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to copy their technology and do it</v>

1991
01:43:13.161 --> 01:43:15.020
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so this way,</v>

1992
01:43:15.021 --> 01:43:17.030
<v Speaker 4>at least they're in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1993
01:43:17.031 --> 01:43:17.864
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a sketchy way of sort of </v>

1994
01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.850
<v Speaker 4>absolving yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1995
01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:26.520
<v Speaker 4>Of any bad feelings about censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

1996
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:29.600
<v Speaker 4>you're contributing to censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Government issued censorship.</v>

1997
01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:30.613
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you want to control the market </v>

1998
01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:33.410
<v Speaker 4>and we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

1999
01:43:33.411 --> 01:43:34.001
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2000
01:43:34.001 --> 01:43:34.834
<v Speaker 4>I can't Google Tiananmen Square.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You literally can't Google Tiananmen </v>

2001
01:43:38.150 --> 01:43:38.983
<v Speaker 4>Square.</v>

2002
01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:47.410
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there's a huge difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between China's authoritarian regime and</v>

2003
01:43:47.411 --> 01:43:48.244
<v Speaker 2>the American political system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think they're not quite as </v>

2004
01:43:51.591 --> 01:43:52.424
<v Speaker 2>different as a lot of folks think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you talk to Chinese academics </v>

2005
01:43:57.891 --> 01:44:00.560
<v Speaker 2>about like what can you research and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what can you not research,</v>

2006
01:44:01.970 --> 01:44:04.670
<v Speaker 2>like they have different constraints </v>
<v Speaker 2>than Americans do.</v>

2007
01:44:04.671 --> 01:44:05.504
<v Speaker 2>But on at the pragmatic level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are certain topics that they can </v>

2008
01:44:10.951 --> 01:44:11.784
<v Speaker 2>address that we can't and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like there's just one </v>

2009
01:44:14.911 --> 01:44:17.220
<v Speaker 2>dimension of freedom and we're better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than them on,</v>

2010
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:20.190
<v Speaker 2>on every aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2011
01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:21.293
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think American citizens have no idea </v>

2012
01:44:22.891 --> 01:44:27.891
<v Speaker 2>how restricted American scientists are </v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of what we're allowed to study.</v>

2013
01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:31.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to talk about loud too,</v>

2014
01:44:31.110 --> 01:44:34.230
<v Speaker 4>or what you can get grants and approval </v>
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>

2015
01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:35.813
<v Speaker 4>And is that the same thing as allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>effectively it's the same thing because </v>

2016
01:44:38.341 --> 01:44:39.720
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have any funding,</v>

2017
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:41.450
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no study.</v>

2018
01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:43.610
<v Speaker 2>You can't do science without money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2019
01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>

2020
01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:51.620
<v Speaker 2>like if I was starting my career again </v>
<v Speaker 2>at this point,</v>

2021
01:44:51.621 --> 01:44:52.454
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't go into academia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I wanted to understand human </v>

2022
01:44:54.531 --> 01:44:55.364
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go work for facebook or Google </v>

2023
01:44:58.340 --> 01:44:59.173
<v Speaker 2>because they have much more data about </v>
<v Speaker 2>human behavior than I could ever get as </v>

2024
01:45:04.071 --> 01:45:07.670
<v Speaker 2>a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they doing that?</v>

2025
01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:09.193
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know what they're finding </v>

2026
01:45:11.091 --> 01:45:13.610
<v Speaker 2>because they don't publish journal </v>
<v Speaker 2>papers.</v>

2027
01:45:13.611 --> 01:45:15.920
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all commercial secrets.</v>

2028
01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:18.253
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm sure that like facebook </v>
<v Speaker 2>understands a lot more about social </v>

2029
01:45:23.961 --> 01:45:27.890
<v Speaker 2>psychology then social psychology does </v>
<v Speaker 2>at this point.</v>

2030
01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2031
01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:31.970
<v Speaker 2>How could they not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have like 1.2</v>

2032
01:45:31.971 --> 01:45:36.971
<v Speaker 2>billion people interacting socially </v>
<v Speaker 2>regularly and they data mine to hell out</v>

2033
01:45:37.641 --> 01:45:39.860
<v Speaker 2>of that for commercial purposes.</v>

2034
01:45:39.940 --> 01:45:41.440
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But are they publishing things?</v>

2035
01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:43.730
<v Speaker 4>Are they sharing this information?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't turn it all.</v>

2036
01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:46.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it's all internal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But internally,</v>

2037
01:45:46.361 --> 01:45:47.770
<v Speaker 4>do you think they're publishing things?</v>

2038
01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:50.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2039
01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

2040
01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2041
01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:53.893
<v Speaker 2>it's just a little bit alarming when </v>
<v Speaker 2>this state of the art in understanding </v>

2042
01:45:57.661 --> 01:45:59.190
<v Speaker 2>behavior isn't public.</v>

2043
01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:02.453
<v Speaker 4>That is alarming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then Mark Zuckerberg might be a </v>

2044
01:46:05.551 --> 01:46:06.660
<v Speaker 4>robot to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2045
01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:09.360
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's worried about that might be </v>
<v Speaker 4>a Spec spot.</v>

2046
01:46:09.630 --> 01:46:10.463
<v Speaker 4>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we played many times a video of him </v>

2047
01:46:11.401 --> 01:46:12.770
<v Speaker 4>drinking water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2048
01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:13.613
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He drinks water like that creepy little </v>

2049
01:46:15.751 --> 01:46:19.110
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a just kidding mark.</v>

2050
01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:20.670
<v Speaker 4>Don't delete my account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2051
01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:25.950
<v Speaker 4>I think that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at in terms of like Google</v>

2052
01:46:26.250 --> 01:46:29.100
<v Speaker 4>and facebook and twitter and even </v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube,</v>

2053
01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:30.173
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at these enormous </v>
<v Speaker 4>organizations that I don't think they </v>

2054
01:46:35.221 --> 01:46:38.610
<v Speaker 4>had any idea what they were going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2055
01:46:38.611 --> 01:46:39.444
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really particularly feel that way </v>

2056
01:46:40.471 --> 01:46:44.100
<v Speaker 4>about twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When twitter first started out,</v>

2057
01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:45.413
<v Speaker 4>do you remember how it used to be like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you would use like you're at like at </v>

2058
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:51.720
<v Speaker 4>Miller is enjoying a cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2059
01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:52.653
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would talk about yourself in the </v>

2060
01:46:53.371 --> 01:46:55.050
<v Speaker 4>third person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really weird,</v>

2061
01:46:55.530 --> 01:46:56.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2062
01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:59.130
<v Speaker 4>at Jamie Vernon is going to the movies.</v>

2063
01:46:59.600 --> 01:46:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2064
01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:00.673
<v Speaker 4>And that's how people talked the early </v>
<v Speaker 4>days of [inaudible] and then people </v>

2065
01:47:03.231 --> 01:47:04.790
<v Speaker 4>realize what the fuck am I doing?</v>

2066
01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:06.553
<v Speaker 8>You had,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's sort of the reason it developed </v>

2067
01:47:07.831 --> 01:47:11.520
<v Speaker 8>it because there was no group tech </v>
<v Speaker 8>texting back then in 2007 or six when it</v>

2068
01:47:11.521 --> 01:47:14.610
<v Speaker 8>started.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it was developed for group texting so</v>

2069
01:47:14.611 --> 01:47:17.700
<v Speaker 8>you could share what you were doing with</v>
<v Speaker 8>a group of your friends.</v>

2070
01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:20.460
<v Speaker 8>Was that what it was for?</v>
<v Speaker 8>They opened it so that more people could</v>

2071
01:47:20.461 --> 01:47:21.294
<v Speaker 8>follow if you wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then celebrities jumped on and then </v>

2072
01:47:23.730 --> 01:47:24.361
<v Speaker 8>it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and they,</v>

2073
01:47:24.361 --> 01:47:25.194
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they started adding the ability people </v>

2074
01:47:26.491 --> 01:47:30.090
<v Speaker 8>just started doing at Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So they'd added the ability to,</v>

2075
01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:33.240
<v Speaker 8>to click that and share it and tag it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2076
01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.320
<v Speaker 8>So weird.</v>

2077
01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:36.033
<v Speaker 4>And then you think about it now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now it's a vehicle for the president to </v>

2078
01:47:38.081 --> 01:47:39.160
<v Speaker 4>threaten other countries</v>

2079
01:47:40.890 --> 01:47:41.723
<v Speaker 2>and it is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the global public forum and </v>

2080
01:47:43.471 --> 01:47:44.304
<v Speaker 2>particularly in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is that the public square where </v>

2081
01:47:46.711 --> 01:47:48.020
<v Speaker 2>everyone shares ideas and,</v>

2082
01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:50.800
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a less verbose version of facebook.</v>

2083
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:53.110
<v Speaker 4>The problem with facebook is you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>can write too much.</v>

2084
01:47:53.170 --> 01:47:54.580
<v Speaker 4>I can't keep up with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>

2085
01:47:54.910 --> 01:47:55.743
<v Speaker 4>And I like the really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really ridiculous people who just </v>

2086
01:47:58.421 --> 01:48:01.960
<v Speaker 4>paragraph after paragraph of run on </v>
<v Speaker 4>sentences with no,</v>

2087
01:48:02.050 --> 01:48:04.330
<v Speaker 4>no editing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like ugh.</v>

2088
01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot about,</v>

2089
01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:09.473
<v Speaker 2>here's a very long story about my most </v>
<v Speaker 2>recent emotional trauma or I dunno if </v>

2090
01:48:15.721 --> 01:48:18.630
<v Speaker 2>anybody ever is like having a breakup or</v>
<v Speaker 2>divorce on facebook.</v>

2091
01:48:18.631 --> 01:48:19.710
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

2092
01:48:19.711 --> 01:48:20.610
<v Speaker 2>now I'm going to have to listen.</v>

2093
01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:23.050
<v Speaker 4>Stop for a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2094
01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:27.220
<v Speaker 4>And then they reach out hoping some </v>
<v Speaker 4>people say it's going to be okay,</v>

2095
01:48:27.221 --> 01:48:29.290
<v Speaker 4>mark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's fine.</v>

2096
01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:30.483
<v Speaker 4>Life moves on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to forget about her </v>

2097
01:48:32.021 --> 01:48:35.550
<v Speaker 4>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2098
01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:38.080
<v Speaker 4>and people keep going back to who's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's left a comment.</v>

2099
01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2100
01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she's changed her mind,</v>

2101
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.980
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2102
01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:46.813
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is very kind of funny and </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting that nobody predicted 15 </v>

2103
01:48:51.111 --> 01:48:55.220
<v Speaker 2>years ago exactly how humans would make </v>
<v Speaker 2>use of this new technology.</v>

2104
01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:56.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like nobody in psychology was talking </v>

2105
01:48:57.591 --> 01:48:58.850
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2106
01:48:58.851 --> 01:49:03.851
<v Speaker 2>twitter is going to radically transform </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that science operates.</v>

2107
01:49:04.671 --> 01:49:09.671
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>news of like failed replications will be</v>

2108
01:49:10.371 --> 01:49:13.850
<v Speaker 2>spread within three days to everybody in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a field.</v>

2109
01:49:14.330 --> 01:49:15.163
<v Speaker 2>And anybody who does scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>misconduct will be suddenly like pushed </v>

2110
01:49:21.291 --> 01:49:26.291
<v Speaker 2>out within a week or a new result will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be shared globally within 24 hours.</v>

2111
01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Nobody was thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's like signs,</v>

2112
01:49:33.951 --> 01:49:34.820
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>

2113
01:49:34.821 --> 01:49:35.601
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment,</v>

2114
01:49:35.601 --> 01:49:40.490
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they've all kind of changed the game</v>

2115
01:49:40.491 --> 01:49:42.860
<v Speaker 2>and their respective fields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2116
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:44.863
<v Speaker 2>and we didn't understand human nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>well enough to predict how people </v>

2117
01:49:47.170 --> 01:49:48.190
<v Speaker 2>actually use the stuff.</v>

2118
01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:51.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did.</v>

2119
01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:53.270
<v Speaker 4>Just didn't see it coming either.</v>

2120
01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:54.090
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

2121
01:49:54.090 --> 01:49:55.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one ever would.</v>

2122
01:49:55.580 --> 01:50:00.580
<v Speaker 4>I remember when Ashton Kutcher was in </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a race with someone else,</v>

2123
01:50:01.290 --> 01:50:03.840
<v Speaker 4>I want to say to get to a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>followers,</v>

2124
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:05.830
<v Speaker 4>wasn't it like a million?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2125
01:50:06.030 --> 01:50:09.810
<v Speaker 4>And everybody thought that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to have a million followers.</v>

2126
01:50:11.530 --> 01:50:13.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think he's on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

2127
01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:17.340
<v Speaker 4>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But his account is hilarious.</v>

2128
01:50:17.341 --> 01:50:19.020
<v Speaker 4>It's like a production company now or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

2129
01:50:19.110 --> 01:50:19.943
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And gave it to system fucking too </v>

2130
01:50:21.241 --> 01:50:22.074
<v Speaker 4>dangerous.</v>

2131
01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:25.120
<v Speaker 2>And now what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Katy Perry has like 120 minutes.</v>

2132
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:27.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something insane.</v>

2133
01:50:28.050 --> 01:50:28.883
<v Speaker 4>Probably more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you've got to go to her </v>

2134
01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:31.610
<v Speaker 4>instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is probably even bigger than that.</v>

2135
01:50:31.611 --> 01:50:35.840
<v Speaker 4>It was racing CNN and Brittany Spears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

2136
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:37.490
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the article for a million.</v>

2137
01:50:37.491 --> 01:50:40.820
<v Speaker 4>Look at that twitter race to a million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what years at 2009.</v>

2138
01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:43.700
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twitter raise to a million followers can</v>

2139
01:50:43.701 --> 01:50:45.740
<v Speaker 4>cut your beat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>CNN and spears.</v>

2140
01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:47.053
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one even knew what it meant back </v>

2141
01:50:49.161 --> 01:50:49.994
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

2142
01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.000
<v Speaker 2>So I mean with the virtual reality work </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the neuro link,</v>

2143
01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:00.540
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have those things.</v>

2144
01:51:00.541 --> 01:51:03.090
<v Speaker 2>We'll probably have a beginner impact on</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture and society.</v>

2145
01:51:03.091 --> 01:51:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Even then twitter did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2146
01:51:05.070 --> 01:51:08.940
<v Speaker 2>And still people are kind of just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleepwalking into that,</v>

2147
01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:10.013
<v Speaker 2>that world sleepwalking with a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>hesitant observers on the outside </v>

2148
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:17.760
<v Speaker 2>warning,</v>

2149
01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:18.593
<v Speaker 4>like almost like standing back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like watching someone play with </v>

2150
01:51:20.251 --> 01:51:20.971
<v Speaker 4>fireworks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2151
01:51:20.971 --> 01:51:22.260
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2152
01:51:22.261 --> 01:51:23.094
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know what's going to happen when </v>

2153
01:51:24.421 --> 01:51:28.350
<v Speaker 4>you light that garbage can on fire?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's filled with dynamite</v>

2154
01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:36.940
<v Speaker 2>and the legal issues or privacy issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the impact on relationships.</v>

2155
01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2156
01:51:38.690 --> 01:51:39.523
<v Speaker 2>is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like we train a lot of PHD's in </v>

2157
01:51:43.821 --> 01:51:44.654
<v Speaker 2>clinical psychology in my department and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are going to deal with </v>

2158
01:51:47.781 --> 01:51:48.614
<v Speaker 2>people and their relationships and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>marriages and the conflicts and </v>

2159
01:51:50.931 --> 01:51:51.764
<v Speaker 2>arguments and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we training them for a future world </v>

2160
01:51:55.371 --> 01:51:56.204
<v Speaker 2>where they're going to have to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex bots and virtual reality and new </v>

2161
01:52:00.681 --> 01:52:01.514
<v Speaker 2>forms of social media and new kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically telepathy that are foreign </v>

2162
01:52:07.851 --> 01:52:09.740
<v Speaker 2>advance of human language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No or not.</v>

2163
01:52:10.730 --> 01:52:11.563
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the world that they're going to </v>

2164
01:52:13.011 --> 01:52:14.750
<v Speaker 2>spend their professional lives in.</v>

2165
01:52:15.050 --> 01:52:17.240
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it similar in some ways?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2166
01:52:17.241 --> 01:52:18.530
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could speak to this,</v>

2167
01:52:19.070 --> 01:52:19.903
<v Speaker 4>you were trained as an audio engineer </v>
<v Speaker 4>and now everything's like all the </v>

2168
01:52:23.571 --> 01:52:28.190
<v Speaker 4>software that was available when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were learning is just useless now.</v>

2169
01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:29.493
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't even youtube when I went to </v>

2170
01:52:30.651 --> 01:52:33.320
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of the,</v>

2171
01:52:33.321 --> 01:52:34.154
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if anyone has questions now you can </v>

2172
01:52:35.421 --> 01:52:36.254
<v Speaker 4>learn almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I learned in the Year of program I had </v>

2173
01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:40.813
<v Speaker 4>in a week if you need it to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just don't get the hands on </v>

2174
01:52:44.361 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 4>application and touched on this stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 4>editing and all the other different </v>

2177
01:52:49.981 --> 01:52:50.814
<v Speaker 4>systems</v>

2178
01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:52.213
<v Speaker 8>detailed,</v>
<v Speaker 8>detailed from anyone you want to watch </v>

2179

2183
01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:07.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then in terms of financial,</v>

2184
01:53:08.330 --> 01:53:09.163
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of financial strain that </v>

2185
01:53:10.971 --> 01:53:14.930
<v Speaker 4>getting the traditional education puts </v>
<v Speaker 4>on people and they get out of school and</v>

2186
01:53:14.931 --> 01:53:17.060
<v Speaker 4>they're saddled with this debt that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>also,</v>

2187
01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:21.080
<v Speaker 4>you can't even absolve it if you declare</v>
<v Speaker 4>bankruptcy,</v>

2188
01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:22.393
<v Speaker 4>which is kind of hilarious when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think of the dirty shit that banks do </v>

2189
01:53:24.861 --> 01:53:25.694
<v Speaker 4>and Wall Street does and all the risks </v>
<v Speaker 4>they take and all the chaos that they </v>

2190
01:53:28.881 --> 01:53:29.714
<v Speaker 4>have created from their shitty decisions</v>
<v Speaker 4>that have affected the entire economy </v>

2191
01:53:32.481 --> 01:53:33.314
<v Speaker 4>and they're absolved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yet some kid who wanted to get a </v>

2192
01:53:37.281 --> 01:53:42.050
<v Speaker 4>gender studies degree and now as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>quarter million dollars,</v>

2193
01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:45.050
<v Speaker 4>some fucking halfassed Michigan </v>
<v Speaker 4>University.</v>

2194
01:53:47.070 --> 01:53:48.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it's unconscionable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2195
01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:50.170
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2196
01:53:50.970 --> 01:53:51.803
<v Speaker 2>I feel really morally conflicted about </v>
<v Speaker 2>working in an industry that I think is </v>

2197
01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:57.760
<v Speaker 2>pretty exploitative and a lot of ways.</v>

2198
01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going to ask you about that.</v>

2199
01:53:59.350 --> 01:54:02.920
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the stance that you take?</v>

2200
01:54:02.921 --> 01:54:06.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if a kid comes to you and says,</v>

2201
01:54:06.250 --> 01:54:07.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what to do here.</v>

2202
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:13.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean generally the stance I take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in,</v>

2203
01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:14.373
<v Speaker 2>in a way I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky because I work at a large </v>

2204
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.410
<v Speaker 2>state public university and tuition is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really pretty.</v>

2205
01:54:21.411 --> 01:54:24.590
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to say which one it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people at University of New Mexico,</v>

2206
01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:26.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's great.</v>

2207
01:54:26.541 --> 01:54:29.360
<v Speaker 2>We serve 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>students and we charge very,</v>

2208
01:54:29.361 --> 01:54:30.194
<v Speaker 2>very little tuition money compared to </v>
<v Speaker 2>most places because it state subsidized </v>

2209
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:37.340
<v Speaker 2>and if you keep up a certain grade point</v>
<v Speaker 2>average,</v>

2210
01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:42.800
<v Speaker 2>it's about as close to free as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get in America.</v>

2211
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:44.623
<v Speaker 2>So I don't feel like we're as </v>
<v Speaker 2>economically exploitative as if I was </v>

2212
01:54:47.961 --> 01:54:50.420
<v Speaker 2>like teaching at Middlebury college or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yale or whatever.</v>

2213
01:54:52.250 --> 01:54:54.140
<v Speaker 2>But still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2214
01:54:56.050 --> 01:54:57.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of undergrads come to me and they go,</v>

2215
01:54:57.711 --> 01:54:59.750
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should I learn?</v>

2216
01:54:59.751 --> 01:55:02.360
<v Speaker 2>What should I major in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What classes should I take?</v>

2217
01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:03.973
<v Speaker 2>The only real advice I can give is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>take stuff that's going to be useful in </v>

2218
01:55:07.101 --> 01:55:08.660
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your personal life,</v>

2219
01:55:08.661 --> 01:55:10.640
<v Speaker 2>no matter what career you do.</v>

2220
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:11.783
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you should take my human sexuality </v>

2221
01:55:13.551 --> 01:55:14.384
<v Speaker 2>class cause you'll probably be a sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>being for the rest of your life and </v>

2222
01:55:16.701 --> 01:55:19.370
<v Speaker 2>you'll be in relationships of some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>or another.</v>

2223
01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:21.870
<v Speaker 2>You should learn about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2224
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:23.683
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should learn about the history of </v>

2225
01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:26.173
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should learn about animal behavior </v>

2226
01:55:27.741 --> 01:55:32.270
<v Speaker 2>and biology and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But don't expect that.</v>

2227
01:55:32.271 --> 01:55:33.104
<v Speaker 2>Like you can major in pharmacy and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a job as a pharmacist that makes a </v>

2228
01:55:40.290 --> 01:55:44.820
<v Speaker 2>hundred k out of the gate because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be automated.</v>

2229
01:55:45.930 --> 01:55:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Don't assume you can go to law school </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'll make bank like your dad did.</v>

2230
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2231
01:55:53.130 --> 01:55:53.963
<v Speaker 2>document discovery is being automated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't assume you're going to be a </v>

2232
01:55:57.690 --> 01:56:00.350
<v Speaker 2>surgeon because that might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>roboticized.</v>

2233
01:56:01.770 --> 01:56:06.440
<v Speaker 2>So I just say you should try to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>classical liberal arts education that,</v>

2234
01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:11.460
<v Speaker 2>that equips you as a citizen and as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person and as a,</v>

2235
01:56:11.730 --> 01:56:16.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ethical being a and that's the future</v>

2236
01:56:16.321 --> 01:56:18.090
<v Speaker 2>proof way to do it.</v>

2237
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:22.740
<v Speaker 4>And even then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a distinct possibility that this</v>

2238
01:56:22.741 --> 01:56:23.574
<v Speaker 4>education or a superior version of it </v>
<v Speaker 4>will be available through some new </v>

2239
01:56:26.911 --> 01:56:29.910
<v Speaker 4>unfound or soon to be discovered form.</v>

2240
01:56:30.530 --> 01:56:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just expect that you will,</v>

2241
01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:38.060
<v Speaker 2>if you stay curious throughout your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

2242
01:56:38.061 --> 01:56:41.510
<v Speaker 2>you'll be able to learn about as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2243
01:56:41.511 --> 01:56:46.511
<v Speaker 2>in every four to six years going forward</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you learned in this four to six years</v>

2244
01:56:46.551 --> 01:56:47.810
<v Speaker 2>of college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2245
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:48.663
<v Speaker 4>What's interesting is that no one really</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks of a university education as </v>

2246
01:56:52.381 --> 01:56:54.510
<v Speaker 4>being something that equips you for </v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

2247
01:56:54.690 --> 01:56:58.080
<v Speaker 4>that your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your learning so that you can just,</v>

2248
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:59.623
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just educating yourself and to </v>

2249
01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:07.100
<v Speaker 4>sort of make your mind more available </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibilities and options and</v>

2250
01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:09.800
<v Speaker 2>causes and effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just,</v>

2251
01:57:10.610 --> 01:57:12.920
<v Speaker 2>just for your own edification that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2252
01:57:12.921 --> 01:57:15.860
<v Speaker 2>this is not a consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People think I need a career.</v>

2253
01:57:16.190 --> 01:57:17.023
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go to this college for </v>

2254
01:57:17.511 --> 01:57:18.430
<v Speaker 2>four years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I get out,</v>

2255
01:57:18.431 --> 01:57:22.190
<v Speaker 2>I want to kick ass job cause I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>buy Alexis or whatever it is.</v>

2256
01:57:23.090 --> 01:57:24.590
<v Speaker 2>My favorite students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

2257
01:57:24.591 --> 01:57:28.550
<v Speaker 2>are the mature students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the vets about a couple of tours in</v>

2258
01:57:28.551 --> 01:57:29.384
<v Speaker 2>Iraq or Afghanistan and come back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>college and they have life experience </v>

2259
01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:36.620
<v Speaker 2>and they're like here because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>really want to learn,</v>

2260
01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:39.710
<v Speaker 2>not because the parents think it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right thing to do.</v>

2261
01:57:40.190 --> 01:57:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Or even in my human sexuality class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

2262
01:57:43.330 --> 01:57:44.163
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandparents in their sixties and </v>

2263
01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:47.420
<v Speaker 2>seventies sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2264
01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grand Pan.</v>

2265
01:57:48.681 --> 01:57:52.400
<v Speaker 2>They're great because they've actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>had like 50 or marriages,</v>

2266
01:57:52.401 --> 01:57:56.090
<v Speaker 2>so they know a little something about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2267
01:57:56.180 --> 01:57:57.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology and it's not for their </v>

2268
01:58:00.261 --> 01:58:02.240
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not for the status.</v>

2269
01:58:02.241 --> 01:58:04.490
<v Speaker 2>It's because they really want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and they want to learn.</v>

2270
01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:05.773
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would also imagine they're not as </v>

2271
01:58:06.831 --> 01:58:08.510
<v Speaker 2>filled with angst as an eight</v>

2272
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:13.550
<v Speaker 4>18 year old first escape from the family</v>
<v Speaker 4>nest and is not understanding what to do</v>

2273
01:58:15.151 --> 01:58:16.200
<v Speaker 4>with their freedom and</v>

2274
01:58:17.070 --> 01:58:19.700
<v Speaker 2>so many distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there just to educate,</v>

2275
01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:21.960
<v Speaker 2>educate themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2276
01:58:21.961 --> 01:58:23.730
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're less neurotic.</v>

2277
01:58:23.731 --> 01:58:25.380
<v Speaker 2>They're more confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2278
01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:29.520
<v Speaker 2>they call me out on my bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes today.</v>

2279
01:58:29.730 --> 01:58:30.451
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2280
01:58:30.451 --> 01:58:31.830
<v Speaker 2>like what bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2281
01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:34.433
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the horrifying thing now of if you're </v>

2282
01:58:35.371 --> 01:58:36.204
<v Speaker 2>teaching a class is you can make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>factual claim and any student can check </v>

2283
01:58:40.291 --> 01:58:41.124
<v Speaker 2>it on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on while I'm talking while you're </v>

2284
01:58:43.421 --> 01:58:44.254
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course the 20 year old won't </v>

2285
01:58:46.451 --> 01:58:48.040
<v Speaker 2>raise their hand and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong.</v>

2286
01:58:48.970 --> 01:58:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Put the grandmas will grandma's well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2287
01:58:53.170 --> 01:58:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yet you have to,</v>

2288
01:58:55.790 --> 01:59:00.790
<v Speaker 2>what do you even call that on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2289
01:59:03.011 --> 01:59:08.011
<v Speaker 2>So there was a book back in 99 called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2290
01:59:10.210 --> 01:59:15.210
<v Speaker 2>I think the technology of orgasm that </v>
<v Speaker 2>made the claim that vibrators were first</v>

2291
01:59:15.281 --> 01:59:16.114
<v Speaker 2>invented in the Victorian era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the late 18 hundreds to help doctors </v>

2292
01:59:20.441 --> 01:59:23.980
<v Speaker 2>bring their female patients to orgasm to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cure quote hysteria.</v>

2293
01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:28.660
<v Speaker 2>And for 20 years that was sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted as,</v>

2294
01:59:28.690 --> 01:59:29.523
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good historical analysis of </v>

2295
01:59:30.881 --> 01:59:31.714
<v Speaker 2>that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that got totally debunked in </v>

2296
01:59:35.321 --> 01:59:37.610
<v Speaker 2>the last few months by other historians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2297
01:59:37.611 --> 01:59:40.750
<v Speaker 2>the last few months I've been telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that forever.</v>

2298
01:59:40.900 --> 01:59:41.733
<v Speaker 2>I know I</v>

2299
01:59:42.340 --> 01:59:45.990
<v Speaker 4>kai had to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what's the reality?</v>

2300
01:59:45.991 --> 01:59:47.110
<v Speaker 4>They didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doctor,</v>

2301
01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:51.180
<v Speaker 4>you didn't finger back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no evidence at all that that was</v>

2302
01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:53.940
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would think that that would be a thing</v>

2303
01:59:53.941 --> 01:59:54.774
<v Speaker 4>that Gal's wouldn't want to let go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there was a place we could go or the </v>

2304
01:59:57.421 --> 02:00:00.330
<v Speaker 4>doctor definitely knew how to work it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You give you an orgasm,</v>

2305
02:00:00.331 --> 02:00:03.780
<v Speaker 4>there'd be a line around the block,</v>
<v Speaker 4>frustrated ladies,</v>

2306
02:00:03.781 --> 02:00:04.800
<v Speaker 4>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would,</v>

2307
02:00:05.130 --> 02:00:07.080
<v Speaker 4>you would think it would have left it </v>
<v Speaker 4>there in print.</v>

2308
02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:09.990
<v Speaker 4>I would not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would it stop?</v>

2309
02:00:10.350 --> 02:00:11.700
<v Speaker 4>Why would the doctor say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

2310
02:00:11.701 --> 02:00:14.330
<v Speaker 4>this business is just too goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 4>lucrative and my hands are tired.</v>

2311
02:00:14.370 --> 02:00:16.350
<v Speaker 4>Closing up shop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got carpal tunnel.</v>

2312
02:00:16.410 --> 02:00:17.610
<v Speaker 4>I can't even type anymore.</v>

2313
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the women are like,</v>

2314
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:23.900
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would that go away?</v>

2315
02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:26.030
<v Speaker 2>So it was no evidence of who invented </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2316
02:00:26.630 --> 02:00:28.790
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the name of the author </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

2317
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it even got made into a movie hysteria.</v>

2318
02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2319
02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:35.030
<v Speaker 4>The job nobody wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a book?</v>

2320
02:00:35.450 --> 02:00:36.283
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There we go about it from the New York </v>

2321
02:00:37.911 --> 02:00:40.310
<v Speaker 4>Times based off the book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or this might actually be from the book.</v>

2322
02:00:40.311 --> 02:00:42.800
<v Speaker 4>And what year is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2323
02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:44.410
<v Speaker 4>this might be the book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2324
02:00:45.110 --> 02:00:46.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's it.</v>

2325
02:00:46.730 --> 02:00:51.440
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so is this like sorta like that killer's</v>

2326
02:00:51.441 --> 02:00:54.710
<v Speaker 4>sperm theory that people still to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>day recite,</v>

2327
02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:55.573
<v Speaker 4>even though there's no evidence </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever that's prime as any other </v>

2328
02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:00.590
<v Speaker 4>function other than impregnating and </v>
<v Speaker 4>egg?</v>

2329
02:01:01.190 --> 02:01:02.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of kind of urban myths.</v>

2330
02:01:02.930 --> 02:01:05.360
<v Speaker 4>That's a big one though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a whole book written about,</v>

2331
02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:07.430
<v Speaker 4>about different kinds of berm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2332
02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:09.440
<v Speaker 4>Sperm wars attacks Berm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2333
02:01:09.590 --> 02:01:10.850
<v Speaker 4>That would kill other sperm</v>

2334
02:01:11.070 --> 02:01:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Baker and bellis back in the early </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties and those guys are assholes.</v>

2335
02:01:16.110 --> 02:01:16.943
<v Speaker 2>It was a beautiful theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like nobody could replicate it and </v>

2336
02:01:21.301 --> 02:01:22.140
<v Speaker 2>it just didn't work.</v>

2337
02:01:22.290 --> 02:01:23.123
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was a little pac man's </v>

2338
02:01:24.621 --> 02:01:26.880
<v Speaker 4>sperm of their attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another sperm.</v>

2339
02:01:26.970 --> 02:01:27.900
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They called it what?</v>

2340
02:01:27.901 --> 02:01:29.880
<v Speaker 4>Kamikaze sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what they call it?</v>

2341
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:30.833
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sperm that allegedly were </v>

2342
02:01:31.621 --> 02:01:32.880
<v Speaker 4>specialized to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2343
02:01:32.881 --> 02:01:34.560
<v Speaker 4>I remember someone brought that up to me</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

2344
02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:36.000
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2345
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.710
<v Speaker 4>I read it and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh boy,</v>

2346
02:01:37.770 --> 02:01:40.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How smaller</v>

2347
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.113
<v Speaker 1>sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's not a lot of room in there </v>

2348
02:01:42.651 --> 02:01:43.484
<v Speaker 1>for other functions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how are they even getting those </v>

2349
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>other sperm and killing them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2350
02:01:47.571 --> 02:01:49.100
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they using?</v>

2351
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:51.170
<v Speaker 1>They have acid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the alien.</v>

2352
02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:53.390
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They rotten little ied.</v>

2353
02:01:53.570 --> 02:01:54.403
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>

2354
02:01:56.640 --> 02:01:57.473
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2355
02:01:57.630 --> 02:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>they have an acrosome reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there is a tiny little warhead that</v>

2356
02:02:00.931 --> 02:02:05.240
<v Speaker 1>like helps her get into the egg a </v>
<v Speaker 1>warhead.</v>

2357
02:02:05.610 --> 02:02:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Well it's some enzymes that are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>good at that kind penetrating yeah.</v>

2358
02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Digesting their way in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2359
02:02:14.221 --> 02:02:17.280
<v Speaker 2>that's an example of urban myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2360
02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:19.633
<v Speaker 1>published urban myth published.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean at the time it was plausible but </v>

2361
02:02:24.381 --> 02:02:25.214
<v Speaker 1>it kinda got debunked fairly quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was this sort of just a </v>

2362
02:02:28.551 --> 02:02:33.551
<v Speaker 1>sensational sort of an article that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone wrote or the book that they did,</v>

2363
02:02:33.891 --> 02:02:34.910
<v Speaker 1>they just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2364
02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:36.973
<v Speaker 1>let's just fake this in order to sell a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of books and get people excited </v>

2365
02:02:40.431 --> 02:02:42.470
<v Speaker 1>about our work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they faked it.</v>

2366
02:02:42.471 --> 02:02:47.471
<v Speaker 1>I think they may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they slightly old oversold it,</v>

2367
02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:48.393
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2368
02:02:48.430 --> 02:02:52.630
<v Speaker 1>they did have some proper journal paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>publications that were peer reviewed and</v>

2369
02:02:52.631 --> 02:02:53.464
<v Speaker 1>that made sense at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I used to teach that stuff </v>

2370
02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:56.890
<v Speaker 1>cause I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2371
02:02:57.070 --> 02:02:57.940
<v Speaker 1>How'd you teach it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2372
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the,</v>

2373
02:02:59.650 --> 02:03:04.650
<v Speaker 1>what was the conventional way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing this conventional story was</v>

2374
02:03:07.710 --> 02:03:11.820
<v Speaker 2>people think we evolved to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>monogamous,</v>

2375
02:03:11.821 --> 02:03:12.654
<v Speaker 2>long term pair bonds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's some evidence that humans do </v>

2376
02:03:18.570 --> 02:03:23.160
<v Speaker 2>extra pair copulations that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes go outside the relationship.</v>

2377
02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:25.313
<v Speaker 2>If that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's occasional sperm </v>

2378
02:03:28.231 --> 02:03:29.064
<v Speaker 2>competition where a woman mates with </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than one guy during one ovulatory </v>

2379
02:03:32.311 --> 02:03:33.144
<v Speaker 2>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that potentially ejaculates from two </v>

2380
02:03:37.111 --> 02:03:37.944
<v Speaker 2>different guys could be in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproductive track competing to </v>

2381
02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:45.690
<v Speaker 2>fertilize same ag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that happens,</v>

2382
02:03:46.170 --> 02:03:51.170
<v Speaker 2>the sperm would be under selection to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>good at being fast,</v>

2383
02:03:51.571 --> 02:03:53.790
<v Speaker 2>fighting off the other sperm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2384
02:03:54.690 --> 02:03:59.190
<v Speaker 2>making the reproductive tract more </v>
<v Speaker 2>hostile to any guy who comes after you,</v>

2385
02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:00.330
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

2386
02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:05.280
<v Speaker 2>So it was kind of like a way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenging the assumption of monogamous</v>

2387
02:04:05.281 --> 02:04:06.114
<v Speaker 2>mating and pointing out women have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual freedom and agency that was not </v>

2388
02:04:12.031 --> 02:04:12.864
<v Speaker 2>fully recognized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the result is men have to compete </v>

2389
02:04:15.181 --> 02:04:18.000
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not just physically,</v>

2390
02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:20.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just for status speeding and even at</v>

2391
02:04:20.521 --> 02:04:22.080
<v Speaker 2>this kind of biochemical level.</v>

2392
02:04:23.790 --> 02:04:26.070
<v Speaker 2>And it all made sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2393
02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:29.760
<v Speaker 2>We could have been that species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as it turned out,</v>

2394
02:04:30.650 --> 02:04:31.483
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rates of extra pair copulation or </v>

2395
02:04:35.821 --> 02:04:36.654
<v Speaker 2>infidelity or actually pretty low and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of societies like it's not like 20% </v>

2396
02:04:43.711 --> 02:04:46.770
<v Speaker 2>of kids are sired by some guy other than</v>
<v Speaker 2>their dad.</v>

2397
02:04:46.771 --> 02:04:51.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like mostly well under two or 3%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2398
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:52.740
<v Speaker 2>But we're talking about now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2399
02:04:53.070 --> 02:04:53.903
<v Speaker 2>But in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in comparison to when all of this stuff </v>

2400
02:04:55.981 --> 02:04:59.460
<v Speaker 2>evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could be talking about humans of 50,</v>

2401
02:04:59.461 --> 02:05:00.810
<v Speaker 2>60,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

2402
02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:02.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is a totally different ballgame.</v>

2403
02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:05.010
<v Speaker 2>It is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>

2404
02:05:06.090 --> 02:05:11.010
<v Speaker 2>if we'd been a species with like a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of sperm competition,</v>

2405
02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:13.440
<v Speaker 2>then our testicles would be as big as </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimp testicles.</v>

2406
02:05:13.470 --> 02:05:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's interesting,</v>

2407
02:05:14.911 --> 02:05:16.320
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That when it comes,</v>

2408
02:05:16.410 --> 02:05:17.243
<v Speaker 2>there's a direct correlation between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of promiscuous females in the </v>

2409
02:05:20.491 --> 02:05:22.320
<v Speaker 2>size of the testicles of the male.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2410
02:05:22.710 --> 02:05:24.450
<v Speaker 2>Which is why girls have little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 2>dicks.</v>

2411
02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause they're just dominating.</v>

2412
02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:27.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2413
02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

2414
02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:34.860
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't try to do some other alpha </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad idea.</v>

2415
02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:38.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean crazy that something grew to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>so strong,</v>

2416
02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:43.380
<v Speaker 2>so powerful with giant fangs and it only</v>
<v Speaker 2>eats like stalks of grass.</v>

2417
02:05:43.381 --> 02:05:45.510
<v Speaker 2>And Broccoli and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2418
02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:48.353
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of these little things in </v>

2419
02:05:49.501 --> 02:05:52.620
<v Speaker 2>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these little urban myths that get,</v>

2420
02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:54.763
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn by professors and Grad school and </v>

2421
02:05:56.701 --> 02:05:57.534
<v Speaker 2>never really tested and then passed on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now that whole house of cards has </v>

2422
02:06:02.071 --> 02:06:02.904
<v Speaker 2>been tumbling down the last couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years where like almost everything that </v>

2423
02:06:07.231 --> 02:06:12.231
<v Speaker 2>was taught in a social psychology course</v>
<v Speaker 2>now turns out to be kind of bullshit and</v>

2424
02:06:12.781 --> 02:06:16.110
<v Speaker 2>not like what other examples?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2425
02:06:18.930 --> 02:06:19.763
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you can use a implicit </v>
<v Speaker 2>association test or iat to sort of </v>

2426
02:06:24.571 --> 02:06:27.210
<v Speaker 2>register how sexist or racist somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2427
02:06:27.930 --> 02:06:28.763
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a big exciting thing that </v>

2428
02:06:31.741 --> 02:06:32.574
<v Speaker 2>social psychologist thought that they'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered that you can give someone </v>

2429
02:06:35.371 --> 02:06:36.204
<v Speaker 2>this kind of computer test that measures</v>
<v Speaker 2>word associations and that kind of </v>

2430
02:06:40.531 --> 02:06:44.190
<v Speaker 2>determine like how secretly sexist are </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2431
02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:49.620
<v Speaker 2>And that turned into a whole industry of</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving these tests,</v>

2432
02:06:49.621 --> 02:06:53.190
<v Speaker 2>everybody in corporations to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>assess,</v>

2433
02:06:53.890 --> 02:06:55.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you secretly sexist and it,</v>

2434
02:06:55.940 --> 02:06:58.050
<v Speaker 2>and to sort of wag fingers at them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2435
02:06:58.051 --> 02:07:00.810
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you scored positive on this test,</v>

2436
02:07:01.290 --> 02:07:06.150
<v Speaker 2>that means you really are secretly </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist and therefore you need training.</v>

2437
02:07:06.430 --> 02:07:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2438
02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:10.830
<v Speaker 2>and that's the industry and this is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened with starbucks,</v>

2439
02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:11.693
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few months ago when they had that </v>

2440
02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:16.223
<v Speaker 2>issue with the black guys and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>starbucks and starbucks didn't handle </v>

2441
02:07:19.651 --> 02:07:20.484
<v Speaker 2>that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there is public blow back and </v>

2442
02:07:23.251 --> 02:07:24.450
<v Speaker 2>starbucks went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2443
02:07:24.451 --> 02:07:25.284
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do implicit association </v>
<v Speaker 2>training for all of our staff </v>

2444
02:07:27.871 --> 02:07:31.410
<v Speaker 2>nationwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of us in psychology.</v>

2445
02:07:31.411 --> 02:07:33.270
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

2446
02:07:33.271 --> 02:07:38.230
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys know that was all debunked like</v>

2447
02:07:38.230 --> 02:07:39.460
<v Speaker 2>a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all nonsense.</v>

2448
02:07:39.490 --> 02:07:40.323
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just concerned about the optics </v>

2449
02:07:40.991 --> 02:07:42.640
<v Speaker 2>in order to make their stock go up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2450
02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:43.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2451
02:07:44.770 --> 02:07:46.330
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pr move,</v>

2452
02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:48.400
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not science based.</v>

2453
02:07:48.550 --> 02:07:49.383
<v Speaker 2>It's not science based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and anybody who's a savvy consumer will </v>

2454
02:07:53.260 --> 02:07:56.380
<v Speaker 2>be able to like Google this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

2455
02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:57.280
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2456
02:07:58.240 --> 02:07:59.073
<v Speaker 2>it's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But implicit bias training is still </v>

2457
02:08:00.671 --> 02:08:01.540
<v Speaker 2>being used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2458
02:08:01.570 --> 02:08:03.670
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's all horse shit.</v>

2459
02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2460
02:08:07.630 --> 02:08:11.800
<v Speaker 4>So what is the method like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say if you ran a corporation and,</v>

2461
02:08:11.801 --> 02:08:12.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2462
02:08:12.881 --> 02:08:13.601
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey everybody,</v>

2463
02:08:13.601 --> 02:08:16.210
<v Speaker 4>Jeffery's going to come in and teach us </v>
<v Speaker 4>how not to be racist.</v>

2464
02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:18.190
<v Speaker 4>You might be racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even know it.</v>

2465
02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:19.570
<v Speaker 4>And Jeffrey's going to show you how,</v>

2466
02:08:21.290 --> 02:08:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know what they do in </v>
<v Speaker 2>implicit bias training.</v>

2467
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.823
<v Speaker 2>I know that they typically will give </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody one of these implicit </v>

2468
02:08:27.681 --> 02:08:28.514
<v Speaker 2>association tests that purports to show </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have issues and you do have </v>

2469
02:08:33.441 --> 02:08:34.274
<v Speaker 2>hidden bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what would be like a question on </v>

2470
02:08:36.021 --> 02:08:39.140
<v Speaker 2>one of these tests?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like associations.</v>

2471
02:08:40.220 --> 02:08:41.053
<v Speaker 2>It's basically d are you faster to </v>
<v Speaker 2>associate this stigmatized group with </v>

2472
02:08:46.251 --> 02:08:50.240
<v Speaker 2>this negative word than you are to </v>
<v Speaker 2>associate them with a positive word?</v>

2473
02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:53.510
<v Speaker 2>And you can measure reaction time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>

2474
02:08:53.930 --> 02:08:57.530
<v Speaker 2>So lever in your hand or by you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing,</v>

2475
02:08:57.590 --> 02:09:00.260
<v Speaker 2>you're pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing words flash on screens and</v>

2476
02:09:00.261 --> 02:09:03.330
<v Speaker 2>you're pushing buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

2477
02:09:03.490 --> 02:09:04.323
<v Speaker 2>the subtle differences in reaction speed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like the good versus the bad </v>

2478
02:09:08.991 --> 02:09:09.824
<v Speaker 2>associations are supposed to map like </v>
<v Speaker 2>your attitude towards the group in </v>

2479
02:09:15.111 --> 02:09:20.111
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a,</v>

2480
02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:21.193
<v Speaker 2>it's a reliable a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is it doesn't actually </v>

2481
02:09:23.121 --> 02:09:26.900
<v Speaker 2>predict real sexist behavior in real </v>
<v Speaker 2>life or racist behavior.</v>

2482
02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:28.633
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how did it get past the initial </v>

2483
02:09:33.531 --> 02:09:35.600
<v Speaker 2>stages to the point what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>implemented?</v>

2484
02:09:35.770 --> 02:09:36.603
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social psychology has just a very </v>

2485
02:09:38.871 --> 02:09:39.704
<v Speaker 2>politically correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually everybody in it is pretty far </v>

2486
02:09:43.791 --> 02:09:46.610
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're conservative or centrist,</v>

2487
02:09:46.611 --> 02:09:50.210
<v Speaker 2>you pretty quickly get driven out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2488
02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Centra,</v>

2489
02:09:52.141 --> 02:09:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Steven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2490
02:09:55.250 --> 02:09:59.300
<v Speaker 2>well we have pretty good data now unlike</v>
<v Speaker 2>like political affiliations of people in</v>

2491
02:09:59.301 --> 02:10:04.301
<v Speaker 2>different fields and in psychology it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least like 10 or 15 to one liberal to</v>

2492
02:10:05.541 --> 02:10:08.270
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that is?</v>

2493
02:10:08.630 --> 02:10:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Is that more of the indoctrination of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the walled garden of academia?</v>

2494
02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:14.713
<v Speaker 2>I think it's partly that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's also like there is </v>

2495
02:10:18.650 --> 02:10:21.970
<v Speaker 2>pretty overt hostility to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2496
02:10:22.970 --> 02:10:23.803
<v Speaker 2>centrist conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarians where you just kind of get </v>

2497
02:10:26.991 --> 02:10:29.270
<v Speaker 2>these signals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you start Grad school that,</v>

2498
02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:33.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you asked all others,</v>

2499
02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:34.760
<v Speaker 2>other students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2500
02:10:34.761 --> 02:10:37.520
<v Speaker 2>do you want to go to the shooting range </v>
<v Speaker 2>or do you want to go hunting?</v>

2501
02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:38.533
<v Speaker 2>Or let's talk about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're on the wrong side of </v>

2502
02:10:44.090 --> 02:10:44.923
<v Speaker 2>what's considered normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're made to feel pretty </v>

2503
02:10:47.301 --> 02:10:49.970
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'll probably just,</v>

2504
02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave Grad school and go,</v>

2505
02:10:51.710 --> 02:10:53.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hell with that.</v>

2506
02:10:53.001 --> 02:10:56.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneur.</v>

2507
02:10:57.290 --> 02:10:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2508
02:10:59.710 --> 02:11:02.980
<v Speaker 4>So just the hostility forces people out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's as a tribal environment.</v>

2509
02:11:03.070 --> 02:11:05.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the source of that?</v>

2510
02:11:06.670 --> 02:11:11.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like if you're going to do real</v>

2511
02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:12.873
<v Speaker 4>social experimental work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're really going to try to </v>

2512
02:11:15.971 --> 02:11:20.310
<v Speaker 4>understand human behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really gotta be done objectively to</v>

2513
02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:21.183
<v Speaker 4>really get the actual raw data to really</v>
<v Speaker 4>be able to do scientific work where </v>

2514
02:11:25.781 --> 02:11:26.614
<v Speaker 4>you're explaining things and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>gauge cause and effect and origins of </v>

2515
02:11:31.091 --> 02:11:31.924
<v Speaker 4>thought and behavior patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to do it really objectively </v>

2516
02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:36.693
<v Speaker 4>the same way you would do mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to really look at it </v>

2517
02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:43.720
<v Speaker 4>cautiously and get your data points in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order and,</v>

2518
02:11:43.721 --> 02:11:46.240
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you're doing real good work,</v>

2519
02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:51.550
<v Speaker 4>you would think that there would be more</v>
<v Speaker 4>of an inclination to do good work,</v>

2520
02:11:51.730 --> 02:11:56.100
<v Speaker 4>then it would be to a ps whatever tribe </v>
<v Speaker 4>you belong to too.</v>

2521
02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:59.110
<v Speaker 2>He would hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2522
02:11:59.950 --> 02:12:02.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take political psychology,</v>

2523
02:12:02.231 --> 02:12:03.064
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the whole point is to understand </v>

2524
02:12:04.481 --> 02:12:07.000
<v Speaker 2>how people think about politics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral issues.</v>

2525
02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:11.800
<v Speaker 2>There's a huge liberal bias and </v>
<v Speaker 2>political psychology and you would think</v>

2526
02:12:11.801 --> 02:12:14.560
<v Speaker 2>they would have corrected that and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2527
02:12:14.561 --> 02:12:15.394
<v Speaker 2>it's that maybe we're missing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>by not like we have a conference of 500 </v>

2528
02:12:20.201 --> 02:12:22.930
<v Speaker 2>people and there's not a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian here or whatever.</v>

2529
02:12:23.290 --> 02:12:26.040
<v Speaker 2>And they never self corrected like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2530
02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:27.640
<v Speaker 2>they just assumed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2531
02:12:28.420 --> 02:12:31.520
<v Speaker 2>we're all well intentioned and we're all</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart so we're going to be able to,</v>

2532
02:12:31.670 --> 02:12:36.670
<v Speaker 2>to check our own biases and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely failed to do that.</v>

2533
02:12:38.590 --> 02:12:43.590
<v Speaker 2>So you have all these measures of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>political attitudes invented by leftists</v>

2534
02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:51.120
<v Speaker 2>that kind of demonize conservatives or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or centrists as basically being mentally</v>

2535
02:12:54.731 --> 02:12:56.760
<v Speaker 2>ill or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or stupid or,</v>

2536
02:12:56.790 --> 02:12:57.623
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you fit on the political </v>

2537
02:12:59.291 --> 02:13:00.124
<v Speaker 2>spectrum?</v>

2538
02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:05.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of a centrist libertarian with </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a complicated patchwork of views.</v>

2539
02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:07.473
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be considered extremely far left on </v>

2540
02:13:10.871 --> 02:13:11.704
<v Speaker 2>certain things and pretty far right on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on other things like what far right and </v>

2541
02:13:16.301 --> 02:13:18.200
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2542
02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:25.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm pro gun rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty cautious about immigration,</v>

2543
02:13:26.380 --> 02:13:31.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on pro economic freedom.</v>

2544
02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want a big,</v>

2545
02:13:33.210 --> 02:13:38.210
<v Speaker 2>expensive state that has high tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>burdens and,</v>

2546
02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2547
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:44.550
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in complicated ways,</v>

2548
02:13:44.551 --> 02:13:47.970
<v Speaker 2>kind of profoundly values and pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>natalist and like,</v>

2549
02:13:47.971 --> 02:13:52.971
<v Speaker 2>I think longterm relationships are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily conventional ones,</v>

2550
02:13:53.161 --> 02:13:53.994
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty concerned about society </v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out a way to make it possible </v>

2551
02:13:58.741 --> 02:14:02.190
<v Speaker 2>for ordinary folks to have longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships and raise families.</v>

2552
02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:07.180
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it fascinating that that's a right</v>
<v Speaker 4>wing thing?</v>

2553
02:14:09.460 --> 02:14:10.293
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't you think that something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would encourage families like the </v>

2554
02:14:14.501 --> 02:14:16.450
<v Speaker 4>universal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't be tribal.</v>

2555
02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:17.493
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would think that something that </v>

2556
02:14:17.951 --> 02:14:18.784
<v Speaker 4>would encourage longterm relationships </v>
<v Speaker 4>and monogamous pair bonding and people </v>

2557
02:14:24.521 --> 02:14:25.354
<v Speaker 4>getting together and working out long </v>
<v Speaker 4>term solutions to keep a family </v>

2558
02:14:29.591 --> 02:14:30.424
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>

2559
02:14:31.380 --> 02:14:32.213
<v Speaker 2>that'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2560
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:35.580
<v Speaker 2>that'd be good for everybody you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

2561
02:14:35.610 --> 02:14:38.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems like a left wing thing too.</v>

2562
02:14:38.490 --> 02:14:41.700
<v Speaker 2>So the left is very concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmental sustainability.</v>

2563
02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2564
02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:43.373
<v Speaker 2>But they're not that concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of what you could call the </v>

2565
02:14:45.111 --> 02:14:48.690
<v Speaker 2>civilizational sustainability or family </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainability.</v>

2566
02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:55.240
<v Speaker 2>And I don't totally understand why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you tend to get the right thinking,</v>

2567
02:14:56.810 --> 02:14:57.643
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's this going to affect my great </v>

2568
02:15:00.660 --> 02:15:01.493
<v Speaker 2>grandkids or allow me to have any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the left is more like how's this </v>

2569
02:15:04.591 --> 02:15:05.424
<v Speaker 2>gonna Affect Harp seals and polar bail </v>
<v Speaker 2>bears in a hundred days and one should </v>

2570
02:15:14.941 --> 02:15:16.500
<v Speaker 2>sort of imply the other but</v>

2571
02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:18.133
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2572
02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:20.850
<v Speaker 4>Hence being a centrist</v>

2573
02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:22.800
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2574
02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:24.390
<v Speaker 2>that's being a centrist and like</v>

2575
02:15:27.950 --> 02:15:28.783
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing like when you try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reach a conclusion about a particular </v>

2576
02:15:33.111 --> 02:15:33.944
<v Speaker 2>political issue based on what you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>is think of the facts and the evidence </v>

2577
02:15:37.791 --> 02:15:42.791
<v Speaker 2>in the good arguments and then you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that for each issue separately.</v>

2578
02:15:44.570 --> 02:15:45.403
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rather than doing kind of tribal </v>

2579
02:15:46.221 --> 02:15:49.130
<v Speaker 2>affiliation signaling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

2580
02:15:49.131 --> 02:15:49.964
<v Speaker 2>very confusing to people because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how can you be like pro cannabis </v>

2581
02:15:56.241 --> 02:16:01.241
<v Speaker 2>legalization if you're also pro guns or </v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you be like open to polyamory if</v>

2582
02:16:04.071 --> 02:16:09.071
<v Speaker 2>you're also concerned about long term </v>
<v Speaker 2>family stability or whatever.</v>

2583
02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just cause of the issues I looked</v>

2584
02:16:13.821 --> 02:16:16.940
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the end dies.</v>

2585
02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I ended up supporting.</v>

2586
02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:20.920
<v Speaker 4>Does this go back to what we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about earlier,</v>

2587
02:16:20.921 --> 02:16:21.754
<v Speaker 4>that most people really don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time to form these opinions or become </v>

2588
02:16:26.321 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 4>informed on these opinions and instead </v>
<v Speaker 4>they just sort of adopt a pattern of</v>

2589
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:34.980
<v Speaker 3>behavior that seems to be the tribe that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they most affiliate with.</v>

2590
02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:38.680
<v Speaker 3>So this this way are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a conglomeration of opinions.</v>

2591
02:16:38.930 --> 02:16:41.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to accept these opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2592
02:16:41.980 --> 02:16:42.813
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so strange that we have to very </v>

2593
02:16:46.451 --> 02:16:49.270
<v Speaker 3>clear sides this left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2594
02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:50.253
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we even have it represented by blue and </v>

2595
02:16:52.331 --> 02:16:54.950
<v Speaker 3>red.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this goes back to,</v>

2596
02:16:54.951 --> 02:16:57.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Korean version of the Yin Yang,</v>

2597
02:16:58.330 --> 02:16:59.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

2598
02:16:59.590 --> 02:17:02.650
<v Speaker 3>the Korean flag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have that Yin Yang,</v>

2599
02:17:02.651 --> 02:17:06.400
<v Speaker 3>but it's instead of white and black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's red and blue.</v>

2600
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:08.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is what it is.</v>

2601
02:17:08.141 --> 02:17:08.974
<v Speaker 3>It's these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these opposites that work together in </v>

2602
02:17:11.921 --> 02:17:13.090
<v Speaker 3>harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2603
02:17:14.180 --> 02:17:15.013
<v Speaker 10>well,</v>

2604
02:17:15.170 --> 02:17:16.190
<v Speaker 3>our society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2605
02:17:16.191 --> 02:17:16.971
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>

2606
02:17:16.971 --> 02:17:20.000
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be some sort of a natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>system that we gravitate towards.</v>

2607
02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people police it.</v>

2608
02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:26.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not like everyone just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chooses one side or the other and then,</v>

2609
02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:27.693
<v Speaker 2>and then they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I guess it makes sense that if you </v>

2610
02:17:29.591 --> 02:17:30.424
<v Speaker 2>believe the laughed about issue a should</v>
<v Speaker 2>also believe the left about issues b c </v>

2611
02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:37.420
<v Speaker 2>through z.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you deviate,</v>

2612
02:17:37.421 --> 02:17:38.260
<v Speaker 2>you got punished for it.</v>

2613
02:17:38.490 --> 02:17:41.340
<v Speaker 3>Well people use the term we to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to win the house.</v>

2614
02:17:41.700 --> 02:17:43.050
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2615
02:17:43.170 --> 02:17:45.210
<v Speaker 3>we've got to win the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

2616
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:46.470
<v Speaker 3>who's we?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2617
02:17:46.620 --> 02:17:48.480
<v Speaker 3>Are we running bob?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are we doing?</v>

2618
02:17:49.290 --> 02:17:50.610
<v Speaker 3>But people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2619
02:17:50.700 --> 02:17:53.580
<v Speaker 3>it's basically like the raiders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to get to the superbowl.</v>

2620
02:17:55.260 --> 02:18:00.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is very tribal but I mean it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird because when,</v>

2621
02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:02.513
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a literal tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have your territory and your </v>

2622
02:18:05.281 --> 02:18:09.210
<v Speaker 2>resources and your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mates that you're defending and the</v>

2623
02:18:09.211 --> 02:18:12.270
<v Speaker 2>other tribe on the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hill has their territory resources,</v>

2624
02:18:12.271 --> 02:18:13.104
<v Speaker 2>mates and kids and you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a little bit of a zero sum </v>

2625
02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:18.233
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're all in the same effing </v>

2626
02:18:20.281 --> 02:18:21.860
<v Speaker 2>country together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2627
02:18:23.010 --> 02:18:23.843
<v Speaker 2>And you're all paying taxes to the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority and you're all partaking in </v>

2628
02:18:27.571 --> 02:18:32.571
<v Speaker 2>the same economy and you're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling in the same public sphere of,</v>

2629
02:18:33.450 --> 02:18:37.230
<v Speaker 2>of the Netflix that you watch and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter we are engaged with.</v>

2630
02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:40.313
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be more positive sum than </v>

2631
02:18:42.151 --> 02:18:42.984
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2632
02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is why I wanted to ask you this.</v>

2633
02:18:44.781 --> 02:18:46.790
<v Speaker 3>As an evolutionary psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does this,</v>

2634
02:18:46.791 --> 02:18:47.960
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2635
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:51.410
<v Speaker 3>you're obviously far more aware of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the average person,</v>

2636
02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:52.273
<v Speaker 3>does this just go back to the way the </v>
<v Speaker 3>human brain developed when we were </v>

2637
02:18:56.481 --> 02:19:01.340
<v Speaker 3>living in small tribes and that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>this inherent need for an us versus them</v>

2638
02:19:01.341 --> 02:19:03.110
<v Speaker 3>mentality that keeps us moving?</v>

2639
02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:04.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

2640
02:19:06.270 --> 02:19:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2641
02:19:08.130 --> 02:19:11.640
<v Speaker 2>the people who have thought the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply about this,</v>

2642
02:19:11.641 --> 02:19:12.474
<v Speaker 2>like I'm a big fan of Jonathan Heights' </v>
<v Speaker 2>work and the righteous mind and the way </v>

2643
02:19:15.271 --> 02:19:18.390
<v Speaker 2>he kind of analyzes this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2644
02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:25.160
<v Speaker 2>I think it will be quite hard to escape </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tribal thinking,</v>

2645
02:19:25.380 --> 02:19:29.180
<v Speaker 2>but we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have escaped it with respect to a lot</v>

2646
02:19:29.181 --> 02:19:30.380
<v Speaker 2>of issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2647
02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Where we really did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did reach a moral common ground.</v>

2648
02:19:34.550 --> 02:19:37.430
<v Speaker 2>Like we all kind of Said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

2649
02:19:37.431 --> 02:19:41.300
<v Speaker 2>slavery was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women should be able to vote.</v>

2650
02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:43.353
<v Speaker 9>MMM.</v>

2651
02:19:44.930 --> 02:19:47.330
<v Speaker 2>We should try to reduce the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear war.</v>

2652
02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:51.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on some really big issues,</v>

2653
02:19:51.861 --> 02:19:55.990
<v Speaker 2>we have succeeded pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And kind of setting aside the,</v>

2654
02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:57.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tribalism,</v>

2655
02:19:58.280 --> 02:19:59.113
<v Speaker 2>I think the problem now is there's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>so many issues that are coming at us so </v>

2656
02:20:02.121 --> 02:20:05.030
<v Speaker 2>fast that we don't have time to reach </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2657
02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:06.620
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2658
02:20:06.620 --> 02:20:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Social equilibrium on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and off of them quickly enough.</v>

2659
02:20:10.980 --> 02:20:11.813
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what fascinates me by augmented </v>

2660
02:20:13.261 --> 02:20:14.094
<v Speaker 3>reality and things like neuro link,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's going to accentuate </v>

2661
02:20:17.581 --> 02:20:18.414
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability and the power of the human </v>

2662
02:20:19.441 --> 02:20:20.274
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we're going to be able to take </v>

2663
02:20:20.980 --> 02:20:24.340
<v Speaker 3>into consideration all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2664
02:20:24.910 --> 02:20:25.743
<v Speaker 3>in a much like with Elan's term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have more bandwidth to work on </v>

2665
02:20:29.251 --> 02:20:30.150
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2666
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:33.390
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the more I think about it,</v>

2667
02:20:33.660 --> 02:20:38.610
<v Speaker 3>I think that this just quagmire of </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

2668
02:20:38.611 --> 02:20:42.480
<v Speaker 3>There's so many different things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were conflicted about that really.</v>

2669
02:20:42.481 --> 02:20:44.610
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it boils down to a lack of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

2670
02:20:44.980 --> 02:20:45.813
<v Speaker 3>lack of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lack of also training in how to </v>

2671
02:20:49.741 --> 02:20:52.500
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that's most disturbing</v>

2672
02:20:52.501 --> 02:20:54.960
<v Speaker 3>about education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly lower education,</v>

2673
02:20:55.350 --> 02:20:58.260
<v Speaker 3>is that no one ever tells you how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

2674
02:20:58.410 --> 02:21:01.410
<v Speaker 3>They give you information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't tell you.</v>

2675
02:21:01.411 --> 02:21:03.750
<v Speaker 3>Now here's the tricks your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing on you.</v>

2676
02:21:04.020 --> 02:21:08.430
<v Speaker 3>Like this is why you think certain ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is if you're lucky,</v>

2677
02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:12.300
<v Speaker 3>if you're really lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone teaches you about discipline,</v>

2678
02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:13.433
<v Speaker 3>they teach you about resistance and </v>
<v Speaker 3>about apathy in about about a </v>

2679
02:21:19.350 --> 02:21:23.040
<v Speaker 3>procrastination and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>games that your mind will play on you.</v>

2680
02:21:23.041 --> 02:21:23.874
<v Speaker 3>And just that alone will give you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to work through things and get </v>

2681
02:21:26.401 --> 02:21:27.234
<v Speaker 3>more stuff done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But very rarely does that even get </v>

2682
02:21:29.311 --> 02:21:30.144
<v Speaker 3>discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So most of the time you're just getting </v>

2683
02:21:32.221 --> 02:21:33.054
<v Speaker 3>boring information stuffed into your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking face and you barely pay </v>

2684
02:21:36.151 --> 02:21:39.060
<v Speaker 3>attention to it enough to pass the test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as the test is over,</v>

2685
02:21:39.061 --> 02:21:40.090
<v Speaker 3>you forget everything you learned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned</v>

2686
02:21:41.350 --> 02:21:42.980
<v Speaker 2>because he really didn't learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just memorize it.</v>

2687
02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:45.033
<v Speaker 2>And I wouldn't take that long to learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the top dozen rationality hawks </v>

2688
02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:50.193
<v Speaker 2>that like the rationalist community or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the effective altruism community are </v>

2689
02:21:52.811 --> 02:21:54.880
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good at using and teaching.</v>

2690
02:21:55.600 --> 02:21:56.433
<v Speaker 2>Like just the idea of steel manning an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument where you develop the ability </v>

2691
02:22:01.001 --> 02:22:01.834
<v Speaker 2>to state the strongest possible version </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your opponent's argument in a way </v>

2692
02:22:05.801 --> 02:22:06.634
<v Speaker 2>that they would go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've said that even better than I </v>

2693
02:22:09.251 --> 02:22:10.510
<v Speaker 2>could say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

2694
02:22:10.540 --> 02:22:13.900
<v Speaker 2>That means you really understand me even</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you disagree with it.</v>

2695
02:22:14.380 --> 02:22:17.170
<v Speaker 2>That's a good term to steel man as </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to a straw man.</v>

2696
02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we just taught,</v>

2697
02:22:20.260 --> 02:22:22.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids in high school how to do that,</v>

2698
02:22:23.260 --> 02:22:24.093
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that would go long way towards </v>

2699
02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:30.030
<v Speaker 2>being able to have these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these tribal dialogues.</v>

2700
02:22:31.690 --> 02:22:32.523
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or just that being able to think </v>

2701
02:22:33.481 --> 02:22:38.100
<v Speaker 2>quantitatively about political and </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy issues.</v>

2702
02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Like how many people are affected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are they affected,</v>

2703
02:22:41.401 --> 02:22:42.234
<v Speaker 2>how much would it cost to fix?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we know what the best way to do </v>

2704
02:22:44.311 --> 02:22:46.170
<v Speaker 2>it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2705
02:22:47.730 --> 02:22:51.690
<v Speaker 2>rather than just diving straight for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional argument.</v>

2706
02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:55.133
<v Speaker 2>I think that would help a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is it really in anyone's vested </v>

2707
02:22:59.071 --> 02:22:59.904
<v Speaker 2>interest to teach that and do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>current stock of members of the public </v>

2708
02:23:06.751 --> 02:23:09.960
<v Speaker 2>school teachers unions really have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability or interest to teach that.</v>

2709
02:23:10.470 --> 02:23:11.303
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It almost seems like something they're </v>

2710
02:23:11.700 --> 02:23:16.140
<v Speaker 2>going to have to learn online and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>augment their traditional education.</v>

2711
02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:17.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ideally you'd have like a virtual </v>

2712
02:23:19.261 --> 02:23:20.094
<v Speaker 2>reality system where a kid could go into</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and argue about some issue like gun </v>

2713
02:23:24.121 --> 02:23:29.121
<v Speaker 2>rights or abortion or immigration and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some ai would sort of argue against them</v>

2714
02:23:29.791 --> 02:23:33.210
<v Speaker 2>or picking out their arguments or go </v>
<v Speaker 2>convince me of your position.</v>

2715
02:23:33.430 --> 02:23:34.263
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And somehow or another make it </v>

2716
02:23:34.681 --> 02:23:35.610
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2717
02:23:36.210 --> 02:23:37.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2718
02:23:37.531 --> 02:23:38.640
<v Speaker 2>Make it fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

2719
02:23:40.530 --> 02:23:41.730
<v Speaker 2>whatever make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2720
02:23:41.940 --> 02:23:44.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it,</v>

2721
02:23:44.851 --> 02:23:48.090
<v Speaker 2>you're arguing with rick and Morty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2722
02:23:52.350 --> 02:23:53.183
<v Speaker 2>That is a,</v>

2723
02:23:53.550 --> 02:23:57.990
<v Speaker 4>one of the big issues with learning </v>
<v Speaker 4>things is making things fun,</v>

2724
02:23:58.710 --> 02:24:03.710
<v Speaker 4>making things somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a enthralling and captivating something,</v>

2725
02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:06.630
<v Speaker 4>something that you actually want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>absorb.</v>

2726
02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:10.830
<v Speaker 4>And it's one of the great arguments </v>
<v Speaker 4>about video games.</v>

2727
02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:12.113
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2728
02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:18.500
<v Speaker 4>one of the more interesting things about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the previous generations,</v>

2729
02:24:18.530 --> 02:24:19.363
<v Speaker 4>sort of a dismissal of video games,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the dismissal was at one point </v>

2730
02:24:22.971 --> 02:24:23.481
<v Speaker 4>in time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2731
02:24:23.481 --> 02:24:25.670
<v Speaker 4>you're just wasting your time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now that,</v>

2732
02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:28.520
<v Speaker 4>that dismissal doesn't necessarily hold </v>
<v Speaker 4>water,</v>

2733
02:24:28.521 --> 02:24:33.440
<v Speaker 4>because just like professional golfers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>professional video game players now make</v>

2734
02:24:33.441 --> 02:24:36.350
<v Speaker 4>enormous sums of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's gotten to this place where,</v>

2735
02:24:36.380 --> 02:24:37.213
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a viable career and perhaps you </v>

2736
02:24:39.231 --> 02:24:40.064
<v Speaker 4>should even be taking your kid to </v>
<v Speaker 4>coaching and learning strategy and </v>

2737
02:24:43.911 --> 02:24:45.450
<v Speaker 4>learning all these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2738
02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:50.210
<v Speaker 4>various applications that allow you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get better at these things that,</v>

2739
02:24:50.211 --> 02:24:53.320
<v Speaker 4>cause there's a real career in this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean.</v>

2740
02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:55.250
<v Speaker 4>Try telling that to your GRANDPA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2741
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:56.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2742
02:24:57.140 --> 02:24:58.700
<v Speaker 4>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the game they played for the most</v>

2743
02:24:58.701 --> 02:25:00.830
<v Speaker 4>money today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fortnite.</v>

2744
02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:02.290
<v Speaker 4>Fortnite right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2745
02:25:02.330 --> 02:25:03.163
<v Speaker 4>The big one that you're going to wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be a professional fortnight </v>

2746
02:25:05.211 --> 02:25:06.380
<v Speaker 4>player.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would say,</v>

2747
02:25:06.381 --> 02:25:07.680
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2748
02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:09.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be a professional golfer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How good are you,</v>

2749
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:10.850
<v Speaker 4>Johnny?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2750
02:25:10.851 --> 02:25:11.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm an underpart,</v>

2751
02:25:11.930 --> 02:25:13.220
<v Speaker 2>eh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2752
02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:16.480
<v Speaker 2>I want to be the next tiger woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2753
02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:17.353
<v Speaker 2>in my cohort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of other academics I've talked to </v>

2754
02:25:20.020 --> 02:25:21.100
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2755
02:25:21.101 --> 02:25:26.101
<v Speaker 2>did you play Sid Meier civilization a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot in Grad school or postdoc and yeah.</v>

2756
02:25:26.650 --> 02:25:27.670
<v Speaker 2>And we all go,</v>

2757
02:25:28.650 --> 02:25:29.060
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2758
02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:29.893
<v Speaker 2>most of our understanding about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of technology and like world </v>

2759
02:25:32.871 --> 02:25:35.330
<v Speaker 2>affairs and economics comes from playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that game.</v>

2760
02:25:35.450 --> 02:25:36.650
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2761
02:25:36.980 --> 02:25:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I never played it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does it work?</v>

2762
02:25:38.540 --> 02:25:43.040
<v Speaker 2>Is it a one of those role playing games?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started out in like the dark ages and</v>

2763
02:25:43.041 --> 02:25:45.770
<v Speaker 2>you progress through like Bronze Age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iron Age,</v>

2764
02:25:45.771 --> 02:25:50.400
<v Speaker 2>you invent railroads and then eventually</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like colonize Alpha Centauri and you</v>

2765
02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:55.010
<v Speaker 2>playing against the computer or it's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>human's turn based strategy game against</v>

2766
02:25:55.011 --> 02:25:56.660
<v Speaker 2>the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2767
02:25:57.050 --> 02:25:57.883
<v Speaker 2>but you kind of learn the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology tree and what everything's </v>

2768
02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:00.793
<v Speaker 2>called and what followed what and God I </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hope said Meyer got it right more or </v>

2769
02:26:04.371 --> 02:26:08.360
<v Speaker 2>less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a much more compelling way to</v>

2770
02:26:08.361 --> 02:26:12.470
<v Speaker 2>learn all that than like taking whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>European history ap.</v>

2771
02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:13.393
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that's incredibly </v>

2772
02:26:15.891 --> 02:26:17.030
<v Speaker 2>immersive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>

2773
02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:19.310
<v Speaker 8>how could they do something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

2774
02:26:19.490 --> 02:26:20.323
<v Speaker 8>the new discovery mode turns on </v>
<v Speaker 8>assassin's creed origins is doing </v>

2775
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:23.383
<v Speaker 8>interactive history lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like ancient Egypt I believe is </v>

2776
02:26:25.731 --> 02:26:28.490
<v Speaker 8>what they do here.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And it's like deep detail,</v>

2777
02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:32.000
<v Speaker 8>really creation of it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You go through it and they take for this</v>

2778
02:26:32.001 --> 02:26:32.834
<v Speaker 8>mode,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they kind of take all the the shoot and </v>

2779
02:26:34.101 --> 02:26:34.934
<v Speaker 8>that's shooting but stabbing and killing</v>
<v Speaker 8>the people and just walk you through </v>

2780
02:26:37.671 --> 02:26:40.010
<v Speaker 8>ancient and Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Cairo you get to see people die.</v>

2781
02:26:40.490 --> 02:26:41.970
<v Speaker 8>Not In this mode.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Maybe they did.</v>

2782
02:26:41.971 --> 02:26:42.804
<v Speaker 8>They might show some stuff of what not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but so that you can either have it </v>

2783
02:26:45.771 --> 02:26:47.510
<v Speaker 8>graphic or non graphic cause that's the </v>
<v Speaker 8>idea.</v>

2784
02:26:47.570 --> 02:26:49.190
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then they can show you through the map,</v>

2785
02:26:49.550 --> 02:26:51.590
<v Speaker 8>take you to play a video of this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Can I watch this?</v>

2786
02:26:52.730 --> 02:26:54.920
<v Speaker 8>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I need to see this.</v>

2787
02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:57.550
<v Speaker 8>I'll look it up like okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2788
02:26:57.620 --> 02:27:00.140
<v Speaker 8>I mean that would be the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 8>teach people.</v>

2789
02:27:00.141 --> 02:27:05.030
<v Speaker 8>Things do make some sort of interactive </v>
<v Speaker 8>environment,</v>

2790
02:27:05.060 --> 02:27:09.890
<v Speaker 8>especially virtual where you could go </v>
<v Speaker 8>there and experience it.</v>

2791
02:27:09.891 --> 02:27:10.820
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I mean,</v>

2792
02:27:10.821 --> 02:27:14.060
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if you've messed around </v>
<v Speaker 8>with any of the htc vive things.</v>

2793
02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:15.150
<v Speaker 8>Oh is this year?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So yeah,</v>

2794
02:27:15.170 --> 02:27:17.180
<v Speaker 8>it's just like a tour of the full screen</v>
<v Speaker 8>with this.</v>

2795
02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:23.030
<v Speaker 8>Hello Mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is part of the game but this is not</v>

2796
02:27:23.031 --> 02:27:23.864
<v Speaker 8>the actual game.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is like a mode they did to teach </v>

2797
02:27:25.461 --> 02:27:29.270
<v Speaker 8>kids cause they had all of this </v>
<v Speaker 8>technology available.</v>

2798
02:27:29.271 --> 02:27:30.230
<v Speaker 8>So they said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know what,</v>

2799
02:27:30.231 --> 02:27:33.200
<v Speaker 8>just get a narrator,</v>
<v Speaker 8>add some audio clips,</v>

2800
02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:36.920
<v Speaker 8>making a mode.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wow world.</v>

2801
02:27:37.290 --> 02:27:40.550
<v Speaker 8>And they even have it the way it was </v>
<v Speaker 8>originally built.</v>

2802
02:27:40.551 --> 02:27:44.270
<v Speaker 8>The Great Pyramid with the limestone </v>
<v Speaker 8>still attached for the most part.</v>

2803
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:46.970
<v Speaker 8>This is a 20 minute videos.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is like,</v>

2804
02:27:46.971 --> 02:27:51.170
<v Speaker 8>this is real deep detailed man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's like the best Graham Hancock,</v>

2805
02:27:51.171 --> 02:27:53.120
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>explanation you could get,</v>

2806
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:58.340
<v Speaker 8>but you're the guy there and you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 8>third person position.</v>

2807
02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:00.190
<v Speaker 8>You probably could go first person too,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm sure.</v>

2808
02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:03.980
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is just this particular part.</v>

2809
02:28:04.250 --> 02:28:06.170
<v Speaker 8>They're going to keep doing this as </v>
<v Speaker 8>well.</v>

2810
02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:07.273
<v Speaker 8>This assassin's creed has gone through </v>
<v Speaker 8>all sorts of different modes of history </v>

2811
02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:12.470
<v Speaker 8>through the renaissance,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Rome,</v>

2812
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:14.960
<v Speaker 8>Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all sorts of different areas.</v>

2813
02:28:14.961 --> 02:28:18.380
<v Speaker 8>And now that they sort of turn this on,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's gonna ramp up probably.</v>

2814
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 8>Well that to me like a really</v>

2815
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:26.150
<v Speaker 2>good idea in terms of getting kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited about learning things,</v>

2816
02:28:26.460 --> 02:28:29.120
<v Speaker 2>having some sort of an interactive game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2817
02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Just game a game of every topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2818
02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Everything up really high quality way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2819
02:28:34.390 --> 02:28:38.080
<v Speaker 2>And I think the tricky thing with um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2820
02:28:38.090 --> 02:28:43.090
<v Speaker 2>education is the kind of tech that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>use is several steps behind the state of</v>

2821
02:28:44.031 --> 02:28:44.864
<v Speaker 2>the art in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Special effects or documentaries or </v>

2822
02:28:50.210 --> 02:28:51.680
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of game.</v>

2823
02:28:51.681 --> 02:28:55.520
<v Speaker 2>So the students are kind of disappointed</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they come to class.</v>

2824
02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:56.553
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2825
02:28:56.570 --> 02:29:01.570
<v Speaker 2>And it's like college is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive and it's really retro grade in</v>

2826
02:29:02.331 --> 02:29:05.540
<v Speaker 2>terms of the tech quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why,</v>

2827
02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:09.500
<v Speaker 2>why are we here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2828
02:29:10.370 --> 02:29:12.890
<v Speaker 2>we should be on the forefront,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2829
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:13.783
<v Speaker 2>It should be possible to go to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>State University and see awesome </v>

2830
02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:21.860
<v Speaker 2>gamified interactive stuff that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have access to at home.</v>

2831
02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:22.843
<v Speaker 2>But everything is changing so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in order for the curriculum to keep </v>

2832
02:29:26.391 --> 02:29:29.360
<v Speaker 2>up with modern technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have to revamp every year.</v>

2833
02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:31.101
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2834
02:29:31.101 --> 02:29:36.101
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the content we teach is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>old actually.</v>

2835
02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Like the key ideas and evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology.</v>

2836
02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Many of them go back 50 or a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2837
02:29:42.890 --> 02:29:43.723
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>key ideas in animal behavior or </v>

2838
02:29:45.350 --> 02:29:48.650
<v Speaker 2>paleontology or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2839
02:29:48.770 --> 02:29:49.603
<v Speaker 2>anthropology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like those get updated that </v>

2840
02:29:52.281 --> 02:29:55.640
<v Speaker 2>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the way you can present them.</v>

2841
02:29:55.641 --> 02:29:56.474
<v Speaker 2>Technically</v>

2842
02:29:58.390 --> 02:29:59.680
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not competitive.</v>

2843
02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:01.920
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2844
02:30:01.920 --> 02:30:02.753
<v Speaker 2>And that's embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a way to change that or is </v>

2845
02:30:06.511 --> 02:30:09.210
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems almost insurmountable without</v>

2846
02:30:09.211 --> 02:30:10.620
<v Speaker 2>a complete overhaul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The system,</v>

2847
02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:16.340
<v Speaker 2>I think you need a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of university and credential that's</v>

2848
02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:22.120
<v Speaker 2>backed by a significant amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital and that's technology,</v>

2849
02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:23.790
<v Speaker 2>technological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovative,</v>

2850
02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:28.620
<v Speaker 2>and it's very on pc in terms of what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaches and how it teaches.</v>

2851
02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:29.633
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's possible that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>come along and compete with the </v>

2852
02:30:32.161 --> 02:30:33.420
<v Speaker 2>standard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2853
02:30:33.480 --> 02:30:34.313
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's inevitable that that will </v>

2854
02:30:35.761 --> 02:30:39.030
<v Speaker 2>happen and then that's probably going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be what bankrupts and I think it's going</v>

2855
02:30:39.031 --> 02:30:39.930
<v Speaker 2>to eat our lunch.</v>

2856
02:30:42.190 --> 02:30:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

2857
02:30:43.380 --> 02:30:46.140
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about that though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a person who makes their living?</v>

2858
02:30:46.141 --> 02:30:46.421
<v Speaker 2>Do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2859
02:30:46.421 --> 02:30:50.460
<v Speaker 2>I'll see you write books and I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy to jump ship and go do that.</v>

2860
02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:52.290
<v Speaker 2>What did you oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>

2861
02:30:52.350 --> 02:30:53.183
<v Speaker 2>If I could like teach hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands or millions of people rather </v>

2862
02:30:56.521 --> 02:30:57.354
<v Speaker 2>than write 200 at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's essentially what Jordan </v>

2863
02:31:00.390 --> 02:31:01.223
<v Speaker 2>Peterson is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2864
02:31:01.350 --> 02:31:02.183
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's not doing it through a virtual </v>

2865
02:31:03.631 --> 02:31:06.000
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's doing it through video lectures and</v>

2866
02:31:06.001 --> 02:31:06.834
<v Speaker 2>then physical lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating to see the </v>

2867
02:31:10.171 --> 02:31:11.004
<v Speaker 2>reaction to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now to Sam Harris is doing this as </v>

2868
02:31:12.931 --> 02:31:14.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not the videos,</v>

2869
02:31:14.431 --> 02:31:18.960
<v Speaker 2>but he's definitely doing the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the live sort of performances.</v>

2870
02:31:19.860 --> 02:31:20.693
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2871
02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:22.530
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who would've ever thought there would be</v>

2872
02:31:22.531 --> 02:31:26.730
<v Speaker 3>a place where public intellectuals would</v>
<v Speaker 3>go and 5,000</v>

2873
02:31:26.731 --> 02:31:30.120
<v Speaker 3>people would sell out like that and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to see them?</v>

2874
02:31:30.121 --> 02:31:32.700
<v Speaker 3>Like they would go to see fucking Kevin </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hart or something.</v>

2875
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.020
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2876
02:31:34.830 --> 02:31:35.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2877
02:31:35.450 --> 02:31:35.900
<v Speaker 3>when</v>

2878
02:31:35.900 --> 02:31:36.733
<v Speaker 2>Kenzie first started doing a sec surveys</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would go around the country </v>

2879
02:31:39.711 --> 02:31:43.220
<v Speaker 2>giving lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he filled up a 4,000</v>

2880
02:31:43.430 --> 02:31:44.263
<v Speaker 2>person stadium and in UC Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just presenting the first real data on </v>

2881
02:31:48.591 --> 02:31:51.850
<v Speaker 2>human sexuality back in late forties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2882
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there was why,</v>

2883
02:31:54.291 --> 02:31:55.124
<v Speaker 2>because there's a real hunger for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was something the students </v>

2884
02:31:57.501 --> 02:31:58.334
<v Speaker 2>couldn't get anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the same was true back in the 18 </v>

2885
02:32:02.061 --> 02:32:04.730
<v Speaker 2>hundreds when you had famous authors </v>
<v Speaker 2>touring America,</v>

2886
02:32:05.390 --> 02:32:06.223
<v Speaker 2>like Mark Twain or um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people think is the founder of </v>

2887
02:32:09.441 --> 02:32:10.970
<v Speaker 2>standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2888
02:32:11.420 --> 02:32:12.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2889
02:32:12.981 --> 02:32:16.310
<v Speaker 2>And they would use humor like Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peterson,</v>

2890
02:32:16.311 --> 02:32:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2891
02:32:17.690 --> 02:32:18.523
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would speak in the register of </v>

2892
02:32:22.911 --> 02:32:26.570
<v Speaker 2>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not pretentious academic jargon.</v>

2893
02:32:27.330 --> 02:32:28.163
<v Speaker 3>Sam is surprisingly funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told that we had dinner recently and </v>

2894
02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:34.080
<v Speaker 3>we were talking and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2895
02:32:34.140 --> 02:32:35.730
<v Speaker 3>you're really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like those,</v>

2896
02:32:35.790 --> 02:32:36.623
<v Speaker 3>those little side notes and asides you </v>
<v Speaker 3>throw out little funny quips like this </v>

2897
02:32:41.251 --> 02:32:44.490
<v Speaker 3>is like standup comedy type stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When someone will say something like,</v>

2898
02:32:45.060 --> 02:32:45.893
<v Speaker 3>like even with you though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys were talking about polyamory </v>

2899
02:32:48.810 --> 02:32:50.830
<v Speaker 3>and there was he through some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>joke?</v>

2900
02:32:50.831 --> 02:32:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Like how's that working out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2901
02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:54.600
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very dry humor,</v>

2902
02:32:54.960 --> 02:32:56.070
<v Speaker 3>which I love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2903
02:32:56.960 --> 02:32:59.070
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so funny guy,</v>

2904
02:32:59.370 --> 02:33:00.203
<v Speaker 3>but that makes it more palatable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go </v>

2905
02:33:03.721 --> 02:33:04.470
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2906
02:33:04.470 --> 02:33:05.303
<v Speaker 3>this fascinating technology in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>video games is going to help you absorb </v>

2907
02:33:08.281 --> 02:33:13.080
<v Speaker 3>information about ancient Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And humor is going to help just make the</v>

2908
02:33:13.081 --> 02:33:17.280
<v Speaker 3>time go by better and make the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience less flat.</v>

2909
02:33:17.900 --> 02:33:20.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

2910
02:33:20.690 --> 02:33:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a future and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>within 10 years,</v>

2911
02:33:23.300 --> 02:33:24.133
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of young people are just going to </v>

2912
02:33:26.691 --> 02:33:31.691
<v Speaker 2>realize if I can actually learn more </v>
<v Speaker 2>from some alternative system,</v>

2913
02:33:33.441 --> 02:33:34.274
<v Speaker 2>some franchise of really good gamified </v>
<v Speaker 2>instruction plus great presenters who </v>

2914
02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:44.360
<v Speaker 2>have a sense of humor and are smart and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of like Hetero docs and,</v>

2915
02:33:45.001 --> 02:33:48.180
<v Speaker 2>and edgy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to flock to that.</v>

2916
02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:49.033
<v Speaker 2>The main thing is that business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that franchise would have to provide a </v>

2917
02:33:54.171 --> 02:33:55.004
<v Speaker 2>credential that actually separates them </v>
<v Speaker 2>from people who don't have it and that </v>

2918
02:33:59.961 --> 02:34:04.961
<v Speaker 2>predicts performance in companies or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the future.</v>

2919
02:34:05.330 --> 02:34:06.163
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's the main function of the </v>

2920
02:34:07.941 --> 02:34:12.830
<v Speaker 2>university right now is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this credential signaling system.</v>

2921
02:34:14.270 --> 02:34:15.103
<v Speaker 2>And if somebody figures out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it so that like if you've got a </v>

2922
02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:22.360
<v Speaker 2>degree from this,</v>

2923
02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:24.030
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2924
02:34:24.030 --> 02:34:24.863
<v Speaker 2>whatever Sam Harris University,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that is really a better predictor </v>

2925
02:34:28.281 --> 02:34:33.200
<v Speaker 2>of doing well in a job or a marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2926
02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:34.063
<v Speaker 2>Then a Yale degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then suddenly the whole business model </v>

2927
02:34:38.021 --> 02:34:39.460
<v Speaker 2>changes for universities.</v>

2928
02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:41.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's really fascinating when you think</v>

2929
02:34:41.161 --> 02:34:41.994
<v Speaker 3>about the history of education is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>our ideas about these gigantic </v>

2930
02:34:45.661 --> 02:34:47.580
<v Speaker 3>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Yale or Harvard,</v>

2931
02:34:47.581 --> 02:34:51.320
<v Speaker 3>is that they've been long established </v>
<v Speaker 3>and long proven and bolt.</v>

2932
02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:52.193
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a few hundred years in terms of </v>

2933
02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:57.060
<v Speaker 3>people being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That ain't shit.</v>

2934
02:34:57.330 --> 02:34:59.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go back before that you're,</v>

2935
02:34:59.810 --> 02:35:00.643
<v Speaker 3>this is really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you only have a certain amount of years </v>

2936
02:35:03.661 --> 02:35:05.460
<v Speaker 3>where these things were even a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2937
02:35:06.050 --> 02:35:06.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean the idea that you have a </v>

2938
02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:10.393
<v Speaker 2>teaching institution that's also a major</v>
<v Speaker 2>research institution really only goes </v>

2939
02:35:13.701 --> 02:35:17.150
<v Speaker 2>back to post World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like before World War II,</v>

2940
02:35:17.151 --> 02:35:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Harvard was basically an elite finishing</v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

2941
02:35:19.850 --> 02:35:24.850
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a research power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that whole system that we think of as</v>

2942
02:35:25.581 --> 02:35:29.660
<v Speaker 2>being ancient as actually just less than</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred several decades.</v>

2943
02:35:29.810 --> 02:35:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2944
02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:32.570
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2945
02:35:32.570 --> 02:35:33.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2946
02:35:33.710 --> 02:35:34.543
<v Speaker 3>I think you're probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the new things can eat the </v>

2947
02:35:37.971 --> 02:35:38.990
<v Speaker 3>lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2948
02:35:39.170 --> 02:35:40.003
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like they're setting </v>

2949
02:35:40.611 --> 02:35:41.444
<v Speaker 3>themselves up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean with some of the more ridiculous </v>

2950
02:35:43.641 --> 02:35:44.474
<v Speaker 3>and preposterous protests that go on </v>
<v Speaker 3>where there they are just trying to </v>

2951
02:35:49.101 --> 02:35:52.850
<v Speaker 3>silence discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even with people like Christina Hoff</v>

2952
02:35:52.851 --> 02:35:57.580
<v Speaker 3>summers who's very reasonable and calls </v>
<v Speaker 3>herself a factual feminist and they want</v>

2953
02:35:57.581 --> 02:36:00.500
<v Speaker 3>to call her a Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's no,</v>

2954
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:03.680
<v Speaker 3>there's no wiggle room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are a one or a zero,</v>

2955
02:36:03.681 --> 02:36:06.500
<v Speaker 3>you are black or white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are evil or good.</v>

2956
02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:07.753
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this inclination towards Silencing </v>

2957
02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:14.120
<v Speaker 3>People d platforming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming them down,</v>

2958
02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:15.433
<v Speaker 3>halting them and getting them out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>who decides who decides who's correct </v>

2959
02:36:19.161 --> 02:36:19.731
<v Speaker 3>and rock?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2960
02:36:19.731 --> 02:36:20.564
<v Speaker 3>the only way for people to get an </v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate assessment of who's giving the </v>

2961
02:36:23.721 --> 02:36:27.230
<v Speaker 3>right information is to have a debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to have a real debate,</v>

2962
02:36:27.410 --> 02:36:28.243
<v Speaker 3>like a real debate where people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to express themselves without </v>

2963
02:36:30.410 --> 02:36:31.243
<v Speaker 3>people in the audience shaking jars of </v>
<v Speaker 3>coins and bull horns and all the </v>

2964
02:36:35.151 --> 02:36:39.410
<v Speaker 3>nonsense and setting off fire alarms and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things that these children,</v>

2965
02:36:39.411 --> 02:36:42.890
<v Speaker 3>and I call them children because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>behaving like children are celebrating.</v>

2966
02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:43.993
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you're aware of what happened </v>

2967
02:36:44.841 --> 02:36:47.880
<v Speaker 3>at Evergreen and now evergreens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2968
02:36:47.930 --> 02:36:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Evergreen State University where Bret </v>
<v Speaker 3>Weinstein had,</v>

2969
02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:54.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his horrible experience with,</v>

2970
02:36:55.010 --> 02:36:57.260
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know the story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you the brief synopsis.</v>

2971
02:36:57.261 --> 02:36:58.094
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a day of absence where it used </v>

2972
02:36:59.421 --> 02:37:02.330
<v Speaker 3>to be that people of color would stay </v>
<v Speaker 3>home so that you would miss them.</v>

2973
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:05.510
<v Speaker 3>And then he decided to turn around and </v>
<v Speaker 3>make white people stay home,</v>

2974
02:37:05.511 --> 02:37:06.560
<v Speaker 3>make them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>force them.</v>

2975
02:37:06.680 --> 02:37:07.880
<v Speaker 3>If you didn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a racist.</v>

2976
02:37:07.881 --> 02:37:09.290
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

2977
02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:10.333
<v Speaker 3>Like you guys are being racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they shouted him down and they shut </v>

2978
02:37:12.651 --> 02:37:17.420
<v Speaker 3>the school down and he won a half a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars in a lawsuit.</v>

2979
02:37:17.770 --> 02:37:19.040
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and thou,</v>

2980
02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:23.330
<v Speaker 3>the schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most recent enrollment from the freshman</v>

2981
02:37:23.331 --> 02:37:26.150
<v Speaker 3>class was only 300 people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy.</v>

2982
02:37:26.340 --> 02:37:28.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm noticing the parents noticed,</v>

2983
02:37:28.851 --> 02:37:32.160
<v Speaker 2>the students notice and universities are</v>
<v Speaker 2>so complacent.</v>

2984
02:37:32.161 --> 02:37:32.671
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2985
02:37:32.671 --> 02:37:35.160
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can do any amount of this.</v>

2986
02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:36.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the customers will still come and </v>

2987
02:37:37.981 --> 02:37:39.180
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wrong.</v>

2988
02:37:39.181 --> 02:37:43.410
<v Speaker 2>As soon as there's a viable alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>where somebody can get a credential that</v>

2989
02:37:43.411 --> 02:37:47.370
<v Speaker 2>means something and it's cheaper and </v>
<v Speaker 2>better and they learn more and it's more</v>

2990
02:37:47.371 --> 02:37:52.371
<v Speaker 2>engaging that hole it universities </v>
<v Speaker 2>acting stupid about that and,</v>

2991
02:37:55.950 --> 02:37:56.783
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>denying free speech and denying real </v>

2992
02:38:00.301 --> 02:38:03.390
<v Speaker 2>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the existential threat to them.</v>

2993
02:38:03.450 --> 02:38:04.283
<v Speaker 2>That's what's going to blindside them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's going to kill their </v>

2994
02:38:07.051 --> 02:38:07.884
<v Speaker 2>tuition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stunning how little resistance </v>

2995
02:38:09.241 --> 02:38:10.620
<v Speaker 2>there is to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2996
02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:11.920
<v Speaker 2>That you,</v>

2997
02:38:12.050 --> 02:38:17.050
<v Speaker 3>the everyone knows that the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find out whose ideas are more,</v>

2998
02:38:19.700 --> 02:38:22.070
<v Speaker 3>more well thought out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more valid,</v>

2999
02:38:22.610 --> 02:38:25.610
<v Speaker 3>more factual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only way to find that out is to have</v>

3000
02:38:25.611 --> 02:38:27.210
<v Speaker 3>people discuss things together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3001
02:38:27.290 --> 02:38:30.230
<v Speaker 3>And T for you to be able to make an </v>
<v Speaker 3>assessment based on the facts,</v>

3002
02:38:30.590 --> 02:38:35.590
<v Speaker 3>do it in real time and based on who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>who farms a more compelling argument,</v>

3003
02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:38.420
<v Speaker 3>who's more reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>

3004
02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:39.553
<v Speaker 3>who's taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's addressing all the flaws and the </v>

3005
02:38:42.591 --> 02:38:45.980
<v Speaker 3>problems with both sides of this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming up with a reasonable conclusion.</v>

3006
02:38:45.981 --> 02:38:46.814
<v Speaker 3>The only way to do that as discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all know that and we've known that </v>

3007
02:38:49.701 --> 02:38:50.690
<v Speaker 3>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3008
02:38:50.930 --> 02:38:51.763
<v Speaker 3>but somehow or another in higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities in higher education </v>

3009
02:38:55.521 --> 02:38:56.354
<v Speaker 3>centers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where they're shutting this </v>

3010
02:38:58.731 --> 02:39:01.250
<v Speaker 3>stuff down and they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3011
02:39:01.251 --> 02:39:02.084
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Ben Shapiro is speaking or </v>

3012
02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:05.930
<v Speaker 3>whoever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's speaking,</v>

3013
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:09.290
<v Speaker 3>they want to scream at them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to yell,</v>

3014
02:39:09.350 --> 02:39:12.620
<v Speaker 3>they want to break windows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to co you know,</v>

3015
02:39:12.660 --> 02:39:14.780
<v Speaker 3>column racists or whatever they want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>call them.</v>

3016
02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:16.753
<v Speaker 3>Stunning.</v>

3017
02:39:16.930 --> 02:39:17.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way I think of it is like standup </v>

3018
02:39:20.170 --> 02:39:21.510
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love and,</v>

3019
02:39:21.620 --> 02:39:22.453
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do and the stuff you can say when </v>

3020
02:39:25.901 --> 02:39:30.901
<v Speaker 2>you're on stage doing standup comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>university should be at least that open.</v>

3021
02:39:32.530 --> 02:39:33.363
<v Speaker 2>Like I should be able to lecture in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that goes even a little bit edgier </v>

3022
02:39:37.180 --> 02:39:40.180
<v Speaker 2>than most standup comedy could go </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically,</v>

3023
02:39:40.181 --> 02:39:42.790
<v Speaker 2>intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologically challenged the thoughts,</v>

3024
02:39:43.210 --> 02:39:46.690
<v Speaker 2>challenged their thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So universities should be like the inner</v>

3025
02:39:46.691 --> 02:39:47.524
<v Speaker 2>sanctum of intellectual freedom compared</v>
<v Speaker 2>to which everything else is more </v>

3026
02:39:53.081 --> 02:39:56.890
<v Speaker 2>restrained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're kind of the opposite.</v>

3027
02:39:58.270 --> 02:40:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a few academics who go,</v>

3028
02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:07.000
<v Speaker 2>who actually are like amateur standup </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians and it's so liberating to them</v>

3029
02:40:08.380 --> 02:40:12.070
<v Speaker 2>to be able to get up on a stage and say </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they really think.</v>

3030
02:40:12.430 --> 02:40:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Dev Use fake names.</v>

3031
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:14.903
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3032
02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:19.753
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're kind of protected by like </v>

3033
02:40:23.961 --> 02:40:26.270
<v Speaker 2>the social norms of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3034
02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:26.961
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3035
02:40:26.961 --> 02:40:29.450
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to really take it </v>
<v Speaker 2>very seriously.</v>

3036
02:40:30.260 --> 02:40:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're,</v>

3037
02:40:32.691 --> 02:40:33.524
<v Speaker 2>we're so far from that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in physics it doesn't matter that much </v>

3038
02:40:41.090 --> 02:40:41.923
<v Speaker 2>because it's not like there's any </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspects of quantum mechanics that are </v>

3039
02:40:45.351 --> 02:40:46.184
<v Speaker 2>that intellectually edgy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but man and psychology and the social </v>

3040
02:40:50.151 --> 02:40:50.984
<v Speaker 2>sciences and behavioral sciences and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>political science it's really important </v>

3041
02:40:55.581 --> 02:41:00.581
<v Speaker 2>to be able to be provocative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>authentic and,</v>

3042
02:41:01.970 --> 02:41:04.790
<v Speaker 2>and we can't in America at the moment,</v>

3043
02:41:06.580 --> 02:41:07.413
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really what's going to set up </v>

3044
02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:10.593
<v Speaker 3>whatever's coming next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to offer some sort of a new </v>

3045
02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:16.750
<v Speaker 3>new pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new avenue that's not restricted.</v>

3046
02:41:17.110 --> 02:41:17.943
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Much like what you're seeing with a </v>

3047
02:41:20.110 --> 02:41:23.860
<v Speaker 3>podcasts and blogs and all in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in comparison to,</v>

3048
02:41:24.100 --> 02:41:24.933
<v Speaker 3>or youtube videos in comparison to what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting on regular network </v>

3049
02:41:26.951 --> 02:41:28.900
<v Speaker 3>television mean it was network </v>
<v Speaker 3>television.</v>

3050
02:41:29.170 --> 02:41:31.150
<v Speaker 3>And then cable was the more edgy </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternative,</v>

3051
02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:33.890
<v Speaker 3>and then there was pay cable like Hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3052
02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:34.733
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw breasts and then that got nuttier </v>

3053
02:41:36.941 --> 02:41:38.830
<v Speaker 3>and nuttier and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it became Netflix,</v>

3054
02:41:38.831 --> 02:41:39.664
<v Speaker 3>which is a total nother level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the internet is the wild west </v>

3055
02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:48.550
<v Speaker 3>and they want you to go back to NBC in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 1970s and you're like,</v>

3056
02:41:48.580 --> 02:41:49.900
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3057
02:41:50.430 --> 02:41:52.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3058
02:41:52.340 --> 02:41:56.110
<v Speaker 3>not going to pretend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but university seemed to be stuck.</v>

3059
02:41:56.990 --> 02:41:57.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think universities are like NBC Circa </v>

3060
02:42:00.681 --> 02:42:04.010
<v Speaker 2>1975 right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're like,</v>

3061
02:42:04.670 --> 02:42:06.520
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this cable stuff that's not really gonna</v>

3062
02:42:06.540 --> 02:42:07.370
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

3063
02:42:07.370 --> 02:42:08.610
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this internet and that,</v>

3064
02:42:08.990 --> 02:42:12.720
<v Speaker 2>but the Netflix of education is coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

3065
02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:17.800
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be incredibly disruptive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hope that the academic friends and</v>

3066
02:42:20.031 --> 02:42:25.031
<v Speaker 2>colleagues I have who are good and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>open minded art ready to jump ship</v>

3067
02:42:26.830 --> 02:42:27.663
<v Speaker 3>because ultimately they're educators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever form it is that what their </v>

3068
02:42:30.821 --> 02:42:32.560
<v Speaker 3>career is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there an educator,</v>

3069
02:42:32.650 --> 02:42:33.483
<v Speaker 3>just like Kyle Dunnigan is a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he takes on a new form with this new </v>

3070
02:42:36.791 --> 02:42:37.624
<v Speaker 3>technology and he becomes a comedian </v>
<v Speaker 3>using face swapping technology that </v>

3071
02:42:41.290 --> 02:42:43.930
<v Speaker 3>these educators are going to recognize </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

3072
02:42:44.050 --> 02:42:44.883
<v Speaker 3>the landscape has changed and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotta be some sort of a new way of </v>

3073
02:42:49.571 --> 02:42:50.680
<v Speaker 3>distributing information.</v>

3074
02:42:51.410 --> 02:42:53.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have good academics or like just</v>

3075
02:42:53.930 --> 02:42:54.763
<v Speaker 2>ordinary humans with their curiosity </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned up to 11 and who have a passion </v>

3076
02:42:58.521 --> 02:43:02.900
<v Speaker 2>for discovering new ideas and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>sharing them with people.</v>

3077
02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:03.793
<v Speaker 2>And we don't really care how we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will do it through lectures or </v>

3078
02:43:07.161 --> 02:43:10.520
<v Speaker 2>writing books or writing articles or </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>

3079
02:43:10.521 --> 02:43:11.354
<v Speaker 2>whatever works the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you thought about starting a </v>

3080
02:43:13.751 --> 02:43:15.370
<v Speaker 2>podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3081
02:43:15.371 --> 02:43:18.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a podcast with Tucker Max a couple</v>

3082
02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:18.993
<v Speaker 2>of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the maiden grounds where it was sort of </v>

3083
02:43:20.110 --> 02:43:23.710
<v Speaker 2>related to our mate book that was dating</v>
<v Speaker 2>advice for young single guys.</v>

3084
02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't realized.</v>

3085
02:43:26.290 --> 02:43:28.060
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3086
02:43:28.061 --> 02:43:28.894
<v Speaker 2>it was figure out what women </v>
<v Speaker 2>authentically actually one and then try </v>

3087
02:43:32.921 --> 02:43:35.950
<v Speaker 2>to transform yourself in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're a better boyfriend.</v>

3088
02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:42.360
<v Speaker 2>What do they want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A women want guys who are uh,</v>

3089
02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:44.743
<v Speaker 2>well informed and know about the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and ambitious and capable capability is </v>

3090
02:43:49.601 --> 02:43:50.434
<v Speaker 2>the main thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like competency just in as many domains </v>

3091
02:43:53.591 --> 02:43:55.410
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3092
02:43:55.450 --> 02:43:56.283
<v Speaker 2>they want guys who were in like </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably good physical shape and good </v>

3093
02:44:00.761 --> 02:44:05.620
<v Speaker 2>mental health and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can strike the right balance between</v>

3094
02:44:05.621 --> 02:44:08.140
<v Speaker 2>being kind of Nice and agreeable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind,</v>

3095
02:44:08.170 --> 02:44:11.470
<v Speaker 2>but also being dominant and assertive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

3096
02:44:12.370 --> 02:44:14.020
<v Speaker 2>kind of high status.</v>

3097
02:44:14.380 --> 02:44:17.050
<v Speaker 4>And if that's too much to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you become a male feminist,</v>

3098
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:21.910
<v Speaker 4>just grovel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just bend of the knee,</v>

3099
02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:24.700
<v Speaker 4>bend the knee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

3100
02:44:26.810 --> 02:44:29.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3101
02:44:29.450 --> 02:44:30.283
<v Speaker 2>when I teach human sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of emphasize this to students </v>

3102
02:44:32.631 --> 02:44:33.464
<v Speaker 2>that there's a lot you can do to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself more attractive to whoever you </v>

3103
02:44:36.411 --> 02:44:38.030
<v Speaker 2>want to attract it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

3104
02:44:38.060 --> 02:44:40.910
<v Speaker 2>it's not all limited by what traits </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're born with.</v>

3105
02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:41.953
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fascinating is the difference in </v>

3106
02:44:43.180 --> 02:44:46.720
<v Speaker 4>what a man is attracted to versus what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a woman's attracted to.</v>

3107
02:44:47.020 --> 02:44:48.940
<v Speaker 4>And this is something that we just don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to admit.</v>

3108
02:44:49.350 --> 02:44:50.183
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a great deal of difference when </v>

3109
02:44:53.741 --> 02:44:55.210
<v Speaker 4>it comes to heterosexuals at least.</v>

3110
02:44:55.350 --> 02:44:56.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of difference when </v>

3111
02:44:57.601 --> 02:44:58.434
<v Speaker 2>it comes to short term mating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what men want if it's a one night </v>

3112
02:45:01.651 --> 02:45:05.400
<v Speaker 2>stand versus what women want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at long term mating,</v>

3113
02:45:05.401 --> 02:45:06.234
<v Speaker 2>like who people choose for marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's actually quite a bit of </v>

3114
02:45:08.971 --> 02:45:09.804
<v Speaker 2>convergence there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody wants someone who's </v>

3115
02:45:12.810 --> 02:45:13.643
<v Speaker 2>mentally healthy and reliable and smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind and would make like would pick </v>

3116
02:45:20.521 --> 02:45:22.040
<v Speaker 2>the kids up on time from school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3117
02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:23.560
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And funny,</v>

3118
02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:26.350
<v Speaker 4>funny is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bret Weinstein,</v>

3119
02:45:26.460 --> 02:45:27.293
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about the difference between a </v>

3120
02:45:28.781 --> 02:45:31.870
<v Speaker 4>woman who is beautiful versus a woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's hot.</v>

3121
02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:33.513
<v Speaker 4>And what hot does is it gives you the </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to spread your genes with </v>

3122
02:45:37.691 --> 02:45:41.440
<v Speaker 4>very little responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a one night stand for,</v>

3123
02:45:41.441 --> 02:45:45.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm a girl who's hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to mate.</v>

3124
02:45:45.910 --> 02:45:50.020
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to like court her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get her to love you,</v>

3125
02:45:50.050 --> 02:45:53.200
<v Speaker 4>show your virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>earn her respect.</v>

3126
02:45:53.260 --> 02:45:56.260
<v Speaker 4>Now he just bang her in the park like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3127
02:45:56.350 --> 02:45:59.860
<v Speaker 4>That's hot versus someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful,</v>

3128
02:45:59.861 --> 02:46:00.694
<v Speaker 4>who you really go out of your way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe even be a better person so that </v>

3129
02:46:04.631 --> 02:46:05.920
<v Speaker 4>you could attract that person.</v>

3130
02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:07.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3131
02:46:07.690 --> 02:46:10.610
<v Speaker 2>If you fall in love with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be a better person for them.</v>

3132
02:46:11.170 --> 02:46:14.160
<v Speaker 4>But it's fascinating that there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>these two choices.</v>

3133
02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:16.410
<v Speaker 4>And I never really thought about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>until he brought it up.</v>

3134
02:46:16.411 --> 02:46:17.244
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're essentially ways to </v>

3135
02:46:19.710 --> 02:46:22.830
<v Speaker 4>distribute your DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's pathways.</v>

3136
02:46:23.010 --> 02:46:27.570
<v Speaker 4>One of them is through longterm bonding </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you want a stable,</v>

3137
02:46:27.571 --> 02:46:30.570
<v Speaker 4>reliable woman who has a lot of self </v>
<v Speaker 4>respect,</v>

3138
02:46:30.780 --> 02:46:32.310
<v Speaker 4>who chooses you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes you feel good,</v>

3139
02:46:32.311 --> 02:46:34.410
<v Speaker 4>she choose you and the other one's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>freak.</v>

3140
02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that all different kinds of</v>

3141
02:46:39.461 --> 02:46:40.294
<v Speaker 2>people exist with all different mating </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategies shows put each of those </v>

3142
02:46:43.811 --> 02:46:48.610
<v Speaker 2>strategies historically and </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionarily has worked like it's been</v>

3143
02:46:48.611 --> 02:46:50.140
<v Speaker 2>a valid strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3144
02:46:50.170 --> 02:46:51.003
<v Speaker 2>Cause there wouldn't be like promiscuous</v>
<v Speaker 2>men or women if that hadn't been </v>

3145
02:46:56.380 --> 02:46:57.940
<v Speaker 2>something that worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3146
02:46:58.030 --> 02:46:58.863
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There also wouldn't be longterm pair </v>

3147
02:47:00.341 --> 02:47:03.340
<v Speaker 2>bonded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3148
02:47:03.460 --> 02:47:04.293
<v Speaker 2>family people if that hadn't worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's silly when people are </v>

3149
02:47:07.781 --> 02:47:12.280
<v Speaker 2>sort of dissing each other's mating </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategies as if,</v>

3150
02:47:12.310 --> 02:47:13.143
<v Speaker 2>well there's one proper way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all the other ways it sort of </v>

3151
02:47:16.361 --> 02:47:18.150
<v Speaker 2>degenerate or reactionary or</v>

3152
02:47:18.210 --> 02:47:19.043
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the other mating strategies </v>

3153
02:47:19.860 --> 02:47:21.840
<v Speaker 4>produced fucked up kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3154
02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:24.930
<v Speaker 4>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hot one when you're not going to see</v>

3155
02:47:24.931 --> 02:47:27.600
<v Speaker 4>the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can develop a mess of a child.</v>

3156
02:47:27.960 --> 02:47:29.700
<v Speaker 4>And those are the ones they used to sell</v>
<v Speaker 4>cars,</v>

3157
02:47:30.580 --> 02:47:32.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3158
02:47:32.350 --> 02:47:36.010
<v Speaker 2>but each fucked up by what standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3159
02:47:36.430 --> 02:47:38.800
<v Speaker 4>well there's dots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the question father around,</v>

3160
02:47:38.830 --> 02:47:40.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have daddy issues.</v>

3161
02:47:42.430 --> 02:47:46.150
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of that is just a way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of shaming these,</v>

3162
02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:49.090
<v Speaker 2>these other mating strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you mean,</v>

3163
02:47:49.540 --> 02:47:54.540
<v Speaker 2>well of course you get a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>circular logic.</v>

3164
02:47:54.761 --> 02:47:59.761
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you say this mating strategy,</v>

3165
02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:03.520
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say a high degree of promiscuity,</v>

3166
02:48:03.570 --> 02:48:05.020
<v Speaker 2>you say that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3167
02:48:05.021 --> 02:48:05.854
<v Speaker 2>Because it leads to offspring who in </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn act promiscuous and then you call </v>

3168
02:48:09.851 --> 02:48:13.180
<v Speaker 2>it the cycle of abuse or daddy issues or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3169
02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:14.233
<v Speaker 4>But it's not a promiscuous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or is it just a longing for both a </v>

3170
02:48:18.471 --> 02:48:19.304
<v Speaker 4>father and a mother and a loneliness and</v>
<v Speaker 4>a vulnerability that seems to come with </v>

3171
02:48:23.661 --> 02:48:26.480
<v Speaker 4>being a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the offspring of a single mother.</v>

3172
02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:30.950
<v Speaker 4>Most people agree that that's not the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideal situation,</v>

3173
02:48:31.070 --> 02:48:34.700
<v Speaker 4>but it does produce unique people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really interesting.</v>

3174
02:48:34.730 --> 02:48:35.810
<v Speaker 4>Like all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most,</v>

3175
02:48:35.870 --> 02:48:39.950
<v Speaker 4>all of my really cool friends came from </v>
<v Speaker 4>a fucked up,</v>

3176
02:48:39.980 --> 02:48:40.813
<v Speaker 4>broken childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I don't know what to think about </v>

3177
02:48:43.311 --> 02:48:44.144
<v Speaker 4>that because I want my children to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>comforted and healthy and never worried </v>

3178
02:48:51.711 --> 02:48:52.544
<v Speaker 4>about the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all my friends that grew up in </v>

3179
02:48:54.111 --> 02:48:59.111
<v Speaker 4>chaotic environments where everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 4>poor and fucked up and there's crime and</v>

3180
02:48:59.211 --> 02:49:02.900
<v Speaker 4>violence and nonsense and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the interesting ones.</v>

3181
02:49:02.901 --> 02:49:05.260
<v Speaker 4>Their parents are drug addicts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the cool ones too.</v>

3182
02:49:05.270 --> 02:49:06.860
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a,</v>

3183
02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:08.633
<v Speaker 4>as a parent,</v>

3184
02:49:10.590 --> 02:49:11.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3185
02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:15.270
<v Speaker 2>so like as a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to look at the whole spectrum</v>

3186
02:49:15.271 --> 02:49:16.104
<v Speaker 2>of mating and parenting behavior and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly as an evolutionary </v>

3187
02:49:20.071 --> 02:49:21.540
<v Speaker 2>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>

3188
02:49:23.190 --> 02:49:25.710
<v Speaker 2>I might have a moralistic reaction to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3189
02:49:25.711 --> 02:49:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I might go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bad,</v>

3190
02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:29.940
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it actually,</v>

3191
02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:35.040
<v Speaker 2>if what we consider bad is actually the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way most of the other 4,000</v>

3192
02:49:35.041 --> 02:49:40.041
<v Speaker 2>species of mammals do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then who,</v>

3193
02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:42.270
<v Speaker 2>who were really the weird families </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

3194
02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:44.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most mammo families,</v>

3195
02:49:44.700 --> 02:49:45.533
<v Speaker 2>the dads aren't involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's single moms raising offspring by </v>

3196
02:49:49.231 --> 02:49:53.460
<v Speaker 2>themselves under harsh conditions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3197
02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:55.710
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing pair bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3198
02:49:55.711 --> 02:50:00.711
<v Speaker 2>Hardly any mammals do pair bonds apart </v>
<v Speaker 2>from like gibbons and few prosimians,</v>

3199
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:03.570
<v Speaker 2>like really small primates.</v>

3200
02:50:04.590 --> 02:50:05.420
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3201
02:50:05.420 --> 02:50:06.253
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just very hesitant to kind of </v>

3202
02:50:07.321 --> 02:50:08.154
<v Speaker 4>moralize it and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't really fair or even </v>

3203
02:50:10.711 --> 02:50:11.544
<v Speaker 4>accurate to compare ourselves to things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that only lived to be like 10 I mean </v>

3204
02:50:16.071 --> 02:50:16.904
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about enormously </v>

3205
02:50:18.681 --> 02:50:22.550
<v Speaker 4>complicated emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>far more so because of communication and</v>

3206
02:50:22.551 --> 02:50:24.950
<v Speaker 4>societal norms and eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3207
02:50:24.990 --> 02:50:27.590
<v Speaker 4>the comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3208
02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:30.230
<v Speaker 4>There's so much more involved being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

3209
02:50:31.530 --> 02:50:32.030
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3210
02:50:32.030 --> 02:50:32.863
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look back historically right </v>

3211
02:50:36.460 --> 02:50:38.990
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>premarital sex is to be demonized.</v>

3212
02:50:39.290 --> 02:50:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And folks used to say,</v>

3213
02:50:41.391 --> 02:50:42.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

3214
02:50:42.711 --> 02:50:43.544
<v Speaker 2>you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had one or two lovers before you </v>

3215
02:50:46.250 --> 02:50:47.870
<v Speaker 2>settled on with your husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's terrible.</v>

3216
02:50:48.260 --> 02:50:50.690
<v Speaker 2>And you could produce statistical </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlations to say,</v>

3217
02:50:50.720 --> 02:50:51.553
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>premarital sex is correlated with being </v>

3218
02:50:53.961 --> 02:50:56.780
<v Speaker 2>lower class or criminal or drug use or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3219
02:50:57.080 --> 02:50:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all true.</v>

3220
02:50:58.101 --> 02:51:03.101
<v Speaker 2>But then society moved in a direction </v>
<v Speaker 2>that said premarital sex is okay.</v>

3221
02:51:03.710 --> 02:51:05.650
<v Speaker 4>But wasn't that really because of birth </v>
<v Speaker 4>control?</v>

3222
02:51:06.250 --> 02:51:07.083
<v Speaker 4>Because a woman's once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once a woman had an ability to control </v>

3223
02:51:09.161 --> 02:51:12.130
<v Speaker 4>her reproductive system and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3224
02:51:12.131 --> 02:51:12.964
<v Speaker 4>I can hit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just have sex for pleasure and </v>

3225
02:51:14.441 --> 02:51:15.670
<v Speaker 4>enjoyment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3226
02:51:16.060 --> 02:51:19.120
<v Speaker 4>Because before it was the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 4>are so grave.</v>

3227
02:51:19.390 --> 02:51:20.930
<v Speaker 4>Especially in poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3228
02:51:21.160 --> 02:51:21.993
<v Speaker 4>Like now there's another mouth to feed </v>
<v Speaker 4>and now I can't work because I have to </v>

3229
02:51:24.461 --> 02:51:25.930
<v Speaker 4>take care of the babies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3230
02:51:26.070 --> 02:51:26.810
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3231
02:51:26.810 --> 02:51:27.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the technology of contraception made </v>

3232
02:51:29.541 --> 02:51:31.490
<v Speaker 2>a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3233
02:51:31.640 --> 02:51:33.290
<v Speaker 2>it used to be thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3234
02:51:33.291 --> 02:51:35.030
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're gay or lesbian,</v>

3235
02:51:35.031 --> 02:51:35.864
<v Speaker 2>that is morally degenerate and terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>and invalid and you can't possibly have </v>

3236
02:51:40.101 --> 02:51:43.340
<v Speaker 2>a longterm relationship or a family or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3237
02:51:43.341 --> 02:51:48.341
<v Speaker 2>And then we kind of changed that pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatically in the last 20,</v>

3238
02:51:49.310 --> 02:51:51.350
<v Speaker 2>30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just,</v>

3239
02:51:51.650 --> 02:51:54.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a sex researcher,</v>

3240
02:51:54.111 --> 02:51:56.110
<v Speaker 2>I want people to</v>

3241
02:51:57.950 --> 02:51:58.783
<v Speaker 2>be quite cautious about saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle is wrong and degenerate and </v>

3242
02:52:03.621 --> 02:52:08.621
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy and this other lifestyle is </v>
<v Speaker 2>better because in the era of sex bots,</v>

3243
02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:11.050
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In virtual reality,</v>

3244
02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:15.550
<v Speaker 2>deep fakes and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what's going to happen.</v>

3245
02:52:16.180 --> 02:52:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you read sex at dawn,</v>

3246
02:52:18.130 --> 02:52:19.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you like it?</v>

3247
02:52:20.250 --> 02:52:22.870
<v Speaker 2>I had very mixed feelings about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the negative?</v>

3248
02:52:23.620 --> 02:52:24.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's an accurate </v>

3249
02:52:25.301 --> 02:52:28.140
<v Speaker 2>description of pre history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prehistoric meeting.</v>

3250
02:52:29.290 --> 02:52:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think pair bonds,</v>

3251
02:52:31.871 --> 02:52:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really deep and human evolution,</v>

3252
02:52:35.410 --> 02:52:38.590
<v Speaker 2>but I think as a sort of ethical ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3253
02:52:38.980 --> 02:52:39.813
<v Speaker 2>polyamory is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is okay and it works for some people </v>

3254
02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:43.233
<v Speaker 2>some of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is something that you've </v>

3255
02:52:44.891 --> 02:52:47.380
<v Speaker 2>discussed a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Polyamory.</v>

3256
02:52:47.710 --> 02:52:48.543
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really only kind of came out publicly </v>

3257
02:52:51.880 --> 02:52:55.510
<v Speaker 2>as being interested in it on the Sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harris' show a few months ago,</v>

3258
02:52:56.140 --> 02:52:56.973
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about writing a book on it </v>

3259
02:52:59.380 --> 02:53:04.380
<v Speaker 2>next and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very popular thing.</v>

3260
02:53:05.200 --> 02:53:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean the number of people who are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>open relationships or poly relationships</v>

3261
02:53:08.891 --> 02:53:11.380
<v Speaker 2>is larger than the number of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are gay or lesbian.</v>

3262
02:53:11.530 --> 02:53:12.730
<v Speaker 2>Certain really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3263
02:53:12.731 --> 02:53:13.720
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3264
02:53:14.170 --> 02:53:16.570
<v Speaker 2>What's the number of people in gay or </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesbian relationships?</v>

3265
02:53:17.380 --> 02:53:18.213
<v Speaker 2>Number of people who are gay or lesbian </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the population level is like two to </v>

3266
02:53:22.121 --> 02:53:26.140
<v Speaker 2>5% depending on the surveys in </v>
<v Speaker 2>polyamorous relationships.</v>

3267
02:53:26.350 --> 02:53:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably five to 15% at the moment.</v>

3268
02:53:30.790 --> 02:53:34.450
<v Speaker 2>And it's even higher among people under </v>
<v Speaker 2>35 or so.</v>

3269
02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:38.140
<v Speaker 2>So this is a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's relatively new.</v>

3270
02:53:38.320 --> 02:53:39.153
<v Speaker 2>And is this just an acceptance of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>instincts that people have to be </v>

3271
02:53:43.390 --> 02:53:47.000
<v Speaker 2>nonmonogamous the acceptance of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3272
02:53:47.130 --> 02:53:47.963
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that jealousy is holding people back </v>

3273
02:53:49.330 --> 02:53:51.310
<v Speaker 2>from experiencing different things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3274
02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:54.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's only in the 90s that you,</v>

3275
02:53:54.280 --> 02:53:59.280
<v Speaker 2>you got a coherent subculture that said </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not going to be monogamous,</v>

3276
02:54:00.311 --> 02:54:04.030
<v Speaker 2>here's the honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical,</v>

3277
02:54:04.420 --> 02:54:05.620
<v Speaker 2>open way to do it.</v>

3278
02:54:05.950 --> 02:54:06.783
<v Speaker 2>And it kind of developed a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social norms about how you manage these </v>

3279
02:54:09.761 --> 02:54:14.761
<v Speaker 2>relationships in a way that's different </v>
<v Speaker 2>from cheating or different from swingers</v>

3280
02:54:15.731 --> 02:54:20.020
<v Speaker 2>or different from prostitute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hippie love communes or,</v>

3281
02:54:20.140 --> 02:54:20.973
<v Speaker 2>or prostitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean this is a longer discussion </v>

3282
02:54:24.311 --> 02:54:26.140
<v Speaker 2>than we have time for probably today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3283
02:54:26.830 --> 02:54:27.663
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a researcher it's a fascinating </v>

3284
02:54:29.201 --> 02:54:30.034
<v Speaker 2>culture because it's people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to find ways to kind of hack </v>

3285
02:54:32.831 --> 02:54:36.310
<v Speaker 2>their jealousy and manage it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3286
02:54:36.850 --> 02:54:37.683
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also a new method of social </v>

3287
02:54:39.581 --> 02:54:41.170
<v Speaker 2>networking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3288
02:54:41.171 --> 02:54:42.004
<v Speaker 2>Where you're not drawing a sharp line </v>
<v Speaker 2>between who you are sexually connected </v>

3289
02:54:46.991 --> 02:54:50.560
<v Speaker 2>to and who you're socially connected to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3290
02:54:50.650 --> 02:54:55.650
<v Speaker 2>so people who were in depaul a tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have sort of sexual friendship,</v>

3291
02:54:56.500 --> 02:54:59.560
<v Speaker 2>professional networks that are much </v>
<v Speaker 2>broader than done.</v>

3292
02:54:59.561 --> 02:55:03.220
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people tend to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

3293
02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:04.273
<v Speaker 2>I think that's actually a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>more similar to what Christopher Ryan </v>

3294
02:55:08.211 --> 02:55:10.590
<v Speaker 2>was talking about with sex at dawn </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

3295
02:55:12.470 --> 02:55:13.303
<v Speaker 2>Like I think in most prehistoric tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody who wasn't a close relative who </v>

3296
02:55:18.291 --> 02:55:19.124
<v Speaker 2>was sort of mating age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably would have had sex with </v>

3297
02:55:21.981 --> 02:55:26.981
<v Speaker 2>like sooner or later at least once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you both had a sort of stable,</v>

3298
02:55:27.810 --> 02:55:28.643
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paramont</v>

3299
02:55:30.970 --> 02:55:31.803
<v Speaker 3>and this is probably an incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversial subject at the academic </v>

3300
02:55:38.021 --> 02:55:38.854
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

3301
02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I taught my course on polyamory and</v>

3302
02:55:41.351 --> 02:55:45.310
<v Speaker 2>open sexuality last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it got a little bit of controversy.</v>

3303
02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:47.830
<v Speaker 2>You say that with smile in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>department.</v>

3304
02:55:48.820 --> 02:55:49.653
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there was concern about what </v>

3305
02:55:52.840 --> 02:55:54.250
<v Speaker 2>happens if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3306
02:55:55.990 --> 02:55:58.450
<v Speaker 2>you get complaints from</v>

3307
02:56:00.190 --> 02:56:01.990
<v Speaker 3>legislators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

3308
02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:03.480
<v Speaker 3>there it goes again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Funding,</v>

3309
02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:05.040
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

3310
02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:07.793
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

3311
02:56:08.380 --> 02:56:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of cool research on it.</v>

3312
02:56:11.590 --> 02:56:14.020
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological issues.</v>

3313
02:56:14.190 --> 02:56:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Plus if your students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a good way to find the freaks.</v>

3314
02:56:18.220 --> 02:56:20.410
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were wonderful,</v>

3315
02:56:20.530 --> 02:56:22.530
<v Speaker 2>wonderful freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean those wrong,</v>

3316
02:56:22.870 --> 02:56:23.703
<v Speaker 2>great in a freak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great students and open minded and you </v>

3317
02:56:27.551 --> 02:56:29.590
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about the pros and the cons.</v>

3318
02:56:29.591 --> 02:56:34.591
<v Speaker 2>It's like this stuff is really hard to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do for this and this and this reason and</v>

3319
02:56:36.730 --> 02:56:37.563
<v Speaker 2>people really only succeed at it if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have certain kinds of traits and </v>

3320
02:56:41.321 --> 02:56:45.490
<v Speaker 2>abilities and communication skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they don't,</v>

3321
02:56:45.610 --> 02:56:50.610
<v Speaker 2>they crash and burn and doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't just an advocacy class,</v>

3322
02:56:51.190 --> 02:56:54.820
<v Speaker 2>it was also like here's the pros and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cons,</v>

3323
02:56:54.821 --> 02:56:59.020
<v Speaker 2>but also as a social trend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a big deal.</v>

3324
02:56:59.740 --> 02:57:02.860
<v Speaker 2>And if you're going into one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>caring professions like medicine,</v>

3325
02:57:02.861 --> 02:57:04.090
<v Speaker 2>nursing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social work,</v>

3326
02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:05.013
<v Speaker 2>clinical psych,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you damn well better know about this </v>

3327
02:57:08.350 --> 02:57:09.183
<v Speaker 2>because a lot of people do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're giving advice to a couple </v>

3328
02:57:14.350 --> 02:57:15.183
<v Speaker 2>and they're in an open relationship and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even understand what that </v>

3329
02:57:17.891 --> 02:57:21.340
<v Speaker 2>means or how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to give bad advice.</v>

3330
02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:24.760
<v Speaker 2>And that's to me kind of professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>malpractice.</v>

3331
02:57:25.150 --> 02:57:28.780
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also sort of in some ways,</v>

3332
02:57:28.781 --> 02:57:33.781
<v Speaker 3>an ongoing experiment in terms of how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3333
02:57:34.631 --> 02:57:38.950
<v Speaker 3>how people bond with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how people form communities.</v>

3334
02:57:39.610 --> 02:57:40.443
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is in particular with in </v>

3335
02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:46.840
<v Speaker 3>today's climate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in today's society with the,</v>

3336
02:57:46.870 --> 02:57:47.703
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to distribute this </v>

3337
02:57:48.191 --> 02:57:50.950
<v Speaker 3>information and discuss these things in </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups and yeah,</v>

3338
02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:52.503
<v Speaker 3>it's a different world in terms of just </v>
<v Speaker 3>collecting data and it and comparing </v>

3339
02:57:56.981 --> 02:57:57.850
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>

3340
02:57:59.140 --> 02:58:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a work in progress.</v>

3341
02:58:01.170 --> 02:58:02.003
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think nobody who is polyamorous or in </v>

3342
02:58:06.301 --> 02:58:09.240
<v Speaker 2>an open relationship can pretend that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3343
02:58:09.241 --> 02:58:10.074
<v Speaker 2>we really know how to make this work </v>
<v Speaker 2>very well and here's the best practices </v>

3344
02:58:13.171 --> 02:58:14.190
<v Speaker 2>and here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

3345
02:58:14.580 --> 02:58:18.030
<v Speaker 2>the hacks and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and anybody can do it.</v>

3346
02:58:18.070 --> 02:58:19.590
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're absolutely not.</v>

3347
02:58:19.591 --> 02:58:23.310
<v Speaker 2>At that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also brave to talk about because it</v>

3348
02:58:23.311 --> 02:58:26.790
<v Speaker 2>immediately puts you into this potential</v>
<v Speaker 2>pervert place.</v>

3349
02:58:26.910 --> 02:58:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3350
02:58:27.470 --> 02:58:28.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk about sex with more than like </v>

3351
02:58:29.670 --> 02:58:30.780
<v Speaker 2>more than one person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3352
02:58:30.781 --> 02:58:31.650
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

3353
02:58:31.770 --> 02:58:32.700
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeffrey?</v>

3354
02:58:32.830 --> 02:58:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

3355
02:58:33.781 --> 02:58:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I know you're wrecking your reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

3356
02:58:36.840 --> 02:58:39.600
<v Speaker 2>You have to having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's super stigmatized.</v>

3357
02:58:39.810 --> 02:58:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like compared to what?</v>

3358
02:58:42.841 --> 02:58:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Compared to be an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist in the first place,</v>

3359
02:58:45.541 --> 02:58:46.374
<v Speaker 2>who does intelligence research or </v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to teaching human sexuality or </v>

3360
02:58:49.651 --> 02:58:50.484
<v Speaker 2>compared to doing just as a human and </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization doing a book with Tucker </v>

3361
02:58:53.520 --> 02:58:54.353
<v Speaker 2>Max.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3362
02:58:54.410 --> 02:58:55.320
<v Speaker 2>that's tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3363
02:58:56.670 --> 02:58:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we,</v>

3364
02:58:59.070 --> 02:59:02.130
<v Speaker 2>we have a professional responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3365
02:59:02.160 --> 02:59:02.993
<v Speaker 2>if you're a behavioral scientist to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what are people doing out </v>

3366
02:59:05.731 --> 02:59:07.390
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3367
02:59:07.740 --> 02:59:12.740
<v Speaker 2>what is working and what isn't and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you make it work better.</v>

3368
02:59:16.440 --> 02:59:17.273
<v Speaker 2>And the people who ignore it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's kind of like if you were </v>

3369
02:59:20.821 --> 02:59:22.920
<v Speaker 2>like a psychologist in the early </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>

3370
02:59:23.580 --> 02:59:25.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the gay and lesbian rights movement</v>

3371
02:59:25.770 --> 02:59:28.050
<v Speaker 2>of starting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you'd sort of said,</v>

3372
02:59:28.080 --> 02:59:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that'll blow over like that.</v>

3373
02:59:30.690 --> 02:59:32.800
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't deserve research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

3374
02:59:32.810 --> 02:59:33.643
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3375
02:59:34.050 --> 02:59:36.080
<v Speaker 2>we should keep it as a mental disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3376
02:59:36.081 --> 02:59:37.320
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Dsm,</v>

3377
02:59:37.350 --> 02:59:41.670
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like is sort of at the same place</v>

3378
02:59:41.671 --> 02:59:44.070
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3379
02:59:44.970 --> 02:59:45.803
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are reactionaries who go that </v>

3380
02:59:47.131 --> 02:59:47.964
<v Speaker 2>that's just gross and disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like people in the early seventies </v>

3381
02:59:51.691 --> 02:59:53.910
<v Speaker 2>would have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality is gross and disgusting.</v>

3382
02:59:56.520 --> 02:59:57.031
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still,</v>

3383
02:59:57.031 --> 02:59:59.970
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's brave to discuss right now.</v>

3384
03:00:00.030 --> 03:00:02.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may very well be like,</v>

3385
03:00:02.880 --> 03:00:03.713
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about the gay and </v>

3386
03:00:04.411 --> 03:00:08.430
<v Speaker 2>lesbian rights revolution of the 1970s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may be 40 years from now,</v>

3387
03:00:08.460 --> 03:00:10.320
<v Speaker 2>it's just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3388
03:00:10.350 --> 03:00:12.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're this and this.</v>

3389
03:00:12.181 --> 03:00:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Is that normal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3390
03:00:13.261 --> 03:00:16.260
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in today's Day and age,</v>

3391
03:00:16.261 --> 03:00:19.950
<v Speaker 2>it's a tread carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3392
03:00:20.610 --> 03:00:21.443
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody's got to research it and talk </v>

3393
03:00:24.931 --> 03:00:25.764
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3394
03:00:26.340 --> 03:00:27.173
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like people should read sex at </v>

3395
03:00:31.531 --> 03:00:32.640
<v Speaker 2>dawn Bicros,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christopher Orion.</v>

3396
03:00:32.641 --> 03:00:37.641
<v Speaker 2>But that shouldn't be the final word </v>
<v Speaker 2>about human evolution and polyamory.</v>

3397
03:00:38.910 --> 03:00:41.850
<v Speaker 2>What's another good book on it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3398
03:00:41.851 --> 03:00:46.380
<v Speaker 2>the ethical slut is a good kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like a restaurant.</v>

3399
03:00:48.930 --> 03:00:50.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of the Poly Bible.</v>

3400
03:00:50.680 --> 03:00:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Is it really the ethical slut?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

3401
03:00:52.940 --> 03:00:53.773
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

3402
03:00:53.850 --> 03:00:55.920
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>

3404
03:00:58.470 --> 03:00:59.560

<v Speaker 2>I</v>

3406

03:01:02.250 --> 03:01:05.260
<v Speaker 1>It's slot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been right now I know it was a poly</v>

3408
03:01:05.261 --> 03:01:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Bible for 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody buys that book just,</v>

3409
03:01:07.181 --> 03:01:09.010
<v Speaker 1>just to have it on your shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

3410
03:01:09.011 --> 03:01:13.150
<v Speaker 1>that book sells a billion copies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's done pretty well at there.</v>

3411
03:01:13.151 --> 03:01:14.320
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ethical slut.</v>

3413
03:01:17.830 --> 03:01:21.520

<v Speaker 1>I'm sad that I never came up with that.</v>

3414
03:01:23.450 --> 03:01:28.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a good title,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think there's a good book.</v>

3415
03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually savvy about evolutionary</v>

3416
03:01:32.321 --> 03:01:37.321
<v Speaker 1>psychology and human sexuality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>polyamory and how it's all going to play</v>

3417
03:01:38.201 --> 03:01:39.034
<v Speaker 1>out in the next 10 years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why you were kind of </v>

3418
03:01:41.530 --> 03:01:42.610
<v Speaker 1>planning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing it yourself.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
