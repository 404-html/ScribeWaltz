00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Five four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.500
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That countdown gives me anxiety.</v>

3
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I got to stop doing the countdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

4
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spilled my fucking Alpha brain.</v>

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is Alpha brain?</v>

6
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a brain juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cognitive enhancing</v>

7
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

8
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever fuck with nootropics?</v>

9
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>You know what nootropics are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

10
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you have an extra one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

11
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nootropics are essentially the building</v>

12
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>blocks for human neurotransmitters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They improve your memory not to</v>

13
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:33.680
<v Speaker 1>radically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like a,</v>

14
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>have you ever fucked with modafinil or</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of that stuff?</v>

15
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modafinil is like a pro vigil.</v>

17
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give it to a fighter pilot.</v>

18
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about it helps keep them</v>

19
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:45.100
<v Speaker 1>awake.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

21
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>You have a doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife,</v>

22
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>my wife is a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

23
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 1>your wife's a doctor.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So she knows about all that jazz.</v>

25
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was just an article recently</v>

26
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Improving cognitive performance.</v>

27
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>You're going to probably have to bite</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

42
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wrote a book with a guy about drug</v>

<v Speaker 1>a mask.</v>

44
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to come on wearing a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Barack Obama mask.</v>

45
00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

46
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.913
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

47
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.130
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really funny.</v>

48
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.890
<v Speaker 2>The whole story is really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing this book.</v>

49
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I spelled it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.800
<v Speaker 2>it's called the business secrets of drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

54
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.790
<v Speaker 2>and I'm serializing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

55
00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 2>but basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.130
<v Speaker 2>somebody I knew for ages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

57
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 2>in a completely different capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

58
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 2>sort of came out to me last year and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

59
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:08.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

60
00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I've been a high level of drug dealer</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

61
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 2>for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically my whole life.</v>

62
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.570
<v Speaker 2>And wanted to tell a story about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

63
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the,</v>

64
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.750
<v Speaker 2>the whole progression of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of drugs,</v>

65
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only things that grow out of the ground.</v>

66
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

67
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.630
<v Speaker 2>he started off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

68
00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:26.230
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

69
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.510
<v Speaker 2>this is an African American guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

70
00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:31.030
<v Speaker 2>he started off bleed or not selling</v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>

71
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

72
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 2>he sort of grew up half in the projects</v>
<v Speaker 2>and half and in an upscale suburb.</v>

73
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he in the upscale suburb,</v>

74
00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 2>he sold mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he,</v>

75
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

76
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 2>basically got through mail order at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>time early in the sort of history of the</v>

77
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Internet when there were some loopholes</v>
<v Speaker 2>about things you get spores,</v>

78
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:55.091
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

79
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Well actually you could get the actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>railing.</v>

80
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

81
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he ends up having this whole career.</v>

82
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

83
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 2>and he wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sort of explain to me what the rules</v>

84
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 2>of the game where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

85
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 2>and do sort of a book version of the 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crack Commandments.</v>

86
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we sat down and,</v>

87
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't quite figure out how to do</v>

88
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 2>it at first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we ended up essentially doing a sort</v>

89
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 2>of fictionalized version of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

90
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 2>of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

91
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 2>and the progression is amazing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

92
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.850
<v Speaker 2>he goes from being a dealer in all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>different parts of the country in</v>

93
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 2>different social spheres.</v>

94
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 2>He's in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he deals to rich,</v>

95
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:49.020
<v Speaker 2>white kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He deals on the street and,</v>

96
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.460
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

97
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough urban neighborhoods and then ends</v>

98
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 2>up sort of in the legal business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

99
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 2>in this state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

100
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 2>and lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

101
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

102
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.691
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

103

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

105
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

106
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 2>and so he's describing that world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not,</v>

107
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of misconceptions about</v>

108
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:11.711
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

109
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some things about it that are,</v>

110
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not known terribly well.</v>

111
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a,</v>

114
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 2>at a farm and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

115

<v Speaker 2>with a contaminant.</v>

117
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

118
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everybody just throws it away,</v>

119
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that stuff ends up shipped</v>

120
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 2>across country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes to other markets.</v>

121
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he sort of describes a lot of this,</v>

122
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 2>like what kind of contaminants would</v>
<v Speaker 2>that be?</v>

123
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Like fungal or past to like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

124
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 2>like a fungus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

125
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

126
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.011
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

127
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 2>there are labs that basically have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear,</v>

128
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.741
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

129
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 2>from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

130
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 2>that have to clear each of the crops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

131
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:57.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are situations where,</v>

132
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole bunch of crop and you've</v>

133
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 2>got workers that have to be paid and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do with it?</v>

134
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 2>And the legal market isn't big enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

135
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 2>to accommodate all this stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>grown.</v>

136
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 2>And so there's sort of still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

137
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:14.790
<v Speaker 2>kind of a black market that goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

138
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he describes this.</v>

139
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:17.170
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

140
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 2>but even before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a fascinating book about,</v>

141
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different things that he learned</v>

142
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.040
<v Speaker 2>in the course of his career about how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it,</v>

143
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

144
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 2>do the job and not get caught.</v>

145
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Had A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a rig,</v>

146
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 2>a load at to drive cross country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you do a dummy car?</v>

147
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 2>he tells a story about how basically you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want four cars,</v>

149
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 2>you want the guy in the front seat to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

150
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.750
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look like a drug dealer,</v>

151
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.890
<v Speaker 2>have a terrible record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive badly,</v>

152
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically to attract the police.</v>

153
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

154
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the third car is the load car,</v>

155
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 2>the second car sort of watching to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's,</v>

156
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 2>there's cops in either direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the fourth car is basically</v>

157
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:04.000
<v Speaker 2>driving up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

158
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 2>behind the load card to sort of prevent</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody from seeing the license plate</v>

159
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:11.360
<v Speaker 2>and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he just talks about all this</v>

160
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 2>stuff and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

161
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

162
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a new kind of writing for me</v>

163
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Speaker 2>because I'd never really done anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>except straight journalism and we sort</v>

164
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 2>of had to do it in narrative form.</v>

165
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 2>And so we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're putting it out serially online</v>

166
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really cool.</v>

167
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.980
<v Speaker 2>So you did one of those change the names</v>
<v Speaker 2>to protect the innocent.</v>

168
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

169
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

170
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.630
<v Speaker 2>or the guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

171
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.483
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

172
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.670
<v Speaker 2>But for the most part based on facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

173
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The situations where let's just say</v>

174
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 2>realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

175
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

176
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:43.310
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his,</v>

177
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the observations were that,</v>

178
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he describes are all,</v>

179
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that he actually learned.</v>

180
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:51.920
<v Speaker 2>The situations were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

181
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 2>relatively close to things that actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

182
00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

183
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:58.100
<v Speaker 2>So that's available now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

184
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.851
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Aye.</v>

188
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

189
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.420
<v Speaker 2>I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of a serialized,</v>

190
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>detective stories.</v>

191
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.960

192
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.520

<v Speaker 2>new our magazine and the twenties and</v>

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

196
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up reading all those stories and</v>

197
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:28.090
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

198
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:33.170
<v Speaker 2>it was in the back of my mind always</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I wanted to try this a and write a</v>

199
00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:34.940
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

200
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.020
<v Speaker 2>on a deadline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm doing this now.</v>

201
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's basically co written with this,</v>

202
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anonymous character who can appear with</v>

203
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:47.370
<v Speaker 2>me on shows like this anywhere because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he asks he's,</v>

204
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 2>he's still not captured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

205
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was their,</v>

206
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 2>their warrants out for this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

207
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 2>he's never been picked up and arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never been arrested?</v>

208
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

209
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a smart dude.</v>

210
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.210
<v Speaker 2>He is a smart dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a smart dude and some of his</v>

211
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 2>employers would be very surprised to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that he's got a hobby like this.</v>

212
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

213
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:09.960
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

214
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew him again.</v>

215
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:13.790
<v Speaker 2>I knew him for years and didn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>faintest clue,</v>

216
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:14.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

217
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.820
<v Speaker 2>that this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was going on.</v>

218
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.090
<v Speaker 2>So keep a job in order to avoid</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspicion.</v>

219
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.150
<v Speaker 2>So the book is actually structured with</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these rules.</v>

220
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:26.740
<v Speaker 2>It's chapter has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has rules.</v>

221
00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:30.680
<v Speaker 2>And at one of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his most important rules is always have</v>

222
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 2>a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

223
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.660
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's for a number of reasons.</v>

224
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

225
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 2>he talks about how when he was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he worked at places like,</v>

226
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Merriot or applebee's and he's like,</v>

227
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can serve,</v>

228
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the patients to serve people at an</v>

229
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 2>apple bees and not blow up and scream</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

230
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 2>then you won't screw up a package like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

231
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can have the self discipline to</v>

232
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.790
<v Speaker 2>actually get through one of these jobs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not blow up and be crazy,</v>

233
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:08.520
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to handle or hinder</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself well at a car stop.</v>

234
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he used it almost like as a</v>

235
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 2>discipline exercise.</v>

236
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.080
<v Speaker 2>He used it as a discipline exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He learned among other things like,</v>

237
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one for his rules,</v>

238
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:21.120
<v Speaker 2>his dress like an off duty is apple</v>
<v Speaker 2>piece waiter,</v>

239
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

240
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.080
<v Speaker 2>do not dress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

241
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.870
<v Speaker 2>and he talks about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how most dealers,</v>

242
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they learn their,</v>

243
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.470
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

244
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.020
<v Speaker 2>profession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

245
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.150
<v Speaker 2>by watching movies.</v>

246
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.830
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no book out there.</v>

247
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like this generation is growing</v>

248
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:44.430
<v Speaker 2>up reading like new the old iceberg slam</v>

<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

252
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.020
<v Speaker 2>but dealers very often dress like</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealers.</v>

253
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:56.610
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of spot them,</v>

254
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he says,</v>

255
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly the opposite of what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to do.</v>

256
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

257
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:05.700

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

265
00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 2>stuff is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is sort of central to his,</v>

266
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.650
<v Speaker 2>his whole a worldview about how to avoid</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting caught.</v>

267
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be a great book.</v>

268
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.490
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

269
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:32.851
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

270
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:35.180
<v Speaker 2>it's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

271
00:10:35.181 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that,</v>

272
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

273
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coauthor is actually a person who's</v>

274
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.430
<v Speaker 2>pulling this off makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes it really interesting and it makes</v>

275
00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:46.560
<v Speaker 2>it a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real challenge to write it too,</v>

276
00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

277
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to kind of,</v>

278
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simulate his voice,</v>

279
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of communicate to people what,</v>

280
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.800
<v Speaker 2>what those situations were like and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>things look like from his point of view.</v>

281
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:04.830
<v Speaker 2>And obviously I'm white and he's African</v>
<v Speaker 2>American and that's,</v>

282
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 2>that's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

283
00:11:05.851 --> 00:11:06.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

284
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.970
<v Speaker 2>I think it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a cool story,</v>

285
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.520
<v Speaker 2>but it must've been a juicy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you found the subject and just</v>

286
00:11:11.521 --> 00:11:12.510
<v Speaker 2>felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh boy,</v>

287
00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:13.620
<v Speaker 2>we got something here.</v>

288
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super Juicy.</v>

289
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

290
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:16.711
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

291
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:19.020
<v Speaker 2>it's so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had this much fun,</v>

292
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.120
<v Speaker 2>like fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun writing anything for,</v>

293
00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:23.790
<v Speaker 2>for a long time because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

294
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:24.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

295
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.310
<v Speaker 2>most criminal memoirs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

296
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 2>I grew up a junkie in terms of reading</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff I love.</v>

297
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:35.450
<v Speaker 2>I love books that are written after the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact by people who were in crime.</v>

298
00:11:36.001 --> 00:11:38.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like pappy on was one of my favorite</v>

299
00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:39.210
<v Speaker 2>books growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

300
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:41.610
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing story about not,</v>

301
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 2>not just crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but about prison and what's that like,</v>

302
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.430
<v Speaker 2>but they're always written by people</v>
<v Speaker 2>after they got caught.</v>

303
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's never that book by the</v>

304
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:53.470
<v Speaker 2>person who's still out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

305
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:56.290
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and talking about what al all life was</v>

306
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:58.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

307
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 2>successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

308
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.890
<v Speaker 2>still on the other side of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

309
00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 2>that part of it is fascinating.</v>

310
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a completely new thing.</v>

311
00:12:07.551 --> 00:12:09.940
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he has all these insights that I,</v>

312
00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:11.760
<v Speaker 2>that I would never have thought about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>

313
00:12:11.761 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 2>he talks about how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

314
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.340
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing he calls the hood price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

315
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.470
<v Speaker 2>when you're dealing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

316
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.590
<v Speaker 2>selling to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

317
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in black neighborhoods even he charges a</v>

318
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:27.220
<v Speaker 2>higher price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

319
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.210
<v Speaker 2>because there's more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are more problems that you</v>

320
00:12:31.211 --> 00:12:35.400
<v Speaker 2>inevitably run into when you're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 2>in those neighborhoods because there's</v>

321
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.150
<v Speaker 2>more cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means more lawyers,</v>

322
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 2>which means more security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means more attention to detail</v>

323
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.530
<v Speaker 2>when you deal to the rich white kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as nobody is paying attention.</v>

324
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:46.600
<v Speaker 2>So you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's less overhead,</v>

325
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the business.</v>

326
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

327
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 2>which is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

328
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:52.750
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

329
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:55.010
<v Speaker 2>he talks to all about this and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

330
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.750
<v Speaker 2>he has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he spent a lifetime kind of just keeping</v>

331
00:12:58.751 --> 00:13:01.720
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff in his head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always wanting to,</v>

332
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.110
<v Speaker 2>to put it down and he just got to be too</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

333
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 2>And he just sort of tapped me on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder one day and said,</v>

334
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.950
<v Speaker 2>can we have lunch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to talk to you about</v>

335
00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:09.784
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

336
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Do you know him before this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say three years.</v>

337
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

338
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.220
<v Speaker 1>We had a trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You well,</v>

339
00:13:20.221 --> 00:13:24.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad we decided to not have him on</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he would get busted.</v>

340
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

341
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.680
<v Speaker 1>They had talked to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you were on something and you</v>

343
00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:31.890
<v Speaker 1>had a mask on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

344

<v Speaker 1>that's mad tie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

345
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.570
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'd be somebody listening to him.</v>

346
00:13:36.571 --> 00:13:38.750
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he doesn't understand that there's</v>

347
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.150
<v Speaker 1>millions of people listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree with you.</v>

348
00:13:42.151 --> 00:13:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Words of those people would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's whatever,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and it's funny,</v>

361
00:14:11.421 --> 00:14:16.421
<v Speaker 2>I covered trump obviously one on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the campaign trail and I watched,</v>

362
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of the progression of his</v>

363
00:14:20.961 --> 00:14:22.710
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

364
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.300
<v Speaker 2>or non thought as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

365
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.730
<v Speaker 2>as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

366
00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.650
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on things like immigration.</v>

367
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:33.070
<v Speaker 2>And it seemed to me that he could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and very quickly that people just want</v>

368
00:14:34.251 --> 00:14:36.560
<v Speaker 2>to be mean to inward immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

369
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:41.570
<v Speaker 2>it's not so much about the policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was very nonspecific about that</v>

370
00:14:41.571 --> 00:14:44.510
<v Speaker 2>whenever he could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just wanted to say things that,</v>

371
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.410
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>

372
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Speaker 2>feel vindictive and cruel and nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so doing something to is just,</v>

373
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 2>it's just monstrous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

374
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:55.460
<v Speaker 2>But SEF sessions is a real creep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

375
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:57.320
<v Speaker 2>he's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a scary guy.</v>

376
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that he said is good</v>

377
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:03.620
<v Speaker 2>people don't smoke marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just saying that alone.</v>

378
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how many grandmas out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>with cancer are smoking marijuana?</v>

379
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.301
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

380
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:09.330
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

381
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Crazy asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the fact that someone could be in</v>

382
00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:14.600
<v Speaker 2>such a position of influence and say</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

383
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.790
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this isn't just your dad saying</v>

384
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:19.700
<v Speaker 2>that good people don't smoke marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes out in the yard and fucking</v>

385
00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:21.440
<v Speaker 2>smokes a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

386
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:23.060
<v Speaker 2>this is the attorney general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

387
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:24.080
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fine.</v>

388
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

389
00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:28.340
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you take ignorance and then the</v>

390
00:15:28.341 --> 00:15:31.820
<v Speaker 2>full weight of the executive branch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

391
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

392
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.450
<v Speaker 2>especially the d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anti-drug apparatus,</v>

393
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:36.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

394
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.380
<v Speaker 2>that's a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible combination with it.</v>

395
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 2>And it's too bad because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think even the law enforcement</v>

396
00:15:42.951 --> 00:15:44.930
<v Speaker 2>community was kind of coming around on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

397
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.020
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

398
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

399
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.000
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to be picking up people</v>
<v Speaker 2>for dealing weed.</v>

400
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to from my last book about the</v>

401
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Eric Garner case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to lots of cops and they,</v>

402
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.650
<v Speaker 2>they just hate having to do that.</v>

403
00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.191
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

404
00:15:58.191 --> 00:15:59.900
<v Speaker 2>those buses are not fun for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

405
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:02.390
<v Speaker 2>the Eric Gardner case was the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 2>got choked in New York,</v>

406
00:16:02.391 --> 00:16:02.781
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

407
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:03.920
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cigarettes,</v>

408
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:06.600
<v Speaker 2>which has even even more than doubles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

409
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

410
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.790
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cops having to do that,</v>

411
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:12.620
<v Speaker 2>that's not even a misdemeanor in New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>

412
00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:13.454
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you gotta,</v>

413
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.580
<v Speaker 2>if you got to drag somebody in for</v>
<v Speaker 2>selling a 50 cents cigarette,</v>

414
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not exactly serpico.</v>

415
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:19.610
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like again,</v>

416
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.340
<v Speaker 2>a cops don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't join the force dreaming of</v>

417
00:16:22.341 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

418
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.620
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

419
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean the sessions thing is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

420
00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Having that guy in that kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>position and saying things like,</v>

421
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.430
<v Speaker 2>good people don't smoke marijuana or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

422
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.270
<v Speaker 2>when families come across the border</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegally,</v>

423
00:16:35.271 --> 00:16:36.980
<v Speaker 2>we're going to separate the parents from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the children.</v>

424
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck is wrong with you.</v>

425
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.310
<v Speaker 2>And then you throw in a good dose of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Jesus.</v>

426
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

427
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Scary fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least trump has said that he's going</v>

428
00:16:48.311 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to support sessions on</v>

429
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.970
<v Speaker 2>going after marijuana in states where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's legal is going to leave the states</v>

430
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.710
<v Speaker 2>to take care of it themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's encouraging the,</v>

431
00:16:59.711 --> 00:17:00.110
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

432
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.040
<v Speaker 2>the problem with Donald Trump and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that I didn't clue</v>

433
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:07.640
<v Speaker 2>into until I'd spent a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching the guy and following them</v>

434
00:17:07.641 --> 00:17:10.700
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that he can sound like he believes</v>

435
00:17:10.701 --> 00:17:15.701
<v Speaker 2>something very deeply and you can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely convinced that he even,</v>

436
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>logically thanks,</v>

437
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:22.280
<v Speaker 2>thanks a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he'll have a meeting with somebody</v>

438
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.830
<v Speaker 2>and five minutes later I'll have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely the opposite opinion.</v>

439
00:17:25.831 --> 00:17:30.831
<v Speaker 2>So I have no confidence that Donald</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump will anything that he says that</v>

440
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.290
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it will stay his opinion on</v>

441
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:35.780
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can be convinced to go through a</v>

442
00:17:35.781 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 2>complete one 80 on basically any issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is scary,</v>

443
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 2>isn't he in some ways the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>representative of America because of</v>

444
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:44.450
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

445
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.010
<v Speaker 2>He has no attention span.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

446
00:17:46.011 --> 00:17:48.170
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I talked about this when,</v>

447
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 2>when I was covering him because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

448
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.441
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

449
00:17:50.441 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 3>what is this billionaire in New York or</v>
<v Speaker 3>have in common with,</v>

450
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.690
<v Speaker 3>with an ordinary Americans?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a lot in common with them.</v>

451
00:17:57.691 --> 00:18:00.180
<v Speaker 3>He has exactly the same media habits</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have.</v>

452
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:02.220
<v Speaker 3>He reads the same dumb shit on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>

453
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.940
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has the same total inability to</v>

454
00:18:05.941 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 3>separate fact from fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

455
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.880
<v Speaker 3>he's completely credulous when he reads</v>
<v Speaker 3>a news item about something that he</v>

456
00:18:14.431 --> 00:18:16.540
<v Speaker 3>personally agrees with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

457
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.440
<v Speaker 3>and he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll tweet it out five seconds later</v>

458
00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:22.650
<v Speaker 3>before he checks it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like what every other American</v>

459
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:23.071
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

460
00:18:23.071 --> 00:18:25.410
<v Speaker 3>they get something on facebook and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately share it with,</v>

461
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all their friends.</v>

462
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a,</v>

463
00:18:28.381 --> 00:18:32.050
<v Speaker 3>this is an American thing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just the total inability to,</v>

464
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.770
<v Speaker 3>to logically look at things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

465
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the short attention span too,</v>

466
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.880
<v Speaker 1>short attention span,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drifting in and out of conversations,</v>

467
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.720
<v Speaker 1>not being able to pay attention to memos</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless his name is in there.</v>

468
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred times.</v>

469
00:18:45.921 --> 00:18:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

470
00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.231
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

471
00:18:48.231 --> 00:18:49.160
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like American.</v>

472
00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:49.871
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

473
00:18:49.871 --> 00:18:51.010
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

474
00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.170
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because if you,</v>

475
00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.100
<v Speaker 3>if you watch trump speeches are actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>better or better yet,</v>

476
00:18:57.101 --> 00:18:58.760
<v Speaker 3>if you read trump's speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

477
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.200
<v Speaker 3>they would pass out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

478
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.880
<v Speaker 3>the text of what trump was supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

479
00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before his events.</v>

480
00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.550
<v Speaker 3>And so I'd be sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be looking at the,</v>

481
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.760
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the remarks,</v>

482
00:19:09.761 --> 00:19:12.340
<v Speaker 3>and they would be cogent from one end to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other.</v>

483
00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.220
<v Speaker 3>Then he would get up there and the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>line we'd be like,</v>

484
00:19:15.221 --> 00:19:16.810
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so great to be back in Manchester,</v>

485
00:19:16.811 --> 00:19:18.130
<v Speaker 3>New Hampshire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always loved,</v>

486
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being here.</v>

487
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.230
<v Speaker 3>And that would be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he would veer off and he would,</v>

488
00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:28.530
<v Speaker 3>he would start saying one thing and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing and his thoughts would</v>

489
00:19:28.631 --> 00:19:30.250
<v Speaker 3>drift and all these different</v>
<v Speaker 3>directions.</v>

490
00:19:30.251 --> 00:19:34.840
<v Speaker 3>And then when you looked at the actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>transcript of what Donald Trump had</v>

491
00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:38.800
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he not only wasn't completing thoughts,</v>

492
00:19:38.801 --> 00:19:42.520
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't completing sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talks in these sort of strange</v>

493
00:19:42.521 --> 00:19:44.230
<v Speaker 3>fragments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

494
00:19:44.231 --> 00:19:47.800
<v Speaker 3>and he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll drift from one idea to another and</v>

495
00:19:47.801 --> 00:19:50.200
<v Speaker 3>they won't have any logical connection</v>
<v Speaker 3>to each other.</v>

496
00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.480
<v Speaker 3>And people still responded to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which tells you something both about him</v>

497
00:19:55.481 --> 00:19:57.070
<v Speaker 3>and about his audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

498
00:19:57.071 --> 00:20:02.071
<v Speaker 3>Because they're on the same weird mental</v>
<v Speaker 3>wave length where we're just sort of</v>

499
00:20:02.651 --> 00:20:07.651
<v Speaker 3>disconnected bits of of emotion and</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought is enough now.</v>

500
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that weird?</v>

501
00:20:09.551 --> 00:20:11.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is where it's really strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strange.</v>

502
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't know that someone's not</v>

503
00:20:14.041 --> 00:20:16.930
<v Speaker 1>smart if they're dumber than the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

504
00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:17.670
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

505
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I think what it's revealing is what a</v>
<v Speaker 1>small amount of time most people spend</v>

506
00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:26.640
<v Speaker 1>actually thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about ideas,</v>

507
00:20:26.641 --> 00:20:29.820
<v Speaker 1>thinking about themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about behavior,</v>

508
00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:33.660
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the impact that someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's in the position of president can</v>

509
00:20:33.661 --> 00:20:36.300
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few people are out there actually</v>

510
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:37.190
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

511
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean relatively a pretty large number</v>
<v Speaker 1>overall,</v>

512
00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:43.230
<v Speaker 1>but very few in terms of percentages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the people that you can</v>

513
00:20:43.231 --> 00:20:45.750
<v Speaker 1>reach and the people that will show up</v>
<v Speaker 1>at his press rallies.</v>

514
00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:47.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a big thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

515
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck</v>

516
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.700
<v Speaker 3>is going to go to a campaign speech for</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody unless you're a journalist.</v>

517
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting because I've,</v>

518
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 3>I've been to a million campaign rallies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

519
00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.060
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my opinion on them is,</v>

520
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would rather basically stick a</v>

521
00:21:04.241 --> 00:21:08.670
<v Speaker 3>railroad spike in my ear then then</v>
<v Speaker 3>voluntarily go to one of these things.</v>

522
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not,</v>

523
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not be paid to do it because normally a</v>

524
00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:18.061
<v Speaker 3>campaign speeches like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>supernaturally boring experience where a</v>

525
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:23.251
<v Speaker 3>guy or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman stands up there and reads out a</v>

526
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.310
<v Speaker 3>preselected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a market tested list of political</v>

527
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:29.700
<v Speaker 3>cliches that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

528
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.010
<v Speaker 3>have no meaning whatsoever and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

529
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.500
<v Speaker 3>don't represent what they're actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do in,</v>

530
00:21:34.501 --> 00:21:36.190
<v Speaker 3>in when there are an office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

531
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:37.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

532
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.380
<v Speaker 3>and if you have to listen to that 40 or</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 times in a row,</v>

533
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.080
<v Speaker 3>which is what happens when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>covering campaigns,</v>

534
00:21:44.081 --> 00:21:45.250
<v Speaker 3>like you want to kill yourself.</v>

535
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:49.120
<v Speaker 3>So why anyone would go voluntarily to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

536
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 3>to see that as entertainment is sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond me.</v>

537
00:21:51.671 --> 00:21:56.671
<v Speaker 3>But that happened in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 2015 and 2016 trumps events were a</v>

538
00:21:58.001 --> 00:21:59.380
<v Speaker 3>little different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

539
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were a little bit,</v>

540
00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.710
<v Speaker 3>and I think he got a little bit of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>from his wwe experience.</v>

541
00:22:05.711 --> 00:22:08.170
<v Speaker 3>Like he turned them into these kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>menacing,</v>

542
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.080
<v Speaker 3>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

543
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.660
<v Speaker 3>audience participation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

544
00:22:13.661 --> 00:22:18.661
<v Speaker 3>things where he would have the audience</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn on the press and shout at us and</v>

545
00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:20.860
<v Speaker 3>throw things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

546
00:22:20.861 --> 00:22:21.694
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

547
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.100
<v Speaker 3>because we're always standing up on</v>
<v Speaker 3>those risers,</v>

548
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we have ropes around us.</v>

549
00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:30.160
<v Speaker 3>We look like zoo animals or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

550
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we were the representatives and they</v>

551
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.420
<v Speaker 3>hated the lead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

552
00:22:34.421 --> 00:22:36.060
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he'll it,</v>

553
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.380
<v Speaker 3>and he turned it into this sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical,</v>

554
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.750
<v Speaker 3>menacing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intimate thing.</v>

555
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.093
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

556
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.390
<v Speaker 3>people would come from all over.</v>

557
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.040
<v Speaker 3>They'd come from down the hills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

558
00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:46.920
<v Speaker 3>and drive 50 miles to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

559
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.400
<v Speaker 3>to see the spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

560
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.280
<v Speaker 3>it was fascinating to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but kind of terrifying too.</v>

561
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:52.221
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the peep.</v>

562
00:22:52.221 --> 00:22:53.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that are going to those</v>

563
00:22:53.921 --> 00:22:54.530
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

564
00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.310
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has an odd group of humans that</v>

565
00:22:57.311 --> 00:22:59.590
<v Speaker 3>have decided this is how you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>spend your day.</v>

566
00:22:59.591 --> 00:23:03.400
<v Speaker 3>You're going to go watch this guy rabble</v>
<v Speaker 3>about fake news,</v>

567
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.320

<v Speaker 3>You're fake news and point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The CNN guy,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That was a line that he,</v>

578
00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.260
<v Speaker 3>that he used to pull out a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at these bloodsuckers,</v>

579
00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.450
<v Speaker 3>these people reporting information.</v>

580
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:32.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We speak again,</v>

581
00:23:32.741 --> 00:23:35.610
<v Speaker 3>we'd be sitting there and a whole bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of reporters and we're,</v>

582
00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.930
<v Speaker 3>we're a bunch of geeks and aero shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

583
00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.800
<v Speaker 3>we got the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got pads and we're kind of looked</v>

584
00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.310
<v Speaker 3>very surrounded by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

585
00:23:42.311 --> 00:23:45.710
<v Speaker 3>in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15,000 people who,</v>

586
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are kind of turning in our direction.</v>

587
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.020
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

588
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.190
<v Speaker 3>in a couple of cases at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

589
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.650
<v Speaker 3>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was definitely up in the air whether</v>

590
00:23:54.651 --> 00:23:58.160
<v Speaker 3>this was going to turn ugly or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in a few places that did turn ugly</v>

591
00:23:58.161 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

592
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.361
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

593
00:24:00.361 --> 00:24:04.100
<v Speaker 3>he was very clued in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one thing I will say about trump is</v>

594
00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:07.640
<v Speaker 3>that he has a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a keen instinct for audience.</v>

595
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.760
<v Speaker 3>He knows where they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows what their mood is.</v>

596
00:24:10.761 --> 00:24:12.760
<v Speaker 3>He knows what he has to do to get them,</v>

597
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:13.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

598
00:24:13.771 --> 00:24:15.900
<v Speaker 1>to wake them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

599
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:17.250
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stir them up.</v>

600
00:24:17.251 --> 00:24:20.400
<v Speaker 1>He can tell when he's losing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

601
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.211
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

602
00:24:21.211 --> 00:24:23.460
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is one talent that he does have.</v>

603
00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

604
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a negative talent for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

605
00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.700
<v Speaker 1>he uses it certainly in a negative way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

606
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.070
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

607
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:36.150
<v Speaker 1>w how much attention have you paid it</v>
<v Speaker 1>all to his use of diet pills had been</v>

608
00:24:36.151 --> 00:24:37.320
<v Speaker 1>following that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

609
00:24:37.321 --> 00:24:39.120
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is he using?</v>

610
00:24:39.121 --> 00:24:42.090
<v Speaker 1>A lot of diet pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad I could talk to matt tight.</v>

611
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.600
<v Speaker 1>This is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the reporter was at Washington</v>

612
00:24:45.601 --> 00:24:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Post that first talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found the Duane Reed pharmacy where</v>

613
00:24:50.281 --> 00:24:55.281
<v Speaker 1>he was first prescribed diet pills by</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doctor who described it for a</v>

614
00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:01.650
<v Speaker 1>nonexistent condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like metabolic deficiency or some shit</v>

615
00:25:01.651 --> 00:25:04.050
<v Speaker 1>like metabolic disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he called it,</v>

616
00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:06.690
<v Speaker 1>and it allowed him to prescribe in.</v>

617
00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.600
<v Speaker 1>This guy was like a known prescriber of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>

618
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.440
<v Speaker 1>like a doctor feel a good time and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>

619
00:25:13.441 --> 00:25:14.670
<v Speaker 1>He's got you covered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

620
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Metabolic disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Matt,</v>

621
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:22.290
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna feel peppy all day and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be on these for a very short</v>

622
00:25:22.291 --> 00:25:24.390
<v Speaker 1>amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on them for a long period of</v>

623
00:25:24.391 --> 00:25:26.400
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm this guy,</v>

624
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.890
<v Speaker 1>this reporter to printed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted out the actual Duane Reed</v>

625
00:25:31.891 --> 00:25:34.980
<v Speaker 1>pharmacy where trump was filling this</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescription.</v>

626
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:39.240
<v Speaker 1>And then now they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying that he's on some other</v>

627
00:25:39.241 --> 00:25:42.750
<v Speaker 1>diet pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the ingredients that was</v>

628
00:25:42.751 --> 00:25:45.240
<v Speaker 1>in phen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phen do you remember Phen Phen Oh,</v>

629
00:25:45.241 --> 00:25:47.910
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately I know.</v>

630
00:25:47.911 --> 00:25:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

631
00:25:48.871 --> 00:25:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Phen phen was something for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't know that the young folks</v>

632
00:25:52.141 --> 00:25:55.200
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a pill that people were taking</v>

633
00:25:55.230 --> 00:26:00.230
<v Speaker 1>in the 1990s and I knew a gal who was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very pretty girl,</v>

634
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:05.630
<v Speaker 1>but she was large and she got on the fen</v>
<v Speaker 1>phen and I hadn't seen her in like,</v>

635
00:26:05.821 --> 00:26:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like six months or something.</v>

636
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.050
<v Speaker 1>And I saw her and all of a sudden she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like 120 pounds.</v>

637
00:26:10.051 --> 00:26:11.340
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

638
00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.440
<v Speaker 1>You look amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing?</v>

639
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Like you exercise and it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you go crazy and join a gym?</v>

640
00:26:16.711 --> 00:26:17.580
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

641
00:26:17.581 --> 00:26:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I started taking this stuff called phen</v>
<v Speaker 1>phen and she'd be like,</v>

642
00:26:20.041 --> 00:26:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Blah Blah Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't stop talking and grinding his</v>

643
00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:26.220
<v Speaker 1>teeth a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non speed and she started having weird</v>

644
00:26:26.221 --> 00:26:29.220
<v Speaker 1>feelings with her heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she stopped it and it turns out</v>

645
00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.070
<v Speaker 1>people are just dropping dead left and</v>
<v Speaker 1>right off of this stuff.</v>

646
00:26:32.071 --> 00:26:34.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you a fucking heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks and all kinds of shit is</v>

647
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:38.280
<v Speaker 1>hardcore stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they recognize that the combination</v>

648
00:26:38.281 --> 00:26:41.460
<v Speaker 1>of these two things was the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of these things by themselves</v>

649
00:26:41.461 --> 00:26:42.294
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

650
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 1>so this one by itself is what they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on now,</v>

651
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:50.970
<v Speaker 1>which makes sense that a guy who's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his seventies has so much energy.</v>

652
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean they say he's up at five o'clock</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning watching Fox News and</v>

653
00:26:55.171 --> 00:26:57.660
<v Speaker 1>then he starts tweeting like a five 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>

654
00:26:57.661 --> 00:27:00.180
<v Speaker 1>He's tweeting and gets very little</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

655
00:27:00.181 --> 00:27:03.060
<v Speaker 1>You drinks like 12 diet cokes a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guy's just,</v>

656
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.720
<v Speaker 1>he's got boundless energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when he was campaigning,</v>

657
00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:08.940
<v Speaker 1>that was the thing that was so stunning</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

658
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what it's like to go on the road</v>

659
00:27:11.011 --> 00:27:14.070
<v Speaker 1>and just do stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to stand up where you have your</v>

660
00:27:14.071 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fuck around.</v>

661
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:17.040
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a good time is fucking,</v>

662
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.320
<v Speaker 1>whereas you add after a couple of days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

663
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.380
<v Speaker 1>One town and the next town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time that third day rolls around,</v>

664
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:26.100
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking beat down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy was doing day after day after</v>

665
00:27:26.101 --> 00:27:27.760
<v Speaker 1>day after day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

666
00:27:27.761 --> 00:27:29.730
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all great to see all you wonderful</v>

667
00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:30.420
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

668
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.960
<v Speaker 1>We're going to make America great again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wall got 10 feet higher and</v>

669
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.100
<v Speaker 1>everything is with energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

670
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.610
<v Speaker 1>and this is the speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the speculation.</v>

671
00:27:38.611 --> 00:27:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Is he like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

672
00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're aware many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many journalists are on adderall,</v>

673
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's on something.</v>

674
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:45.901
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

675
00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:46.681
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

676
00:27:46.681 --> 00:27:50.280
<v Speaker 1>This is in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way I look at it,</v>

677
00:27:50.281 --> 00:27:53.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like this is indicative of where</v>
<v Speaker 1>America stands today.</v>

678
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:56.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that he's a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of mayor because he has</v>

679
00:27:56.251 --> 00:27:58.740
<v Speaker 1>the same media consumption habits and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>

680
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inability to read books and all these</v>

681
00:28:00.421 --> 00:28:03.810
<v Speaker 1>different variables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because he's pilled up,</v>

682
00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is everybody in America,</v>

683
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.930
<v Speaker 1>everybody in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

684
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.903
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

685
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.240
<v Speaker 3>like there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

686
00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.380
<v Speaker 3>there's a little bit of a precedent</v>
<v Speaker 3>there because,</v>

687
00:28:12.381 --> 00:28:13.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

688
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy had so many physical problems</v>

689
00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:17.350
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

690
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a book that dark side of</v>

691
00:28:20.421 --> 00:28:22.670
<v Speaker 3>camelot that came and came out by Sy</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hersh,</v>

692
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

693
00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it talked about how Kennedy in the</v>

694
00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:30.020
<v Speaker 3>morning used to have an s a secret</v>
<v Speaker 3>service agent give him,</v>

695
00:28:30.021 --> 00:28:33.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shot of basically amphetamines every,</v>

696
00:28:33.201 --> 00:28:35.840
<v Speaker 3>every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he would sort of pace around the</v>

697
00:28:35.841 --> 00:28:38.390
<v Speaker 3>oval office talking about who we wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to whack today.</v>

698
00:28:38.391 --> 00:28:39.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

699
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.220
<v Speaker 3>this was like the background for Bay of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pigs and you know,</v>

700
00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:45.070
<v Speaker 3>all these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

701
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.650
<v Speaker 3>so it's very dangerous when a president</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

702
00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:48.580
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

703
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:51.950
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutically altered when a person</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

704
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:53.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

705
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:54.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's,</v>

706
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:59.020
<v Speaker 3>if he's on speed and he's tweeting</v>
<v Speaker 3>threats to a nuclear power,</v>

707
00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:02.370
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that would be a very ironic and</v>

708
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but terrible way for all of it.</v>

709
00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.110
<v Speaker 3>All of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of us to end</v>

710
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:10.110
<v Speaker 1>find the tweet I've been looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was hard to find the first time.</v>

711
00:29:10.111 --> 00:29:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I know who wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't you gotta you gotta save</v>

712
00:29:12.661 --> 00:29:15.240
<v Speaker 1>that and put it in your favorites cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about it so many times.</v>

713
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:20.620
<v Speaker 1>You got to figure out a way to save that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put it in a bookmark because it was</v>

714
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:25.940
<v Speaker 1>in like he had the Duane Reed pharmacy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the speculation about</v>

715
00:29:27.271 --> 00:29:29.670
<v Speaker 1>what the most recent stuff is that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

716
00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:32.460
<v Speaker 1>which is again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one ingredient in fen phen.</v>

717
00:29:32.461 --> 00:29:36.420
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying is that when you look at the side</v>

718
00:29:36.421 --> 00:29:41.421
<v Speaker 1>effects of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the side effects is a delusional</v>

719
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.930
<v Speaker 1>of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delusions of grandeur,</v>

720
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.330
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>

721
00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:49.210
<v Speaker 1>impulsiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all these things that we associate</v>

722
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:51.010
<v Speaker 1>with Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>

723
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.140
<v Speaker 1>we don't even know who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know.</v>

724
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.480
<v Speaker 1>We know who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pilled up if this guy's right,</v>

725
00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:00.850
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might be dealing with essentially a</v>

726
00:30:00.851 --> 00:30:05.851
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical intervention into not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just American lives in terms of</v>

727
00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:10.300
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of the way policy is driven</v>

728
00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:14.800
<v Speaker 1>and the way the country moves forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might literally be pharmaceutically</v>

729
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.800
<v Speaker 1>enhanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very Philip k Dick,</v>

730
00:30:17.801 --> 00:30:20.140
<v Speaker 1>but it could easily be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could easily be true.</v>

731
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:23.120
<v Speaker 1>It all seems true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like,</v>

732
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.930
<v Speaker 1>like I'm not saying anything that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>outland as first of all not,</v>

733
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.820
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>real pills.</v>

734
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.680
<v Speaker 1>These pills are real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about something that's</v>

735
00:30:29.681 --> 00:30:31.990
<v Speaker 1>widely consumed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows this and we're talking</v>

736
00:30:31.991 --> 00:30:34.450
<v Speaker 1>about a guy who was an extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary amount of energy for</v>

737
00:30:34.451 --> 00:30:38.350
<v Speaker 1>somebody who doesn't work dirt work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather doesn't eat healthy.</v>

738
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like what?</v>

739
00:30:39.621 --> 00:30:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Where's he getting on his energy?</v>

740
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.171
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

741
00:30:41.171 --> 00:30:43.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember talking about this with some</v>

742
00:30:43.751 --> 00:30:47.120
<v Speaker 3>of the other reporters because</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>

743
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.360
<v Speaker 3>the campaign trail is incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>grueling.</v>

744
00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.350
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why some candidates</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't do it.</v>

745
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

746
00:30:55.211 --> 00:31:00.211
<v Speaker 3>or they opt to do lots of legacy media</v>
<v Speaker 3>appearances or ad buys.</v>

747
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.700
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they travel less than a pure more.</v>

748
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.390
<v Speaker 3>The people who tend to succeed are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ones who can do three or four</v>

749
00:31:07.391 --> 00:31:10.330
<v Speaker 3>appearances a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fly to three different cities a day.</v>

750
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.640
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>

751
00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.130
<v Speaker 3>most of those people are either health</v>
<v Speaker 3>freaks,</v>

752
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.210
<v Speaker 3>people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

753
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.210
<v Speaker 3>in good physical condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama was,</v>

754
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.490
<v Speaker 3>was definitely one of those people who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

755
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:24.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to have a run at some point or else</v>

756
00:31:24.371 --> 00:31:27.610
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't do that schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Donald Trump,</v>

757
00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:29.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at him and it's kind of</v>

758
00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:30.400
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

759
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:31.570
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fun fact,</v>

760
00:31:31.571 --> 00:31:34.510
<v Speaker 1>in 19 to trump started taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>amphetamine derivatives,</v>

761
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.390
<v Speaker 1>abused them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only supposed to take two for 25 days,</v>

762
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:39.460
<v Speaker 1>stayed on for eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

763
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.840
<v Speaker 1>And this is Kurt [inaudible] White House</v>
<v Speaker 1>submit,</v>

764
00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:45.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admitted it to me,</v>

765
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said only a short time for diet in</v>

766
00:31:48.581 --> 00:31:52.120
<v Speaker 1>quotes when he was not overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I countered with medical records.</v>

767
00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:55.960
<v Speaker 1>They cut me off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People misreading drug was dye,</v>

768
00:31:55.961 --> 00:32:00.961
<v Speaker 1>ethyl [inaudible] 75 milligrams a day</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescription filled at Duane reed on</v>

769
00:32:01.361 --> 00:32:03.010
<v Speaker 1>57th street in Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

770
00:32:03.011 --> 00:32:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know things,</v>

771
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.250
<v Speaker 1>doctor who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

772
00:32:06.251 --> 00:32:11.251
<v Speaker 1>wrote prescription Dr. Joseph Greenberg</v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed him with metabolic imbalance,</v>

773
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.170
<v Speaker 1>which we have never heard about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>

774
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Greenberg was later publicly slammed as</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who provided uppers to rich</v>

775
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:21.610
<v Speaker 1>people in Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a metabolic imbalance in quotes.</v>

776
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if true could be electrolyte</v>

777
00:32:24.341 --> 00:32:28.480
<v Speaker 1>insufficiencies anaerobic and bounces</v>
<v Speaker 1>acid and bounces and an assortment of</v>

778
00:32:28.481 --> 00:32:31.450
<v Speaker 1>related disorders that can have serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>health consequences.</v>

779
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Yet his other doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Harold Bornstein said he had been</v>

780
00:32:35.981 --> 00:32:40.981
<v Speaker 1>trump's doctors since 1980 and it never</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned the metabolic imbalance found</v>

781
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:43.100
<v Speaker 1>by Greenburg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

782
00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.250
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

786
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:01.370
<v Speaker 1>phen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phen so I googled that.</v>

787
00:33:01.371 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 1>That came up and like a gawker article,</v>

<v Speaker 1>which just makes sense.</v>

793
00:33:17.961 --> 00:33:20.570
<v Speaker 1>If that guy's telling the truth of Kurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>icon wall is telling the truth,</v>

<v Speaker 1>amphetamines for eight years,</v>

795
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:30.250

<v Speaker 3>was the name of the very cheap speed</v>

828
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:47.060
<v Speaker 3>that used to be imported when I lived in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

829
00:34:47.061 --> 00:34:47.930
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

830
00:34:47.931 --> 00:34:50.600
<v Speaker 3>there was a type of speed that used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>come from the Baltics,</v>

831
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that allegedly,</v>

832
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:54.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

833
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.600
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the urban legend was,</v>

834
00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:01.630
<v Speaker 3>was that the Nazis had all their</v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers on a cheap speed for the long</v>

835
00:35:02.991 --> 00:35:05.390
<v Speaker 3>marches going into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into Russia.</v>

836
00:35:05.391 --> 00:35:07.070
<v Speaker 3>And they set up these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

837
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:09.590
<v Speaker 3>these pharmaceutical plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

838
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.390
<v Speaker 3>and theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

839
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.610
<v Speaker 3>the street legend was that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was what this drug was,</v>

840
00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:15.290
<v Speaker 3>but they called it fen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

841
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:15.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't</v>

842
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.960
<v Speaker 1>that the original,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the origins of methamphetamines wasn't</v>

843
00:35:21.271 --> 00:35:25.110
<v Speaker 1>methamphetamines created by the Nazis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was.</v>

844
00:35:25.111 --> 00:35:29.820
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculations as to why they could get</v>

845
00:35:29.821 --> 00:35:33.900
<v Speaker 1>suicide bombers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kamikazes to slam their jets into</v>

846
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.370
<v Speaker 1>aircraft carriers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loaded them up on math up.</v>

847
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we have those go pills.</v>

848
00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're called.</v>

849
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

850
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.910
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

851
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.350
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely some speed that gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribed and steroids right.</v>

852
00:35:48.351 --> 00:35:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Also to soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

853
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.990
<v Speaker 1>and maybe talk to people that have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

854
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:52.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

855
00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:56.460
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you about what different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they allow them to take and</v>

856
00:35:56.461 --> 00:35:58.590
<v Speaker 1>gave them to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

857
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.260
<v Speaker 1>that modafinil stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

858
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.750
<v Speaker 1>that's really common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I know,</v>

859
00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of fighter pilot or pilots</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll take that keeps you from getting</v>

860
00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:09.330
<v Speaker 1>sleepy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps you alert and awake.</v>

861
00:36:09.331 --> 00:36:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And that was also something Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton was supposed to be on.</v>

862
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

863
00:36:12.901 --> 00:36:15.360
<v Speaker 1>She was supposed to be on Modafinil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the things that she</v>

864
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:16.660
<v Speaker 1>admitted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

865
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's legal and it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird,</v>

866
00:36:18.961 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 1>if you've tried that now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird one.</v>

867
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.270
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't speed you up in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart rate.</v>

868
00:36:24.271 --> 00:36:26.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like drinking five cups of coffee,</v>

869
00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.520
<v Speaker 1>but it does give you this weird sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>alertness like,</v>

870
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.920
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking really awake.</v>

871
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.990
<v Speaker 1>That sounds kind of good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of good.</v>

872
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy of mine who's a writer</v>

875

893
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's going to put a line on the,</v>

894
00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.130
<v Speaker 1>on that spatula after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

895
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.140
<v Speaker 1>after she's done and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

896
00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:35.640
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

897
00:37:35.641 --> 00:37:36.480
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

898
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.560
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a time where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't understand how bad that stuff was</v>

899
00:37:40.561 --> 00:37:42.420
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was probably a lot of people on</v>

900
00:37:42.421 --> 00:37:43.170
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

901
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably going through a similar</v>

902
00:37:45.391 --> 00:37:50.391
<v Speaker 1>period where all kinds of stuff is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribed that we're gonna find out 50</v>

903
00:37:50.671 --> 00:37:51.330
<v Speaker 1>years from now.</v>

904
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.163
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

905
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.870
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we prescribed adderall to 50 million</v>

906
00:37:54.871 --> 00:37:56.700
<v Speaker 1>children or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

907
00:37:56.701 --> 00:37:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just kind of sea monsters I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

908
00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something Someday Prozac,</v>

909
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.320
<v Speaker 1>adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the numbers of Ssri is that are</v>

910
00:38:04.321 --> 00:38:07.320
<v Speaker 1>prescribed needlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who knows how many people actually</v>

911
00:38:07.321 --> 00:38:10.440
<v Speaker 1>need those things versus how many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were just having a bad day and went to</v>

912
00:38:10.441 --> 00:38:12.390
<v Speaker 1>the doctor and they give you something</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbs you up.</v>

913
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

914
00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:15.260
<v Speaker 1>And how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many schools are,</v>

915
00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.880
<v Speaker 1>are mandated to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

916
00:38:17.881 --> 00:38:19.190
<v Speaker 1>to put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

917
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.820
<v Speaker 1>bunch of kids on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on these drugs.</v>

918
00:38:20.821 --> 00:38:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think probably in hindsight,</v>

919
00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:25.920
<v Speaker 1>some of that is going to look really bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

920
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're experimenting,</v>

921
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:31.290
<v Speaker 1>experimenting on People's brains and</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely these pharmaceutical</v>

922
00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:35.500
<v Speaker 1>companies have billions of dollars in</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive influence and they're making it</v>

923
00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 1>so this stuff</v>

924
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.410
<v Speaker 2>is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe just had a look at the number of</v>

925
00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:41.590
<v Speaker 2>people that are dying just dying from</v>
<v Speaker 2>opiate pills.</v>

926
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If those were illegal drugs,</v>

927
00:38:43.541 --> 00:38:46.060
<v Speaker 2>we'd be saying that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two goddamn epidemic.</v>

928
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.430
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

929
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>

930
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no question that it's a</v>

931
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:53.460
<v Speaker 2>conscious strategy to get people hooked</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

932
00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:58.590
<v Speaker 2>and get them taking those pills for in</v>
<v Speaker 2>every conceivable scenario so that they</v>

933
00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:03.700
<v Speaker 2>will seek them out in other areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in legally.</v>

934
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

935
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some,</v>

936
00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:12.760
<v Speaker 2>some prosecutor is going to have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out some way to get to hold some</v>

937
00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:15.760
<v Speaker 2>of those companies accountable because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're definitely doing not on purpose,</v>

938
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.650
<v Speaker 2>but even if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like they just,</v>

939
00:39:17.651 --> 00:39:19.660
<v Speaker 2>it's like the tobacco thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get paid,</v>

940
00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:20.470
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

941
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.830
<v Speaker 2>they pay off a few billion dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's barely scratches at debt and then</v>

942
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:26.620
<v Speaker 2>they write it all off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack up the price of everything a little</v>

943
00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:30.070
<v Speaker 2>bit over the course of 10 years of</v>
<v Speaker 2>balances itself out to zero.</v>

944
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

945
00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.950
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of movies will be made,</v>

946
00:39:32.951 --> 00:39:35.170
<v Speaker 2>but at the same thing will happen going</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

947
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:35.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

948
00:39:35.741 --> 00:39:37.960
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that Russell Crowe movie the</v>

949
00:39:37.961 --> 00:39:38.920
<v Speaker 2>insider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

950
00:39:38.921 --> 00:39:39.880
<v Speaker 2>that was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

951
00:39:39.881 --> 00:39:41.530
<v Speaker 2>it was a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a good movie.</v>

952
00:39:41.531 --> 00:39:43.090
<v Speaker 2>It was actually kind of more movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

953
00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:47.020
<v Speaker 2>about the death of the press as it</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned out than it was a movie about the</v>

954
00:39:47.021 --> 00:39:49.420
<v Speaker 2>death of the tobacco industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

955
00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.231
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

956
00:39:50.231 --> 00:39:52.390
<v Speaker 2>it was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

957
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:57.570
<v Speaker 2>what is it like being a reporter and</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a journalist rather today with all</v>

958
00:39:57.611 --> 00:40:02.611
<v Speaker 2>this fake news talk like this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a new thing,</v>

959
00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:07.980
<v Speaker 2>this whole calling something fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly is manufactured</v>

960
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:11.050
<v Speaker 2>stories and things that just aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

961
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Websites that are just designed to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to click on them and they have</v>

962
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.700
<v Speaker 2>crazy stories that didn't really happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're pretty obvious.</v>

963
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

964
00:40:20.081 --> 00:40:23.830
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of what people call</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake news is just news that is very</v>

965
00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:26.320
<v Speaker 2>heavily slanted in one direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

966
00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:29.470
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people talk a lot about how fox is fake</v>

967
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:30.580
<v Speaker 2>fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

968
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:33.970
<v Speaker 2>most of the time when you watch Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're just doing is they're</v>

969
00:40:33.971 --> 00:40:37.660
<v Speaker 2>selectively picking out stories that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know are going to rile up their</v>

970
00:40:37.661 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 2>elderly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a freaked out,</v>

971
00:40:39.941 --> 00:40:41.740
<v Speaker 2>terrified audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

972
00:40:41.741 --> 00:40:46.030
<v Speaker 2>and so they pick out the four or five</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are,</v>

973
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.030
<v Speaker 2>that actually happened around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

974
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.290
<v Speaker 2>they can do that without lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

975
00:40:50.291 --> 00:40:52.120
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to make this stuff up.</v>

976
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:55.450
<v Speaker 2>They can find the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lineup of facts that they want.</v>

977
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

978
00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working as a journalist now is,</v>

979
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.570
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

980
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.980
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different.</v>

981
00:41:02.981 --> 00:41:07.981
<v Speaker 2>The business is undergoing a extremely</v>
<v Speaker 2>rapid change and it's not something that</v>

982
00:41:09.431 --> 00:41:10.580
<v Speaker 2>we really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

983
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.450
<v Speaker 2>have reckoned with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't sat down and had a discussion</v>

984
00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:15.710
<v Speaker 2>about where this is all going and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

985
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:18.870
<v Speaker 2>how we can fix it because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

986
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:23.050
<v Speaker 2>the business is changing in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is extremely negative and no one's</v>

987
00:41:23.051 --> 00:41:25.150
<v Speaker 2>talking about how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to reverse that.</v>

988
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Like long form investigative reporting</v>
<v Speaker 2>is started to disappear,</v>

989
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 80s,</v>

990
00:41:32.381 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's accelerated to the point</v>

991
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.160
<v Speaker 3>where there's almost none of that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost everybody who works in the</v>

992
00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:42.161
<v Speaker 3>business is doing quick hits and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost no time left to do,</v>

993
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of Real,</v>

994
00:41:46.191 --> 00:41:50.930
<v Speaker 3>real hardcore investigative work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've trained our audiences also to</v>

995
00:41:50.931 --> 00:41:54.260
<v Speaker 3>be unable to consume that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

996
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:55.760
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

997
00:41:55.761 --> 00:41:58.850
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all basically doing clickbait now</v>

998
00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.010
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's,</v>

999
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.170
<v Speaker 3>it's a really dark time in our business.</v>

1000
00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1001
00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.840
<v Speaker 1>it's also this weird time of</v>
<v Speaker 1>transitioning between paper and digital</v>

1002
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.970
<v Speaker 1>and trying to get people to pay for</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital.</v>

1003
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:13.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I subscribed to a few of them online,</v>

1004
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:16.810
<v Speaker 1>a Washington Post New York Times where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay,</v>

1005
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.600
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think very many people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

1006
00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably a small amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are paying.</v>

1007
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1008
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I think the New York Times gives you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10 articles a month or something</v>

1009
00:42:26.321 --> 00:42:28.060
<v Speaker 1>like that for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>

1010
00:42:28.061 --> 00:42:28.691
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1011
00:42:28.691 --> 00:42:30.970
<v Speaker 1>you're here every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time to pay up.</v>

1012
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you like a little countdown,</v>

1013
00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:33.671
<v Speaker 1>then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1014
00:42:33.671 --> 00:42:34.660
<v Speaker 1>this is a good article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1015
00:42:34.661 --> 00:42:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pay.</v>

1016
00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:36.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

1017
00:42:36.211 --> 00:42:40.140
<v Speaker 3>this is a fascinating sort of sub plot</v>
<v Speaker 3>to what happened to the media business</v>

1018
00:42:40.141 --> 00:42:44.970
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of that is because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that Google did a long time</v>

1019
00:42:44.971 --> 00:42:46.440
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had this thing called the first</v>

1020
00:42:46.441 --> 00:42:50.760
<v Speaker 3>click rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the sort of mandated that all</v>

1021
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:55.790
<v Speaker 3>all new sites have at least some free</v>
<v Speaker 3>content or else the algorithm would,</v>

1022
00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:59.400
<v Speaker 3>would push the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1023
00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new story far down on the search</v>

1024
00:43:01.741 --> 00:43:02.970
<v Speaker 3>results,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1025
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.760
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't have free content on your</v>

1026
00:43:05.761 --> 00:43:08.400
<v Speaker 3>site,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't meet Google's first click</v>

1027
00:43:08.401 --> 00:43:09.520
<v Speaker 3>rule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1028
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.870
<v Speaker 3>when you search for a new story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just wouldn't find it.</v>

1029
00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:14.540
<v Speaker 3>So all of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1030
00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:17.610
<v Speaker 3>in the early days of sort of digital</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalism,</v>

1031
00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:22.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the news companies offered their</v>

1032
00:43:22.531 --> 00:43:26.640
<v Speaker 3>content basically for free and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1033
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:31.910
<v Speaker 3>that trained audiences to not pay for</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalism basically.</v>

1034
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.430
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1035
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.040
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty hard to put the genie back</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the bottle and tell everybody to go</v>

1036
00:43:38.041 --> 00:43:40.290
<v Speaker 3>back and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pay for everything.</v>

1037
00:43:40.291 --> 00:43:42.350
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1038
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:43.390
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1039
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:45.360
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in this place where everybody sort</v>

1040
00:43:45.361 --> 00:43:47.850
<v Speaker 3>of consuming free media and not only</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1041
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.260
<v Speaker 3>there's this additional problem of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1042
00:43:52.261 --> 00:43:54.690
<v Speaker 3>the internet platforms like facebook and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google,</v>

1043
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:59.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing news that they already know</v>

1044
00:43:59.551 --> 00:44:02.460
<v Speaker 3>people are going to agree with two</v>
<v Speaker 3>users.</v>

1045
00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:03.450
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1046
00:44:03.451 --> 00:44:06.000
<v Speaker 3>there's sort of less news that</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenges people,</v>

1047
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just not going to see it,</v>

1048
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:09.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's not the way the</v>

1049
00:44:09.361 --> 00:44:10.290
<v Speaker 3>algorithms work.</v>

1050
00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.120
<v Speaker 1>The algorithms are really confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the algorithms like will actively</v>

1051
00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:18.540
<v Speaker 1>pick out things they think you'll be</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>

1052
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.140
<v Speaker 1>So if you're someone who has got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular set of interest,</v>

1053
00:44:22.141 --> 00:44:23.520
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes sort of a,</v>

1054
00:44:23.521 --> 00:44:24.810
<v Speaker 1>an echo chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1055
00:44:24.811 --> 00:44:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Your Google search becomes an echo</v>
<v Speaker 1>chamber.</v>

1056
00:44:26.761 --> 00:44:29.580
<v Speaker 1>You're go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have that Google News App on my phone.</v>

1057
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll check it every morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what's going,</v>

1058
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's all shit that I'm interested</v>

1059
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.180
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1060
00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1061
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.050
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a little bit worse on</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook than it is on Google,</v>

1062
00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:39.250
<v Speaker 2>but because it's google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you at least have some,</v>

1063
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:44.250
<v Speaker 2>some control over what you searched for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even Google will will prompt you</v>

1064
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:45.810
<v Speaker 2>with things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1065
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.150
<v Speaker 2>Like so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with,</v>

1066
00:44:48.151 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with both of them,</v>

1067
00:44:49.711 --> 00:44:50.371
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1068
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:52.560
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're accumulating lots and lots of</v>

1069
00:44:52.561 --> 00:44:56.790
<v Speaker 2>information about your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only about what you read but about</v>

1070
00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:59.310
<v Speaker 2>the things that you buy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movies that you watch,</v>

1071
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.490
<v Speaker 2>what your predilections probably are and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what your opinions,</v>

1072
00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:06.660
<v Speaker 2>your political stances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they pick out a new stories that</v>

1073
00:45:06.661 --> 00:45:11.490
<v Speaker 2>they think are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are likely to endorse or spent a lot of</v>

1074
00:45:11.491 --> 00:45:13.350
<v Speaker 2>time reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1075
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:18.410
<v Speaker 2>which likely means that you're never</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to see a news story that says you</v>

1076
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.820
<v Speaker 2>personally are responsible for something</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

1077
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like thing one,</v>

1078
00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will see a lot of news stories that</v>

1079
00:45:25.051 --> 00:45:27.960
<v Speaker 2>say your neighbor is responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>something bad.</v>

1080
00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the reasons why like</v>

1081
00:45:30.541 --> 00:45:33.570
<v Speaker 2>divisiveness is a conscious commercial</v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy.</v>

1082
00:45:33.571 --> 00:45:34.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1083
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.940
<v Speaker 2>it's a natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1084
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:40.020
<v Speaker 2>result of a lot of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these behaviors.</v>

1085
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.950
<v Speaker 2>What is the mean age of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching Fox News?</v>

1086
00:45:43.951 --> 00:45:46.200
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about like how it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>people 68.</v>

1087
00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:47.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1088
00:45:47.551 --> 00:45:50.520
<v Speaker 2>it's something ridiculously all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's true of all the,</v>

1089
00:45:50.521 --> 00:45:53.360
<v Speaker 2>all the cable networks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all MSNBC.</v>

1090
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even Msnbc,</v>

1091
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1092
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:57.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1093
00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:02.100
<v Speaker 2>it's worse with Fox and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1094
00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:06.330
<v Speaker 2>and CNN and I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to misquote it,</v>

1095
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:11.360
<v Speaker 2>but I know they're all like above 65.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1096
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:12.050
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

1097
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:13.290
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 68,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

1098
00:46:13.291 --> 00:46:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Look at that median age of a prime time</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Fox News.</v>

1099
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Do we do we have an MSAC 65,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the younguns CNN 60.</v>

1100
00:46:24.661 --> 00:46:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're little kids.</v>

1101
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:33.060
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of that has to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that young people just don't watch</v>

1103
00:46:33.061 --> 00:46:33.730
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1104
00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're done.</v>

1105
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:38.430
<v Speaker 2>They're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're getting their news some other</v>

1106
00:46:38.431 --> 00:46:40.340
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not getting it ready.</v>

1107
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:40.671
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1108
00:46:40.671 --> 00:46:44.220
<v Speaker 2>they're night or they're not getting it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in youtube videos,</v>

1109
00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.100
<v Speaker 2>getting almost no news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1110
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:46.971
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1111
00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:47.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1112
00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:47.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1113
00:46:47.511 --> 00:46:48.321
<v Speaker 1>it's a post to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1114
00:46:48.321 --> 00:46:50.600
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1115
00:46:50.601 --> 00:46:52.850
<v Speaker 1>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to deliver newspapers,</v>

1116
00:46:52.851 --> 00:46:54.570
<v Speaker 1>so I've read newspapers quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>

1117
00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to do the globe?</v>

1118
00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did until I was a paper boy.</v>

1119
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Where was your route?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

1120
00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:01.490
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one in Hingham.</v>

1121
00:47:01.491 --> 00:47:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I had one in Norwell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1122
00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did mostly Newton.</v>

1123
00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Newton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1124
00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the globe.</v>

1125
00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I did the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1126
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:14.330
<v Speaker 1>the Herald Boston Herald and I delivered</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times for awhile.</v>

1127
00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:18.800
<v Speaker 1>But just so I didn't like the New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>Times is interesting because it wasn't,</v>

1128
00:47:18.801 --> 00:47:21.800
<v Speaker 1>didn't pay as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were a larger routes,</v>

1129
00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:26.210
<v Speaker 1>like you had to go much further because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was very few houses that would get</v>

1130
00:47:26.211 --> 00:47:28.850
<v Speaker 1>the times right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you felt like you were doing</v>

1131
00:47:28.851 --> 00:47:29.740
<v Speaker 1>something special</v>

1132
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:34.810
<v Speaker 2>liver and the New York Times that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>prestige to it and they had clear blue</v>

1133
00:47:34.811 --> 00:47:36.860
<v Speaker 2>plastic bags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1134
00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Is that a blue bag?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the Boston Globe at clear bags,</v>

1135
00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:45.250
<v Speaker 2>they deliver those in clear bags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the times the Herald should have</v>

1136
00:47:45.251 --> 00:47:47.910
<v Speaker 2>been in a brown paper bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1137
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:51.280
<v Speaker 2>like a porno or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they,</v>

1138
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:54.520
<v Speaker 2>do they deliver like the Daily News and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the post in New York?</v>

1139
00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:56.170
<v Speaker 2>Does that get delivered or is it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1140
00:47:56.171 --> 00:47:58.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean they must,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1141
00:47:58.450 --> 00:47:59.020
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>

1142
00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:04.020
<v Speaker 2>they have subscriptions and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the times is the daily news</v>

1143
00:48:04.331 --> 00:48:06.910
<v Speaker 2>definitely does have a delivery for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1144
00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think so.</v>

1145
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:09.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1146
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:12.940
<v Speaker 2>but that I just spent a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing about this.</v>

1147
00:48:12.941 --> 00:48:15.910
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the VAT model where,</v>

1148
00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>newspapers had this direct relationship</v>

1149
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:20.920
<v Speaker 2>with their readers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1150
00:48:20.921 --> 00:48:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Like they not only owned the content and</v>
<v Speaker 2>created the content,</v>

1151
00:48:25.841 --> 00:48:27.850
<v Speaker 2>but they also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1152
00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.760
<v Speaker 2>completely controlled the distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1153
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:34.000
<v Speaker 2>They had the trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had the paper kids like us.</v>

1154
00:48:34.001 --> 00:48:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1155
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:39.970
<v Speaker 2>that was all part of what gave the press</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's power is that we were,</v>

1156
00:48:39.971 --> 00:48:42.400
<v Speaker 2>we had the unique ability to reach all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people.</v>

1157
00:48:42.401 --> 00:48:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1158
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:46.720
<v Speaker 2>once the Internet came along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cut that in half.</v>

1159
00:48:46.721 --> 00:48:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the distribution is all google</v>

1160
00:48:49.631 --> 00:48:51.570
<v Speaker 2>and facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1161
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:54.910
<v Speaker 1>and the content is all being made by</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else.</v>

1162
00:48:54.911 --> 00:48:57.240
<v Speaker 1>So it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1163
00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.200
<v Speaker 1>it makes it very difficult to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

1164
00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:03.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a and then b you just don't have that,</v>

1165
00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.140
<v Speaker 1>that personal relationship with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

1166
00:49:06.141 --> 00:49:07.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consumer anymore,</v>

1167
00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:10.240
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a completely different sort of</v>

1168
00:49:10.241 --> 00:49:13.750
<v Speaker 1>paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do you think there's a connection to</v>

1169
00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:16.300
<v Speaker 1>ponder this myself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like in the early days of the</v>

1170
00:49:16.301 --> 00:49:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one a big factor with the music industry</v>

1171
00:49:19.541 --> 00:49:23.830
<v Speaker 1>for sure was napster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Napster came along and then people got</v>

1172
00:49:23.831 --> 00:49:27.280
<v Speaker 1>this initial taste of getting a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that you'd normally paid for,</v>

1173
00:49:27.281 --> 00:49:29.680
<v Speaker 1>for free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get just get tons of it.</v>

1174
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:33.850
<v Speaker 1>And then so the internet sort of got</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with being a free thing and</v>

1175
00:49:33.851 --> 00:49:37.630
<v Speaker 1>then there was bit torrent and through</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit torrent you can get films and all</v>

1176
00:49:37.631 --> 00:49:40.480
<v Speaker 1>kinds of different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could download movies and,</v>

1177
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:43.600
<v Speaker 1>and people just start filling up hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>drives with this stuff that they would</v>

1178
00:49:43.601 --> 00:49:44.620
<v Speaker 1>get off a bit torrent.</v>

1179
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:49.720
<v Speaker 1>And in my mind at least it became this</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection with the Internet.</v>

1180
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Stuff's free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much stuff for free.</v>

1181
00:49:52.481 --> 00:49:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Like why would I pay for this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1182
00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:55.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've,</v>

1183
00:49:55.041 --> 00:49:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to say this to friends who</v>
<v Speaker 1>get involved with podcasting,</v>

1184
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:03.610
<v Speaker 1>who have come over from radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just friends that have been fired</v>

1185
00:50:03.611 --> 00:50:04.690
<v Speaker 1>from radio jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1186
00:50:04.691 --> 00:50:06.130
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to start a podcast and</v>

1187
00:50:06.131 --> 00:50:09.220
<v Speaker 1>charge people five bucks a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as you do that,</v>

1188
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:12.280
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck would I pay get Adam</v>

1189
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Carolla for free?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz for free?</v>

1190
00:50:14.591 --> 00:50:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Why would I pay $5 for you?</v>

1191
00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:17.853
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1192
00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:21.660
<v Speaker 2>absolutely know that the audience</v>
<v Speaker 2>expectations now or that they're going</v>

1193
00:50:21.661 --> 00:50:23.130
<v Speaker 2>to get free content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's free,</v>

1194
00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.840
<v Speaker 2>everything's free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1195
00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously that has a</v>

1196
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:32.980
<v Speaker 3>huge consequences because that forces</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who create the content to get the</v>

1197
00:50:33.591 --> 00:50:36.020
<v Speaker 3>money from somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They either have to be sponsored by an</v>

1198
00:50:36.021 --> 00:50:39.410
<v Speaker 3>advertiser who might have certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>expectations.</v>

1199
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:41.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>

1200
00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly not good for the people</v>

1201
00:50:43.161 --> 00:50:44.520
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who make content that,</v>

1202
00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:45.830
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's like that.</v>

1203
00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1204
00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:47.991
<v Speaker 3>and it creates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1205
00:50:47.991 --> 00:50:49.820
<v Speaker 3>a lot of bad habits with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1206
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.620
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the readers too.</v>

1207
00:50:51.621 --> 00:50:52.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

1208
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:54.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than,</v>

1209
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:58.760
<v Speaker 3>rather than look for the best stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just look for what's available and</v>

1210
00:50:58.761 --> 00:50:59.900
<v Speaker 3>what they can read for free.</v>

1211
00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it opens up the door to all this</v>

1212
00:51:02.591 --> 00:51:07.210
<v Speaker 1>wacky advertising where pop up ads and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and scroll down ads.</v>

1213
00:51:07.211 --> 00:51:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Like you try to scroll down a screen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ad follows with you and then,</v>

1214
00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so annoying.</v>

1215
00:51:11.381 --> 00:51:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1216
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.011
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1217
00:51:13.011 --> 00:51:14.590
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so invasive and they're</v>

1218
00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.690
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even on really good websites.</v>

1219
00:51:16.691 --> 00:51:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you go to CNN,</v>

1220
00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:23.080
<v Speaker 1>you get the real stories and then below</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get this stuff that looks like</v>

1221
00:51:23.081 --> 00:51:25.540
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a very faint print,</v>

1222
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.850
<v Speaker 1>it says paid content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1223
00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:31.330
<v Speaker 1>And then you look at it like you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to believe what she looks like now</v>

1224
00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:35.860
<v Speaker 1>and then you click and you can't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>outbrain.</v>

1225
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even find out what she looks</v>

1226
00:51:37.901 --> 00:51:41.800
<v Speaker 1>like now cause you've got to go through</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 other people that look like shit now</v>

1227
00:51:41.801 --> 00:51:44.530
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then finally you get it.</v>

1228
00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you don't even get to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>original one.</v>

1229
00:51:46.301 --> 00:51:48.700
<v Speaker 1>So you're confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's better if they don't</v>

1230
00:51:48.701 --> 00:51:51.270
<v Speaker 1>satisfy you because then he'd just go</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the rest of the site.</v>

1231
00:51:51.271 --> 00:51:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Well what does he look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1232
00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:58.480
<v Speaker 1>you go to all these different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like one of those pages that</v>

1233
00:51:58.481 --> 00:52:03.481
<v Speaker 1>you go to where there's just dozens and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dozens of windows and boxes that you can</v>

1234
00:52:03.551 --> 00:52:08.500
<v Speaker 1>click on different individual like</v>
<v Speaker 1>cliquey bait stories where you go to</v>

1235
00:52:08.501 --> 00:52:12.880
<v Speaker 1>each one of them and they'll take you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 pages of different people that have</v>

1236
00:52:12.881 --> 00:52:16.810
<v Speaker 1>gained weight or lost weight or a poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>now or whatever it is.</v>

1237
00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:19.140
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1238
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:24.450
<v Speaker 3>I think it's one of the things that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>really bad about that is that if you</v>

1239
00:52:24.451 --> 00:52:27.720
<v Speaker 3>spend enough time doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain stops being able to do other</v>

1240
00:52:27.721 --> 00:52:28.590
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1241
00:52:28.591 --> 00:52:33.450
<v Speaker 3>like when you're reading books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>books require you to sit there and</v>

1242
00:52:33.451 --> 00:52:37.710
<v Speaker 3>construct in your head all the visuals</v>
<v Speaker 3>for everything that you're reading.</v>

1243
00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:40.380
<v Speaker 3>You have to imagine what the people look</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

1244
00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.030
<v Speaker 3>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1245
00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:45.240
<v Speaker 3>do all this mental work to construct the</v>
<v Speaker 3>scene,</v>

1246
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your brain is actively engaged in,</v>

1247
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:49.800
<v Speaker 3>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this really highly specific.</v>

1248
00:52:49.801 --> 00:52:51.150
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and creative way.</v>

1249
00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:53.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1250
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:57.540
<v Speaker 3>but the Internet now just has it moving</v>
<v Speaker 3>from place to place,</v>

1251
00:52:57.541 --> 00:53:01.500
<v Speaker 3>clicking from place to place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going from sensation to sensation.</v>

1252
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:03.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to ponder anything.</v>

1253
00:53:03.841 --> 00:53:06.420
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have an opinion about</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1254
00:53:06.421 --> 00:53:08.520
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to look at both sides of</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1255
00:53:08.521 --> 00:53:11.070
<v Speaker 3>You just have to move from one thing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>another to the next thing,</v>

1256
00:53:11.071 --> 00:53:12.600
<v Speaker 3>which is what you're talking about with</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

1257
00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.520
<v Speaker 3>That's the way his brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1258
00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:16.530
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1259
00:53:16.531 --> 00:53:18.220
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a bad thing,</v>

1260
00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:20.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not only bad in itself,</v>

1261
00:53:20.431 --> 00:53:22.740
<v Speaker 3>but it makes it impossible for us to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing,</v>

1262
00:53:22.741 --> 00:53:23.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

1263
00:53:23.491 --> 00:53:25.590
<v Speaker 3>which is more constructive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1264
00:53:25.591 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

1265
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.180
<v Speaker 1>almost like mental range of motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're somehow or another,</v>

1266
00:53:30.181 --> 00:53:33.660
<v Speaker 1>your joints were restricted where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could only like move a certain amount</v>

1267
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:36.120
<v Speaker 1>after a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would lose your full range of</v>

1268
00:53:36.121 --> 00:53:37.140
<v Speaker 1>motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1269
00:53:37.141 --> 00:53:39.470
<v Speaker 1>It gets atrophied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a heart,</v>

1270
00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm reading books now than I did when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1271
00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably 11 years old.</v>

1272
00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.530
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's just from,</v>

1273
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:47.670
<v Speaker 3>and you're a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Write,</v>

1274
00:53:47.671 --> 00:53:48.504
<v Speaker 3>I'm a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1275
00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:49.470
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

1276
00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still,</v>

1277
00:53:51.301 --> 00:53:54.570
<v Speaker 3>I find that I have a harder time doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the work,</v>

1278
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:55.463
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1279
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.520
<v Speaker 3>And that's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or like when I was,</v>

1280
00:53:59.521 --> 00:54:02.100
<v Speaker 3>when I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read more fiction,</v>

1281
00:54:02.101 --> 00:54:05.070
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is harder because it requires you</v>

1282
00:54:05.071 --> 00:54:06.540
<v Speaker 3>to do more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1283
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:09.290
<v Speaker 3>sort of mental construction work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1284
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.790
<v Speaker 3>now it's much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going to read a book,</v>

1285
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:13.830
<v Speaker 3>it's typically nonfiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is linear,</v>

1286
00:54:13.831 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 3>which is an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1287
00:54:15.271 --> 00:54:16.230
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1288
00:54:16.231 --> 00:54:17.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1289
00:54:17.521 --> 00:54:19.650
<v Speaker 3>it's less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it requires less work of the</v>

1290
00:54:19.651 --> 00:54:20.550
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1291
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:23.400
<v Speaker 3>It may be just as interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it just requires less work.</v>

1292
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:26.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like the hardest thing to read is,</v>

1293
00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anna Karenina or something like that.</v>

1294
00:54:28.891 --> 00:54:31.500
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have to not only think,</v>

1295
00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:33.840
<v Speaker 3>but you have to construct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with your,</v>

1296
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.820
<v Speaker 3>if you're just reading the diary of Kim</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kim,</v>

1297
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Kim Kardashian or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>

1298
00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:39.510
<v Speaker 3>you're just kind of listening to</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>

1299
00:54:39.511 --> 00:54:40.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go look like that.</v>

1300
00:54:40.741 --> 00:54:44.430
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think all of this stuff is negative,</v>

1301
00:54:44.431 --> 00:54:46.920
<v Speaker 3>but I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm an old fogy about it.</v>

1302
00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1303
00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:47.701
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1304
00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think it's not the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal in terms of constructing a healthy</v>

1305
00:54:52.501 --> 00:54:53.400
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1306
00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.720
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1307
00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:56.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's what we got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1308
00:54:56.581 --> 00:54:57.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

1309
00:54:57.991 --> 00:54:58.280
<v Speaker 1>It's so</v>

1310
00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.050
<v Speaker 3>weird time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1311
00:55:00.051 --> 00:55:01.430
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1312
00:55:01.431 --> 00:55:03.230
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of positive things.</v>

1313
00:55:03.231 --> 00:55:06.710
<v Speaker 3>The positive things are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can have a voice now and anybody</v>

1314
00:55:06.711 --> 00:55:10.610
<v Speaker 3>who has something interesting to say can</v>
<v Speaker 3>be instantly elevated and have an</v>

1315
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.980
<v Speaker 3>audience overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's great.</v>

1316
00:55:12.981 --> 00:55:13.671
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1317
00:55:13.671 --> 00:55:14.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1318
00:55:14.021 --> 00:55:14.860
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1319
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:19.550
<v Speaker 3>in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had to penetrate this ridiculous</v>

1320
00:55:19.551 --> 00:55:23.120
<v Speaker 3>oligarchy of entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who,</v>

1321
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:27.230
<v Speaker 3>who really own tightly controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who got access to what,</v>

1322
00:55:27.231 --> 00:55:28.460
<v Speaker 3>who got to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1323
00:55:28.461 --> 00:55:32.660
<v Speaker 3>have an audience a and now you get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>bypass that entirely and sort of</v>

1324
00:55:32.661 --> 00:55:34.250
<v Speaker 3>directly appeal to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1325
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:35.720
<v Speaker 3>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>

1326
00:55:35.721 --> 00:55:36.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an amazing thing.</v>

1327
00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.900
<v Speaker 1>But then you get youtube stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I would watch this over reading my</v>

<v Speaker 1>So what the fuck I'm going to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1375
00:58:19.701 --> 00:58:21.380
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting thought exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1376
00:58:21.381 --> 00:58:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Like where do you go down from Donald</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump?</v>

1377
00:58:23.121 --> 00:58:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause the progression has to go down,</v>

00:58:25.281 --> 00:58:26.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we all done?</v>

1379
00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Cause I remember when Bush was</v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

1380
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:33.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like are we talking to reporters?</v>

1381
00:58:33.051 --> 00:58:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Bush used to do this thing where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>would carry around a biography of Dean</v>

1382
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Aitchison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1383
00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:40.940

<v Speaker 1>just approved reporters that he could</v>

1384
00:58:40.941 --> 00:58:43.200
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1385
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:45.170
<v Speaker 1>we all used to joke with each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1386
00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.870
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's stupider than this is ever</v>

1387
00:58:47.871 --> 00:58:51.190
<v Speaker 1>going to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you know,</v>

1388
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.240
<v Speaker 1>you look back and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bushes,</v>

1389

<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1390
00:58:53.801 --> 00:58:55.470
<v Speaker 1>he's like Einstein compared to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1391
00:58:55.810 --> 00:58:58.580
<v Speaker 1>to trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a joke that I did back in my</v>

1392
00:58:58.581 --> 00:59:03.581
<v Speaker 1>netflix special from 2005 were when Bush</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in office where it was a bunch of</v>

1393
00:59:05.931 --> 00:59:08.900
<v Speaker 1>people were trying to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb people are.</v>

1394
00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:11.470
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way they like there</v>

1395
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.230
<v Speaker 1>speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1396
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:14.090
<v Speaker 1>let's get a smart guy to act dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1397
00:59:14.091 --> 00:59:14.331
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1398
00:59:14.331 --> 00:59:16.400
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get a real dumb guy.</v>

1399
00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise we'll never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta have a real dumb guy.</v>

1400
00:59:20.031 --> 00:59:22.080
<v Speaker 1>And then so they get the real guy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put up do</v>

1401
00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.180
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1402
00:59:23.181 --> 00:59:25.430
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they vote him in a second time and then</v>

1403
00:59:25.431 --> 00:59:28.100
<v Speaker 2>someone in the back of the room goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can go dumber</v>

1404
00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.310
<v Speaker 2>and this is where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1405
00:59:34.311 --> 00:59:38.660
<v Speaker 2>This is a bit from 2005 but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 years later,</v>

1406
00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.400
<v Speaker 2>life imitates art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went away.</v>

1407
00:59:40.401 --> 00:59:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Dumber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1408
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well do a lab which seems super</v>

1409
00:59:43.761 --> 00:59:47.210
<v Speaker 2>reasonable in comparison to some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that trump says in terms of like</v>

1410
00:59:47.211 --> 00:59:49.760
<v Speaker 2>supreme court rulings and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1411
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:53.720
<v Speaker 2>there was a supreme court ruling that</v>
<v Speaker 2>went against bushes way while he was an</v>

1412
00:59:53.721 --> 00:59:56.300
<v Speaker 2>office and he had a really reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

1413
00:59:56.570 --> 00:59:58.010
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course we're disappointed,</v>

1414
00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.560
<v Speaker 2>but we have to abide by the court and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their ruling.</v>

1415
01:00:00.561 --> 01:00:02.720
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like something you would never</v>

1416
01:00:02.721 --> 01:00:05.360
<v Speaker 2>hear trump say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never hear him say something like that.</v>

1417
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:06.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1418
01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1419
01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:11.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look back and Bush seems to me almost</v>

1420
01:00:11.721 --> 01:00:15.620
<v Speaker 2>like a Scandinavian statesmen compared</v>
<v Speaker 2>to compared to Donald Trump,</v>

1421
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.820
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would go to the White House to,</v>

1422
01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people did want to go to the</v>

1423
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:23.810
<v Speaker 2>White House for the inauguration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little table go.</v>

1424
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:25.340
<v Speaker 2>She'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1425
01:00:25.341 --> 01:00:27.350
<v Speaker 2>the White House is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to look like the White House</v>

1426
01:00:27.351 --> 01:00:29.480
<v Speaker 2>and idiocrasy when she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she's in there.</v>

1427
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1428
01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:31.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1429
01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:33.410
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1430
01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a weird time too,</v>

1431
01:00:35.091 --> 01:00:36.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like during the inauguration when no</v>

1432
01:00:36.711 --> 01:00:40.100
<v Speaker 2>celebrities wanted to go and they dig</v>
<v Speaker 2>out like really weird,</v>

1433
01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:45.160
<v Speaker 2>like real fucking on the outskirts</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrities.</v>

1434
01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:46.310
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1435
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.110
<v Speaker 2>And it was the same thing with the RNC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cover,</v>

1436
01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:50.720
<v Speaker 2>I remember I covered the RNC and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1437
01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:55.070
<v Speaker 2>and they had to have Scott Bayeux,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1438
01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.020
<v Speaker 2>do one of the first day speeches.</v>

1439
01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:59.870
<v Speaker 2>Got bail is a huge supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1440
01:00:59.871 --> 01:01:01.010
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Scott,</v>

1441
01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.380
<v Speaker 2>I know personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very nice guy.</v>

1442
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it has guy.</v>

1443
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1444
01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:08.120
<v Speaker 2>But that was their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was their,</v>

1445
01:01:08.121 --> 01:01:11.550
<v Speaker 2>a list for the Republican National</v>
<v Speaker 2>Convention and uh,</v>

1446
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of,</v>

1447
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:16.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Hannitys and those type</v>

1448
01:01:16.611 --> 01:01:17.390
<v Speaker 2>fellows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1449
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1450
01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1451
01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:21.200
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1452
01:01:21.201 --> 01:01:23.360
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1453
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:25.610
<v Speaker 2>it's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1454
01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.910
<v Speaker 2>it just seems like everything's off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>

1455
01:01:28.911 --> 01:01:31.940
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we skipped dimensions were like jolted</v>

1456
01:01:31.941 --> 01:01:36.941
<v Speaker 2>over isn't parallel world where things</v>
<v Speaker 2>just don't seem like at least things</v>

1457
01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:40.910
<v Speaker 2>used to make set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd be disappointed at this guy</v>

1458
01:01:40.911 --> 01:01:44.870
<v Speaker 2>won or you'd be disappointed that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country was doing this or that we were</v>

1459
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:49.280
<v Speaker 2>invading Iraq or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it would kind of seem like the</v>

1460
01:01:49.281 --> 01:01:50.720
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1461
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is it.</v>

1462
01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.540
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1463
01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:57.560
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean previously,</v>

1464
01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:02.270
<v Speaker 2>like the entertainment industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics was tightly controlled by a</v>

1465
01:02:02.271 --> 01:02:07.271
<v Speaker 2>small group of Cigar chomping people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>sat in the back room and in both parties</v>

1466
01:02:07.881 --> 01:02:09.540
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>

1467
01:02:09.541 --> 01:02:11.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they carefully outlined a sort of</v>

1468
01:02:11.601 --> 01:02:15.230
<v Speaker 2>narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a range of acceptable political</v>

1469
01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:18.110
<v Speaker 2>opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in one party,</v>

1470
01:02:18.111 --> 01:02:20.670
<v Speaker 2>you could be all the way up to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1471
01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:24.750
<v Speaker 2>somebody like Ron Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they tended to put somebody like</v>

1472
01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:27.660
<v Speaker 2>George Bush that as the candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1473
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:31.890
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no directly appealing to the</v>

1474
01:02:31.891 --> 01:02:35.730
<v Speaker 2>electorate and asking them who they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to be,</v>

1475
01:02:35.731 --> 01:02:36.690
<v Speaker 2>the candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1476
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump is really the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>internet president.</v>

1477
01:02:39.301 --> 01:02:43.230
<v Speaker 2>He completely bypassed that entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>oligarchy.</v>

1478
01:02:43.231 --> 01:02:46.260
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have to go through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1479
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:49.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the priesthood to get to be president,</v>

1480
01:02:49.231 --> 01:02:53.490
<v Speaker 2>which on the one hand is evidence of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good thing because it's actually more</v>

1481
01:02:53.491 --> 01:02:54.910
<v Speaker 2>democratic than the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1482
01:02:54.911 --> 01:02:57.330
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the system was before where it was</v>

1483
01:02:57.331 --> 01:03:01.290
<v Speaker 2>pretty much close to everybody except</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a few people who paid their dues</v>

1484
01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.340
<v Speaker 2>through the system.</v>

1485
01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but trump direct,</v>

1486
01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just by being famous and just by</v>

1487
01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:08.550
<v Speaker 2>attracting media attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1488
01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:13.880
<v Speaker 2>he was able to bypass all of the usual</v>
<v Speaker 2>tests and bypass the parties,</v>

1489
01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decision making process,</v>

1490
01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:20.160
<v Speaker 2>and he got to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's like little pay,</v>

1491
01:03:20.161 --> 01:03:20.731
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1492
01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:23.820
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just represents the dumber side of us</v>

1493
01:03:23.821 --> 01:03:25.860
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to the more enlightened side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of us.</v>

1494
01:03:25.861 --> 01:03:27.120
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1495
01:03:27.121 --> 01:03:28.830
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to know what to think about</v>

1496
01:03:28.831 --> 01:03:29.171
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1497
01:03:29.171 --> 01:03:30.930
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I when I was covering it,</v>

1498
01:03:30.931 --> 01:03:34.860
<v Speaker 2>I thought on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is evidence that the electorate is</v>

1499
01:03:34.861 --> 01:03:37.470
<v Speaker 2>breaking away from being told who to</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote for.</v>

1500
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other hand,</v>

1501
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.090
<v Speaker 2>the first time they take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that freedom and for a test drive,</v>

1502
01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:43.470
<v Speaker 2>this is what they pick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1503
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:46.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't know lease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it throws a giant monkey wrench into the</v>

1504
01:03:46.801 --> 01:03:47.690
<v Speaker 2>gears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1505
01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:48.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1506
01:03:48.571 --> 01:03:51.180
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what,</v>

1507
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.530
<v Speaker 2>what the result of that will be is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is yet to be determined yet to be</v>

1508
01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:56.400
<v Speaker 2>determined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1509
01:03:56.401 --> 01:04:01.401
<v Speaker 2>I mean it could be the end of civil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said this before,</v>

1510
01:04:01.681 --> 01:04:02.850
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1511
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:08.630
<v Speaker 2>when I was covering the trump run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of me wanted to write it as a</v>

1512
01:04:09.211 --> 01:04:11.520
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all the early stories were like</v>

1513
01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:13.980
<v Speaker 2>highly comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to write about the funny</v>

1514
01:04:13.981 --> 01:04:17.100
<v Speaker 2>aspect of it and then after he became</v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

1515
01:04:17.101 --> 01:04:18.900
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1516
01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.070
<v Speaker 2>this is either the funniest thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever happened in America or it's the end</v>

1517
01:04:23.071 --> 01:04:24.630
<v Speaker 2>of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1518
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Does that make it funnier?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the end of the civilization.</v>

1519
01:04:27.091 --> 01:04:27.901
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1520
01:04:27.901 --> 01:04:29.340
<v Speaker 2>you're the erotic comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I should,</v>

1521
01:04:29.341 --> 01:04:30.960
<v Speaker 2>I should ask you about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know either.</v>

1522
01:04:30.961 --> 01:04:31.351
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1523
01:04:31.351 --> 01:04:33.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all depending upon how it plays</v>

1524
01:04:33.151 --> 01:04:33.870
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1525
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations have absolutely fallen in</v>

1526
01:04:36.061 --> 01:04:39.810
<v Speaker 2>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This idea that civilization won't fall,</v>

1527
01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:42.780
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is akin to the people that live on the</v>

1528
01:04:42.781 --> 01:04:45.600
<v Speaker 2>big island thinking that the volcano</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't erupt again.</v>

1529
01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:46.291
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1530
01:04:46.291 --> 01:04:47.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1531
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's going to happen again,</v>

1532
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:53.820
<v Speaker 2>like so will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our ideas about maintaining civilization</v>

1533
01:04:53.821 --> 01:04:58.821
<v Speaker 2>are an attempt to prolong this state or</v>
<v Speaker 2>mitigate any possible disastrous effects</v>

1534
01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:01.650
<v Speaker 2>of collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1535
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:03.750
<v Speaker 2>But it's going to fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

1536
01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:09.290
<v Speaker 2>it's an old system that was constructed</v>
<v Speaker 2>on scrolls by people writing with</v>

1537
01:05:09.301 --> 01:05:12.270
<v Speaker 2>feathered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really had no idea what the future</v>

1538
01:05:12.271 --> 01:05:13.470
<v Speaker 2>hadn't stall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1539
01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:16.260
<v Speaker 2>We didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know what the future had in</v>

1540
01:05:16.261 --> 01:05:17.094
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had no,</v>

1541
01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>they would have</v>

1542
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>been terrified by a toothbrush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1543
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.823
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1544
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly by a fucking airplane and</v>

1545
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:29.671
<v Speaker 1>cellular communication and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in a world that requires a</v>

1546
01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:33.250
<v Speaker 1>completely new set of rules and</v>
<v Speaker 1>guidelines.</v>

1547
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.740
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has always been the article against</v>

1548
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:37.090
<v Speaker 1>the second amendment like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1549
01:05:37.091 --> 01:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>did they had muskets when they wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

1550
01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:43.110
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have ar fifteens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have 50 caliber guns that</v>

1551
01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>can kill things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

1552
01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:50.011
<v Speaker 1>they miss them playing a video yesterday</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a guy shooting a deer and with a 50</v>

1553
01:05:50.351 --> 01:05:53.980
<v Speaker 1>caliber rifle and he misses the deer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still kills the deer.</v>

1554
01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:59.290
<v Speaker 1>The bullet going past the deer's head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just of sheer force of it blows the</v>

1555
01:05:59.291 --> 01:06:02.560
<v Speaker 1>deer's brains out dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that actually it happened?</v>

1556
01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to watch it.</v>

1557
01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1558
01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep that one on a favorites to make a</v>

1559
01:06:11.261 --> 01:06:14.200
<v Speaker 1>folder for shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We repetitively talk about</v>

1560
01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:17.320
<v Speaker 1>when I was embedded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interact,</v>

1561
01:06:17.321 --> 01:06:20.320
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took me out and the guys apparently</v>

1562
01:06:20.321 --> 01:06:23.880
<v Speaker 1>for recreation and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cut cars and half with 50 cal</v>

1563
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:25.680
<v Speaker 1>calibers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the,</v>

1564
01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:27.730
<v Speaker 1>here's the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now watch this.</v>

1565
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:32.910
<v Speaker 1>He misses boom and watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just falls down dead</v>

1566
01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:41.650
<v Speaker 1>from the bullet passing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like Jesus.</v>

1567
01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:45.910
<v Speaker 1>It just whizzed by it and the force of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullet passing by.</v>

1568
01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:46.840
<v Speaker 1>He's psyched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1569
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:47.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1570
01:06:47.381 --> 01:06:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But watch the slow Mo,</v>

1571
01:06:50.730 --> 01:06:54.590
<v Speaker 1>it just falls down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1572
01:06:55.020 --> 01:07:00.020
<v Speaker 1>thank God this guy's got Cammo on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>million miles away and literally sitting</v>

1573
01:07:00.481 --> 01:07:03.270
<v Speaker 1>on a bench,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on a bench shooting something in</v>

1574
01:07:03.271 --> 01:07:06.480
<v Speaker 1>the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he picks his deer up and the deer's</v>

1575
01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:08.910
<v Speaker 1>brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just completely scrambled.</v>

1576
01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:11.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bolt wound at all.</v>

1577
01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No whole dead.</v>

1578
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:17.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a horror movie waiting to happen.</v>

1579
01:07:17.131 --> 01:07:19.180
<v Speaker 1>That deer's going to wake up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the night and,</v>

1580
01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:22.890
<v Speaker 1>and reanimated and uh Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

1581
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:25.860
<v Speaker 1>So the brands coming out of the ears</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of the ears.</v>

1582
01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just from the sheer force of the bullet</v>

1583
01:07:28.591 --> 01:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>passing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

1584
01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:35.620
<v Speaker 1>That's all I'm saying is it would be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good time to reconsider how we run</v>

1585
01:07:37.051 --> 01:07:39.750
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the good things about</v>

1586
01:07:39.751 --> 01:07:42.570
<v Speaker 1>having a guy like trump and offices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should sit down and say,</v>

1587
01:07:42.571 --> 01:07:44.820
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we probably shouldn't have a popularity</v>

1588
01:07:44.821 --> 01:07:46.680
<v Speaker 1>contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he who controls the nukes?</v>

1589
01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:52.200
<v Speaker 1>See who's the commander in chief of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest army that the planet has ever</v>

1590
01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:55.890
<v Speaker 1>known right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Far the most destructive force the</v>

1591
01:07:55.891 --> 01:07:58.020
<v Speaker 1>planet has ever known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't we?</v>

1592
01:07:58.021 --> 01:08:00.440
<v Speaker 1>At least find out if he's on diet pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1593
01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't be at least shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>saved.</v>

1594
01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Mr President,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd like a urine sample from you.</v>

1595
01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:06.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1596
01:08:06.991 --> 01:08:09.360
<v Speaker 1>After They Test Your pee if you work at</v>
<v Speaker 1>ups.</v>

1597
01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1598
01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:11.730
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1599
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:12.481
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1600
01:08:12.481 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I think there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there should be more a pee test</v>

1601
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.290
<v Speaker 3>for launching a nuclear strike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely</v>

1602
01:08:18.490 --> 01:08:22.260
<v Speaker 1>spit a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot of changes and one thing I'm hoping</v>

1603
01:08:22.261 --> 01:08:24.860
<v Speaker 1>is that this does this presidency and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1604
01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:26.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea of like having a</v>

1605
01:08:26.791 --> 01:08:29.780
<v Speaker 1>popularity contest will allow people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize like,</v>

1606
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.190
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't have one alpha champ</v>

1607
01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.900
<v Speaker 1>running things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1608
01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:35.910
<v Speaker 1>that's an antiquated idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was really great.</v>

1609
01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:38.390
<v Speaker 1>And a tribe of 50 nomads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1610
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Get them together and you have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wisest,</v>

1611
01:08:39.991 --> 01:08:42.060
<v Speaker 1>strongest one with the most battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

1612
01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.580
<v Speaker 1>That guy should be running things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows more than I do.</v>

1613
01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1614
01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's vote for ORC or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's the guy with the knowledge,</v>

1615
01:08:49.650 --> 01:08:51.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense,</v>

1616
01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>but when there's 350 million people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the ability to manipulate</v>

1617
01:08:56.011 --> 01:09:00.720
<v Speaker 1>things and you have tweets and facebook</v>
<v Speaker 1>posts and write could make wacky little</v>

1618
01:09:00.721 --> 01:09:03.750
<v Speaker 1>tay videos were not designed for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1619
01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.790
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1620
01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:09.790
<v Speaker 3>we have some structures that rely on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>popularity contest and some that have,</v>

1621
01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.860
<v Speaker 3>the public has no control over</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever.</v>

1622
01:09:12.861 --> 01:09:15.140
<v Speaker 3>Like Federal Reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't,</v>

1623
01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:17.540
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it makes no sense at all.</v>

1624
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Or how net neutrality got passed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>five different people or how it got</v>

1625
01:09:21.901 --> 01:09:22.460
<v Speaker 1>rescinded.</v>

1626
01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.181
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1627
01:09:23.181 --> 01:09:24.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1628
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1629
01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:25.850
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1630
01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.120
<v Speaker 3>the system doesn't really make a whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of sense.</v>

1631
01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:30.470
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1632
01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:35.340
<v Speaker 3>the s Congress and uncovering</v>
<v Speaker 3>congressional races now in the run up to</v>

1633
01:09:35.341 --> 01:09:37.960
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2018 and you know,</v>

1634
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:41.200
<v Speaker 3>the process is almost 100% about money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

1635
01:09:41.201 --> 01:09:44.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I talked to a guy who was,</v>

1636
01:09:44.151 --> 01:09:46.820
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who jumped in and in the ring to run for</v>

1637
01:09:46.821 --> 01:09:49.160
<v Speaker 3>a seat in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 19th district.</v>

1638
01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:52.490
<v Speaker 3>And he told me he calls up the National</v>
<v Speaker 3>Party and they re they basically had</v>

1639
01:09:52.491 --> 01:09:53.660
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two questions for him.</v>

1640
01:09:53.661 --> 01:09:58.661
<v Speaker 3>Like can you raise $300,000 within the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next three months and can you raise $1</v>

1641
01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:01.350
<v Speaker 3>million by election day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1642
01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.080
<v Speaker 3>that was the whole of the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1643
01:10:03.081 --> 01:10:06.710
<v Speaker 3>and it has to be based on more than</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1644
01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:09.380
<v Speaker 3>more than how much money can you raise</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1645
01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:12.530
<v Speaker 3>we have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has to be another variable for</v>

1646
01:10:12.531 --> 01:10:14.510
<v Speaker 3>picking leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1647
01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:15.860
<v Speaker 3>beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1648
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:18.350
<v Speaker 3>how much cash can you get your hands on</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the next few months?</v>

1649
01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that Rosie O'donnell got in</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble for,</v>

1650
01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raising money under various names and,</v>

1651
01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.870
<v Speaker 1>and donating too much money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Roy,</v>

1652
01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Roy Moore's a opponents and wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1653
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:32.730
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly happened?</v>

1654
01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.760
<v Speaker 1>I read that she had used a website that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she thought should have stopped her from</v>

1655
01:10:38.251 --> 01:10:42.120
<v Speaker 1>donating the extra amount cause it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>being divvied amongst many people and</v>

1656
01:10:42.121 --> 01:10:43.620
<v Speaker 1>that it should have been returned to</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

1657
01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:46.140
<v Speaker 1>which I s I don't know enough about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1658
01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:49.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates are supposed to return extra</v>

1659
01:10:49.741 --> 01:10:52.650
<v Speaker 1>funds once they've crossed over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount that a individual is supposed to</v>

1660
01:10:52.651 --> 01:10:55.290
<v Speaker 1>give.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't happen in this,</v>

1661
01:10:55.291 --> 01:10:57.600
<v Speaker 1>these cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it should have happened.</v>

1662
01:10:57.610 --> 01:10:59.580
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

1663
01:10:59.581 --> 01:11:02.030
<v Speaker 1>she know how much you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>donate isn't there's free.</v>

1664
01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:04.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what she was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's $2,700.</v>

1665
01:11:04.111 --> 01:11:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She used a website and she just gave him</v>

1666
01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:06.930
<v Speaker 1>a shit load of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1667
01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1668
01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:11.370
<v Speaker 1>But I thought she used different names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that part.</v>

1669
01:11:11.371 --> 01:11:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hear about that part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should probably that up.</v>

1670
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>

1671
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:14.160
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

1672
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.360
<v Speaker 3>was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1673
01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:18.900
<v Speaker 3>sort of stories that wasn't followed up</v>
<v Speaker 3>after 2016,</v>

1674
01:11:18.901 --> 01:11:20.910
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one of the things that came out</v>

1675
01:11:20.911 --> 01:11:23.100
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in those hacked dnc,</v>

1676
01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:24.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1677
01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:26.270
<v Speaker 3>things was that there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1678
01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:28.890
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of a scam going on in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1679
01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1680
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:31.350
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you see it,</v>

1681
01:11:31.351 --> 01:11:35.310
<v Speaker 3>the individual donor living donation</v>
<v Speaker 3>limit is pretty small.</v>

1682
01:11:35.311 --> 01:11:37.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like $2,700 for an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a couple,</v>

1683
01:11:37.921 --> 01:11:40.950
<v Speaker 3>it's $5,400.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what they would do is they would host</v>

1684
01:11:40.951 --> 01:11:43.230
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these dinners with celebrities,</v>

1685
01:11:43.231 --> 01:11:44.300
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1686
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:46.170
<v Speaker 3>George Clooney and a bunch of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

1687
01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.060
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1688
01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:52.200
<v Speaker 3>they would raise all this money and</v>
<v Speaker 3>theoretically the money was supposed to</v>

1689
01:11:52.201 --> 01:11:55.800
<v Speaker 3>go only a tiny portion of it to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>presidential campaign and the rest of</v>

1690
01:11:55.801 --> 01:11:58.440
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to go to the regional</v>
<v Speaker 3>parties.</v>

1691
01:11:58.441 --> 01:12:01.950
<v Speaker 3>But what was actually happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to politico anyway,</v>

1692
01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.520
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that the money was basically going</v>

1693
01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:08.010
<v Speaker 3>to the parties and then going</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately back to the presidential</v>

1694
01:12:08.011 --> 01:12:08.880
<v Speaker 3>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1695
01:12:08.881 --> 01:12:09.990
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1696
01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.890
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the people who gave the money</v>

1697
01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.090
<v Speaker 3>didn't even know that that was happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

1698
01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:16.760
<v Speaker 1>they were upset about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1699
01:12:16.761 --> 01:12:17.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1700
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:19.460
<v Speaker 1>but that was a story that wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed up after,</v>

1701
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:21.260
<v Speaker 1>after 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1702
01:12:21.261 --> 01:12:23.420
<v Speaker 1>There's just entirely too much money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1703
01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much money in politics.</v>

1704
01:12:24.891 --> 01:12:26.780
<v Speaker 1>But how would you ever do it without the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money?</v>

1705
01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the money's in,</v>

1706
01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.720
<v Speaker 1>how do you pull it out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you say no,</v>

1707
01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:31.041
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1708
01:12:31.041 --> 01:12:33.890
<v Speaker 1>no more influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more special interest groups.</v>

1709
01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Lobbyists are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1710
01:12:36.471 --> 01:12:37.304
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1711
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:42.320

<v Speaker 1>they should probably have very brief,</v>

1712
01:12:42.321 --> 01:12:45.230
<v Speaker 1>publicly funded elections where</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1755
01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:39.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have feelings one way or another</v>

1756
01:14:39.981 --> 01:14:41.500
<v Speaker 2>about Rosie O'donnell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>

1757
01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.260
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make me outraged terribly.</v>

1758
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:45.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump hates her.</v>

1759
01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:47.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's fascinating about it at all?</v>

1760
01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he,</v>

1761
01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:49.870
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1762
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.500
<v Speaker 2>he got a big bump from talking about her</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the debate and you know,</v>

1763
01:14:53.770 --> 01:14:55.360
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was another thing that he did very</v>

1764
01:14:55.361 --> 01:14:59.770
<v Speaker 2>early on as he clued into the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people hate people hate journalists and</v>

1765
01:14:59.771 --> 01:15:00.850
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood actors.</v>

1766
01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:04.780
<v Speaker 2>And so he made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he made sure as much as possible to talk</v>

1767
01:15:04.781 --> 01:15:05.860
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1768
01:15:05.861 --> 01:15:07.030
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the groups,</v>

1769
01:15:07.031 --> 01:15:08.770
<v Speaker 2>the major food groups of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1770
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:10.780
<v Speaker 2>of hate in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1771
01:15:10.781 --> 01:15:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Like immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton,</v>

1772
01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood actors and reporters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those were the staples of his</v>

1773
01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:18.041
<v Speaker 2>routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1774
01:15:18.041 --> 01:15:19.630
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1775
01:15:19.631 --> 01:15:20.530
<v Speaker 2>it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1776
01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.690
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was smart on his part.</v>

1777
01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think particularly the targeting of</v>

1778
01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:30.931
<v Speaker 2>journalists was brilliant because he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to portray us as the wealthy elite.</v>

1779
01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:32.381
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1780
01:15:32.381 --> 01:15:34.720
<v Speaker 2>he's the billionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1781
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:37.060
<v Speaker 2>but he's pointing the finger at us as</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll look to,</v>

1782
01:15:37.061 --> 01:15:39.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the guardians of,</v>

1783
01:15:39.190 --> 01:15:41.090
<v Speaker 2>of rich America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1784
01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:43.360
<v Speaker 2>which worked and what wasn't brilliant</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1785
01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.633
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1786
01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.040
<v Speaker 2>it's unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1787
01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:51.060
<v Speaker 2>What was the last time any presidential</v>
<v Speaker 2>among maybe Nixon complained about them</v>

1788
01:15:51.161 --> 01:15:53.110
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I believe it was privately.</v>

1789
01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he,</v>

1790
01:15:54.741 --> 01:15:57.310
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hated the press pretty openly.</v>

1791
01:15:57.310 --> 01:16:00.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had that 1962 press conference where</v>

1792
01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:02.170
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't have Nixon to kick around</v>

1793
01:16:02.171 --> 01:16:04.300
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1794
01:16:04.301 --> 01:16:05.740
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1795
01:16:05.741 --> 01:16:10.741
<v Speaker 2>he from all accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was an incredibly profane,</v>

1796
01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:14.620
<v Speaker 2>nasty person in private,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he only talked to a few reporters.</v>

1797
01:16:14.710 --> 01:16:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1798
01:16:16.301 --> 01:16:18.970
<v Speaker 2>I think all politicians hate reporters</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>

1799
01:16:18.971 --> 01:16:20.800
<v Speaker 2>if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1800
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:22.870
<v Speaker 2>there's probably something wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them because,</v>

1801
01:16:22.871 --> 01:16:24.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the press corps in most cases is,</v>

1802
01:16:24.701 --> 01:16:27.130
<v Speaker 2>is really is out to get them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1803
01:16:27.131 --> 01:16:29.650
<v Speaker 2>or at least as dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1804
01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with trump and Nixon,</v>

1805
01:16:32.711 --> 01:16:34.420
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went to a whole new level and,</v>

1806
01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:37.390
<v Speaker 2>and went to a paranoid place and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1807
01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:39.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>

1808
01:16:39.650 --> 01:16:40.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to bore you with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1809
01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:43.990
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whining about being kicked out of</v>

1810
01:16:43.991 --> 01:16:46.620
<v Speaker 2>the White House and not being able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fly with,</v>

1811
01:16:46.621 --> 01:16:50.920
<v Speaker 2>with trump and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the sort of separation between the</v>

1812
01:16:50.921 --> 01:16:53.890
<v Speaker 2>president and the press corps and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact he doesn't show up at the White</v>

1813
01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:56.920
<v Speaker 2>House correspondence dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as a reporter,</v>

1814
01:16:56.921 --> 01:16:58.300
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my response to that is,</v>

1815
01:16:58.301 --> 01:17:00.700
<v Speaker 2>so what we should be on the outside.</v>

1816
01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:01.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1817
01:17:01.601 --> 01:17:02.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1818
01:17:02.501 --> 01:17:05.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't shed a tear about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very strange the response</v>

1819
01:17:05.771 --> 01:17:06.950
<v Speaker 2>in our business that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1820
01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:07.631
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1821
01:17:07.631 --> 01:17:08.260
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>

1822
01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:10.430
<v Speaker 2>we don't get to be hanging around with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president and,</v>

1823
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:11.870
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1824
01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:13.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pal around behind the rope line with</v>

1825
01:17:13.941 --> 01:17:15.270
<v Speaker 2>them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>

1826
01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:18.110
<v Speaker 2>we should be adversarial I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1827
01:17:18.111 --> 01:17:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Well if as long as you're honest and</v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate.</v>

1828
01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1829
01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.033
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you,</v>

1830
01:17:22.050 --> 01:17:24.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even adversarial,</v>

1831
01:17:24.171 --> 01:17:25.770
<v Speaker 2>but not connected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1832
01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:26.620
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1833
01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:28.820
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of a separation of church</v>

1834
01:17:28.821 --> 01:17:31.880
<v Speaker 2>and state thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had an experience when I,</v>

1835
01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:36.530
<v Speaker 2>when I covered the Obama campaign and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Barack Obama as a candidate in</v>

1836
01:17:36.531 --> 01:17:39.320
<v Speaker 2>2008.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really impressed by him.</v>

1837
01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:43.820
<v Speaker 2>But I remember going into the plane the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first time going back into the press</v>

1838
01:17:43.821 --> 01:17:46.610
<v Speaker 2>section and I see that there's photos</v>
<v Speaker 2>all over the walls of the,</v>

1839
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:48.710
<v Speaker 2>of the campaign plane.</v>

1840
01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:54.040
<v Speaker 2>And apparently there's a tradition where</v>
<v Speaker 2>each of the reporters had like a little</v>

1841
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:57.590
<v Speaker 2>sort of high school yearbook photo taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the candidate where,</v>

1842
01:17:57.591 --> 01:18:00.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got their arm around a Obama and</v>

1843
01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:03.050
<v Speaker 2>they're posing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a tradition to kind of put</v>

1844
01:18:03.051 --> 01:18:05.960
<v Speaker 2>the photo up on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1845
01:18:05.961 --> 01:18:07.360
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1846
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:09.680
<v Speaker 2>this is not a good look for the press</v>
<v Speaker 2>corps.</v>

1847
01:18:09.681 --> 01:18:14.540
<v Speaker 2>Even if you like the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to at least pretend to have a</v>

1848
01:18:14.541 --> 01:18:16.580
<v Speaker 2>little bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mode is supposed to be there.</v>

1849
01:18:16.581 --> 01:18:17.410
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>

1850
01:18:17.410 --> 01:18:20.230
<v Speaker 2>this is certainly influential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1851
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Certainly going to have some sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence on you.</v>

1852
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:23.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1853
01:18:23.361 --> 01:18:25.910
<v Speaker 2>It's just a bad look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what happens if you do a story</v>

1854
01:18:25.911 --> 01:18:28.430
<v Speaker 2>about the guy that's complimentary and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes out that,</v>

1855
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:29.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1856
01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:32.330
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've put a picture of yourself with</v>

1857
01:18:32.331 --> 01:18:33.320
<v Speaker 2>your arm around the guy.</v>

1858
01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.330
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1859
01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.850
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reporters are kind of supposed to be</v>

1860
01:18:37.851 --> 01:18:40.850
<v Speaker 2>these unpleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1861
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of grumpy people who instantly</v>

1862
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:47.390
<v Speaker 2>deface the posters of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1863
01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:48.710
<v Speaker 2>powerful people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1864
01:18:48.711 --> 01:18:49.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1865
01:18:49.311 --> 01:18:52.640
<v Speaker 2>whenever they get a chance and throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>darts at pictures of them and stuff like</v>

1866
01:18:52.641 --> 01:18:53.240
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1867
01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:57.770
<v Speaker 2>that's who they kind of used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see there's people that are</v>

1868
01:18:57.771 --> 01:19:01.010
<v Speaker 2>jockeying for position to potentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>run in.</v>

1869
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:02.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next election,</v>

1870
01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:07.520
<v Speaker 2>obviously the 2018 elections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in 2020 for president,</v>

1871
01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.680
<v Speaker 2>he seen people that are moving into</v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

1872
01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:13.040
<v Speaker 2>You see these congressional candidates</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are showing promise.</v>

1873
01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the,</v>

1874
01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:15.650
<v Speaker 2>when you're covering this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

1875
01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:18.170
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the feeling of like the future</v>

1876
01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:22.010
<v Speaker 2>from these races?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1877
01:19:22.011 --> 01:19:24.480
<v Speaker 2>what is it from the standpoint of</v>
<v Speaker 2>reporters like when like,</v>

1878
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:26.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well first,</v>

1879
01:19:26.121 --> 01:19:27.370
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1880
01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:32.380
<v Speaker 2>the holy grail of reporting is to latch</v>
<v Speaker 2>onto a politician before they become</v>

1881
01:19:33.171 --> 01:19:36.830
<v Speaker 2>famous and before they become president</v>
<v Speaker 2>and follow them all the way.</v>

1882
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:41.270
<v Speaker 2>And that way you get to be the insider</v>
<v Speaker 2>who gets invited into the Oval Office.</v>

1883
01:19:41.271 --> 01:19:43.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1884
01:19:43.161 --> 01:19:46.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big thing that a lot of reporters</v>

1885
01:19:46.041 --> 01:19:51.041
<v Speaker 2>kind of dream of his to his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to latch on early to somebody like Bill</v>

1886
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.881
<v Speaker 2>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1887
01:19:52.881 --> 01:19:57.080
<v Speaker 2>and become the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of favored reporter on that</v>

1888
01:19:57.081 --> 01:19:58.640
<v Speaker 2>beat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1889
01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:01.970
<v Speaker 2>that's why at the outset of presidential</v>
<v Speaker 2>elections,</v>

1890
01:20:01.971 --> 01:20:05.450
<v Speaker 2>you'll often see a lot of jockeying</v>
<v Speaker 2>within newsrooms to see who gets to</v>

1891
01:20:05.451 --> 01:20:07.250
<v Speaker 2>cover which campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

1892
01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people always want to pick the winner</v>

1893
01:20:09.811 --> 01:20:12.790
<v Speaker 2>because they think they're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>a book deal out of it at the end and</v>

1894
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:16.320
<v Speaker 2>you're going to end up having their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>show on MSNBC or whatever.</v>

1895
01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:18.450
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1896
01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.720
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the w w what's the feeling right</v>

1897
01:20:21.721 --> 01:20:24.270
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who are people coalescing around?</v>

1898
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what you're asking that too?</v>

1899
01:20:27.601 --> 01:20:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1900
01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1901
01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:33.660
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the expectation is that some of the same</v>

1902
01:20:33.661 --> 01:20:35.250
<v Speaker 2>people are going to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

1903
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:38.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of belief that Bernie's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to run again.</v>

1904
01:20:38.281 --> 01:20:40.530
<v Speaker 2>But then there's also a Kamala Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1905
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:42.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cory booker.</v>

1906
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1907
01:20:43.921 --> 01:20:45.390
<v Speaker 2>people believe that those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1908
01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.420
<v Speaker 2>those folks are gonna run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1909
01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:49.660
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1910
01:20:49.661 --> 01:20:51.090
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oddly enough,</v>

1911
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:55.950
<v Speaker 2>the press corps is less focused on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>than they would be normally.</v>

1912
01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're the only story that</v>

1913
01:20:58.981 --> 01:21:02.400
<v Speaker 2>matters to political reporters right now</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the Russia gate trump thing.</v>

1914
01:21:02.401 --> 01:21:06.090
<v Speaker 2>And they're following that and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping that will be some,</v>

1915
01:21:06.150 --> 01:21:08.280
<v Speaker 2>the thing that happens instead of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

1916
01:21:08.281 --> 01:21:09.660
<v Speaker 2>20 election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1917
01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:12.720
<v Speaker 2>that they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big,</v>

1918
01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:16.920
<v Speaker 2>the big sort of trial of Donald Trump is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what everybody's kind of waiting for.</v>

1919
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:19.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the recent take on that is that there is</v>

1920
01:21:19.411 --> 01:21:22.290
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a connection between</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian oligarchs and Michael Cohen.</v>

1921
01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something that he moved the Vec</v>

1922
01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Vekselberg uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>payment.</v>

1923
01:21:27.730 --> 01:21:31.830
<v Speaker 2>I just heard about that this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can't say that I know a whole lot</v>

1924
01:21:31.831 --> 01:21:33.510
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1925
01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:35.790
<v Speaker 2>what would that payment before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When was it?</v>

1926
01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:37.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was allegedly after the elections,</v>

1927
01:21:37.951 --> 01:21:40.200
<v Speaker 2>so that would be a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1928
01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.073
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1929
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:44.310
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten a lot of criticism because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had been a little bit of a skeptic on</v>

1930
01:21:44.311 --> 01:21:46.050
<v Speaker 2>the Russia Gate Front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1931
01:21:46.170 --> 01:21:49.050
<v Speaker 2>not so much that I don't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just kind of think the press</v>

1932
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:51.160
<v Speaker 2>should be a little careful about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1933
01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.700
<v Speaker 2>but if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1934
01:21:53.701 --> 01:21:54.690
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big story.</v>

1935
01:21:54.691 --> 01:21:56.730
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Cohen really was in Prague,</v>

1936
01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.650
<v Speaker 2>that's also a really big story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1937
01:21:58.710 --> 01:22:00.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll have to see what those,</v>

1938
01:22:00.331 --> 01:22:01.830
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what really comes out of that.</v>

1939
01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:05.790
<v Speaker 2>It's just such an unusual moment in</v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

1940
01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1941
01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:08.640
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1942
01:22:08.670 --> 01:22:10.220
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1943
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:15.420
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as unstable as American history's been</v>

1944
01:22:15.421 --> 01:22:16.770
<v Speaker 2>in our lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly.</v>

1945
01:22:16.771 --> 01:22:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think,</v>

1946
01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:19.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he ever,</v>

1947
01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:20.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or close to it.</v>

1948
01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:22.590
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The civil war on,</v>

1949
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:23.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1950
01:22:23.671 --> 01:22:28.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you add in the fact that we've had</v>

1951
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:32.370
<v Speaker 2>concerns about nuclear conflict with two</v>
<v Speaker 2>different nations,</v>

1952
01:22:32.371 --> 01:22:33.031
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And since,</v>

1953
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.190
<v Speaker 2>since trump has been elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

1954
01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:39.600
<v Speaker 2>there's the North Korea thing and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the fact that we've had military</v>

1955
01:22:39.601 --> 01:22:42.620
<v Speaker 2>exchanges where Russian mercenaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1956
01:22:42.710 --> 01:22:44.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reportedly have died.</v>

1957
01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1958
01:22:46.401 --> 01:22:49.470
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's certainly unnerving.</v>

1959
01:22:49.471 --> 01:22:50.041
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1960
01:22:50.041 --> 01:22:51.990
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nuclear clock,</v>

1961
01:22:51.991 --> 01:22:54.360
<v Speaker 2>which was established,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the doomsday clock,</v>

1962
01:22:54.361 --> 01:22:56.250
<v Speaker 2>which was established way back in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fifties,</v>

1963
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:58.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has us at the,</v>

1964
01:22:58.510 --> 01:23:03.270
<v Speaker 2>the most dangerous points since 1953.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm merely,</v>

1965
01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:03.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1966
01:23:03.930 --> 01:23:05.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1967
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:06.463
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a,</v>

1968
01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:10.440
<v Speaker 2>at a time in their estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what the,</v>

1969
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:12.250
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the organization is actually called,</v>

1970
01:23:12.251 --> 01:23:13.780
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1971
01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:16.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's physicians for social</v>

1972
01:23:16.331 --> 01:23:17.200
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

1973
01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1974
01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:20.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1975
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:23.210
<v Speaker 2>this right now is more dangerous than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1976
01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:26.020
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the k seven shooting the Cuban missile</v>

1977
01:23:26.021 --> 01:23:26.920
<v Speaker 2>crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1978
01:23:26.921 --> 01:23:30.010
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're at a a moment that's incredibly</v>

1979
01:23:30.011 --> 01:23:33.760
<v Speaker 2>tense between these two countries and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more so than the Cuban missile crisis in</v>

1980
01:23:33.761 --> 01:23:35.050
<v Speaker 2>their estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1981
01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Who's estimating this there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the doomsday clock.</v>

1982
01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:42.450
<v Speaker 2>You can find it as a metric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the,</v>

1983
01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:43.930
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1984
01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I guess they're just reading the news</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everybody else,</v>

1985
01:23:46.091 --> 01:23:47.170
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1986
01:23:47.290 --> 01:23:48.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1987
01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:50.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know it,</v>

1988
01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:53.680
<v Speaker 2>it's off derided by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1989
01:23:53.681 --> 01:23:57.010
<v Speaker 2>by people in Washington has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington as being too hysterical.</v>

1990
01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1991
01:23:58.961 --> 01:23:59.410
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1992
01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:01.330
<v Speaker 2>it is an indicator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1993
01:24:01.331 --> 01:24:02.830
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1994
01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:04.820
<v Speaker 2>the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1995
01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.100
<v Speaker 2>who do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1996
01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:10.300
<v Speaker 2>I think are the same people who want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>win Nobel prize last year for,</v>

1997
01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of anti nuclear,</v>

1998
01:24:13.190 --> 01:24:14.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1999
01:24:14.161 --> 01:24:15.950
<v Speaker 2>the UN ban,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2000
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.290
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on nuclear weapons.</v>

2001
01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:21.670
<v Speaker 2>So [inaudible] nine 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to have a terrorist threat</v>

2002
01:24:21.671 --> 01:24:22.840
<v Speaker 2>colors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2003
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert Mueller was on the board,</v>

2004
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:26.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2005
01:24:26.551 --> 01:24:31.551
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day they used to have a meeting of</v>

2006
01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:36.130
<v Speaker 2>a group of people in the various</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence agencies to decide what the</v>

2007
01:24:36.131 --> 01:24:38.320
<v Speaker 2>color would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2008
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:40.150
<v Speaker 2>as a yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2009
01:24:40.151 --> 01:24:40.951
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>

2010
01:24:40.951 --> 01:24:44.650
<v Speaker 2>what's fascinating about this tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only heard about this cause I wrote</v>

2011
01:24:44.651 --> 01:24:49.651
<v Speaker 2>about this a few months ago and I made a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake by saying that it,</v>

2012
01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2013
01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:55.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the color used to toggle between red,</v>

2014
01:24:55.031 --> 01:24:58.090
<v Speaker 2>which was the highest and green,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the lowest,</v>

2015
01:24:58.091 --> 01:25:00.280
<v Speaker 2>but apparently not once in its entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

2016
01:25:00.281 --> 01:25:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Was it ever green?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>

2017
01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.690
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never had threat level low,</v>

2018
01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:07.510
<v Speaker 2>even won a once in its history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were,</v>

2019
01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:09.850
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were always at some level of anxiety.</v>

2020
01:25:09.851 --> 01:25:11.920
<v Speaker 2>But those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are weird times to remember that</v>

2021
01:25:11.921 --> 01:25:14.470
<v Speaker 2>when they used to kind of tell us how</v>
<v Speaker 2>scared we were supposed to be about</v>

2022
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:15.640
<v Speaker 2>about stuff.</v>

2023
01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:20.110
<v Speaker 2>And with a real simple distinction like</v>
<v Speaker 2>colors,</v>

2024
01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2025
01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Today's orange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2026
01:25:22.631 --> 01:25:24.160
<v Speaker 2>It's orange dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be careful.</v>

2027
01:25:24.161 --> 01:25:26.140
<v Speaker 2>You're going to fly today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's more,</v>

2028
01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.030
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to go to an airport today?</v>

2029
01:25:28.450 --> 01:25:30.370
<v Speaker 2>It's orange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to the superbowl.</v>

2030
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Today's orange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2031
01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:34.300

<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2032
01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:37.560
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had to have a,</v>

2033
01:25:37.570 --> 01:25:39.670
<v Speaker 2>and then they just stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2034
01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

2035
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:41.560
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the program,</v>

2036
01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took a huge hit when,</v>

2037
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:47.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys who was involved who was</v>

2038
01:25:47.891 --> 01:25:52.720
<v Speaker 2>the former head of homeland security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not mistaken,</v>

2039
01:25:53.650 --> 01:25:58.650
<v Speaker 2>came out with a story that he had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>told by some of the Bush people to Jack</v>

2040
01:25:59.291 --> 01:26:01.660
<v Speaker 2>up the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2041
01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:06.720
<v Speaker 2>the color in advance of an election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2042
01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.780
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2043
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:13.010
<v Speaker 2>it was shortly after that story came out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they discontinued the program.</v>

2044
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it came out in the book by,</v>

2045
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:17.570
<v Speaker 2>by the former head of the homeland</v>
<v Speaker 2>security,</v>

2046
01:26:17.710 --> 01:26:21.220
<v Speaker 2>right before an election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were told time to go orange.</v>

2047
01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2048
01:26:22.230 --> 01:26:22.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2049
01:26:22.941 --> 01:26:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Because they wanted to build up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2050
01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was this,</v>

2051
01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.420
<v Speaker 2>you get people scared and they'll vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote a certain way.</v>

2052
01:26:29.421 --> 01:26:31.010
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2053
01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:33.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing Times though.</v>

2054
01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:34.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2055
01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:37.780
<v Speaker 1>As a journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you look at these times and say,</v>

2056
01:26:37.781 --> 01:26:39.910
<v Speaker 1>this is great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is great for business,</v>

2057
01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:44.050
<v Speaker 1>or do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you more so look at it as a human</v>

2058
01:26:44.051 --> 01:26:46.810
<v Speaker 1>being and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just a fucking mess.</v>

2059
01:26:46.811 --> 01:26:50.160
<v Speaker 1>And I wish we weren't so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

2060
01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:53.030
<v Speaker 2>when I first started covering the trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign,</v>

2061
01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:56.390
<v Speaker 2>I thought this is the most awesome thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever because,</v>

2062
01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:58.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2063
01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.510
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dynamic I was talking about before</v>

2064
01:27:00.511 --> 01:27:02.450
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about reporters wanting to be on the</v>

2065
01:27:02.451 --> 01:27:04.430
<v Speaker 2>ground floor with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the future winner.</v>

2066
01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody wanted to be on the trump</v>

2067
01:27:06.681 --> 01:27:08.900
<v Speaker 2>campaign because nobody thought he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to win.</v>

2068
01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I was stoked to the assigned to cover</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump because I thought this is the most</v>

2069
01:27:14.751 --> 01:27:16.490
<v Speaker 2>insane thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

2070
01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:17.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can fit your style of</v>

2071
01:27:17.991 --> 01:27:18.771
<v Speaker 2>journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2072
01:27:18.771 --> 01:27:20.180
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought this is,</v>

2073
01:27:20.210 --> 01:27:24.020
<v Speaker 2>this is the black comedy that I was then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sort of born to cover and born,</v>

2074
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:26.690
<v Speaker 2>born to write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for the first,</v>

2075
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:29.420
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five or six things that I wrote about</v>

2076
01:27:29.421 --> 01:27:29.750
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2077
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:31.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about trump,</v>

2078
01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was the most amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>

2079
01:27:33.891 --> 01:27:36.020
<v Speaker 2>interesting story of my lifetime.</v>

2080
01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:39.050
<v Speaker 2>And then it took this incredibly dark</v>
<v Speaker 2>term where he actually won.</v>

2081
01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.210
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2082
01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:44.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a dark term for him too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2083
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:46.420
<v Speaker 2>There's no question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

2084
01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:49.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean I knew some of the people in his</v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign,</v>

2085
01:27:50.410 --> 01:27:52.460
<v Speaker 2>I can't say this definitively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2086
01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:55.820
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a very good educated guests that</v>

2087
01:27:55.821 --> 01:27:59.420
<v Speaker 2>they had absolutely no expectation of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever even been close,</v>

2088
01:27:59.421 --> 01:28:03.440
<v Speaker 2>let alone winning and that and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2089
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:08.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they did this as a publicity stunt</v>

2090
01:28:08.211 --> 01:28:11.390
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably with the aim of either creating</v>

2091
01:28:11.391 --> 01:28:16.391
<v Speaker 2>a media network or just bolstering</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's overall q rating or whatever it</v>

2092
01:28:16.761 --> 01:28:17.594
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

2093
01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:22.960
<v Speaker 1>NBC might've pushed him towards the</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidency by firing him from the</v>

2094
01:28:22.961 --> 01:28:23.620
<v Speaker 1>apprentice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2095
01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:25.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he was still the host of that</v>

2096
01:28:25.961 --> 01:28:28.720
<v Speaker 1>fucking show while he was running for</v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

2097
01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:32.140
<v Speaker 1>They fire him and then arnold takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

2098
01:28:32.141 --> 01:28:36.250
<v Speaker 1>People forgot already and Arnold</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schwartzenegger with for a very short</v>

2099
01:28:36.251 --> 01:28:37.740
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fired.</v>

2100
01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:40.540
<v Speaker 1>You're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fired.</v>

2101
01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.250
<v Speaker 1>He was the guy for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:28:42.251 --> 01:28:43.660
<v Speaker 1>They had that flame war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember?</v>

2103
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really weird.</v>

2104
01:28:45.431 --> 01:28:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking strange.</v>

2105
01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:50.740
<v Speaker 1>But NBC might have given him the final,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2106
01:28:50.741 --> 01:28:53.420
<v Speaker 1>you might have taken an extra diet pill</v>
<v Speaker 1>that day and went,</v>

2107
01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.630
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going all in the wall.</v>

2108
01:28:55.631 --> 01:28:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Got 10 feet higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Swartz.</v>

2109
01:28:59.910 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Bigger says he's done with apprentice</v>
<v Speaker 1>blames</v>

2110
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.500
<v Speaker 2>poor ratings on trump involvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2111
01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:06.870
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2112
01:29:06.871 --> 01:29:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had that whole back and forth over</v>

2113
01:29:08.491 --> 01:29:10.900
<v Speaker 2>who was to blame for the ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2114
01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:14.550
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a host of that show,</v>

2115
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump was crate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2116
01:29:16.770 --> 01:29:18.540
<v Speaker 2>he's the perfect guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole statue.</v>

2117
01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Arnold's too nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the right guy.</v>

2118
01:29:21.571 --> 01:29:23.330
<v Speaker 2>He's not a billionaire asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2119
01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:26.880
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need a total jackass and,</v>

2120
01:29:26.881 --> 01:29:29.010
<v Speaker 2>and get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those guys,</v>

2121
01:29:29.011 --> 01:29:30.780
<v Speaker 2>you need one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got fired.</v>

2122
01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:32.160
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2123
01:29:32.161 --> 01:29:36.510
<v Speaker 2>the same thing that made trump perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that show made him perfect as the</v>

2124
01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:41.340
<v Speaker 2>main protagonist in campaign coverage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is actually really just a really</v>

2125
01:29:41.341 --> 01:29:45.270
<v Speaker 2>long super boring reality show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least it used to be until trump</v>

2126
01:29:45.271 --> 01:29:46.620
<v Speaker 2>came along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2127
01:29:46.621 --> 01:29:48.750
<v Speaker 2>trump completely changed the dynamic of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2128
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:49.783
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

2129
01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:52.350
<v Speaker 2>if you're thinking of it in terms of how</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks to a network,</v>

2130
01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:54.990
<v Speaker 2>what were the networks thinking before?</v>

2131
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:56.730
<v Speaker 2>If they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they were going to have people like</v>

2132
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Scott Walker and Lindsey Graham be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stars of,</v>

2133
01:29:59.821 --> 01:30:01.890
<v Speaker 2>of their lead reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2134
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:04.980
<v Speaker 2>let's get a real performer in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2135
01:30:04.981 --> 01:30:06.300
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when they did,</v>

2136
01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:07.530
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2137
01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.890
<v Speaker 2>when trump entered the fray and became a</v>
<v Speaker 2>real candidate and started getting</v>

2138
01:30:10.891 --> 01:30:14.650
<v Speaker 2>votes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly news started making money and</v>

2139
01:30:14.651 --> 01:30:17.160
<v Speaker 2>like for like real money for the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2140
01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:20.490
<v Speaker 2>And there a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an amazing data point right now,</v>

2141
01:30:20.491 --> 01:30:24.780
<v Speaker 2>which is that the public trusts the</v>
<v Speaker 2>press less than ever,</v>

2142
01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:27.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They believe the things that we say less</v>

2143
01:30:27.001 --> 01:30:28.530
<v Speaker 2>than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the polls show this,</v>

2144
01:30:28.531 --> 01:30:32.550
<v Speaker 2>that there's been a dramatic downturn</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how much people will put stock in</v>

2145
01:30:32.551 --> 01:30:34.680
<v Speaker 2>and things that people like me say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2146
01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:37.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're watching television,</v>

2147
01:30:38.250 --> 01:30:40.710
<v Speaker 2>television news more than they ever have</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a lot.</v>

2148
01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.200
<v Speaker 2>So what are those two data points say</v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

2149
01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:46.260
<v Speaker 2>put together that people are consuming</v>
<v Speaker 2>news not as news,</v>

2150
01:30:46.261 --> 01:30:47.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's entertainment there.</v>

2151
01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.950
<v Speaker 2>There,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are watching it more,</v>

2152
01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:51.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>

2153
01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:53.040
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2154
01:30:53.190 --> 01:30:56.070
<v Speaker 2>CNN made over $1 billion last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just eating into the</v>

2155
01:30:56.071 --> 01:30:57.360
<v Speaker 2>entertainment budget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2156
01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:59.610
<v Speaker 2>that's all they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's all trump.</v>

2157
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:00.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2158
01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:04.020
<v Speaker 2>is fascinating and kind of horrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2159
01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:06.990
<v Speaker 2>but really interesting too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that also what he played upon when</v>

2160
01:31:06.991 --> 01:31:09.240
<v Speaker 2>he was running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he would say outrageous shit.</v>

2161
01:31:09.241 --> 01:31:11.310
<v Speaker 2>So they would cover him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that essentially gave him free</v>

2162
01:31:11.311 --> 01:31:12.150
<v Speaker 2>press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2163
01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:13.440
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2164
01:31:13.441 --> 01:31:15.630
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no doubt in my mind that,</v>

2165
01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:20.660
<v Speaker 2>that he was doing that intentionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember watching him and I'm in New</v>

2166
01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Hampshire where he's giving a speech and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably remember this,</v>

2167
01:31:26.211 --> 01:31:28.630
<v Speaker 2>this woman stood up and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ted Cruz,</v>

2168
01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:29.940
<v Speaker 2>the pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

2169
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:31.720
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2170
01:31:32.850 --> 01:31:36.450
<v Speaker 2>and trump looks over at her and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2171
01:31:36.451 --> 01:31:37.650
<v Speaker 2>that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's terrible.</v>

2172
01:31:37.651 --> 01:31:39.480
<v Speaker 2>She just had a terrible thing about Ted</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cruz.</v>

2173
01:31:39.481 --> 01:31:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2174
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:43.860
<v Speaker 2>And I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember him looking over at the,</v>

2175
01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.720
<v Speaker 2>at the rise of where all the cameras</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2176
01:31:46.050 --> 01:31:50.370
<v Speaker 2>and you could see him thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's thinking it's a story for six</v>

2177
01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:51.590
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she says it,</v>

2178
01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:53.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a story for three days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I say it.</v>

2179
01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:54.853
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2180
01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.340
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks,</v>

2181
01:31:56.341 --> 01:31:59.490
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just said that Ted Cruz is a pussy a</v>

2182
01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:00.610
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And next thing you know,</v>

2183
01:32:00.611 --> 01:32:02.330
<v Speaker 2>it like completely dominated the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2184
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.630
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he comes,</v>

2185
01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:07.840
<v Speaker 2>he understood the dynamic of how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>news works better than,</v>

2186
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:10.210
<v Speaker 2>than even the people in the news</v>
<v Speaker 2>understood it.</v>

2187
01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly better than Ted Cruz,</v>

2188
01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:14.020
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted Cruz,</v>

2189
01:32:14.021 --> 01:32:18.700
<v Speaker 2>that the recent praise of trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they go back to like what he</v>

2190
01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:20.750
<v Speaker 2>said during the campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2191
01:32:21.650 --> 01:32:24.490
<v Speaker 2>It's no one should ever listen to him</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever again about anything.</v>

2192
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2193
01:32:25.511 --> 01:32:26.340
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2194
01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:27.430
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious.</v>

2195
01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Ted Cruz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2196
01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:32.590
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my favorite part of that whole campaign</v>

2197
01:32:32.591 --> 01:32:35.410
<v Speaker 2>was the thing that he couldn't shake</v>
<v Speaker 2>about being the Zodiac killer.</v>

2198
01:32:35.411 --> 01:32:36.790
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2199
01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:40.420
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and reporters would give him shit about</v>

2200
01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:41.254
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2201
01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.170
<v Speaker 2>like we would talk amongst each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2202
01:32:44.171 --> 01:32:45.550
<v Speaker 2>who's going to ask him about it the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next,</v>

2203
01:32:45.551 --> 01:32:46.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2204
01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:46.930
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2205
01:32:47.050 --> 01:32:49.600
<v Speaker 2>and everybody knew that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was bullshit.</v>

2206
01:32:49.601 --> 01:32:51.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was born after the killing</v>

2207
01:32:51.261 --> 01:32:52.810
<v Speaker 2>started and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

2208
01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:55.240
<v Speaker 2>But somebody would always make it a</v>
<v Speaker 2>point to say,</v>

2209
01:32:55.241 --> 01:32:57.040
<v Speaker 2>so what do you think about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2210
01:32:57.041 --> 01:32:59.860
<v Speaker 2>the rumors about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could see that it just,</v>

2211
01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:02.410
<v Speaker 2>it completely drove him to distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know how to,</v>

2212
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:04.660
<v Speaker 2>how to make a joke out of it or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2213
01:33:04.810 --> 01:33:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're a hunter s thompson fancy.</v>

2214
01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:09.400
<v Speaker 2>You were probably aware of what a hunter</v>
<v Speaker 2>did to Ed Muskie.</v>

2215
01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The IBOGAINE.</v>

2216
01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2217
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.820
<v Speaker 2>He went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally went crazy.</v>

2218
01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.033
<v Speaker 2>A hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2219
01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:20.590
<v Speaker 2>what was it on the Dick Cavett show that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talked about it?</v>

2220
01:33:20.591 --> 01:33:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a rumor he had,</v>

2221
01:33:23.591 --> 01:33:25.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken Ibogaine and,</v>

2222
01:33:25.301 --> 01:33:27.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew about that rumor because I</v>

2223
01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:27.934
<v Speaker 2>started it.</v>

2224
01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.440
<v Speaker 2>He drove that guy crazy to the point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you see,</v>

2225
01:33:35.441 --> 01:33:38.830
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in New Hampshire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was giving a political campaign</v>

2226
01:33:38.831 --> 01:33:40.580
<v Speaker 2>speech and he broke down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2227
01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:41.453
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He cried.</v>

2228
01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he,</v>

2229
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.730
<v Speaker 2>so hundreds of this great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2230
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:48.310
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote about it.</v>

2231
01:33:48.630 --> 01:33:50.410
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of a spoof of campaign</v>

2232
01:33:50.411 --> 01:33:52.600
<v Speaker 2>coverage because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2233
01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:54.730
<v Speaker 2>he did this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2234
01:33:55.090 --> 01:33:58.540
<v Speaker 2>campaign diary and then he just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>went into this dead Pan,</v>

2235
01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:04.080
<v Speaker 2>a recitation of what sounded like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking news story about him</v>

2236
01:34:04.691 --> 01:34:06.390
<v Speaker 2>discovering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2237
01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:10.250
<v Speaker 2>muskies secret relationship with a witch</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor who was providing him with it</v>

2238
01:34:10.251 --> 01:34:11.050
<v Speaker 2>will gain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2239
01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:11.690
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then he,</v>

2240
01:34:11.690 --> 01:34:16.270
<v Speaker 2>he dug up some file photo of Musky that</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like this.</v>

2241
01:34:16.271 --> 01:34:19.590
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

2242
01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:20.940
<v Speaker 2>they put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2243
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:23.320
<v Speaker 2>must ed Musky in the grips of an Igbo</v>
<v Speaker 2>gain.</v>

2244
01:34:23.321 --> 01:34:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Frenzy was the caption and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was completely dead pan.</v>

2245
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:28.960
<v Speaker 2>He never said he was kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen that.</v>

2246
01:34:28.961 --> 01:34:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Never said it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2247
01:34:30.101 --> 01:34:34.660
<v Speaker 2>not like that was fiction and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Musky couldn't handle it.</v>

2248
01:34:34.661 --> 01:34:38.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was probably the first real</v>

2249
01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:40.510
<v Speaker 2>political trolling that went on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2250
01:34:40.511 --> 01:34:42.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a brilliant one too,</v>

2251
01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:45.130
<v Speaker 2>because I began,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even in that kind of a drug.</v>

2252
01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.320
<v Speaker 2>It's a drug that helps people get off</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

2253
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:49.570
<v Speaker 2>oddly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Illegal,</v>

2254
01:34:49.571 --> 01:34:50.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2255
01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:51.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In America,</v>

2256
01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:53.320
<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's legal in a lot of places,</v>

2257
01:34:53.321 --> 01:34:55.570
<v Speaker 2>but it's really great for people getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>off opiates.</v>

2258
01:34:55.630 --> 01:34:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's it just a ferociously introspective</v>

2259
01:34:58.821 --> 01:35:03.410
<v Speaker 2>drug that rewires the way your brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>deals with addictions.</v>

2260
01:35:03.411 --> 01:35:08.090
<v Speaker 2>It literally rewires the connections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alleviates addictions on a physical and</v>

2261
01:35:08.091 --> 01:35:09.860
<v Speaker 2>psychological level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>

2262
01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:13.640
<v Speaker 2>what does it feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2263
01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:15.410
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done it on that one.</v>

2264
01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:18.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know quite a few people that have,</v>

2265
01:35:18.111 --> 01:35:23.111
<v Speaker 2>that have had pill problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have gone to Mexico and taking my friend</v>

2266
01:35:23.421 --> 01:35:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Ed Clay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has an actual center down there now,</v>

2267
01:35:26.630 --> 01:35:28.650
<v Speaker 2>he started it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2268
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:30.530
<v Speaker 2>after he had gone down there for</v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment,</v>

2269
01:35:30.531 --> 01:35:32.030
<v Speaker 2>he had a back injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was,</v>

2270
01:35:32.031 --> 01:35:34.340
<v Speaker 2>and got hooked on pills and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

2271
01:35:34.341 --> 01:35:37.460
<v Speaker 2>I got to figure out a way to get off</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fucking things and did Ibogaine</v>

2272
01:35:37.461 --> 01:35:38.960
<v Speaker 2>and then cleared it right up.</v>

2273
01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You realize like,</v>

2274
01:35:40.221 --> 01:35:41.780
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is,</v>

2275
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:43.580
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is illegal.</v>

2276
01:35:43.890 --> 01:35:48.890
<v Speaker 2>So the one drug that hunter chose was</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a drug that gets people off</v>

2277
01:35:49.431 --> 01:35:51.230
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just even more ironic.</v>

2278
01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.700
<v Speaker 2>It just had a great name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2279
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And doctor,</v>

2280
01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking awesome.</v>

2281
01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:01.160
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really was the original political</v>

2282
01:36:01.161 --> 01:36:02.100
<v Speaker 2>troll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2283
01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it might have had a giant effect in</v>

2284
01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:05.900
<v Speaker 2>the election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably did.</v>

2285
01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2286
01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think it was an accident</v>

2287
01:36:11.481 --> 01:36:15.890
<v Speaker 2>that</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunter's coverage was,</v>

2288
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:16.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2289
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:20.150
<v Speaker 2>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he chose that year to do these diaries.</v>

2290
01:36:20.151 --> 01:36:22.970
<v Speaker 2>And I remember my father telling me</v>
<v Speaker 2>about however report or would,</v>

2291
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.910
<v Speaker 2>would wait for rolling stone to come out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that week so they could,</v>

2292
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:28.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read the coverage of the election.</v>

2293
01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:30.280
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2294
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:32.270
<v Speaker 2>hunter kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2295
01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:36.140
<v Speaker 2>took this unknown unknown senator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2296
01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:38.720
<v Speaker 2>from the Dakotas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Mcgovern and made them into this,</v>

2297
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:42.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this like Christ figure</v>

2298
01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:43.543
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

2299
01:36:43.690 --> 01:36:45.980
<v Speaker 2>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that mcgovern would have</v>

2300
01:36:45.981 --> 01:36:49.310
<v Speaker 2>won the nomination without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without that sort of relentless hyping</v>

2301
01:36:49.311 --> 01:36:52.220
<v Speaker 2>that he gave him because it probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have won the presidency if it</v>

2302
01:36:52.221 --> 01:36:54.900
<v Speaker 2>wasn't for the vice president having</v>
<v Speaker 2>that issue with,</v>

2303
01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:58.040
<v Speaker 2>he had gone through electroshock</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>

2304
01:36:58.041 --> 01:36:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Eagleton right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2305
01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:00.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2306
01:37:00.891 --> 01:37:02.570
<v Speaker 2>That was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was terrible.</v>

2307
01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:03.770
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2308
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:05.130
<v Speaker 2>but fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2309
01:37:05.250 --> 01:37:07.640
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to write the introduction to the,</v>

2310
01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:09.860
<v Speaker 2>to the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2311
01:37:10.190 --> 01:37:11.990
<v Speaker 2>last version of that book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2312
01:37:11.991 --> 01:37:13.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of my favorite books of all</v>

2313
01:37:13.941 --> 01:37:15.440
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great fucking book.</v>

2314
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2315
01:37:16.311 --> 01:37:20.030
<v Speaker 2>it's just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a crazy economic ethic,</v>

2316
01:37:20.031 --> 01:37:23.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a big influence of yours.</v>

2317
01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2318
01:37:24.490 --> 01:37:25.323
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2319
01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:29.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely I think the,</v>

2320
01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:33.050
<v Speaker 2>the great thing of a Hunter Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2321
01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:35.060
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

2322
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:39.890
<v Speaker 2>he was so incredibly funny in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was completely rare.</v>

2323
01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:40.271
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2324
01:37:40.271 --> 01:37:45.271
<v Speaker 2>you can't just trained to be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You either are born with that ability,</v>

2325
01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:47.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>verbally or not.</v>

2326
01:37:47.961 --> 01:37:52.160
<v Speaker 2>And he just had this completely strange</v>
<v Speaker 2>four dimensional way of looking at</v>

2327
01:37:52.161 --> 01:37:52.994
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2328
01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2329
01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:58.770
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would a completely boring a campaign</v>

2330
01:37:58.771 --> 01:38:02.700
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he got done writing it up,</v>

2331
01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:04.800
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2332
01:38:04.801 --> 01:38:05.634
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2333
01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:08.430
<v Speaker 2>a psychedelic wrestling match or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2334
01:38:08.431 --> 01:38:09.264
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2335
01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:12.420
<v Speaker 2>it was so much more interesting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre and weird,</v>

2336
01:38:12.421 --> 01:38:15.330
<v Speaker 2>and he saw these great details and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2337
01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:18.770
<v Speaker 2>and he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2338
01:38:19.170 --> 01:38:21.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a great approach to</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism,</v>

2339
01:38:21.691 --> 01:38:22.640
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2340
01:38:22.770 --> 01:38:25.350
<v Speaker 2>sadly there aren't that many people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>can pull it off because it just</v>

2341
01:38:25.351 --> 01:38:27.000
<v Speaker 2>required,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2342
01:38:27.150 --> 01:38:29.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surpassing literary talent.</v>

2343
01:38:29.461 --> 01:38:30.360
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2344
01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:35.460
<v Speaker 2>that's incredibly rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was a unique combination of fiction</v>

2345
01:38:35.461 --> 01:38:40.461
<v Speaker 2>writing along with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>an actual understanding analysis?</v>

2346
01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

2347
01:38:43.741 --> 01:38:46.330
<v Speaker 2>that was his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his cause is great cause it,</v>

2348
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:47.280
<v Speaker 2>cause you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2349
01:38:47.281 --> 01:38:50.430
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would bring you in and,</v>

2350
01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:52.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2351
01:38:52.830 --> 01:38:54.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reader would,</v>

2352
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:57.150
<v Speaker 2>would kind of surf along this</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly,</v>

2353
01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:58.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2354
01:38:58.290 --> 01:39:00.310
<v Speaker 2>charged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast paced,</v>

2355
01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:03.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a narrative that read like,</v>

2356
01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:04.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2357
01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:06.910
<v Speaker 2>the fastest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most engrossing fiction or,</v>

2358
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:10.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he would intersperse it and stop and</v>

2359
01:39:10.591 --> 01:39:13.980
<v Speaker 2>pull back a and do a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we call it,</v>

2360
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:15.630
<v Speaker 2>a rolling stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We call them wisdoms,</v>

2361
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:16.591
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>

2362
01:39:16.591 --> 01:39:18.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just sort of stop and say,</v>

2363
01:39:18.710 --> 01:39:20.220
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my take on this.</v>

2364
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:21.960
<v Speaker 2>And those were amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2365
01:39:21.961 --> 01:39:23.910
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just had this ability to sort of cut</v>

2366
01:39:23.911 --> 01:39:27.480
<v Speaker 2>through the bullshit and see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see things from an angle that nobody</v>

2367
01:39:27.481 --> 01:39:30.080
<v Speaker 2>else saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the,</v>

2368
01:39:30.210 --> 01:39:32.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rare technique back then.</v>

2369
01:39:32.191 --> 01:39:32.431
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2370
01:39:32.431 --> 01:39:36.450
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the kind of individualized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2371
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:38.040
<v Speaker 2>take on things.</v>

2372
01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody was doing that and reporting back</v>

2373
01:39:40.471 --> 01:39:42.690
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was the,</v>

2374
01:39:42.691 --> 01:39:44.300
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody even thought of it as a form,</v>

2375
01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:46.410
<v Speaker 2>as a form that you can really experiment</v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

2376
01:39:46.411 --> 01:39:48.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were a few people back then like</v>

2377
01:39:48.331 --> 01:39:52.230
<v Speaker 2>terry southern and Tom Wolfe who were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were doing some things like that,</v>

2378
01:39:52.231 --> 01:39:54.420
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Thompson was completely unique.</v>

2379
01:39:54.810 --> 01:39:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there hasn't been anybody like him,</v>

2380
01:39:58.231 --> 01:39:59.190
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So since,</v>

2381
01:39:59.191 --> 01:40:00.960
<v Speaker 2>since then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2382
01:40:00.961 --> 01:40:02.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2383
01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:05.010
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an accident that nobody's been</v>

2384
01:40:05.011 --> 01:40:07.620
<v Speaker 2>able to pull that off again now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2385
01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:10.890
<v Speaker 2>you get compared to him a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2386
01:40:10.891 --> 01:40:14.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one one way I really saw that comparison</v>

2387
01:40:14.581 --> 01:40:19.400
<v Speaker 2>was your brilliant coverage of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial crisis and what was the,</v>

2388
01:40:19.401 --> 01:40:23.070
<v Speaker 2>the mechanisms behind the scene of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial crisis and that I became a</v>

2389
01:40:23.071 --> 01:40:24.930
<v Speaker 2>really big fan of your work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2390
01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:29.340
<v Speaker 2>reading that because that I think you</v>
<v Speaker 2>covered that as well,</v>

2391
01:40:29.341 --> 01:40:30.420
<v Speaker 2>if not better than anybody.</v>

2392
01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.201
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>

2393
01:40:31.201 --> 01:40:32.034
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2394
01:40:33.630 --> 01:40:35.730
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew nothing about any,</v>

2395
01:40:35.731 --> 01:40:38.820
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even balance my checkbook</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they assigned me to that story.</v>

2396
01:40:38.821 --> 01:40:40.440
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2397
01:40:41.190 --> 01:40:44.280
<v Speaker 2>and I had to start basically from square</v>
<v Speaker 2>one and,</v>

2398
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:48.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was calling people and saying things</v>

2399
01:40:48.241 --> 01:40:49.590
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you tell me something about</v>

2400
01:40:49.591 --> 01:40:51.300
<v Speaker 2>something that I'll understand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2401
01:40:51.301 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of cold calling investment</v>
<v Speaker 2>banks and literally saying that.</v>

2402
01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:59.700
<v Speaker 2>And I finally got a guy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have lunch with me and he said,</v>

2403
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:05.350
<v Speaker 2>your problem is that you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand this as an economic story.</v>

2404
01:41:05.630 --> 01:41:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you look at it as a crime story,</v>

2405
01:41:08.530 --> 01:41:10.240
<v Speaker 2>you'll get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2406
01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:12.940
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and from that point forward,</v>

2407
01:41:12.941 --> 01:41:14.440
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally,</v>

2408
01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:17.440
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started to understand the whole</v>

2409
01:41:17.441 --> 01:41:20.380
<v Speaker 2>mechanism wa the sub prime mortgage</v>
<v Speaker 2>scam.</v>

2410
01:41:20.381 --> 01:41:21.940
<v Speaker 2>It really was a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

2411
01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:27.240
<v Speaker 2>it's really just a massive corporatized</v>
<v Speaker 2>version of like selling a Oregano is,</v>

2412
01:41:30.221 --> 01:41:31.950
<v Speaker 2>we'd basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2413
01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:34.660
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took stuff that these,</v>

2414
01:41:34.661 --> 01:41:39.220
<v Speaker 2>these incredibly worthless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a highly risky mortgage loans,</v>

2415
01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:40.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2416
01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would give out loans to everybody</v>

2417
01:41:41.741 --> 01:41:43.930
<v Speaker 2>with a pulse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2418
01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:45.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you had a job or not,</v>

2419
01:41:45.521 --> 01:41:47.740
<v Speaker 2>whether you were a citizen or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't matter.</v>

2420
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Port thing was to get the loan</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately,</v>

2421
01:41:50.651 --> 01:41:51.970
<v Speaker 2>sell it off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chop it up,</v>

2422
01:41:51.971 --> 01:41:55.780
<v Speaker 2>turn it into securities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they use this highly advanced,</v>

2423
01:41:56.020 --> 01:42:01.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of mathematical trick to turn all</v>

2424
01:42:01.391 --> 01:42:04.780
<v Speaker 2>that sort of mortgage hamburger into</v>
<v Speaker 2>triple a rated securities.</v>

2425
01:42:04.781 --> 01:42:06.790
<v Speaker 2>So you'd have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2426
01:42:06.791 --> 01:42:11.791
<v Speaker 2>a junk rated mortgage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the riskiest a loan in existence.</v>

2427
01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:16.600
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that was so toxic that country</v>

2428
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:19.720
<v Speaker 2>companies like country ride wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to hold onto it for more than a</v>

2429
01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:22.960
<v Speaker 2>week because they were afraid it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff would blow up and then they</v>

2430
01:42:22.961 --> 01:42:26.200
<v Speaker 2>would sell it off to like a pension fund</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

2431
01:42:26.530 --> 01:42:27.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2432
01:42:27.821 --> 01:42:31.960
<v Speaker 2>an insurance company in the form of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>AAA rated security,</v>

2433
01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.490
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2434
01:42:33.491 --> 01:42:35.770
<v Speaker 2>is as safe as a US treasury bond.</v>

2435
01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:37.420
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a scam.</v>

2436
01:42:37.810 --> 01:42:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2437
01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:39.841
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2438
01:42:39.841 --> 01:42:40.720
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2439
01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:42.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the metaphor of,</v>

2440
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:46.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby powder taking baby powder and</v>

2441
01:42:46.181 --> 01:42:48.730
<v Speaker 2>selling it as coke or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's exactly what it was.</v>

2442
01:42:48.731 --> 01:42:51.820
<v Speaker 2>They just took worthless shit and sold</v>
<v Speaker 2>it as something that was,</v>

2443
01:42:51.821 --> 01:42:53.770
<v Speaker 2>that was gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2444
01:42:53.771 --> 01:42:56.140
<v Speaker 2>and they got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did it for years and years and</v>

2445
01:42:56.141 --> 01:42:57.150
<v Speaker 2>years and years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

2446
01:42:57.490 --> 01:43:02.490
<v Speaker 2>they knew that this gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge bubble of risk and disaster was</v>

2447
01:43:04.571 --> 01:43:09.520
<v Speaker 2>just accumulating and that someday it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to all explode and cascade</v>

2448
01:43:09.521 --> 01:43:10.290
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2449
01:43:10.290 --> 01:43:14.230
<v Speaker 2>and ruined the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But everybody was trying to time it,</v>

2450
01:43:14.231 --> 01:43:15.790
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2451
01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:19.930
<v Speaker 2>and bet on when that would happen and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make their money before that,</v>

2452
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:22.390
<v Speaker 2>that Judgment Day came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2453
01:43:22.391 --> 01:43:23.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2454
01:43:24.010 --> 01:43:26.320
<v Speaker 2>it was fascinating once I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I started to learn about it,</v>

2455
01:43:26.321 --> 01:43:29.080
<v Speaker 2>it was just such an amazingly</v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusting,</v>

2456
01:43:29.410 --> 01:43:31.930
<v Speaker 2>a fascinating story that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2457
01:43:32.050 --> 01:43:35.890
<v Speaker 2>it was just hard not to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to get into it a crime story.</v>

2458
01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of it as a crime story.</v>

2459
01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:38.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2460
01:43:38.951 --> 01:43:40.300
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even got,</v>

2461
01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:45.000
<v Speaker 2>one guy gave me a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2462
01:43:45.670 --> 01:43:49.360
<v Speaker 2>it was called famous famous con artists</v>
<v Speaker 2>in history,</v>

2463
01:43:49.570 --> 01:43:51.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like this little tome,</v>

2464
01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:53.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and smaller than like the smallest paper</v>

2465
01:43:53.741 --> 01:43:57.560
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was the biography of this guy,</v>

2466
01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Victor Lustig was his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was famous because he sold the Eiffel</v>

2467
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Tower twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

2468
01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

2469
01:44:06.650 --> 01:44:08.510
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had this,</v>

2470
01:44:08.511 --> 01:44:11.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this scam that he called,</v>

2471
01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2472
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:17.060
<v Speaker 2>the Hungarian box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2473
01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:19.790
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to go back and look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically what he would do is he</v>

2474
01:44:19.791 --> 01:44:23.810
<v Speaker 2>would get on a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2475
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:27.120
<v Speaker 2>in New York and he had this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2476
01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:30.980
<v Speaker 2>sort of beautiful Mahogany box with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>crank on it that had two holes in it.</v>

2477
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:35.690
<v Speaker 2>And he would show all the guests that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would put a blank piece of paper and one</v>

2478
01:44:35.691 --> 01:44:39.470
<v Speaker 2>and turn a crank and a hundred dollar</v>
<v Speaker 2>bill would come out the other end.</v>

2479
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he convinced them all that it was a</v>

2480
01:44:43.791 --> 01:44:46.890
<v Speaker 2>machine that made money and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2481
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:51.860
<v Speaker 2>everybody would offer him an increasing</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of money for this invention.</v>

2482
01:44:52.190 --> 01:44:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wouldn't sell it until the last</v>

2483
01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:56.330
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2484
01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:57.470
<v Speaker 2>when he would sell it for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2485
01:44:57.471 --> 01:45:00.230
<v Speaker 2>40 or $50,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he would disappear and jump off</v>

2486
01:45:00.231 --> 01:45:02.270
<v Speaker 2>the boat and in France and never be seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2487
01:45:02.271 --> 01:45:03.680
<v Speaker 2>People would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it called?</v>

2489
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:07.223
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:08.830
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2491
01:45:08.831 --> 01:45:10.000
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2492
01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:12.860
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's exactly what the mortgage,</v>

2493
01:45:13.930 --> 01:45:18.930
<v Speaker 2>let me see his face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that fucking creep lugging them.</v>

2494
01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see that box again.</v>

2495
01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:25.510
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2496
01:45:25.890 --> 01:45:28.020
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

2497
01:45:28.021 --> 01:45:30.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was obviously fake and,</v>

2498
01:45:30.261 --> 01:45:30.991
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2499
01:45:30.991 --> 01:45:32.930
<v Speaker 2>but that's what the Morgan scam was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2500
01:45:32.931 --> 01:45:37.740
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were taking basically blank paper,</v>

2501
01:45:37.741 --> 01:45:40.830
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these sub prime loans that belonged to</v>

2502
01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:44.940
<v Speaker 2>janitors who were going to foreclose</v>
<v Speaker 2>within 10 minutes.</v>

2503
01:45:45.330 --> 01:45:49.410
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were telling people that,</v>

2504
01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.810
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have this new mathematical process</v>

2505
01:45:51.811 --> 01:45:54.330
<v Speaker 2>that allows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually makes this stuff really</v>

2506
01:45:54.331 --> 01:45:55.980
<v Speaker 2>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2507
01:45:55.981 --> 01:45:59.340
<v Speaker 2>and you can put it in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2508
01:45:59.341 --> 01:46:03.030
<v Speaker 2>in your college endowment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can put in your pension fund.</v>

2509
01:46:03.330 --> 01:46:05.550
<v Speaker 2>And so all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2510
01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:10.570
<v Speaker 2>who his retirement monies were based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on security is we're buying all this</v>

2511
01:46:11.011 --> 01:46:14.250
<v Speaker 2>shit that they thought was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was aaa aerated.</v>

2512
01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:15.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how they woke up and you know,</v>

2513
01:46:15.901 --> 01:46:19.710
<v Speaker 2>and in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2009 and they found their 401ks where</v>

2514
01:46:20.190 --> 01:46:21.240
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2515
01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:23.970
<v Speaker 2>wiped out by 40% or whatever it was.</v>

2516
01:46:23.970 --> 01:46:26.010
<v Speaker 2>My neighbor really did that happen to</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2517
01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.350
<v Speaker 2>My neighbor bought this plot of land</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2518
01:46:28.351 --> 01:46:30.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had this dream to build his dream house.</v>

2519
01:46:31.230 --> 01:46:31.740
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2520
01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:34.500
<v Speaker 2>he would go buy the plot of land and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was always cleaned it up and</v>

2521
01:46:34.501 --> 01:46:36.510
<v Speaker 2>getting ready and I was talking to him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

2522
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:39.270
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2008 happened.</v>

2523
01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:43.290
<v Speaker 2>He lost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he would still go by that plot of</v>

2524
01:46:43.291 --> 01:46:46.710
<v Speaker 2>land and cleaning it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he and I would talk about it and</v>

2525
01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:48.900
<v Speaker 2>they just told me he lost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2526
01:46:48.901 --> 01:46:50.220
<v Speaker 2>So Never gonna Happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2527
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:51.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2528
01:46:51.061 --> 01:46:52.680
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2529
01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:56.530
<v Speaker 2>I think he died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He eventually got really sick and they</v>

2530
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:58.680
<v Speaker 2>took him out of his house and brought</v>
<v Speaker 2>them somewhere,</v>

2531
01:46:58.681 --> 01:47:00.930
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's dead now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2532
01:47:00.931 --> 01:47:01.764
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2533
01:47:01.890 --> 01:47:06.720
<v Speaker 2>his story was awful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awful to hear this guy who was in his</v>

2534
01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:09.750
<v Speaker 2>sixties who had got this piece of land</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a nice view and it's like,</v>

2535
01:47:09.751 --> 01:47:12.270
<v Speaker 2>this is where I'm going to drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build my dream house.</v>

2536
01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:14.370
<v Speaker 2>And he had all this money prepared for</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2537
01:47:14.371 --> 01:47:19.050
<v Speaker 2>all this money saved away and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready to rock and roll and then boom,</v>

2538
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:22.050
<v Speaker 2>it all went out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just drained out.</v>

2539
01:47:22.051 --> 01:47:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Somebody put a hole in the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>boat and everything,</v>

2540
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:27.120
<v Speaker 2>everything went to the bottom of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>

2541
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he'd probably got ripped off</v>

2542
01:47:28.921 --> 01:47:32.190
<v Speaker 2>twice because it's tax dollars went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go bail out the guys who,</v>

2543
01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:33.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2544
01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:36.330
<v Speaker 2>cause some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the banks got stuck holding some</v>

2545
01:47:36.331 --> 01:47:39.420
<v Speaker 2>of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And rather than eat the loss is like</v>

2546
01:47:39.421 --> 01:47:40.620
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your friend did.</v>

2547
01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:44.100
<v Speaker 2>They got the Federal Reserve to buy it</v>
<v Speaker 2>from them,</v>

2548
01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:45.160
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2549
01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:46.780
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

2550
01:47:47.670 --> 01:47:50.790
<v Speaker 2>or the treasury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all the fuck did they get away with</v>

2551
01:47:50.791 --> 01:47:54.750
<v Speaker 2>giving the Ceos bonuses during that</v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

2552
01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2553
01:47:55.711 --> 01:47:57.640
<v Speaker 2>I ain't bonuses during the time where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2554
01:47:57.641 --> 01:48:00.120
<v Speaker 2>they had to be bailed out by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>taxpayers.</v>

2555
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:01.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was another scam.</v>

2556
01:48:01.711 --> 01:48:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there were,</v>

2557
01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:06.180
<v Speaker 2>if you looked at the fine print of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bail outs,</v>

2558
01:48:06.190 --> 01:48:09.000
<v Speaker 2>it's basically said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2559
01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:14.010
<v Speaker 2>you had to repay the money by us by x</v>
<v Speaker 2>time before you could start paying</v>

2560
01:48:14.011 --> 01:48:16.080
<v Speaker 2>people exorbitant amounts of money</v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2561
01:48:16.410 --> 01:48:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of those,</v>

2562
01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:21.450
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those conditions were never</v>
<v Speaker 2>really followed.</v>

2563
01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.250
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2564
01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:26.640
<v Speaker 2>the conditions of repayment we're kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of glossed over.</v>

2565
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:28.790
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2566
01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:30.180
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2567
01:48:30.181 --> 01:48:33.210
<v Speaker 2>the companies that they were supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to pass these things called</v>

2568
01:48:33.211 --> 01:48:36.750
<v Speaker 2>stress tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which demonstrated that they were back</v>

2569
01:48:36.751 --> 01:48:40.950
<v Speaker 2>on solid footing again before they paid</v>
<v Speaker 2>people a bonuses.</v>

2570
01:48:40.951 --> 01:48:43.950
<v Speaker 2>But the stress tests are all fudged in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2571
01:48:44.010 --> 01:48:44.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

2572
01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:49.980
<v Speaker 2>there was crime and corruption</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegality basically in every direction</v>

2573
01:48:49.981 --> 01:48:52.170
<v Speaker 2>during that whole period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2574
01:48:52.171 --> 01:48:53.030
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2575
01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:54.830
<v Speaker 2>not just in the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in,</v>

2576
01:48:54.831 --> 01:48:56.280
<v Speaker 2>in all of these companies as well.</v>

2577
01:48:56.570 --> 01:48:57.800
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2578
01:48:58.260 --> 01:48:59.510
<v Speaker 2>But fascinating to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2579
01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:00.660
<v Speaker 2>to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2580
01:49:00.661 --> 01:49:02.280
<v Speaker 2>What was it like covering that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2581
01:49:02.281 --> 01:49:04.350
<v Speaker 2>how long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long did you spend working on that?</v>

2582
01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Seven years probably riced yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2583
01:49:09.121 --> 01:49:13.200
<v Speaker 2>cause one of the things that I found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing it was really interesting was</v>

2584
01:49:15.450 --> 01:49:20.450
<v Speaker 2>I did my first story about this and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got this incredible reaction because it</v>

2585
01:49:22.261 --> 01:49:25.920
<v Speaker 2>turns out that the financial press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is nobody in the financial press</v>

2586
01:49:25.921 --> 01:49:29.640
<v Speaker 2>who writes for ordinary people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's basically what I was doing was</v>

2587
01:49:29.641 --> 01:49:33.690
<v Speaker 2>a translation job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to basically take what had</v>

2588
01:49:33.691 --> 01:49:38.691
<v Speaker 2>happened and explain it in a way that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who knew nothing about finance</v>

2589
01:49:39.001 --> 01:49:41.370
<v Speaker 2>would be able to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2590
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:43.200
<v Speaker 2>and it turns out that nobody's doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2591
01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:47.680
<v Speaker 2>So all these people who had questions</v>
<v Speaker 2>about who,</v>

2592
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:51.430
<v Speaker 2>who wanted to know what had happened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>their money or why,</v>

2593
01:49:51.610 --> 01:49:53.600
<v Speaker 2>why did my house get foreclosed on or</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2594
01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:54.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

2595
01:49:54.551 --> 01:49:57.790
<v Speaker 2>what's a subprime mortgage or anything.</v>

2596
01:49:58.150 --> 01:49:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2597
01:49:59.561 --> 01:50:01.360
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nobody else doing that work.</v>

2598
01:50:01.361 --> 01:50:04.060
<v Speaker 2>So I had lots of it to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

2599
01:50:04.061 --> 01:50:06.430
<v Speaker 2>it was really interesting and I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept doing it.</v>

2600
01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That had to be depressing.</v>

2601
01:50:09.670 --> 01:50:10.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2602
01:50:10.151 --> 01:50:11.320
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2603
01:50:11.321 --> 01:50:12.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

2604
01:50:12.491 --> 01:50:14.590
<v Speaker 2>most investigative reporting is</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressing.</v>

2605
01:50:15.130 --> 01:50:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look particularly that because I mean,</v>

2606
01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:22.450
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it was old people that when got</v>
<v Speaker 2>old people,</v>

2607
01:50:22.451 --> 01:50:23.920
<v Speaker 2>minorities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2608
01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:26.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did one story about,</v>

2609
01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:28.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bank,</v>

2610
01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:30.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Maryland.</v>

2611
01:50:31.090 --> 01:50:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a national bank.</v>

2612
01:50:32.381 --> 01:50:34.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a bank that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2613
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:38.530
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be surprised that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people listening how have their accounts</v>

2614
01:50:38.531 --> 01:50:40.330
<v Speaker 2>with this bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2615
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:41.840
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2616
01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:45.160
<v Speaker 2>had to pay a settlement to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government because they were,</v>

2617
01:50:45.190 --> 01:50:48.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intentionally targeting elderly black</v>

2618
01:50:48.701 --> 01:50:50.020
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2619
01:50:50.021 --> 01:50:54.280
<v Speaker 2>to sell sub prime mortgages to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they called the mud people.</v>

2620
01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there were all these,</v>

2621
01:50:56.050 --> 01:51:00.490
<v Speaker 2>these plague toxic emails going back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth about how stupid they were and how</v>

2622
01:51:00.491 --> 01:51:02.010
<v Speaker 2>they'll buy anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

2623
01:51:02.011 --> 01:51:02.844
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

2624
01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Emails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call them mud people.</v>

2625
01:51:04.421 --> 01:51:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2626
01:51:05.531 --> 01:51:08.200
<v Speaker 2>And so they had to pay a settlement to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government and,</v>

2627
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:09.221
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2628
01:51:09.221 --> 01:51:10.900
<v Speaker 2>the racial component of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2629
01:51:10.901 --> 01:51:14.350
<v Speaker 2>of that crash was something that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't really clue into it until late,</v>

2630
01:51:14.351 --> 01:51:16.570
<v Speaker 2>but that was a big part of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2631
01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:22.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it involved these mortgage</v>

2632
01:51:23.141 --> 01:51:28.141
<v Speaker 2>lenders going into particularly like</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower middle class black neighborhoods</v>

2633
01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:33.070
<v Speaker 2>and knocking on doors where there'd be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an elderly person at home and</v>

2634
01:51:33.071 --> 01:51:34.570
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2635
01:51:34.571 --> 01:51:38.440
<v Speaker 2>would you like to refi your mortgage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have a little bit of extra</v>

2636
01:51:38.441 --> 01:51:40.270
<v Speaker 2>spending money this month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2637
01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:45.170
<v Speaker 2>And the person won't know anything about</v>
<v Speaker 2>finance and they'll,</v>

2638
01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:49.780
<v Speaker 2>they'll sign this refinance deal that</v>
<v Speaker 2>allows them to save a little bit of</v>

2639
01:51:49.781 --> 01:51:53.140
<v Speaker 2>money each month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not knowing that they had just converted</v>

2640
01:51:53.141 --> 01:51:55.840
<v Speaker 2>their fixed mortgage into a floating</v>
<v Speaker 2>mortgage.</v>

2641
01:51:56.170 --> 01:51:58.690
<v Speaker 2>And that is seen as the interest rates</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>

2642
01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:02.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have people who went from paying</v>

2643
01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:05.740
<v Speaker 2>$900 a month to paying $7,000 a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2644
01:52:05.741 --> 01:52:08.590
<v Speaker 2>And suddenly they're out in the street</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2645
01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:10.340
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2646
01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:13.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the company that sold them the loan is</v>

2647
01:52:13.301 --> 01:52:14.490
<v Speaker 2>long gone by then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2648
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:15.880
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not holding it.</v>

2649
01:52:15.881 --> 01:52:18.220
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as they got her name on the,</v>

2650
01:52:18.221 --> 01:52:21.160
<v Speaker 2>on the dotted line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sold it off to a bank in New York</v>

2651
01:52:21.610 --> 01:52:24.980
<v Speaker 2>who in turn again chopped it up into</v>
<v Speaker 2>hamburger and sold it probably to you</v>

2652
01:52:24.981 --> 01:52:29.440
<v Speaker 2>are a pension fund or who or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's nobody she could complain to</v>

2653
01:52:29.441 --> 01:52:30.280
<v Speaker 2>and you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2654
01:52:30.281 --> 01:52:33.820
<v Speaker 2>That stuff was really depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the feeling like of having very</v>

2655
01:52:33.821 --> 01:52:38.550
<v Speaker 2>little understanding about finance and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then immersing yourself in it and that</v>

2656
01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:41.650
<v Speaker 2>was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the underlying structure that</v>

2657
01:52:41.651 --> 01:52:46.580
<v Speaker 2>our society is run on that our money is</v>
<v Speaker 2>established through like this is,</v>

2658
01:52:46.581 --> 01:52:51.350
<v Speaker 2>this is how we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sell houses and loans and this is</v>

2659
01:52:51.351 --> 01:52:52.300
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing this.</v>

2660
01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:53.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2661
01:52:53.301 --> 01:52:54.500
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was fascinating.</v>

2662
01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:57.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because before that I was mostly</v>

2663
01:52:57.501 --> 01:53:00.560
<v Speaker 2>covering like elections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2664
01:53:00.561 --> 01:53:02.030
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you cover elections,</v>

2665
01:53:02.031 --> 01:53:06.530
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly boring and you never</v>
<v Speaker 2>hear anything of substance and it's not</v>

2666
01:53:06.531 --> 01:53:08.190
<v Speaker 2>terribly complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2667
01:53:08.210 --> 01:53:10.880
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one the Democrats says that,</v>

2668
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:13.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to help the middle class and the</v>

2669
01:53:13.401 --> 01:53:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Republicans says we want to protect</v>
<v Speaker 2>family values.</v>

2670
01:53:15.951 --> 01:53:19.580
<v Speaker 2>And that's pretty much the extent of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual challenge in terms of</v>

2671
01:53:19.581 --> 01:53:23.030
<v Speaker 2>covering that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I always thought to myself,</v>

2672
01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:25.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics in America must be a lot more</v>

2673
01:53:25.161 --> 01:53:26.480
<v Speaker 2>complicated than this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2674
01:53:26.481 --> 01:53:31.481
<v Speaker 2>There must be some other hidden thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's incredibly complex and</v>

2675
01:53:32.931 --> 01:53:35.180
<v Speaker 2>diabolical and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2676
01:53:35.181 --> 01:53:35.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2677
01:53:35.730 --> 01:53:38.900
<v Speaker 2>the real machinations of power must be</v>
<v Speaker 2>visible somewhere.</v>

2678
01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:40.880
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2679
01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:44.990
<v Speaker 2>I think that you find that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start looking at the,</v>

2680
01:53:44.991 --> 01:53:47.540
<v Speaker 2>how Wall Street works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how money works,</v>

2681
01:53:47.541 --> 01:53:49.490
<v Speaker 2>how central banking works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

2682
01:53:49.850 --> 01:53:51.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2683
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:55.730
<v Speaker 2>how the concentration of wealth works.</v>

2684
01:53:55.820 --> 01:53:56.653
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2685
01:53:56.690 --> 01:54:01.690
<v Speaker 2>basically the subprime scheme was an</v>
<v Speaker 2>effort to pull the remaining savings out</v>

2686
01:54:04.191 --> 01:54:05.450
<v Speaker 2>of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2687
01:54:05.451 --> 01:54:06.760
<v Speaker 2>There just wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2688
01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:09.710
<v Speaker 2>in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>invest in banks made their money by</v>

2689
01:54:09.711 --> 01:54:13.430
<v Speaker 2>lending money to companies who would</v>
<v Speaker 2>build factories and they would make</v>

2690
01:54:13.431 --> 01:54:16.290
<v Speaker 2>stuff and sell it around the world and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody would make money and never,</v>

2691
01:54:16.291 --> 01:54:18.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even even the,</v>

2692
01:54:18.170 --> 01:54:19.880
<v Speaker 2>the population would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

2693
01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:23.960
<v Speaker 2>would benefit from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that manufacturing economy,</v>

2694
01:54:23.961 --> 01:54:26.080
<v Speaker 2>it's all gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's overseas.</v>

2695
01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:31.330
<v Speaker 2>So you have this financial as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>economy and they have no normal</v>

2696
01:54:31.581 --> 01:54:35.180
<v Speaker 2>beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A way to make money and all their,</v>

2697
01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:39.200
<v Speaker 2>all of it can really do is look to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is their money and how can we get</v>

2698
01:54:39.201 --> 01:54:41.660
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most people had money in their</v>

2699
01:54:41.661 --> 01:54:42.920
<v Speaker 2>houses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2700
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the accumulated savings of most people.</v>

2701
01:54:47.150 --> 01:54:50.570
<v Speaker 2>Whatever was left after the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>crash in the nineties,</v>

2702
01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:52.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in real estate.</v>

2703
01:54:52.670 --> 01:54:57.670
<v Speaker 2>And this was the scam by which they took</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wealth that was left in the pockets</v>

2704
01:55:01.161 --> 01:55:06.161
<v Speaker 2>of ordinary people and transferred it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine people in Manhattan basically.</v>

2705
01:55:07.131 --> 01:55:07.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2706
01:55:07.511 --> 01:55:09.440
<v Speaker 2>that's why you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2707
01:55:09.441 --> 01:55:12.530
<v Speaker 2>we told them when we talk about wealth</v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality now,</v>

2708
01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:15.530
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it being a huge factor that,</v>

2709
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:20.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top 95,</v>

2710
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:24.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top 1% of the population owns 90% of</v>

2711
01:55:24.321 --> 01:55:25.970
<v Speaker 2>the wealth in the country or whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2712
01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:30.740
<v Speaker 2>That's a consequence of schemes like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this where they're just there,</v>

2713
01:55:30.741 --> 01:55:34.790
<v Speaker 2>they're finding out where people have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of money and they're</v>

2714
01:55:34.791 --> 01:55:39.020
<v Speaker 2>systematically coming up with scams to</v>
<v Speaker 2>move it from there to here.</v>

2715
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:41.780
<v Speaker 2>No consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no with no consequences.</v>

2716
01:55:41.781 --> 01:55:44.910
<v Speaker 2>And that was the other part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that I ended up having to cover</v>

2717
01:55:44.911 --> 01:55:46.020
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>

2718
01:55:46.530 --> 01:55:48.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last time they tried something like</v>

2719
01:55:48.961 --> 01:55:50.910
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like during the s and l crisis,</v>

2720
01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:56.620
<v Speaker 2>which was also sort of a giant fraud</v>
<v Speaker 2>scheme also that involved real estate</v>

2721
01:55:57.481 --> 01:56:01.350
<v Speaker 2>lending and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the government after that actually,</v>

2722
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and died at 1800 people,</v>

2723
01:56:04.081 --> 01:56:05.700
<v Speaker 2>they put 800 people in jail.</v>

2724
01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:07.130
<v Speaker 2>They put a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2725
01:56:07.590 --> 01:56:09.960
<v Speaker 2>serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>influential people on the dock after</v>

2726
01:56:09.961 --> 01:56:11.910
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2727
01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:15.210
<v Speaker 2>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody went to jail after this stuff.</v>

2728
01:56:15.211 --> 01:56:17.640
<v Speaker 2>And there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people think that,</v>

2729
01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:19.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't do anything that was</v>

2730
01:56:19.321 --> 01:56:20.950
<v Speaker 2>technically illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No bullshit there.</v>

2731
01:56:20.951 --> 01:56:25.951
<v Speaker 2>There was lots of stuff that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was brazenly criminally illegal.</v>

2732
01:56:26.131 --> 01:56:26.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2733
01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:29.670
<v Speaker 2>they committed fraud on a broad scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2734
01:56:29.671 --> 01:56:32.790
<v Speaker 2>but some of these companies were into</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that were even worse than that.</v>

2735
01:56:32.791 --> 01:56:35.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take HSBC,</v>

2736
01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:40.940
<v Speaker 2>HSBC admitted to laundering $850 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a pair of central and South American</v>

2737
01:56:43.081 --> 01:56:44.640
<v Speaker 2>drug cartels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2738
01:56:44.641 --> 01:56:46.530
<v Speaker 2>including the Sinaloa cartel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2739
01:56:46.531 --> 01:56:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Which is suspected and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>murders,</v>

2740
01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:50.860
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2741
01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:53.760
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they admitted to this activity,</v>

2742
01:56:54.210 --> 01:56:59.210
<v Speaker 2>they agreed to a deferred prosecution</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreement with the government where</v>

2743
01:56:59.910 --> 01:57:03.870
<v Speaker 2>nobody did a day in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No individual had to pull out a dime out</v>

2744
01:57:03.871 --> 01:57:05.430
<v Speaker 2>of their own pockets to pay.</v>

2745
01:57:05.790 --> 01:57:08.640
<v Speaker 2>The shareholders ponied up one point $9</v>
<v Speaker 2>million,</v>

2746
01:57:08.641 --> 01:57:11.220
<v Speaker 2>but some of that was tax deductible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means we pay,</v>

2747
01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:13.950
<v Speaker 2>we paid some of that fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2748
01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:17.730
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the only real punishment with any</v>

2749
01:57:17.731 --> 01:57:22.290
<v Speaker 2>teeth is that some of the executives had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to partially defer their bonuses for</v>

2750
01:57:22.291 --> 01:57:24.430
<v Speaker 2>five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2751
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:29.400
<v Speaker 2>so that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laundering $850 million for narco</v>

2752
01:57:29.401 --> 01:57:33.540
<v Speaker 2>terrorists gets you a total walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2753
01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:35.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that tells you basically everything you</v>

2754
01:57:35.821 --> 01:57:40.821
<v Speaker 2>need to know about w do we prosecute</v>
<v Speaker 2>white collar crime in this country?</v>

2755
01:57:41.311 --> 01:57:42.120
<v Speaker 2>Basically?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2756
01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:42.721
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2757
01:57:42.721 --> 01:57:45.480
<v Speaker 2>that's the answer ultimately that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>find out.</v>

2758
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:49.230
<v Speaker 2>And there was paperwork that showed they</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew it was from the cartels.</v>

2759
01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:50.093
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2760
01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:52.580
<v Speaker 2>if you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the,</v>

2761
01:57:52.610 --> 01:57:54.120
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the agreement,</v>

2762
01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:55.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can watch that.</v>

2763
01:57:55.971 --> 01:57:56.520
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2764
01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:58.740
<v Speaker 2>there's a video of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2765
01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:04.580
<v Speaker 2>of Loretta Lynch and Lanny Breuer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause this was before Laura,</v>

2766
01:58:04.621 --> 01:58:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Loretta Lynch was the attorney general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was,</v>

2767
01:58:06.721 --> 01:58:08.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2768
01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:10.830
<v Speaker 2>she was basically the head of this deal.</v>

2769
01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:14.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talked about the fact that the HSBC</v>

2770
01:58:14.161 --> 01:58:16.860
<v Speaker 2>branches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because most of this was done in Mexico.</v>

2771
01:58:17.250 --> 01:58:18.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2772
01:58:18.661 --> 01:58:21.330

<v Speaker 2>which was the subsidiary company.</v>

2773
01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:25.110
<v Speaker 2>They had special teller windows built,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2774
01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:29.850
<v Speaker 2>to fit cashboxes that the drug cartels</v>
<v Speaker 2>were bringing in to the bank.</v>

2775
01:58:30.150 --> 01:58:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so basically you've seen the,</v>

2776
01:58:32.471 --> 01:58:36.030
<v Speaker 2>seen the seen in scarface for the guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>come in with duffle bags with cash to</v>

2777
01:58:36.031 --> 01:58:37.170
<v Speaker 2>the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2778
01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:38.910
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like a montage,</v>

2779
01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:39.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that,</v>

2780

<v Speaker 2>I forget what song it is,</v>

2781
01:58:41.110 --> 01:58:42.550
<v Speaker 2>the background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

2782
01:58:42.551 --> 01:58:47.551
<v Speaker 2>These guys would come into the bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would slide in these boxes of cash,</v>

2783
01:58:48.011 --> 01:58:51.430
<v Speaker 2>one after the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's admitted activity.</v>

2784

2785
01:58:52.990 --> 01:58:54.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like they're contesting it.</v>

2786
01:58:54.431 --> 01:58:56.530
<v Speaker 2>They're not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we neither admit nor deny.</v>

2787
01:58:56.531 --> 01:58:58.750
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the deal.</v>

2788
01:58:59.050 --> 01:59:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2789
01:59:00.581 --> 01:59:02.440
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they agreed to the amount,</v>

2790
01:59:02.441 --> 01:59:03.274
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2791
01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:05.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2792
01:59:05.710 --> 01:59:07.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a one point $9 billion</v>

2793
01:59:07.541 --> 01:59:08.690
<v Speaker 2>settlement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2794
01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:09.220

<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2795
01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:11.650
<v Speaker 2>it's not like it came out of the pockets</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the people who did it.</v>

2796
01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:14.650
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like any of the people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it are in jail.</v>

2797
01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:16.300
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2798
01:59:16.301 --> 01:59:19.750
<v Speaker 2>a thing that happened and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's five weeks of profit for the</v>

2799

<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the documentary inside job?</v>

2804
01:59:29.771 --> 01:59:30.900
<v Speaker 2>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly,</v>

2805
01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a sobering documentary where</v>

2806
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.660
<v Speaker 2>they're talking to the very people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>caused the financial crisis and,</v>

2807
01:59:37.690 --> 01:59:41.530
<v Speaker 2>and realizing that these people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>economics professors that eventually got</v>

2808
01:59:41.531 --> 01:59:46.030
<v Speaker 2>these jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really lucrative jobs with banks and how</v>

2809
01:59:46.031 --> 01:59:49.960
<v Speaker 2>they finagle this system and made it so</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looked like these things were</v>

2810
01:59:49.961 --> 01:59:50.920
<v Speaker 2>appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2811
01:59:50.921 --> 01:59:54.280
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to some of the,</v>

2812
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:56.980
<v Speaker 2>some of the things that they invented</v>
<v Speaker 2>that made this,</v>

2813
01:59:56.981 --> 02:00:00.520
<v Speaker 2>the crash possible sounded like good</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

2814
02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:03.040
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they came up with this thing called the</v>

2815
02:00:03.041 --> 02:00:04.810
<v Speaker 2>credit default swap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2816
02:00:04.811 --> 02:00:07.450
<v Speaker 2>And I won't bore you with what that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly,</v>

2817
02:00:07.451 --> 02:00:11.170
<v Speaker 2>but basically it's a kind of insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2818
02:00:11.171 --> 02:00:12.820
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2819
02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:15.040
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's basically a bet.</v>

2820
02:00:15.070 --> 02:00:17.080
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2821
02:00:17.110 --> 02:00:22.110
<v Speaker 2>but it's a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of quasi I ensuring a product,</v>

2822
02:00:23.110 --> 02:00:25.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without having to pony up a lot of</v>

2823
02:00:25.271 --> 02:00:26.800
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2824
02:00:26.801 --> 02:00:31.120
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called the derivative,</v>

2825
02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:32.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2826
02:00:32.351 --> 02:00:36.100
<v Speaker 2>and these instruments are completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>unregulated.</v>

2827
02:00:36.370 --> 02:00:39.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of put the socratic default swap</v>

2828
02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:40.990
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>

2829
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:46.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I betting on whether or not a</v>

2830
02:00:47.170 --> 02:00:52.060
<v Speaker 2>third person's house is going to a burn</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a fire,</v>

2831
02:00:52.090 --> 02:00:55.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the old school insurance said that</v>

2832
02:00:55.361 --> 02:00:58.000
<v Speaker 2>it had to be your house in order for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get insurance on it.</v>

2833
02:00:58.270 --> 02:01:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this new form of [inaudible] insurance</v>

2834
02:01:02.531 --> 02:01:05.200
<v Speaker 2>said that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally disinterested parties could have</v>

2835
02:01:05.201 --> 02:01:06.250
<v Speaker 2>an interest in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

2836
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:08.050
<v Speaker 2>in a third thing that happens.</v>

2837
02:01:08.050 --> 02:01:10.360
<v Speaker 2>So it's basically gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2838
02:01:10.361 --> 02:01:13.900
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand,</v>

2839
02:01:13.930 --> 02:01:18.160
<v Speaker 2>it allowed people to create a whole lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of capital,</v>

2840
02:01:18.161 --> 02:01:21.850
<v Speaker 2>which allowed them to lend more money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which theoretically allowed people to</v>

2841
02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:24.400
<v Speaker 2>buy more houses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in reality,</v>

2842
02:01:24.401 --> 02:01:27.640
<v Speaker 2>it just created the system where all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people had bets that were back and</v>

2843
02:01:27.641 --> 02:01:29.440
<v Speaker 2>forth on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on all these properties.</v>

2844
02:01:29.441 --> 02:01:33.100
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the reasons why the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the crash happened,</v>

2845
02:01:33.101 --> 02:01:34.930
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when all those mortgages started to</v>

2846
02:01:34.931 --> 02:01:37.900
<v Speaker 2>fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't just the failures of those</v>

2847
02:01:37.901 --> 02:01:39.830
<v Speaker 2>properties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all these people who are betting</v>

2848
02:01:39.831 --> 02:01:43.220
<v Speaker 2>on whether or not these people could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could pay their mortgages.</v>

2849
02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:46.580
<v Speaker 2>They started to lose money and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were people who had bets on that.</v>

2850
02:01:46.581 --> 02:01:50.690
<v Speaker 2>He started to lose money and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this cascading whirlpool of shit that</v>

2851
02:01:50.691 --> 02:01:53.060
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2852
02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:53.811
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

2853
02:01:53.811 --> 02:01:57.920
<v Speaker 2>it started out as an idea to just create</v>
<v Speaker 2>more money to lend to lend.</v>

2854
02:01:58.130 --> 02:02:03.130
<v Speaker 2>And it turned into this nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mechanical scenario that just,</v>

2855
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:06.080
<v Speaker 2>that created losses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2856
02:02:06.110 --> 02:02:09.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this almost apocalyptic fashion.</v>

2857
02:02:09.230 --> 02:02:11.900
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of them had no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

2858
02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:13.670
<v Speaker 2>that was going to be the eventuality.</v>

2859
02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2860
02:02:17.250 --> 02:02:17.960
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2861
02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:19.850
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely crazy stuff.</v>

2862
02:02:20.210 --> 02:02:23.480
<v Speaker 2>As a person who didn't really follow</v>
<v Speaker 2>finance before,</v>

2863
02:02:23.481 --> 02:02:25.670
<v Speaker 2>how much has that affected your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>down?</v>

2864
02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:30.140
<v Speaker 2>Like the way you look at things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely pay a lot more attention to</v>

2865
02:02:30.650 --> 02:02:32.310
<v Speaker 2>the fine print.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2866
02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:35.180
<v Speaker 2>when I enter into any financial</v>
<v Speaker 2>contract,</v>

2867
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:39.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about where I do my banking.</v>

2868
02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is you just don't have a</v>

2869
02:02:42.591 --> 02:02:44.630
<v Speaker 2>whole lot of choice in this country</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

2870
02:02:44.631 --> 02:02:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like everything else.</v>

2871
02:02:46.221 --> 02:02:49.100
<v Speaker 2>There's only a few companies left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2872
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:52.660
<v Speaker 2>so almost every bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2873
02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:56.100
<v Speaker 2>that's out there where you can have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bank account and a mortgage is,</v>

2874
02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:59.600
<v Speaker 2>is a bank that I've written about</v>
<v Speaker 2>something massive scandal,</v>

2875
02:02:59.650 --> 02:03:00.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

2876
02:03:00.531 --> 02:03:01.580
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2877
02:03:01.581 --> 02:03:02.270
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2878
02:03:02.270 --> 02:03:04.280
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2879
02:03:04.430 --> 02:03:05.270
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2880
02:03:05.271 --> 02:03:07.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worry about it all the time and I have</v>

2881
02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:11.510
<v Speaker 2>friends in finance who call me and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tell me that,</v>

2882
02:03:11.690 --> 02:03:14.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the things that are incredibly</v>

2883
02:03:14.781 --> 02:03:16.280
<v Speaker 2>unsafe and that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2884
02:03:16.281 --> 02:03:17.270
<v Speaker 2>and the other could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

2885
02:03:17.330 --> 02:03:18.230
<v Speaker 2>could happen.</v>

2886
02:03:18.230 --> 02:03:21.440
<v Speaker 2>And so I have an anxiety level about</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that I never had before.</v>

2887
02:03:21.441 --> 02:03:23.750
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from that,</v>

2888
02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:24.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2889
02:03:24.710 --> 02:03:29.710
<v Speaker 2>that's a natural consequence of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of having to spend seven years looking</v>

2890
02:03:31.071 --> 02:03:33.140
<v Speaker 2>at all these horror stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2891
02:03:33.170 --> 02:03:35.060
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You spent that much time on it.</v>

2892
02:03:36.170 --> 02:03:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Do you see any other bubbles coming up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2893
02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:42.470
<v Speaker 2>people talk about that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2894
02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:45.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2895
02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:50.360
<v Speaker 2>a lot of negative press about subprime</v>
<v Speaker 2>auto loans for instance,</v>

2896
02:03:50.361 --> 02:03:52.400
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2897
02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:55.610
<v Speaker 2>it's not exactly the same but it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar thing.</v>

2898
02:03:55.611 --> 02:04:00.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean the same basic scam of taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>loans,</v>

2899
02:04:01.580 --> 02:04:06.110
<v Speaker 2>chopping them up and then repackaging</v>
<v Speaker 2>them as something that's more valuable</v>

2900
02:04:06.111 --> 02:04:08.870
<v Speaker 2>than the original loan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do that with anything,</v>

2901
02:04:08.871 --> 02:04:11.150
<v Speaker 2>any kind of credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do that with credit cards.</v>

2902
02:04:11.151 --> 02:04:13.360
<v Speaker 2>You can do it with aircraft loans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do it with,</v>

2903
02:04:13.390 --> 02:04:15.150
<v Speaker 2>with car loans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do it with,</v>

2904
02:04:15.180 --> 02:04:16.370
<v Speaker 2>with home mortgages.</v>

2905
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the,</v>

2906
02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:23.920
<v Speaker 2>the mechanism of taking things that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are toxic and risky and making them look</v>

2907
02:04:25.521 --> 02:04:28.460
<v Speaker 2>like aaa is still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2908
02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:33.170
<v Speaker 2>it's still part of the economy and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's everywhere.</v>

2909
02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:37.280
<v Speaker 2>The plus side of that is that there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>more credit available.</v>

2910
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:38.161
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2911
02:04:38.161 --> 02:04:41.970
<v Speaker 2>almost anybody can get a credit card or</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you've had screwed up credit,</v>

2912
02:04:41.971 --> 02:04:43.530
<v Speaker 2>you can get a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2913
02:04:43.531 --> 02:04:45.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this is this put us in this</v>

2914
02:04:45.630 --> 02:04:48.300
<v Speaker 2>endless cycle of buildup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble collapse,</v>

2915
02:04:48.301 --> 02:04:49.510
<v Speaker 2>build up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bubble collapse,</v>

2916
02:04:50.190 --> 02:04:52.380
<v Speaker 2>rebounding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collapse again.</v>

2917
02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2918
02:04:53.311 --> 02:04:54.720
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2919
02:04:55.110 --> 02:04:58.870
<v Speaker 2>that's why you have to be nervous about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2920
02:04:58.990 --> 02:05:03.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the skyrocketing stock exchange because</v>

2921
02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:04.620
<v Speaker 2>we've had a fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2922
02:05:04.621 --> 02:05:05.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be.</v>

2923
02:05:05.371 --> 02:05:05.951
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have,</v>

2924
02:05:05.951 --> 02:05:08.190
<v Speaker 2>what are you heavily invested in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got some in there.</v>

2925
02:05:08.370 --> 02:05:10.140
<v Speaker 2>I just did when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the whole,</v>

2926
02:05:10.230 --> 02:05:12.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when trump was saying the economy's</v>

2927
02:05:12.241 --> 02:05:14.480
<v Speaker 2>never been better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the stock market stock markets,</v>

2928
02:05:14.490 --> 02:05:17.850
<v Speaker 2>killing it all these days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it'll have a bad day and you're</v>

2929
02:05:17.851 --> 02:05:18.181
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2930
02:05:18.181 --> 02:05:19.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I thought we were doing great.</v>

2931
02:05:19.590 --> 02:05:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Like what's going on with his bad day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you not control these bad days?</v>

2932
02:05:22.590 --> 02:05:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's happening here?</v>

2933
02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

2934
02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:27.570
<v Speaker 2>if you're in control of the good days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're also in control of the bad days.</v>

2935
02:05:27.571 --> 02:05:28.201
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2936
02:05:28.201 --> 02:05:29.490
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2937
02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:30.930
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems,</v>

2938
02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:33.840
<v Speaker 2>it seems super suspicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2939
02:05:33.841 --> 02:05:35.850
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the old days,</v>

2940
02:05:35.851 --> 02:05:38.700
<v Speaker 2>you'd have a lot of confidence that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2941
02:05:38.701 --> 02:05:41.040
<v Speaker 2>the stock market always eventually goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2942
02:05:41.190 --> 02:05:43.440
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be bad days,</v>

2943
02:05:43.441 --> 02:05:44.720
<v Speaker 2>but it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll go back up.</v>

2944
02:05:44.730 --> 02:05:48.360
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is the underlying</v>
<v Speaker 2>economy in America just isn't all that</v>

2945
02:05:48.361 --> 02:05:49.320
<v Speaker 2>hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2946
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:52.200
<v Speaker 2>like we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we really make in this country?</v>

2947
02:05:52.201 --> 02:05:54.810
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wha where's the floor?</v>

2948
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we have,</v>

2949
02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:58.920
<v Speaker 2>we have some industries that sorta</v>
<v Speaker 2>perform well,</v>

2950
02:05:58.980 --> 02:06:00.780
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2951
02:06:00.781 --> 02:06:03.930
<v Speaker 2>periodically we go through these bubbles</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are based on nothing more than</v>

2952
02:06:03.931 --> 02:06:05.730
<v Speaker 2>enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2953
02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:07.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the nineties it was the,</v>

2954
02:06:07.870 --> 02:06:09.700
<v Speaker 2>the tech bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2955
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:12.420
<v Speaker 2>Where people like Alan Greenspan would</v>
<v Speaker 2>say things like,</v>

2956
02:06:12.421 --> 02:06:14.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a new paradigm and economics,</v>

2957
02:06:14.401 --> 02:06:15.234
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2958
02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:18.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter whether a company</v>

2959
02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:22.710
<v Speaker 2>hasn't shown any ability to make money</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

2960
02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:24.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2961
02:06:24.330 --> 02:06:28.470
<v Speaker 2>has no reasonable profit and loss</v>
<v Speaker 2>statements.</v>

2962
02:06:28.471 --> 02:06:30.210
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a good idea,</v>

2963
02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:35.600
<v Speaker 2>the stock is sound and everybody should</v>
<v Speaker 2>invest in it and the stock market is</v>

2964
02:06:35.731 --> 02:06:37.200
<v Speaker 2>going to continually go up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go up.</v>

2965
02:06:37.201 --> 02:06:40.320
<v Speaker 2>So don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course that doesn't happen and</v>

2966
02:06:40.410 --> 02:06:41.820
<v Speaker 2>everybody blows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It blows up.</v>

2967
02:06:41.821 --> 02:06:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Everybody loses their shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>

2968
02:06:44.101 --> 02:06:45.420
<v Speaker 2>what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Fed,</v>

2969
02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:50.520
<v Speaker 2>lowered interest rates basically allows</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wall Street to recapitalize,</v>

2970
02:06:50.521 --> 02:06:53.520
<v Speaker 2>drink itself sober,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they plunge into the next,</v>

2971
02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:56.490
<v Speaker 2>the next madness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is mortgages.</v>

2972
02:06:56.550 --> 02:06:59.910
<v Speaker 2>And once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have Alan Greenspan saying,</v>

2973
02:06:59.911 --> 02:07:00.780
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2974
02:07:01.290 --> 02:07:03.570
<v Speaker 2>real estate is a great bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2975
02:07:03.571 --> 02:07:05.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to continually ascend.</v>

2976
02:07:05.970 --> 02:07:08.970
<v Speaker 2>People should use their homes as ATM</v>
<v Speaker 2>machines.</v>

2977
02:07:08.970 --> 02:07:09.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>

2978
02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:13.290
<v Speaker 2>you should consider refinancing your</v>
<v Speaker 2>house so that you can get a little bit</v>

2979
02:07:13.291 --> 02:07:14.610
<v Speaker 2>of extra cash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2980
02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.110
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2981
02:07:16.111 --> 02:07:19.050
<v Speaker 2>this was actually the message they sent</v>
<v Speaker 2>to America and it again,</v>

2982
02:07:19.051 --> 02:07:24.051
<v Speaker 2>it creates this artificial mania where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economy's stoked artificially,</v>

2983
02:07:25.950 --> 02:07:28.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two gigantic dimensions,</v>

2984
02:07:28.831 --> 02:07:31.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's not based on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when,</v>

2985
02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:33.810
<v Speaker 2>when it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it crashes,</v>

2986
02:07:33.811 --> 02:07:36.730
<v Speaker 2>when you finally get like any scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2987
02:07:36.731 --> 02:07:40.750
<v Speaker 2>it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on more new investors coming</v>

2988
02:07:40.751 --> 02:07:42.670
<v Speaker 2>in and old investors leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2989
02:07:42.671 --> 02:07:46.570
<v Speaker 2>So there's always going to be that</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment when suddenly we don't have as</v>

2990
02:07:46.571 --> 02:07:50.200
<v Speaker 2>many new ones and old ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the instant that happens,</v>

2991
02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:52.270
<v Speaker 2>it all goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kaboom.</v>

2992
02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happened with,</v>

2993
02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:55.470
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2994
02:07:55.500 --> 02:07:59.440
<v Speaker 2>the subprime market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a moment in time where the,</v>

2995
02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:01.110
<v Speaker 2>they just couldn't keep it going</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2996
02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:04.000
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't find any more new soccer's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the to get to,</v>

2997
02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:09.240
<v Speaker 2>to sell mortgages to and the mania ended</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an all went splat and then it was</v>

2998
02:08:09.581 --> 02:08:14.581
<v Speaker 2>amplified by the fact that we have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>system now of people betting on credit,</v>

2999
02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:17.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is legal,</v>

3000
02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:21.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which creates more losses out of at a</v>

3001
02:08:21.611 --> 02:08:22.240
<v Speaker 2>thin air.</v>

3002
02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:25.170
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrified every time I see this,</v>

3003
02:08:25.210 --> 02:08:26.950
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stock market go up.</v>

3004
02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:30.040
<v Speaker 2>What's it based on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it based on our economy actually</v>

3005
02:08:30.041 --> 02:08:31.390
<v Speaker 2>doing well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3006
02:08:31.391 --> 02:08:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3007
02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:34.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

3008
02:08:34.931 --> 02:08:36.460
<v Speaker 2>I look like I'm scaring you a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

3009
02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Definitely a scary thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's good.</v>

3010
02:08:38.681 --> 02:08:40.260
<v Speaker 2>I think I need to be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3011
02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:43.120
<v Speaker 2>I tend to take these things and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3012
02:08:43.121 --> 02:08:45.820
<v Speaker 2>I have financial advisors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like let them handle money.</v>

3013
02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:47.800
<v Speaker 2>When I hear things like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go,</v>

3014
02:08:47.801 --> 02:08:48.634
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

3015
02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get terrified when I hear about really</v>

3016
02:08:51.281 --> 02:08:55.120
<v Speaker 2>smart people getting scammed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like yesterday we were talking about,</v>

3017
02:08:55.170 --> 02:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theranose.</v>

3018
02:08:56.191 --> 02:09:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that a blood testing company</v>
<v Speaker 2>that turned out to be total horse shit?</v>

3019
02:09:00.250 --> 02:09:01.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hear about this.</v>

3020
02:09:01.450 --> 02:09:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great story.</v>

3021
02:09:02.890 --> 02:09:05.560
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a story of one of those things</v>

3022
02:09:05.561 --> 02:09:09.400
<v Speaker 2>where you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find someone who you hope exists and</v>

3023
02:09:09.401 --> 02:09:10.234
<v Speaker 2>you build them up.</v>

3024
02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:13.810
<v Speaker 2>There was this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she looked like Steve Jobs.</v>

3025
02:09:13.811 --> 02:09:17.290
<v Speaker 2>She wore a black turtle neck and every</v>
<v Speaker 2>photo and uh,</v>

3026
02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:18.640
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3027
02:09:18.670 --> 02:09:22.150
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the richest ever self made woman.</v>

3028
02:09:22.450 --> 02:09:26.230
<v Speaker 2>She was worth $4 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had built this company called the</v>

3029
02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:29.950
<v Speaker 2>rhinos right out of college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like 19 when she started the</v>

3030
02:09:29.951 --> 02:09:32.830
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a blood testing company that just</v>

3031
02:09:32.831 --> 02:09:36.880
<v Speaker 2>required a small prick of your blood to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do complicated blood analysis for</v>

3032
02:09:36.881 --> 02:09:40.120
<v Speaker 2>diseases and things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out it didn't work at all.</v>

3033
02:09:40.570 --> 02:09:43.030
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave faked a bunch of shit.</v>

3034
02:09:43.330 --> 02:09:46.620
<v Speaker 2>God spread fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people got their blood tested.</v>

3035
02:09:46.630 --> 02:09:47.770
<v Speaker 2>It turned out to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3036
02:09:47.771 --> 02:09:49.690
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were at risk for all these diseases</v>

3037
02:09:49.691 --> 02:09:53.740
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Warren Buffet have invested $100</v>

3038
02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:55.390
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at one 25,</v>

3039
02:09:55.570 --> 02:09:56.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Betsy Devos,</v>

3040
02:09:56.890 --> 02:09:58.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than a hundred million dollars,</v>

3041
02:09:58.361 --> 02:10:01.090
<v Speaker 2>like all these super wealthy people get</v>
<v Speaker 2>scammed.</v>

3042
02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3043
02:10:02.201 --> 02:10:04.630
<v Speaker 2>When you find out that really wealthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

3044
02:10:04.650 --> 02:10:06.880
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that do this for a living,</v>

3045
02:10:07.090 --> 02:10:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Warren Buffet does that for a living</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he can get scammed out of $125</v>

3046
02:10:15.070 --> 02:10:15.380
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>

3047
02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:16.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3048
02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:16.701
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3049
02:10:16.701 --> 02:10:18.010
<v Speaker 2>and Warren Buffett,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

3050
02:10:18.940 --> 02:10:23.710
<v Speaker 2>his mantra is supposed to be picking</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3051
02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:27.310
<v Speaker 2>the absolute longterm investment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3052
02:10:27.311 --> 02:10:31.180
<v Speaker 2>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not like a Stevie Cohen type who</v>

3053
02:10:31.181 --> 02:10:34.330
<v Speaker 2>just looks at the tape and tries to time</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just right.</v>

3054
02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:38.810
<v Speaker 2>So you can make an investment for 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds and come out with,</v>

3055
02:10:38.811 --> 02:10:39.370
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3056
02:10:39.370 --> 02:10:40.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he,</v>

3057
02:10:40.971 --> 02:10:42.440
<v Speaker 2>if he's investing in a company and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3058
02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:45.230
<v Speaker 2>and even he can be fooled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3059
02:10:45.231 --> 02:10:46.820
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look at Enron.</v>

3060
02:10:46.821 --> 02:10:47.631
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and run was,</v>

3061
02:10:47.631 --> 02:10:51.740
<v Speaker 2>was another example of the world's best</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial analysts were looking at this</v>

3062
02:10:51.741 --> 02:10:56.741
<v Speaker 2>company for a decade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

3063
02:10:57.050 --> 02:10:59.510
<v Speaker 2>the results were completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3064
02:10:59.511 --> 02:11:01.700
<v Speaker 2>it should have been obvious to any lay</v>
<v Speaker 2>person that,</v>

3065
02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:03.553
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3066
02:11:03.590 --> 02:11:06.110
<v Speaker 2>these profit numbers couldn't possibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>be real.</v>

3067
02:11:06.410 --> 02:11:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it wasn't until,</v>

3068
02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:11.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those guys,</v>

3069
02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:12.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it was jim chain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3070
02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:15.830
<v Speaker 2>it was sort of a famous short seller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3071
02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:17.211
<v Speaker 2>sort of said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3072
02:11:17.211 --> 02:11:19.370
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's something up here.</v>

3073
02:11:19.610 --> 02:11:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people continually invested in these</v>

3074
02:11:23.361 --> 02:11:26.330
<v Speaker 2>companies and there's just not a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of oversight that goes on,</v>

3075
02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:27.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3076
02:11:28.010 --> 02:11:29.480
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Wall Street.</v>

3077
02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:32.120
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a major lesson of,</v>

3078
02:11:32.121 --> 02:11:33.140
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3079
02:11:33.290 --> 02:11:36.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last 20 years is that,</v>

3080
02:11:36.860 --> 02:11:38.920
<v Speaker 2>is that there's just not a lot of eyes</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

3081
02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:42.770
<v Speaker 2>on crime in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another example is,</v>

3082
02:11:42.771 --> 02:11:43.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3083
02:11:44.330 --> 02:11:46.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the WHO's the guy scammed all the rich</v>

3084
02:11:46.641 --> 02:11:48.160
<v Speaker 2>people I made off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3085
02:11:48.170 --> 02:11:50.450
<v Speaker 2>I was going to bring him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the most egregious example,</v>

3086
02:11:50.451 --> 02:11:50.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3087
02:11:50.930 --> 02:11:51.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3088
02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:54.110
<v Speaker 2>there are other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are other people who did similar</v>

3089
02:11:54.111 --> 02:11:55.870
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3090
02:11:56.030 --> 02:11:57.920
<v Speaker 2>but this guy didn't even make</v>
<v Speaker 2>investments.</v>

3091
02:11:58.060 --> 02:11:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3092
02:11:58.970 --> 02:12:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was literally just sort of taking</v>

3093
02:12:01.461 --> 02:12:03.680
<v Speaker 2>money and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone cashed out,</v>

3094
02:12:03.681 --> 02:12:04.514
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3095
02:12:04.810 --> 02:12:05.780
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

3096
02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:08.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's that little girl t little t,</v>

3097
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:09.400
<v Speaker 2>little t.</v>

3098
02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3099
02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Just like throwing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a big pile of cash and you know,</v>

3100
02:12:13.491 --> 02:12:15.410
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would take some men and throw some</v>

3101
02:12:15.411 --> 02:12:18.860
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if the SEC had had at any time,</v>

3102
02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:23.120
<v Speaker 2>just looked at his books and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you invested in?</v>

3103
02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all would have,</v>

3104
02:12:25.730 --> 02:12:27.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole house of cards would have</v>

3105
02:12:27.411 --> 02:12:29.580
<v Speaker 2>fallen and invest in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3106
02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:31.850
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't making trades,</v>

3107
02:12:32.090 --> 02:12:33.980
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't doing anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3108
02:12:34.070 --> 02:12:36.920
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there were a bunch of stories like</v>

3109
02:12:36.921 --> 02:12:37.850
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3110
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:42.580
<v Speaker 2>there's a great book called the octopus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about as somebody who did a</v>

3111
02:12:42.581 --> 02:12:45.500
<v Speaker 2>made off like scam and other hedge fund,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3112
02:12:45.590 --> 02:12:46.550
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>

3113
02:12:46.551 --> 02:12:49.580
<v Speaker 2>they weren't really making trades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just sort of creating phony</v>

3114
02:12:49.581 --> 02:12:52.130
<v Speaker 2>profit and loss statements and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3115
02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:55.850
<v Speaker 2>and creating records that look like</v>
<v Speaker 2>trades.</v>

3116
02:12:56.090 --> 02:12:56.691
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could,</v>

3117
02:12:56.691 --> 02:12:59.390
<v Speaker 2>they could tell their investors about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't actually doing</v>

3118
02:12:59.391 --> 02:12:59.780
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

3119
02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:04.730
<v Speaker 2>So if anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any expert at any time had just poke</v>

3120
02:13:04.731 --> 02:13:09.560
<v Speaker 2>their nose into this person's books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have seen it in 10 seconds.</v>

3121
02:13:09.561 --> 02:13:10.221
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3122
02:13:10.221 --> 02:13:12.830
<v Speaker 2>that's the amazing thing about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3123
02:13:13.070 --> 02:13:13.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

3124
02:13:13.610 --> 02:13:15.320
<v Speaker 2>not to get back to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3125
02:13:15.321 --> 02:13:16.700
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my drug dealing book,</v>

3126
02:13:16.701 --> 02:13:18.290
<v Speaker 2>but this is one of the things that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

3127
02:13:18.650 --> 02:13:20.250
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3128
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:22.670
<v Speaker 2>you can be in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3129
02:13:22.671 --> 02:13:26.970
<v Speaker 2>an a poor black neighborhood and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of kids will be on a cell phone</v>

3130
02:13:26.971 --> 02:13:31.971
<v Speaker 2>and talking about selling $10 worth of</v>
<v Speaker 2>weed and there'll be picked up by cops,</v>

3131
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within 20 minutes or something like</v>

3132
02:13:35.641 --> 02:13:37.110
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

3133
02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:38.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody like,</v>

3134
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:39.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3135
02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Bernie madoff can commit hundred million</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar frauds year after year after year</v>

3136
02:13:45.481 --> 02:13:49.980
<v Speaker 2>and not even do any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take any effort to try to cover it up</v>

3137
02:13:49.981 --> 02:13:51.990
<v Speaker 2>all that well and get away with it.</v>

3138
02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie's big crime was that he ripped</v>

3139
02:13:54.181 --> 02:13:55.360
<v Speaker 2>off rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3140
02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:58.110
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he had done the exact same thing to</v>

3141
02:13:58.111 --> 02:14:00.030
<v Speaker 2>poor p,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what he did was just,</v>

3142
02:14:00.031 --> 02:14:04.260
<v Speaker 2>it was just too easy to call what he did</v>
<v Speaker 2>a crime versus what you were talking</v>

3143
02:14:04.261 --> 02:14:06.840
<v Speaker 2>about with these financial institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3144
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3145
02:14:07.891 --> 02:14:08.850
<v Speaker 2>If he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he had lawn,</v>

3146
02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:12.540
<v Speaker 2>if he had laundered it through a</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly more legitimate process,</v>

3147
02:14:12.541 --> 02:14:14.190
<v Speaker 2>he would have gotten out fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

3148
02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:16.560
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

3149
02:14:17.310 --> 02:14:22.020
<v Speaker 2>these scam artists get into it thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're actually gonna be real</v>

3150
02:14:22.021 --> 02:14:23.520
<v Speaker 2>hedge funds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3151
02:14:23.550 --> 02:14:26.190
<v Speaker 2>and that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have some stock pigging system</v>

3152
02:14:26.191 --> 02:14:28.110
<v Speaker 2>that's actually going to make all their</v>
<v Speaker 2>clients Moni.</v>

3153
02:14:28.111 --> 02:14:30.570
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things they find out is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a,</v>

3154
02:14:30.571 --> 02:14:31.380
<v Speaker 2>they suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3155
02:14:31.380 --> 02:14:34.170
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not outperforming the market and</v>

3156
02:14:34.230 --> 02:14:38.670
<v Speaker 2>they're not that smart but be that their</v>
<v Speaker 2>clients can't tell if they just make up</v>

3157
02:14:38.671 --> 02:14:39.504
<v Speaker 2>the numbers.</v>

3158
02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:43.050
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a number of cases of people</v>

3159
02:14:43.051 --> 02:14:46.860
<v Speaker 2>who start out trying to be legitimate</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to be real,</v>

3160
02:14:46.890 --> 02:14:50.590
<v Speaker 2>real investment advisors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they just ended up turning into</v>

3161
02:14:50.610 --> 02:14:53.850
<v Speaker 2>Bernie madoff types because it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy.</v>

3162
02:14:53.851 --> 02:14:55.010
<v Speaker 2>There's no there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

3163
02:14:55.110 --> 02:14:57.060
<v Speaker 2>there aren't that many people watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

3164
02:14:57.330 --> 02:15:00.150
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that that's kind of scary too.</v>

3165
02:15:00.330 --> 02:15:03.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like there's so many people</v>

3166
02:15:04.050 --> 02:15:06.720
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could there be enough people</v>

3167
02:15:06.721 --> 02:15:07.610
<v Speaker 2>watching it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3168
02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Think about how many investment firms</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are and how many different people</v>

3169
02:15:10.501 --> 02:15:15.030
<v Speaker 2>that are involved in trading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could anybody be watching all of it,</v>

3170
02:15:15.170 --> 02:15:15.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3171
02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:16.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>

3172
02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:22.100
<v Speaker 2>But the evens even so even if you take</v>
<v Speaker 2>that into consideration,</v>

3173
02:15:22.651 --> 02:15:24.570
<v Speaker 2>then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the number of eyes that are,</v>

3174
02:15:24.571 --> 02:15:27.660
<v Speaker 2>that are on this world is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is ridiculously low.</v>

3175
02:15:27.661 --> 02:15:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Like take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take Aig.</v>

3176
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Aig was one of the world's largest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3177
02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:36.510
<v Speaker 2>companies that before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before it crashed,</v>

3178
02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:38.880
<v Speaker 2>it had like 180,000 employees.</v>

3179
02:15:39.210 --> 02:15:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3180
02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:45.210
<v Speaker 2>it took advantage of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are loophole that allows financial</v>

3181
02:15:45.211 --> 02:15:47.850
<v Speaker 2>companies to essentially choose their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own regulator.</v>

3182
02:15:48.090 --> 02:15:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so because,</v>

3183
02:15:51.210 --> 02:15:54.780
<v Speaker 2>because aig had a thrift or a savings</v>
<v Speaker 2>and loan,</v>

3184
02:15:54.781 --> 02:15:59.781
<v Speaker 2>that's basically the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They chose to be regulated by the Ots,</v>

3185
02:16:01.710 --> 02:16:03.930
<v Speaker 2>which is the office of thrift</v>
<v Speaker 2>supervision,</v>

3186
02:16:04.290 --> 02:16:06.420
<v Speaker 2>which is this tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny little,</v>

3187
02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:08.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3188
02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:11.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>office in Washington that overseas</v>

3189
02:16:11.581 --> 02:16:14.880
<v Speaker 2>basically savings and loan operations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in,</v>

3190
02:16:15.330 --> 02:16:17.280
<v Speaker 2>in the Ots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

3191
02:16:17.281 --> 02:16:19.170
<v Speaker 2>this is actually true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3192
02:16:19.230 --> 02:16:22.740
<v Speaker 2>they had exactly one insurance expert on</v>
<v Speaker 2>staff.</v>

3193
02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:28.100
<v Speaker 2>So essentially what the world's largest</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance company was being regulated by</v>

3194
02:16:29.290 --> 02:16:32.920
<v Speaker 2>a government office that only had one</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who really understood insurance</v>

3195
02:16:32.921 --> 02:16:33.940
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even,</v>

3196
02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:37.980
<v Speaker 2>and even that person wouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>understood the,</v>

3197
02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:43.000
<v Speaker 2>the part of the company that blew up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was essentially an investment bank</v>

3198
02:16:43.301 --> 02:16:47.350
<v Speaker 2>within the insurance company that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>creating these sort of highly advanced</v>

3199
02:16:47.351 --> 02:16:49.930
<v Speaker 2>sort of derivative operations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3200
02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:54.220
<v Speaker 2>that know that they just would not have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been able to understand that stuff.</v>

3201
02:16:54.220 --> 02:16:59.220
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government just does not place a lot</v>

3202
02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:02.300
<v Speaker 2>of resources into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3203
02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:05.590
<v Speaker 2>keeping an eye on even the most basic</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

3204
02:17:05.650 --> 02:17:09.190
<v Speaker 2>And when you compare that to law</v>
<v Speaker 2>enforcement and other areas,</v>

3205
02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:11.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is how many,</v>

3206
02:17:11.051 --> 02:17:13.810
<v Speaker 2>how many people do we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3207
02:17:13.811 --> 02:17:16.270
<v Speaker 2>worrying about bank bank robberies in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country or,</v>

3208
02:17:16.271 --> 02:17:18.460
<v Speaker 2>or drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3209
02:17:18.461 --> 02:17:21.610
<v Speaker 2>Or how many people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are being watched because their</v>

3210
02:17:21.611 --> 02:17:24.720
<v Speaker 2>marijuana dealers in other states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

3211
02:17:24.770 --> 02:17:28.150
<v Speaker 2>it dwarfs the number of people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching for economic crimes.</v>

3212
02:17:29.300 --> 02:17:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One person,</v>

3213
02:17:31.450 --> 02:17:33.490
<v Speaker 2>I just love the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the name of it.</v>

3214
02:17:33.970 --> 02:17:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Office of thrift supervision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3215
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:37.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3216
02:17:37.001 --> 02:17:39.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even sure it exists anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

3217
02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:42.500
<v Speaker 2>it was merged into some other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3218
02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:47.680
<v Speaker 2>cause there used to be the OCC officer</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the comptroller of the currency and I</v>

3219
02:17:47.681 --> 02:17:51.730
<v Speaker 2>think they created a new regulator out</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of all of that after the crash.</v>

3220
02:17:51.730 --> 02:17:53.230
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3221
02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:55.810
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aig shows it's regulator and it's</v>

3222
02:17:55.811 --> 02:17:57.310
<v Speaker 2>regulator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3223
02:17:57.370 --> 02:17:59.200
<v Speaker 2>was totally overmatched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

3224
02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:02.620
<v Speaker 2>couldn't understand shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the reasons why the</v>

3225
02:18:02.621 --> 02:18:05.500
<v Speaker 2>company blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The company also bill up because it was</v>

3226
02:18:05.501 --> 02:18:10.501
<v Speaker 2>run by insurance people who didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>

3227
02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:13.330
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is basically Wall Street's bookie,</v>

3228
02:18:13.331 --> 02:18:16.270
<v Speaker 2>all these people were betting all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these investment banks were betting on</v>

3229
02:18:16.271 --> 02:18:18.520
<v Speaker 2>whether or not mortgages we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fail or not.</v>

3230
02:18:18.970 --> 02:18:22.720
<v Speaker 2>And Aig was selling the product that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could use,</v>

3231
02:18:23.150 --> 02:18:25.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make those bets essentially.</v>

3232
02:18:25.541 --> 02:18:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Or there were taking on insurance on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on packets of mortgages.</v>

3233
02:18:29.231 --> 02:18:32.050
<v Speaker 2>So if they exploded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would get a payout,</v>

3234
02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:33.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3235
02:18:33.850 --> 02:18:34.930
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3236
02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:37.330
<v Speaker 2>it's like buying an insurance policy on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your neighbor's house.</v>

3237
02:18:37.510 --> 02:18:39.100
<v Speaker 2>If it goes up in flames,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get paid,</v>

3238
02:18:39.340 --> 02:18:42.610
<v Speaker 2>you get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aig was selling a product that allowed</v>

3239
02:18:42.611 --> 02:18:47.020
<v Speaker 2>banks essentially to buy insurance on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on houses,</v>

3240
02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:48.310
<v Speaker 2>on mortgages.</v>

3241
02:18:48.490 --> 02:18:50.590
<v Speaker 2>And if the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people foreclosed,</v>

3242
02:18:51.100 --> 02:18:55.570
<v Speaker 2>if the mortgage is failed or pools of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mortgages failed,</v>

3243
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:57.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

3244
02:18:57.371 --> 02:19:00.130
<v Speaker 2>if you bought that kind of insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got these huge payouts.</v>

3245
02:19:00.131 --> 02:19:03.370
<v Speaker 2>So people were betting against mortgages</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

3246
02:19:03.430 --> 02:19:07.780
<v Speaker 2>And Aig was taking all this book and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

3247
02:19:07.810 --> 02:19:11.320
<v Speaker 2>the heads of the company were old school</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance executives and just didn't</v>

3248
02:19:11.321 --> 02:19:15.810
<v Speaker 2>understand this sort of new fangled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3249
02:19:16.330 --> 02:19:20.980
<v Speaker 2>complicated form of insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they would look at the numbers</v>

3250
02:19:20.981 --> 02:19:23.230
<v Speaker 2>that they were being given.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even they didn't get it.</v>

3251
02:19:23.290 --> 02:19:25.090
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't understand how,</v>

3252
02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:28.970
<v Speaker 2>how exposed they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when all of the bet started going</v>

3253
02:19:28.971 --> 02:19:32.120
<v Speaker 2>the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly they're being asked to pay out</v>

3254
02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:34.930
<v Speaker 2>billions of dollars and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3255
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:36.620
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is this coming from?</v>

3256
02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:38.900
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so even the companies were kind of</v>

3257
02:19:38.930 --> 02:19:41.540
<v Speaker 2>clueless about the shit that was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

3258
02:19:41.570 --> 02:19:43.230
<v Speaker 2>It turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3259
02:19:44.210 --> 02:19:45.170
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3260
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:49.550
<v Speaker 2>if it wasn't for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dummies like me would not understand why</v>

3261
02:19:49.551 --> 02:19:50.450
<v Speaker 2>we should be scared.</v>

3262
02:19:51.220 --> 02:19:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody was scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But reading your,</v>

3263
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:57.740
<v Speaker 2>your articles about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe understand why.</v>

3264
02:19:57.860 --> 02:20:01.070
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he described it as great,</v>

3265
02:20:01.071 --> 02:20:04.250
<v Speaker 2>that you translated this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You actually worked at as trash as a</v>

3266
02:20:04.251 --> 02:20:05.810
<v Speaker 2>translator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3267
02:20:05.811 --> 02:20:06.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate your work,</v>

3268
02:20:06.921 --> 02:20:07.460
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3269
02:20:07.460 --> 02:20:09.680
<v Speaker 2>thank you so much for him to have been a</v>
