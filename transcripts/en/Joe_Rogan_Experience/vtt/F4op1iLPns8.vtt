1
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.190
<v Speaker 1>So it was one of the great challenges in life is knowing enough to think you're</v>

3
00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:11.674
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>but not enough to know you're wrong.</v>

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.441
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

7
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Well that is a big problem with a lot of people that watch these youtube videos.</v>

8
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

9
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.921
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

10
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:20.131
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

11
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:20.701
<v Speaker 1>this is right.</v>

12
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:21.211
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>

13
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>But they don't know enough to know why it's wrong,</v>

14
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>but this is what I wanted to talk to you about.</v>

15
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:24.481
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>what is it about people that there's this,</v>

17
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.410
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

18
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

19
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 1>this very compelling need to find something out that other people don't know.</v>

20
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Like the world is flat,</v>

21
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>like dinosaurs aren't real.</v>

22
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Like that kind of stuff is very compelling to people.</v>

23
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>So what I do in those cases,</v>

24
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:41.431
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

25
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:42.264
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

26
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

28
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.140
<v Speaker 1>so what I do is I would say instead of debating them and some of some of your</v>

29
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>listeners are listening to this right now,</v>

30
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>it's what all I would do is say,</v>

31
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 1>what is your best single bit of evidence for what you're claiming</v>

32
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.300
<v Speaker 1>and what would it take to show that you're wrong?</v>

33
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.483
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

34
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>well let's go get a simple one.</v>

35
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.731
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

36
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:08.971
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

37
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:13.971
<v Speaker 1>so that's what I would ask and I've done this exercise and it doesn't work.</v>

38
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

39
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

40
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Because there was a guy who didn't believe we went to the moon.</v>

41
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>We spent a third of our time in our last session,</v>

42
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>goes into there.</v>

43
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.150
<v Speaker 1>So there's someone I know who doesn't believe he went to the moon rather than</v>

44
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>just say he's skeptical.</v>

45
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

46
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>what kind of evidence would convince you?</v>

47
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>He said images of the landing site of the Apollo missions.</v>

48
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.311
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

49
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:36.144
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

50
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>here's a website where we sent a,</v>

51
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.281
<v Speaker 1>if I wasn't west,</v>

52
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:40.921
<v Speaker 1>it was the Chinese.</v>

53
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I think Chinese or Europeans sent aced a probe to an orbiter,</v>

54
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>to the moon.</v>

55
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>So it was close enough because ground based telescopes are not,</v>

56
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.610
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

57
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the resolution to see the landing sites.</v>

58
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>But via close enough to the moon you can the.</v>

59
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>It photographed the entire surface of the moon.</v>

60
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.030
<v Speaker 1>And there were the landing sites and you saw the rover tracks and the base for</v>

61
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>the lunar module.</v>

62
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>And so he,</v>

63
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>that night he went home and found it and then he came back and says,</v>

64
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

65
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>NASA could have faked that.</v>

66
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

67
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.773
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with you.</v>

68
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Speaker 1>We have no more to talk about because he's not ready to be convinced.</v>

69
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:19.081
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird.</v>

71
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Because he gave him the evidence he asked for exactly that would convince him</v>

72
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>and it did not convince them.</v>

73
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that's going on here,</v>

74
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 1>which is still a theory I'm working on,</v>

75
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>but there seems to be a disturbing peek at what a matriarchy would be like.</v>

76
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.560
<v Speaker 1>And I'm seeing a lot of women in these movements who are sort of vindictive and</v>

77
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.513
<v Speaker 1>cruel.</v>

78
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.650
<v Speaker 1>And like this woman we're talking about,</v>

79
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>you watch these videos and you hear like,</v>

82
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>fuck 'em up these women's voices from behind the crowd.</v>

83
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>And I called them shit chest.</v>

84
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Let's that woman from the University of Missouri.</v>

85
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Can I get some muscle over here?</v>

86
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Remember her?</v>

87
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

88
00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:55.871
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

89
00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:56.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

90
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

91
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>She wants men to fight on her behalf.</v>

92
00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

93
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Ironman has that blue thing in his chest.</v>

94
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think women are evil.</v>

95
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>I like our women are like ironman there magic,</v>

96
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

97
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>but by ripping out that blue thing,</v>

98
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>you're ripping up the ability to have children and be mothers and everything,</v>

99
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>and then you put in a piece of shit into iron man's chest.</v>

100
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>That's what feminist and like this woman are there.</v>

101
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:17.764
<v Speaker 1>Shit chests.</v>

102
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.070
<v Speaker 1>They're malfunctioning robots and they're like,</v>

103
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.490
<v Speaker 1>this kill him.</v>

104
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Milo wants genocide killing.</v>

105
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that they're imitating what they think are patriarchal</v>

106
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:29.861
<v Speaker 1>societies?</v>

107
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>They're doing their version of it and that's what they're doing with this.</v>

108
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 1>The whole matriarchal posturing.</v>

109
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:35.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like Clark Kent,</v>

111
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I want to run an article.</v>

112
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing.</v>

113
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

114
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.320
<v Speaker 1>you're not running a clerk.</v>

115
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Simmer down,</v>

116
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

117
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 1>You write your article.</v>

118
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing mine.</v>

119
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.443
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

120
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Can he crunches up?</v>

121
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.260
<v Speaker 1>There's not a whole lot of matriarchal societies in the animal world other than</v>

122
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:54.094
<v Speaker 1>hyenas.</v>

123
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 1>I try.</v>

124
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a few of them is a few where the females are larger than the males.</v>

125
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>A few bugs especially,</v>

126
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>but hyenas in particular,</v>

127
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>the female hyenas are much larger than the males.</v>

128
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:07.350
<v Speaker 1>They even have fake Dick's penis.</v>

129
00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>He has this big large tube fake Dick that hangs down.</v>

130
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>They actually give birth out of it and they climb on top of the males and they</v>

131
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>fucked him and the speculation,</v>

132
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

133
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of speculation as to why the females are bigger,</v>

134
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>but one of them is that they think that she has to be bigger because Nina's are</v>

135
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>so god damn ruthless.</v>

136
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>They eat their babies.</v>

137
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

138
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:29.590
<v Speaker 1>So the female has to go get the fuck away from the booby good to when she gets</v>

139
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>on top of books.</v>

140
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

141
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.130
<v Speaker 1>you piece of shit did.</v>

142
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.240
<v Speaker 1>It's my baby.</v>

143
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no more,</v>

144
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>no pun intended,</v>

146
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>dog eat dog world than a fucking Hyena world.</v>

147
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.320
<v Speaker 1>You're out there fighting for scraps with lions.</v>

148
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

149
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

150
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I actually have described Antifa and these people as hygienists because that</v>

151
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>thing I was talking about at Berkeley where there are guys went in and said,</v>

152
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 1>I thought you guys were tough or something,</v>

153
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 1>was his exact quote and they're going to get him,</v>

154
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:53.801
<v Speaker 1>get him,</v>

155
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:54.634
<v Speaker 1>fuck him up.</v>

156
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>And then the guys sort of give up because no one wants to fight them.</v>

157
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.260
<v Speaker 1>They start walking away and then someone runs up behind him,</v>

158
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>knocks him out with a flag pole as they're screaming easy Italian slogans by the</v>

159
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:04.070
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

160
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.450
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

161
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

162
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 1>she's thought the flashy stuff from the 19 twenties having fun.</v>

163
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.290
<v Speaker 1>They knock yet game.</v>

164
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.510
<v Speaker 1>They're larping and then knocked him out and then as soon as he's out that the</v>

165
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>hyenas come out and then they start kicking his unconscious body and they start</v>

166
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.341
<v Speaker 1>grabbing.</v>

167
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>They're really little.</v>

168
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

169
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

170
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:20.441
<v Speaker 1>it's online.</v>

171
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:21.110
<v Speaker 1>You can find.</v>

172
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>I have people that I talked to,</v>

173
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>professionals,</v>

174
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.391
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

175
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 1>obviously like sports psychologists or sports psychologist.</v>

176
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 1>And then you got to get a psychologist in general to deal with the depression,</v>

177
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.041
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

178
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:33.990
<v Speaker 1>When you hit your lows,</v>

179
00:05:33.991 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 1>like it's okay to,</v>

180
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.340
<v Speaker 1>to get,</v>

181
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 1>if you're bench pressing 350 pounds,</v>

183
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.600
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to have a little touch.</v>

184
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 1>It's okay to have a little spot here and there,</v>

185
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 1>and then after you get a couple of spots,</v>

187
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.930
<v Speaker 1>now after a while you can do it yourself.</v>

188
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 1>You don't need the spot anymore.</v>

189
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 1>That's how I look at psychiatric help to an extent.</v>

190
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:51.521
<v Speaker 1>For some people,</v>

191
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're battling depression.</v>

192
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you just need a floaty and you did,</v>

193
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.130
<v Speaker 1>and then you can take the floaties off after a year.</v>

194
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.090
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

195
00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.731
<v Speaker 2>see what I'm saying?</v>

196
00:05:58.731 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a mental,</v>

197
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 2>it's a mental floaty and it's okay because we all hit low part low points in our</v>

198
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 2>life where it's unbearable and you either allow it to continue to be unbearable</v>

199
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 2>and just deny it or you deal with the task at hand and say,</v>

200
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little low right now.</v>

201
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:13.651
<v Speaker 2>I need the floaties.</v>

202
00:06:13.651 --> 00:06:14.484
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

203
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll get through this,</v>

204
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 2>and then when you take the photos off,</v>

205
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 2>you realize I only needed them for a little bit of time and now I'm okay.</v>

206
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:21.074
<v Speaker 2>I'm here,</v>

207
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 2>and that's kind of what it felt like.</v>

208
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like I just needed a little bit of a push.</v>

209
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 2>I needed to get through this and learn some things about my own,</v>

210
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.680
<v Speaker 2>my own mind and understand my own emotions and understand that I didn't need all</v>

211
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 2>these things that I was thinking where it real.</v>

212
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 2>It was me not being in control of my own emotions,</v>

213
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 2>your own emotions or your choice and I chose to feel trapped.</v>

214
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I chose to be sad.</v>

215
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 2>I chose to feel like I was Jack Shit.</v>

216
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I chose all these things and it's like you don't need fighting to be these</v>

217
00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:49.371
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

218
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:50.204
<v Speaker 2>You need to.</v>

219
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.270
<v Speaker 2>You need to let go of fighting to learn that you are something without it,</v>

220
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 2>and that was actually a gift.</v>

221
00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.890
<v Speaker 2>It became a gift because I learned so much in life now bigger than fighting.</v>

222
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 2>I look at the things that I went through as a gift because I have gotten the</v>

223
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:06.470
<v Speaker 2>gift of feeling</v>

224
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 2>retired during my career.</v>

225
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Who else gets that?</v>

226
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Some people retire for five years,</v>

227
00:07:17.031 --> 00:07:18.170
<v Speaker 2>lose their freaking mind,</v>

228
00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:21.410
<v Speaker 2>end up in the bar and come back and try to fight again 10 years later with a</v>

229
00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:22.244
<v Speaker 2>weakened body,</v>

230
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.190
<v Speaker 2>a mess or abuse.</v>

231
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

232
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:25.723
<v Speaker 2>Why though?</v>

233
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Why are they doing that?</v>

234
00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing it because they're physically capable.</v>

235
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 2>They're doing it because they never dealt with their life away from fighting.</v>

236
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Fighting was there like fighting is who they are.</v>

237
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 2>Fighting is their persona,</v>

238
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 2>so take away fighting.</v>

239
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.933
<v Speaker 2>What are they?</v>

240
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.250
<v Speaker 2>They're in the bar drinking away with.</v>

241
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.084
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

242
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Instead of drinking,</v>

243
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 2>putting the booze down and knowing what you are without fighting,</v>

244
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.580
<v Speaker 2>being happy with that chapter of your life and being able to live who you are.</v>

245
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten to feel that and now I can fight with a peace of mind,</v>

246
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 2>knowing how good I am without fighting and how great I am with it too.</v>

247
00:07:58.910 --> 00:07:59.860
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

248
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.083
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

249
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 2>that's what this thing's about.</v>

250
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.421
<v Speaker 2>All these fights,</v>

251
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:08.720
<v Speaker 2>all these me attacking those challenges coming back and winning and getting my</v>

252
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:09.554
<v Speaker 2>belt back.</v>

253
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.903
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

254
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.780
<v Speaker 2>that could only happen because I let go of control of the things I couldn't</v>

255
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:15.350
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

256
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.591
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

257
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:16.040
<v Speaker 3>But here's,</v>

258
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.340
<v Speaker 3>here's part of the problem when you're talking about people who troll online,</v>

259
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 3>go back to when you were a young liberal and you thought that if I was a doctor</v>

260
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 3>and I was making $3 million a year course,</v>

261
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.050
<v Speaker 3>I should be given 70 percent in taxes.</v>

262
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.970
<v Speaker 3>You don't have that.</v>

263
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.080
<v Speaker 3>So you're looking at the people who do in this part of you is like,</v>

264
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:32.721
<v Speaker 3>give it away,</v>

265
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:33.261
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

266
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:33.741
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't do.</v>

267
00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:34.670
<v Speaker 3>You don't deserve it.</v>

268
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:35.504
<v Speaker 3>Give it away.</v>

269
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 3>That same mentality exists with trolls.</v>

270
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.220
<v Speaker 3>They don't have anything going on.</v>

271
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.380
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking losers for the most part,</v>

272
00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:43.214
<v Speaker 3>so what do they want to do?</v>

273
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.900
<v Speaker 3>They want to burn it all down.</v>

274
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 3>They want the whole thing burned down.</v>

275
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Go trump,</v>

276
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 3>go try.</v>

277
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.990
<v Speaker 3>The reason why they want to say go trump is because they want this clearly</v>

278
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 3>maniacal person to just throw a fucking monkey wrench into the gears and watched</v>

279
00:08:58.531 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 3>the whole system explode.</v>

280
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 3>That's half of what they're doing.</v>

281
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a vested interest in it.</v>

282
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>

283
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 3>They're not successful.</v>

284
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.020
<v Speaker 3>They're not happy.</v>

285
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.190
<v Speaker 3>They're not doing well.</v>

286
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.310
<v Speaker 3>I think their roles,</v>
