13
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 2>It feels like it feels like it was here</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two days ago.</v>

14
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're drinking too much on the</v>

15
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely was drinking too much.</v>

16
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

17
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to my,</v>

18
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 2>the last tour I ended up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make,</v>

19
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ended up in the emergency room in the</v>

20
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:56.090
<v Speaker 2>last tour with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

21
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.370
<v Speaker 2>with the Ivs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fucking real shit.</v>

22
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went a little too.</v>

23
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

24
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 2>They said it was kind of just exhaustion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

25
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.330
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

26
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the normal.</v>

27
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I think that people at the emergency</v>
<v Speaker 2>room wouldn't believe me that it wasn't,</v>

28
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on hardcore drugs because they come in</v>

29
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking out of it.</v>

30
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 2>And I am</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

31
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.451
<v Speaker 2>where you been?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

32
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I've been out on tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I go,</v>

33
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what's up and they torched it on</v>

34
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 2>my blood work and there was no shit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

35
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 2>And then nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

36
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was honestly kind of just</v>

37
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 2>meet at what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find some kind of like vibe,</v>

38
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 2>like a bug or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just bug that I had been on.</v>

39
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 2>That probably was more of it than I</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

40
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:44.451
<v Speaker 2>but I really do think it was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of nonstop every night rocking out</v>

41
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing it a little too hard.</v>

42
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 2>So you really did wind up in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>emergency room?</v>

43
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

44
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 2>it was that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the official diagnosis was just</v>

45
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 2>exhaustion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What were you worried about?</v>

46
00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Like what did you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't think you could just go to</v>

47
00:01:58.561 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 2>sleep?</v>

48
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 2>Like how does one go to the emergency</v>
<v Speaker 2>room?</v>

49
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened was I,</v>

50
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was off the tour and had a meeting</v>

51
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.950
<v Speaker 2>with some managers and shit and in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting I fucking barfed like in a,</v>

52
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.290
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a nice building.</v>

53
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 2>We're in a nice building talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit rush.</v>

54
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the shit that rick</v>
<v Speaker 2>is over here doing it with like guys in</v>

55
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 2>suits and I fucking threw up on myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

56
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you okay?</v>

57
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I am in,</v>

58
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 2>they hand me a banana to get some food</v>
<v Speaker 2>in me and I couldn't peel the banana.</v>

59
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 2>So then I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drove myself to the emergency room,</v>

60
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.180
<v Speaker 2>couldn't peel the banana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have the strength to open a</v>

61
00:02:31.181 --> 00:02:32.560
<v Speaker 2>banana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

62
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do now.</v>

63
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I,</v>

64
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:40.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drove myself to the emergency room and</v>

65
00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:43.240
<v Speaker 2>they hooked me up to ivs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like put me on fluids and everything.</v>

66
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Just to give you an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

67
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.840
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when they finally said I was good to</v>

68
00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:48.250
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went back out and I couldn't fucking</v>

69
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:51.790
<v Speaker 2>find my car</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just checked my parking ticket.</v>

70
00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:52.720
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's this lot?</v>

71
00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:55.450
<v Speaker 2>And I called the guy on the lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

72
00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your cars in here.</v>

73
00:02:56.921 --> 00:03:01.921
<v Speaker 2>It's the windows are down and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess apparently I just drove myself</v>

74
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 2>to the emergency room and fucking close</v>
<v Speaker 2>the doors and walked into the emergency</v>

75
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:07.054
<v Speaker 2>room and said help me.</v>

76
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.683

<v Speaker 2>while he was,</v>

79
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 2>we talked about last time a guy who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big help to me.</v>

80
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Then I was just like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I didn't know I had a bug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was just pure exhaustion,</v>

84
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 2>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't that sound like the old rock,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like heroin excuse,</v>

86
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.540

<v Speaker 2>he has to cancel a tour.</v>

87
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 2>And I reached out to Sturgis and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

90
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.733
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

91
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.310
<v Speaker 2>it's mental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical,</v>

00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fatiguing,</v>

93
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I need to figure out a way.</v>

94
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:40.803
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

95
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 2>I forget who you were talking to a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks ago talking about um,</v>

96
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 2>talking spirits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit about suicide and stuff and about</v>

97
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 2>how exercise is such an important part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that and I've been on a pretty</v>

98
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 2>vigorous.</v>

99
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell,</v>

100
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:56.940
<v Speaker 2>but I've been running a ton which you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been running to and um,</v>

101
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to a doctor recently and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

102
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

103
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 2>he told me about a study they did with</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

104
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.910
<v Speaker 2>with like $200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told me he was like a couple,</v>

105
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.880
<v Speaker 2>the 200 depressed people and the study</v>
<v Speaker 2>was half of them.</v>

106
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 2>They gave Prozac the other half they put</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a strict like running regimen.</v>

107
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 2>They said there was no difference</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the two.</v>

108
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like they both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were both helped a ton and the,</v>

109
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 2>the running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give out,</v>

110
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical information,</v>

111
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:27.154
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

112
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The woman I had on Kelly Brogan,</v>

113
00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:32.720
<v Speaker 3>she's a psychiatrist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said that it's more effective.</v>

114
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.450
<v Speaker 3>That exercise is actually more effective</v>
<v Speaker 3>than psych meds.</v>

115
00:04:35.451 --> 00:04:36.284
<v Speaker 3>I'm wondering</v>

116
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.130
<v Speaker 2>just the fact that a doctor told me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes me think that he was airing on,</v>

117
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he still wants to sell the drugs,</v>

118
00:04:41.541 --> 00:04:46.190
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just wondering if like um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I started when I fucking run,</v>

119
00:04:46.191 --> 00:04:48.950
<v Speaker 2>I feel fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can't do it in cowboy boots and</v>

120
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:49.784
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

121
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.230
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to wake when you're on,</v>

122
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 2>when you do the tours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tours just hard to wake up before</v>

123
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.300
<v Speaker 2>showing.</v>

124
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard.</v>

125
00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:58.700
<v Speaker 3>But you gotta do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to do it.</v>

126
00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:00.480
<v Speaker 3>Like it's brushing your teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

127
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just something that is.</v>

128
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.530
<v Speaker 3>If you give yourself the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you won't do it,</v>

129
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.540
<v Speaker 3>then you won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

130
00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:09.650
<v Speaker 3>And I think in my back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my head,</v>

131
00:05:09.651 --> 00:05:10.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this is a tour,</v>

132
00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:13.250
<v Speaker 3>this is a little vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little break and that's just,</v>

133
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.900
<v Speaker 3>that's why I need it the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to start.</v>

134
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.090
<v Speaker 3>When you think about it as a tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what you think about?</v>

135
00:05:17.091 --> 00:05:19.020
<v Speaker 3>I think about it as work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about his work,</v>

136
00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:21.920
<v Speaker 3>but I think about it as like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my excuse for not.</v>

137
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.511
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely.</v>

138
00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:25.560
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely more work than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

139
00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:27.350
<v Speaker 3>The human brain seeks comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

140
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.010
<v Speaker 3>We like to fuck ourselves up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to take those little nap so you</v>

141
00:05:31.011 --> 00:05:34.160
<v Speaker 3>don't really need and blow things off</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you really should do.</v>

142
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.700
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weird Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like if I don't get up and fight,</v>

154
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 2>don't make sure there's someone there</v>
<v Speaker 2>making me do all that shit.</v>

155
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.340
<v Speaker 2>I ain't going to do the tour because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been looking at your tour online</v>

156
00:06:08.341 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But looking at some of the photos and</v>

157
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 2>videos from your shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're insane.</v>

158
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been pretty crazy.</v>

159
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing giant places.</v>

160
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

161
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping that it gets bigger.</v>

162
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:21.860
<v Speaker 2>But it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been fun.</v>

163
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:23.050
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a um,</v>

164
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.810
<v Speaker 2>it's been a fucking blast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

165
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

166
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 2>one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to change the subject,</v>

167

172
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:41.960

<v Speaker 2>bring.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't like bring it out like to</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

175
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.540

<v Speaker 2>it's almost like,</v>

176
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 2>these are kind of silly now because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave it to one guy.</v>

177
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:52.440
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my man,</v>

178
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 2>you give it to somebody that their</v>
<v Speaker 2>desktop,</v>

179
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.400
<v Speaker 2>their laptop doesn't even have a CD</v>
<v Speaker 2>player and you're like,</v>

180
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 2>thanks for the CD.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll throw it in the back of the car and</v>

181
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 2>load it up and listened to it in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

182
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Most cars still have a CD player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bet they'll stop pretty soon.</v>

183
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:06.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

184
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.060
<v Speaker 3>I used to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an Acura NSX and had a cassette player</v>

185
00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:13.600
<v Speaker 3>and is still the cell phone holders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where they're putting the thing</v>

186
00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:15.880
<v Speaker 3>to hold them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now instead of put it in your error,</v>

187
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.960
<v Speaker 3>dear air filter thing or the AC comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>out to clip on that.</v>

188
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.690
<v Speaker 3>There's like a little thing that spreads</v>
<v Speaker 3>out to this fits in the CD slot.</v>

189
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.300
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking up space.</v>

190
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what my new thing is everywhere I</v>

191
00:07:26.531 --> 00:07:26.950
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

192
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:27.970
<v Speaker 2>I ran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran a car.</v>

193
00:07:27.971 --> 00:07:31.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll get to the airport and rent a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right in the first 20 minutes is mason</v>

194
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 2>in that fucking car trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bluetooth and it.</v>

195
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Every time you find that it just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>every fucking one.</v>

196
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.780
<v Speaker 2>They make it so fucking impaler</v>

197
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love cadillacs,</v>

198
00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:43.420
<v Speaker 3>but God damn that escalate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Infotainment system is a piece of shit.</v>

199
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.360
<v Speaker 3>It's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to work.</v>

200
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Apparently they switched it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're going to do apple car play,</v>

201
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:50.770
<v Speaker 3>which is infinitely better.</v>

202
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.780
<v Speaker 2>You might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uber driver had that the other day I</v>

203
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.560
<v Speaker 2>asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally had something to talk about with</v>

204
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:55.700
<v Speaker 2>my uber driver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was telling me,</v>

205
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:57.450
<v Speaker 2>explain it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked like the whole interface was</v>

206
00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:57.980
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

207
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a phone.</v>

208
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 3>It's not the whole interface because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

209
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 3>you can't get most of your apps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you get things like messages,</v>

210
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Speaker 3>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things on the science.</v>

211
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the good.</v>

212
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was kind of getting to before is,</v>

213
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:11.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about the crowds and shit,</v>

214
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 2>which was when I first put out these</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy records of mine,</v>

215
00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:16.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

216
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:17.090
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

217
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.520
<v Speaker 2>the assumption was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

218
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:19.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nowhere,</v>

219
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.280
<v Speaker 2>there's nowhere to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to terrestrial radio won't play</v>

220
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:24.260
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't doing all that shit,</v>

221
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to kiss your ass too</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

222
00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:27.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that.</v>

223
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:29.940
<v Speaker 2>But it was kind of finding this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

224
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.570
<v Speaker 2>this is all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's fucking equal now.</v>

225
00:08:33.571 --> 00:08:35.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was kind of the big breakthrough</v>

226
00:08:35.461 --> 00:08:39.910
<v Speaker 2>for me was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did a few weeks ago,</v>

227
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:42.610
<v Speaker 2>did Joey Coco Diaz who's my new favorite</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking dude,</v>

228
00:08:42.611 --> 00:08:45.130
<v Speaker 2>this is the best time I'm now in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rogan world.</v>

229
00:08:45.131 --> 00:08:46.450
<v Speaker 2>I did that and Bert Kreischer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

230
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.350
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like doing the tonight show.</v>

231
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Then like Colby and I'm telling you</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things and I've got numbers to</v>

232
00:08:54.431 --> 00:08:55.264
<v Speaker 2>prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

233
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 2>there is no mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you go to the backdoor and</v>

234
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 2>do all this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

235
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 2>it's bigger than that fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What mainstream media if you.</v>

236
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.900
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual numbers that they get,</v>

237
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.410
<v Speaker 3>it's not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a good show on CNN,</v>

238
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>might get a million,</v>

239
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.240
<v Speaker 3>a million and a half views.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we got a million and a half</v>

240
00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:15.800
<v Speaker 3>downloads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've pretty bummed out.</v>

241
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy because the week I came in</v>

242
00:09:18.281 --> 00:09:19.300

244
00:09:24.491 --> 00:09:25.271
<v Speaker 2>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have them,</v>

245
00:09:25.271 --> 00:09:29.770
<v Speaker 2>but they said</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sold more albums from being on here.</v>

246
00:09:29.771 --> 00:09:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Then the artists that we did on snl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is,</v>

247
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.540
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is snl get what kind of uses</v>

<v Speaker 2>do they make it to the music?</v>

254
00:09:49.361 --> 00:09:50.610

<v Speaker 2>They're just there now.</v>

255
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Some funny.</v>

256
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.290
<v Speaker 3>Well not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't watch the whole thing because</v>

00:09:53.291 --> 00:09:56.560
<v Speaker 3>snl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love snl sometimes.</v>

258
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.770
<v Speaker 3>SNL is one of those things though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fuck you like 70 percent of the</v>

259
00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:00.640
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

260
00:10:00.641 --> 00:10:03.130
<v Speaker 3>I got really pissed about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And point 7 million views,</v>

261
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the rock.</v>

262
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.430
<v Speaker 3>That's a one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

263
00:10:06.431 --> 00:10:07.600
<v Speaker 3>the finale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

264
00:10:07.601 --> 00:10:11.950
<v Speaker 3>So that's their big one of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the other big one is smaller than</v>

265
00:10:11.951 --> 00:10:14.380
<v Speaker 3>yours and normal one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

266
00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:18.640
<v Speaker 3>Melissa Mccarthy was 10 million of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>top two.</v>

267
00:10:18.641 --> 00:10:22.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our top one for the year was Alex</v>

268
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.130
<v Speaker 3>Jones at 15 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then number two be Neil.</v>

269
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.013
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

270
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones got put out of country</v>
<v Speaker 2>record.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Reptilians and black helicopters and he</v>

272
00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:36.100
<v Speaker 2>could do it too from Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit would sell.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

279
00:10:49.661 --> 00:10:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is not for lawyer reasons,</v>

280
00:10:52.181 --> 00:10:55.810
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sturgill Simpson is not</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to get that on the record last</v>

282

<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>

283
00:11:01.751 --> 00:11:03.520
<v Speaker 2>I may have mentioned that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you did.</v>

284
00:11:03.521 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 2>I think you said he worked for James</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comey and he was a.</v>

285
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>some hits on the site.</v>

289
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:24.010
<v Speaker 2>The lawyer part of me says no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the sensible part of me,</v>

290
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.140
<v Speaker 2>he's doing some dates in Europe with</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Prine.</v>

291
00:11:26.141 --> 00:11:28.840

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:44.620
<v Speaker 2>Almost call them like more like folk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's more in that kind of.</v>

299
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Isabel struck him in spiritual Sharon</v>
<v Speaker 2>office in Nashville.</v>

300
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bells in a weird category,</v>

301
00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:50.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's kind of country,</v>

302
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.480
<v Speaker 2>but he's also kind of folk at this days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know nowadays what the fuck his</v>

303
00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:57.730
<v Speaker 2>country who the funder is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I complain about all the time,</v>

304
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jason Isbell is a bad motherfucker</v>

305
00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh dear.</v>

306
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 2>He damaged as I heard a few songs from</v>
<v Speaker 2>his new record.</v>

307
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:04.654
<v Speaker 2>Sounds killer.</v>

308
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's going to ruffle some</v>

309
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:09.220
<v Speaker 2>feathers too because it sounds like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little political,</v>

310
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:10.690
<v Speaker 2>which is a no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no in that world,</v>

311
00:12:10.691 --> 00:12:11.524
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

312
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a crazy day.</v>

313
00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:16.630
<v Speaker 2>Did you watching that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit this morning.</v>

314
00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Call me stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't watch it.</v>

315
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Did you watch it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched some of it,</v>

316
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like it was a waste.</v>

317
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:27.511
<v Speaker 2>It's just like shit we knew before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like politicians lie a Komi.</v>

318
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 2>It was like I felt like we knew well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see.</v>

319
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:34.470
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see anything fucking knew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's way too easy to fire</v>

320
00:12:34.471 --> 00:12:36.670
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you could just decide you don't</v>

321
00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:39.400
<v Speaker 2>like what he's doing at firearm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't seem to be any like real</v>

322
00:12:39.401 --> 00:12:41.620
<v Speaker 2>clear definitive reason why he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>fired.</v>

323
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.833
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like the,</v>

324
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.640
<v Speaker 2>like the main news is like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians lie,</v>

325
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:47.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>news flash and the other one was like,</v>

326
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can make the point that like trump</v>

327
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:51.484
<v Speaker 2>is a different.</v>

328
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.070
<v Speaker 2>It's different than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most presidents were like he used to</v>

329
00:12:54.071 --> 00:12:55.180
<v Speaker 2>host a reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Shit.</v>

330
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:57.130
<v Speaker 2>We knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was their big takeaway.</v>

331
00:12:57.131 --> 00:13:01.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like two hours of fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just used the time to fucking tweet</v>

332
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:04.420
<v Speaker 2>about my new record saying how I kept</v>
<v Speaker 2>tweeting that James Comey was.</v>

333
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.240
<v Speaker 2>It was all code for my new record that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wanted people to buy it.</v>

334
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.200
<v Speaker 2>I know I saw some instagram posts that</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a Colombian endorsing your album.</v>

335
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

336
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:12.850
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

337
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.490
<v Speaker 2>he said he wanted to talk about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the hearings because that's a big</v>

338
00:13:15.491 --> 00:13:16.161
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

339
00:13:16.161 --> 00:13:18.210
<v Speaker 2>apparently they wouldn't let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

340
00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.530
<v Speaker 2>collusion between me and comey would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have fucked things up.</v>

341
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that Russians have colluded with Sony</v>
<v Speaker 2>records to like have him out sell me and</v>

350

<v Speaker 2>I was telling you before I did joey,</v>

381
00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Coco Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bert Kreischer,</v>

382
00:14:57.411 --> 00:14:58.340
<v Speaker 2>like all these dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

383
00:14:58.341 --> 00:15:01.340
<v Speaker 2>it's cool to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cool because I went into the second</v>

384
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:01.851
<v Speaker 2>album,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

385
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:04.130
<v Speaker 2>I gotta make my fucking money back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

386
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.350
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't about the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying it's like,</v>

387
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.600
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be the same shit again.</v>

388
00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:12.110
<v Speaker 2>But like no one I have these other</v>
<v Speaker 2>places to go now is so fucking great.</v>

389
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's,</v>

390
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.850
<v Speaker 4>there's a transition happening and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think for the longest time they always</v>

391
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:21.851
<v Speaker 4>felt like the whole idea of mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 4>media like that was just going to be</v>

392
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.520
<v Speaker 4>locked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was going to be the case forever.</v>

393
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.200
<v Speaker 4>It's CBS,</v>
<v Speaker 4>NBC,</v>

394
00:15:27.201 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 4>the Cable News Networks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were gonna be there forever.</v>

395
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.130
<v Speaker 4>That's not really the case anymore.</v>

396
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:32.680
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

397
00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:34.510
<v Speaker 2>I've got the numbers to prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

398
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.210
<v Speaker 2>I came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was telling me,</v>

399
00:15:37.211 --> 00:15:39.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't get on fucking good morning</v>

400
00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:41.110
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be on fucking terrestrial</v>

401
00:15:41.111 --> 00:15:44.290
<v Speaker 2>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just kind of lucked into finding</v>

402
00:15:44.291 --> 00:15:46.330
<v Speaker 2>this and you guys been being supportive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>

403
00:15:46.331 --> 00:15:48.940
<v Speaker 2>It's just like these things are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

404
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.130
<v Speaker 2>it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I saw Mark Marin,</v>

405
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.310
<v Speaker 2>some guy was tweeting to him like how</v>
<v Speaker 2>your podcasts fucking,</v>

406
00:15:55.311 --> 00:15:56.790
<v Speaker 2>it ain't the tonight show or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>

407
00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.530
<v Speaker 2>he said something back to the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

408
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.780
<v Speaker 2>it's just all media now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of how I look at it.</v>

409
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.060
<v Speaker 2>It's all fucking even where.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

410
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean you guys are probably bigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

411
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.420
<v Speaker 2>you know what they quote unquote</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream media.</v>

412
00:16:10.421 --> 00:16:13.060
<v Speaker 2>But it's to me it's just all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all part of the same fucking thing.</v>

413
00:16:13.061 --> 00:16:13.841
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

414
00:16:13.841 --> 00:16:14.080
<v Speaker 2>what's up</v>

415
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.740
<v Speaker 4>bigger and what's more popular as all</v>
<v Speaker 4>kinds of silly thing that's different is</v>

416
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.190
<v Speaker 4>that if you go to mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go to television shows for the</v>

417
00:16:21.191 --> 00:16:24.370
<v Speaker 4>most part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to get 100 percent</v>

418
00:16:24.371 --> 00:16:25.450
<v Speaker 4>dedicated audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get.</v>

419
00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:27.100
<v Speaker 4>People are just flipping through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>channels.</v>

420
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.280
<v Speaker 4>So some people might fall upon them</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they were looking for it.</v>

421
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:33.160
<v Speaker 4>But a whole lot of people I just going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be flipping channels.</v>

422
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.113
<v Speaker 4>Like what's on</v>

423
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.740
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the people who listen to you,</v>

424
00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.680
<v Speaker 2>like that's why the first pod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want this whole podcast to be a</v>

425
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.900
<v Speaker 2>review of the last one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I wouldn't mind because I had a</v>

426
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:42.734
<v Speaker 2>blast.</v>

<v Speaker 2>people watch while he's playing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking video games,</v>

498
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.890
<v Speaker 2>he was singing my songs just along to</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

509
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.430
<v Speaker 2>that's where other artists would just be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

510
00:20:16.431 --> 00:20:17.001
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

512
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:18.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>

513
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.920
<v Speaker 2>So I went on his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he posted an interview with me on his</v>

514
00:20:21.921 --> 00:20:24.650
<v Speaker 2>youtube page and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that it was huge,</v>

515
00:20:24.651 --> 00:20:26.470
<v Speaker 2>but it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I not saying well?</v>

516
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.520
<v Speaker 2>I say no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>

517
00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:28.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all.</v>

518
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all fucking.</v>

519
00:20:29.451 --> 00:20:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Even though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

520
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.523
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

521
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.840
<v Speaker 4>might not even be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even guys like that pooty pie guy.</v>

522
00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:38.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much he's dropped off</v>
<v Speaker 4>since the nazi controversy,</v>

523
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.760
<v Speaker 4>but that guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has millions and millions of</v>

524
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.260
<v Speaker 4>downloads for every single thing he</v>
<v Speaker 4>does.</v>

525
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.950
<v Speaker 4>Like he might be above mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I give you that.</v>

526
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the reasons why he</v>
<v Speaker 2>felt like they were going after and like</v>

527
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:53.590
<v Speaker 2>the wall street journal went after him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was at the Washington post,</v>

528
00:20:53.591 --> 00:20:55.780
<v Speaker 2>the wall street journal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wall street journal.</v>

529
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Because both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually they went after him and they</v>

530
00:20:58.931 --> 00:21:01.840
<v Speaker 2>kinda made it seem like he was a nazi</v>
<v Speaker 2>sympathizer.</v>

531
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.510
<v Speaker 2>He was making a few inappropriate jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd he say?</v>

532
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.480
<v Speaker 2>What'd he say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just joked around and did like a sieg</v>

533
00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 2>heil salute or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was apparently making fun of</v>

534
00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:13.840
<v Speaker 2>people that were nazis making fun of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of being nazis.</v>

535
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.390
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's been all been distorted and</v>

536
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:17.560
<v Speaker 2>twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

537
00:21:17.561 --> 00:21:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I was like this new record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's people out there way</v>

538
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.850
<v Speaker 2>after you that are coming after me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to make sure I don't chart high,</v>

539
00:21:24.851 --> 00:21:27.010
<v Speaker 2>which by the way I'm banned from all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chains.</v>

540
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Are you really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

541
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Best buy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>best buy.</v>

542
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Walmart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Target.</v>

543
00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put.</v>

544
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:36.250
<v Speaker 2>The weird thing is country music fans</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

545
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:37.720
<v Speaker 2>And that really pissed me off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

546
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.310
<v Speaker 2>And it was this other site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pledge,</v>

547
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.500
<v Speaker 2>pledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pledge music where you can preorder</v>

548
00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:43.600
<v Speaker 2>albums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the first album they ever dropped.</v>

549
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 2>So they're buying cds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still has led.</v>

550
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:49.040
<v Speaker 2>one of the few genres is still bought</v>
<v Speaker 2>cds,</v>

551
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.850
<v Speaker 2>genres of buy cds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I can't compete wIth on the</v>

552
00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:54.670
<v Speaker 2>charts as well because they're making</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure I don't go.</v>

553
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:58.390
<v Speaker 2>And I think honestly it's not just the</v>
<v Speaker 2>language that's bothering him,</v>

554
00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 2>it's the fact that I'm doing it outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this.</v>

555
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:04.460
<v Speaker 2>So thank you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>

562
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.760

<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

563
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're opening up the door for</v>
<v Speaker 2>people doing pretty much anything in</v>

564
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:30.940
<v Speaker 2>country music now with the crazy fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>lyrics and the fact that it's been so</v>

565
00:22:30.941 --> 00:22:35.200
<v Speaker 2>successful and you got people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a whole goddamn theater filled.</v>

<v Speaker 2>going home.</v>

572
00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I think they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they because they listen to</v>

573
00:22:59.651 --> 00:23:00.790
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're just going home and</v>

574
00:23:00.791 --> 00:23:02.980
<v Speaker 2>blown each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that you have that kind of</v>

575

<v Speaker 2>power with a really good song?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean if anyone can.</v>

577
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:09.790

<v Speaker 2>But there's no way these dudes have ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their life screen.</v>

580
00:23:13.121 --> 00:23:15.400
<v Speaker 2>Which one are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Queer is going to suck my dick and I</v>

581
00:23:15.401 --> 00:23:19.200
<v Speaker 2>would imagine of fucking open</v>
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

582
00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.550
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But along with a bunch of other people</v>

583
00:23:21.551 --> 00:23:22.750
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

584
00:23:22.751 --> 00:23:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Gives them freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

585
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:24.900
<v Speaker 2>I think it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

586
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.510
<v Speaker 2>It's probably weird for their wives when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

587
00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:28.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'd you do tonight?</v>

588
00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:31.810
<v Speaker 2>We went out with 800 dudes and screamed</v>
<v Speaker 2>about blowing each other.</v>

589
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.410
<v Speaker 2>She'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you actually blow each other?</v>

590
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Like girls will find a loophole or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

591
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.250
<v Speaker 2>we didn't actually do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

592
00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm kind of hoping to get some</v>

593
00:23:42.311 --> 00:23:43.720
<v Speaker 2>of the women back with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this.</v>

594
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you lost a lot of them with</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you bitch?</v>

595
00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women women's favorite song because</v>

596
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:51.880
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they could sing it too.</v>

597
00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:57.120
<v Speaker 2>They can see it from all three</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspectives way that they had that much</v>

598
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.890
<v Speaker 2>that they had that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for example,</v>

599
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.120
<v Speaker 2>the woman who made me write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you bitch had that much power over</v>

600
00:24:05.121 --> 00:24:07.640
<v Speaker 2>me to make me write that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>DoeS she know who she is?</v>

601
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she does now unfortunately.</v>

602
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:16.160
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she laughs and I think she's honestly</v>

603
00:24:16.161 --> 00:24:17.960
<v Speaker 2>upset and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've had,</v>

604
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.280
<v Speaker 2>that's happened a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

605
00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:21.230
<v Speaker 2>I've been on some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a po po.</v>

606
00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Do you know this is new.</v>

607
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 2>This is podcast I fucking love called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you've talked about before.</v>

608
00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:30.260
<v Speaker 2>two guys we fucked pod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically women talking about</v>

609
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.910
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about dudes.</v>

610
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.020
<v Speaker 2>The way that guys talk about women and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking love it.</v>

611
00:24:35.021 --> 00:24:37.230
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

612
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.590
<v Speaker 2>it's the way women talk about men when</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not around.</v>

613
00:24:39.591 --> 00:24:42.680
<v Speaker 2>So it's like an eye opener for dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason there's been no,</v>

614
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.640
<v Speaker 2>no one's really done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was in New York to impress and</v>

615
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.070
<v Speaker 2>they'd reached out before they wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use one of my songs and I was like,</v>

616
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:49.511
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out there.</v>

617
00:24:49.511 --> 00:24:50.450
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I stop by?</v>

618
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.480
<v Speaker 2>And of course I just start telling a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of fucking stories than my phone</v>

619
00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:54.314
<v Speaker 2>starts blowing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

620
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:55.580
<v Speaker 2>don't fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't tell him,</v>

621
00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.910
<v Speaker 2>don't talk that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I got in a lot of trouble for that</v>

622
00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:01.210
<v Speaker 2>one because you can't really go tell him</v>
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of stories on.</v>

623
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Because my thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that the podcast was that</v>

624
00:25:05.031 --> 00:25:06.480
<v Speaker 2>fucking popular is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

625
00:25:06.481 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 2>they're very popular to a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A good example of what I use is like,</v>

626
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:11.240
<v Speaker 2>people always try to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

627
00:25:11.241 --> 00:25:14.300
<v Speaker 2>you can't start a new podcast and have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been successful today.</v>

628
00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

629
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Those girls started that podcast just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of years ago and fucking</v>

630
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:19.330
<v Speaker 2>gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

631
00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of fucking people talk.</v>

632
00:25:21.171 --> 00:25:22.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten a lot.</v>

633
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.160
<v Speaker 2>I lost some pussy over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've gotten a lot of trouble.</v>

634
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:25.911
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

635
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:28.850
<v Speaker 2>don't forget I got a podcast to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

636
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.800
<v Speaker 2>When did you start doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

637
00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:34.760
<v Speaker 2>like a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually what's weird as it's</v>

638
00:25:34.761 --> 00:25:37.730
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the number one music podcasts for</v>

639
00:25:37.731 --> 00:25:38.564
<v Speaker 2>like a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

640
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.750
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll even admit like the problem</v>

641
00:25:41.751 --> 00:25:45.350
<v Speaker 2>with doing a podcast now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I kind of want your notes on this,</v>

642
00:25:45.351 --> 00:25:49.160
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is with someone like me</v>
<v Speaker 2>who sells records is I didn't,</v>

643
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:54.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't get the months of</v>
<v Speaker 2>testing and you know,</v>

644
00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.130
<v Speaker 2>it's like they hear it from everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to the first,</v>

645
00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:58.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way there's,</v>

646
00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.330
<v Speaker 2>I can't experiment as much and I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

647
00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 2>obviously what you're saying.</v>

648
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:04.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the case with us to our first</v>

649
00:26:04.031 --> 00:26:06.490
<v Speaker 2>ones are terriBle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was to him but.</v>

650
00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:07.670
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

651
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.910
<v Speaker 2>but it was probably before but it was at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least before he got huge.</v>

652
00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:11.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

653
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:13.250
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're still available.</v>

654
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Like if people who I'm going to start</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the beginning,</v>

655
00:26:15.141 --> 00:26:17.300
<v Speaker 2>they might get to episode three and go</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this dude.</v>

656
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you were in the early days you</v>

657
00:26:19.371 --> 00:26:21.440
<v Speaker 2>were doing just like straight to video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

658
00:26:21.441 --> 00:26:22.820
<v Speaker 2>With like video effects and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

659
00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:23.571
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

660
00:26:23.571 --> 00:26:25.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had snow flakes in the background and</v>

661
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:27.620
<v Speaker 2>we'd do it right to a webcam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

662
00:26:27.621 --> 00:26:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's been fun.</v>

663
00:26:29.271 --> 00:26:32.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a cool way to just talk directly to</v>
<v Speaker 2>your people,</v>

664
00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:35.690
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not my natural.</v>

665
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:38.650
<v Speaker 2>What happens is you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had,</v>

666
00:26:38.651 --> 00:26:42.380
<v Speaker 2>you talked to a good example about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other day which is you just have</v>

667
00:26:42.381 --> 00:26:43.640
<v Speaker 2>conversations like</v>

668
00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.660
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing them all over the phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>because all the musicians I want to talk</v>

669
00:26:47.661 --> 00:26:50.930
<v Speaker 2>to you on the road and when you do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the phone it becomes like an</v>

670
00:26:50.931 --> 00:26:54.050
<v Speaker 2>interview and I don't want to interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to talk to my friends,</v>

671
00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the phone and over skype.</v>

672
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.080
<v Speaker 2>They're both weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

673
00:26:57.081 --> 00:26:59.030
<v Speaker 2>it's better than nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people do well,</v>

674
00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.400
<v Speaker 2>like sam harris does a good podcast over</v>
<v Speaker 2>skype,</v>

675
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.070
<v Speaker 2>but I think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

676
00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.270
<v Speaker 2>it's just the lose something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be in the room with</v>

677
00:27:05.271 --> 00:27:07.970
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burt was the one who told me that and</v>

678
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:09.381
<v Speaker 2>said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

679
00:27:09.381 --> 00:27:13.400
<v Speaker 2>don't do it over the fucking phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I did one in person with a</v>

680
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:14.340
<v Speaker 2>singer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked it.</v>

681
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.040
<v Speaker 2>It was so much fucking bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just hanging out.</v>

682
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:17.630
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I like to listen to when I</v>

683
00:27:17.631 --> 00:27:20.330
<v Speaker 2>was in a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his buddies hanging out,</v>

684
00:27:20.331 --> 00:27:21.164
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

685
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.040
<v Speaker 2>So when you started touring from your</v>
<v Speaker 2>last album,</v>

686
00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.480
<v Speaker 2>and it was this just out of the gate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprised,</v>

687
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:34.190
<v Speaker 2>smash hit took the whole country music</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry by storm.</v>

688
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.370
<v Speaker 2>What was that like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>

689
00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:40.640
<v Speaker 2>did it feel surreal because it seemed</v>
<v Speaker 2>surreal on the outside it felt it felt</v>

690
00:27:40.641 --> 00:27:45.050
<v Speaker 2>surreal was because of my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's this one so much</v>

691
00:27:45.051 --> 00:27:49.910
<v Speaker 2>different and I kind of hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's expectations because what I left</v>

692
00:27:49.911 --> 00:27:52.910
<v Speaker 2>the studio on the first album with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just paid cash for.</v>

693
00:27:52.911 --> 00:27:54.650
<v Speaker 2>I think I told you I didn't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>label.</v>

694
00:27:54.651 --> 00:27:58.610
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any way to release It and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

695
00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.770
<v Speaker 2>this is a great fucking record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bummer.</v>

696
00:28:00.771 --> 00:28:03.590
<v Speaker 2>No one's gonna hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I finally started getting it out</v>

697
00:28:03.591 --> 00:28:07.190
<v Speaker 2>there and so then I really thought it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to just be like a cult record</v>

698
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.340
<v Speaker 2>and like I was gonna run into some do 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>years from now down the street.</v>

699
00:28:10.341 --> 00:28:11.174
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

700
00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.570
<v Speaker 2>I did the record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when you know,</v>

701
00:28:14.571 --> 00:28:16.190
<v Speaker 2>the guys who do the tours for me were</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling up like,</v>

702
00:28:16.191 --> 00:28:17.630
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to fucking believe this</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

703
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.630
<v Speaker 2>We sold ouT,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

704
00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.490
<v Speaker 2>you know la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the whole west with twitter for me</v>

705
00:28:22.491 --> 00:28:25.640
<v Speaker 2>is because it's so country to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we did a west coast tour and</v>

706
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck we do in a west coast tour</v>

707
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.810
<v Speaker 2>for the whole west coast sold out.</v>

708
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how the fuck did I sell tickets and</v>

709
00:28:33.201 --> 00:28:35.270
<v Speaker 2>seattle and portland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes no fucking sense to me.</v>

710
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Like do they even know what country</v>
<v Speaker 2>music is there?</v>

711
00:28:37.701 --> 00:28:39.710
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's almost like they're looking</v>

712
00:28:39.711 --> 00:28:41.620
<v Speaker 2>at me like in a glass cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like look at the,</v>

713
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.110
<v Speaker 2>look at the redneck in his natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>habitat kind of thing.</v>

714
00:28:45.111 --> 00:28:46.700
<v Speaker 2>So I think they're just having fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

715
00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.350
<v Speaker 2>Well I think they're having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's that too.</v>

716
00:28:48.351 --> 00:28:50.950
<v Speaker 2>I think they're also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there are a lot of people out there</v>

717
00:28:50.951 --> 00:28:52.790
<v Speaker 2>who do love country music and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>love it,</v>

718
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.040
<v Speaker 2>there's not much of it left anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to mention.</v>

719
00:28:55.041 --> 00:28:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Not much the price goes to seattle or</v>
<v Speaker 2>portland isn't there seemingly is some</v>

720
00:28:58.491 --> 00:29:02.420
<v Speaker 2>sort of a resurgence though and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good country music seems like</v>

721
00:29:02.421 --> 00:29:04.070
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there is a little bit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>a dude with limited use of his brain.</v>

763
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but to think about it there's,</v>

766
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.530
<v Speaker 2>we know there's a lot of fucking idiots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

767
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Think about how many People would just</v>
<v Speaker 2>double minded folks and then think about</v>

768
00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.080
<v Speaker 2>how few people are talking directly to</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

769
00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.590
<v Speaker 2>And then finally someone comes along and</v>
<v Speaker 2>does like finally,</v>

770
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:00.611
<v Speaker 2>finally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

771
00:31:00.611 --> 00:31:05.611
<v Speaker 2>Finally enough about life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough sturgeon but life and like what</v>

772
00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:07.960
<v Speaker 2>it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally someone I can relate to,</v>

773
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.300
<v Speaker 2>just how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much whiskey,</v>

774
00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:11.440
<v Speaker 2>how much sour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

775
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:14.500
<v Speaker 2>that's what I want to fucking hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But some people just want life simple</v>

776
00:31:14.501 --> 00:31:16.360
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't that sort of alwaYs been the</v>

777
00:31:16.361 --> 00:31:19.540
<v Speaker 2>knock on country music in the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the country music would,</v>

778
00:31:19.541 --> 00:31:22.570
<v Speaker 2>it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of reinforces these stereotypes</v>

779
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:26.350
<v Speaker 2>of this simple step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried to get me on that shit</v>

780
00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just saying also I think they were</v>

781
00:31:28.811 --> 00:31:29.271
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

782
00:31:29.271 --> 00:31:32.400
<v Speaker 2>you're doIng like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like mocking redneck,</v>

783
00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using a mocking like redneck shit.</v>

784
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.850
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the crazy shit like fucking your</v>

785
00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:37.860
<v Speaker 2>cat and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

786
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kIlling your dog and all that shit.</v>

787
00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.690
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't think they got that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just kind of making fun of my</v>

788
00:31:43.691 --> 00:31:44.530
<v Speaker 2>buddies back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

789
00:31:44.531 --> 00:31:47.200
<v Speaker 2>like what the cliche of being a redneck</v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

790
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I still see it.</v>

791
00:31:48.841 --> 00:31:50.770
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the political shit,</v>

792
00:31:50.771 --> 00:31:52.960
<v Speaker 2>like an snl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>

793
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.920
<v Speaker 2>there was a sketch on snl near the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the season on,</v>

794
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.960
<v Speaker 2>you saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was alec baldwin doing trump and</v>

795
00:31:58.961 --> 00:32:01.240
<v Speaker 2>he was in a small town called union</v>
<v Speaker 2>kentucky's,</v>

796
00:32:01.241 --> 00:32:03.490
<v Speaker 2>what they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is actually not far from me.</v>

797
00:32:03.491 --> 00:32:07.510
<v Speaker 2>And the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of the sketch was that this,</v>

798
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:11.050
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've been hearing a lot with,</v>

799
00:32:11.051 --> 00:32:15.550
<v Speaker 2>these were these southern people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>were so dumb that they voted against</v>

800
00:32:15.551 --> 00:32:16.780
<v Speaker 2>trump against their own interest.</v>

801
00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Which I'm so sick of that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative,</v>

802
00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:20.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>against their own interest.</v>

803
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.760
<v Speaker 2>How can they say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

804
00:32:21.761 --> 00:32:23.470
<v Speaker 2>they're just saying that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>

805
00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:25.150
<v Speaker 2>there's been a lot of shit in the press</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how,</v>

806
00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these old quote unquote southerners and</v>

807
00:32:27.191 --> 00:32:31.340
<v Speaker 2>rednecks voted for trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but It's like they're the ones who work</v>

808
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.260
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones who are going to lose</v>

809
00:32:32.261 --> 00:32:33.790
<v Speaker 2>their health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aren't you even hear that a lot?</v>

810
00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:36.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just from my point of view,</v>

811
00:32:36.131 --> 00:32:37.960
<v Speaker 2>but I found it very condescending to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

812
00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.280
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just,</v>

813
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the sketches.</v>

814
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 3>It seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

815
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.020
<v Speaker 3>like 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the foRties,</v>

816
00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:48.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some characterize Mr. Trump.</v>

817
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:49.200
<v Speaker 3>I got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

818
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.240
<v Speaker 3>that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

819
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:56.420
<v Speaker 3>I think people are nervous because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing that you're saying when</v>

820
00:32:56.421 --> 00:32:59.990
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream media anymore and there's</v>

821
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:02.660
<v Speaker 3>just media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When a guy like Donald Trump gets in</v>

822
00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:03.710
<v Speaker 3>office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

823
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.240
<v Speaker 3>it's changed what being a politician is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because now it seems like anybody can be</v>

824
00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:10.460
<v Speaker 3>a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we had a reality star that became</v>

825
00:33:10.461 --> 00:33:12.870
<v Speaker 3>the president of United States law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

826
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:14.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>

827
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.300
<v Speaker 3>There's no real precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

828
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.280
<v Speaker 3>There'S just a guy we have no control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we can't,</v>

829
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.880
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing we can control and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't stop non-politicians from being</v>

830
00:33:22.881 --> 00:33:24.930
<v Speaker 3>president anymore and it seems like they</v>
<v Speaker 3>will be able.</v>

831
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.570
<v Speaker 3>They were able to do that for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>longest time.</v>

832
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.130
<v Speaker 3>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of other factors.</v>

833
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.680
<v Speaker 3>He's very rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very famous.</v>

834
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.980
<v Speaker 3>He handled a bunch of politicians for</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

835
00:33:33.981 --> 00:33:38.090
<v Speaker 3>many years and paid them off and</v>
<v Speaker 3>understood and understood from behind</v>

836
00:33:38.091 --> 00:33:40.160
<v Speaker 3>the scenes that going to be the next 20</v>
<v Speaker 3>presidents.</v>

837
00:33:40.161 --> 00:33:42.500
<v Speaker 3>Are they all meet president?</v>
<v Speaker 3>kanye coming up.</v>

838
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:44.330
<v Speaker 3>Mark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark cuban is the one they're talking</v>

839
00:33:44.331 --> 00:33:45.470
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is a good one.</v>

840
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.610
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's rich.</v>

841
00:33:46.611 --> 00:33:47.990
<v Speaker 3>He's on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's nice guy.</v>

842
00:33:47.991 --> 00:33:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

843
00:33:48.951 --> 00:33:50.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be superior.</v>

844
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:52.940
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might do it.</v>

845
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the one I keep hearing,</v>

846
00:33:54.711 --> 00:33:56.480
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could just be from now on.</v>

847
00:33:56.481 --> 00:33:58.730
<v Speaker 3>You just buy the presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

848
00:33:58.731 --> 00:33:59.960
<v Speaker 3>it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

849
00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:01.880
<v Speaker 3>until we figure out that that's a dumb</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>

850
00:34:01.881 --> 00:34:05.930
<v Speaker 3>that being a president is a dumb idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dumb idea to have one person</v>

851
00:34:05.931 --> 00:34:09.620
<v Speaker 3>running shit that just the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump has the ability to fire that call</v>

852
00:34:09.621 --> 00:34:11.870
<v Speaker 3>me guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous that he could just say,</v>

853
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.180
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like what you're doing.</v>

854
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.340
<v Speaker 3>You're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like doesn't even have to have some like</v>

855
00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:18.830
<v Speaker 3>rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you get fired from walmart,</v>

856
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.970
<v Speaker 3>they have to have a reason like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get fired from the fucking head</v>

857
00:34:22.971 --> 00:34:27.290
<v Speaker 3>of the fbi and you just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't like the fact that you're not</v>

858
00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:28.970
<v Speaker 3>willing to drop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Investigation.</v>

859
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.660
<v Speaker 3>That seems like that seems insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole.</v>

860
00:34:32.661 --> 00:34:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is fucking like.</v>

861
00:34:34.971 --> 00:34:36.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing more you can say other</v>

862
00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:38.480
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy was hosted a reality show.</v>

863
00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Now he's president and I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>another thing that fucking scares people</v>

864
00:34:42.021 --> 00:34:43.490
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

<v Speaker 3>allowed to fucking talk about that shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't talk politics.</v>

00:34:49.281 --> 00:34:52.290
<v Speaker 3>You gotta you gotta fucking right man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the dixie chicks talked about joy</v>

<v Speaker 3>still killbuck go back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

869
00:34:53.961 --> 00:34:56.060
<v Speaker 3>they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened with that?</v>

870
00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.120
<v Speaker 3>They were essentially blackballed from</v>
<v Speaker 3>country music for years for saying that</v>

871
00:35:01.341 --> 00:35:02.960
<v Speaker 3>they were against the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>

872
00:35:02.961 --> 00:35:03.370
<v Speaker 3>pr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

873
00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:06.830
<v Speaker 3>which trump basically got elected,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

874
00:35:06.831 --> 00:35:09.320
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he kept saying he was against that war</v>

875
00:35:09.321 --> 00:35:09.920
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

876
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.330
<v Speaker 3>So they like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

877
00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.850
<v Speaker 3>Well I think they said that he's an</v>
<v Speaker 3>embarrassment,</v>

878
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.400
<v Speaker 3>that they're embarrassed that George</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush was the president.</v>

879
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.770
<v Speaker 3>I think it had more to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They set it at a club in england,</v>

880
00:35:18.771 --> 00:35:21.620
<v Speaker 3>so doing it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can't leave the country</v>

881
00:35:21.621 --> 00:35:24.830
<v Speaker 3>and talk shit about american lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if that was pop music,</v>

882
00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:27.180
<v Speaker 3>that'd be super standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like no big deal.</v>

883
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 3>The weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

884
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.260
<v Speaker 3>we grew up on like dylan and the beatles</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whatever,</v>

885
00:35:33.261 --> 00:35:35.570
<v Speaker 3>hendrick people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all they did was talk about that shit.</v>

886
00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:36.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neil young,</v>

887
00:35:36.531 --> 00:35:38.040

<v Speaker 3>his whole album</v>

890
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:43.950
<v Speaker 2>in country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why that is.</v>

891
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.821
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>

892
00:35:44.821 --> 00:35:49.821
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about that simplified</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative that these stereotypes of this</v>

893
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.480
<v Speaker 2>world where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

894
00:35:51.481 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 2>you go to bed and you get up in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>

897
00:36:00.211 --> 00:36:02.920
<v Speaker 2>world that's boiled down to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

898
00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.380
<v Speaker 2>there's things that are allowed inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>the simple version of the world and</v>

899
00:36:07.381 --> 00:36:10.380
<v Speaker 2>there's things that are expected and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's things that are just not</v>

900
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:13.740
<v Speaker 2>discussed and you don't discuss sucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>dick and kicking ass.</v>

<v Speaker 2>was implied consent because he was</v>

919
00:36:53.761 --> 00:36:58.230
<v Speaker 2>saying they let you let you grab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ThAt whole thing was so fucking weird</v>

920
00:36:58.231 --> 00:37:02.400
<v Speaker 2>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to still be talking about it,</v>

921

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.770

<v Speaker 2>It didn't change my opinion of the guy</v>

923
00:37:07.771 --> 00:37:09.480
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew was a scumbag.</v>

924
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you knew him in whatever ways.</v>

925
00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.990
<v Speaker 2>This is who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it too is about you</v>

926
00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:16.710
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

927
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I'd never heard that phrase before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grabbing by the,</v>

928
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

929
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.200
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

930
00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.170
<v Speaker 2>that's somethIng i'd heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was new here.</v>

931
00:37:22.171 --> 00:37:24.330
<v Speaker 2>I have a question for you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a question for you.</v>

932
00:37:24.331 --> 00:37:25.740
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a theory I have,</v>

933
00:37:25.741 --> 00:37:28.740
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think someone that trump</v>

934
00:37:28.741 --> 00:37:30.750
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been wondering this for like a year</v>

935
00:37:30.751 --> 00:37:33.770
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secretly after that happened because he</v>

936
00:37:33.771 --> 00:37:35.940
<v Speaker 2>smiled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No doubt he's a smart businessman.</v>

937
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Copyrighted that phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know for spring break from</v>

938
00:37:39.541 --> 00:37:40.800
<v Speaker 2>now on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be grabbing by the</v>

939
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:44.100
<v Speaker 2>pussy shirts for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could sell it,</v>

940
00:37:44.101 --> 00:37:45.690
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's kind of died off.</v>

941
00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Those things have like a short shelf</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

942
00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.270
<v Speaker 2>like those fidget spinners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody making those fidget spinners.</v>

943
00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.270
<v Speaker 2>Salesman as you can now because a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>from now no one's going to.</v>

944
00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:55.104

<v Speaker 2>finger and they spin around in circles</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll be tweaking from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems like you've got something going on</v>

1041
00:41:26.191 --> 00:41:27.900
<v Speaker 3>with that opening and closing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottle.</v>

1042
00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:30.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm going to stop a fidget</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1043
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:33.250
<v Speaker 3>I got one of them fidget spinners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:37.850
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A water bottles to get the stress</v>

1045
00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:39.890
<v Speaker 3>relievers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wheeler walker water bottles.</v>

1046
00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.260
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were we just talking about?</v>

1047
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:46.500
<v Speaker 3>A stress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about New York times know</v>

1048
00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:48.350
<v Speaker 3>the bias of the people who are writing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1049
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.850
<v Speaker 3>They want to get at trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if they have any sort of an article</v>

1050
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.260
<v Speaker 3>that even might be true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kind of think might be true.</v>

1051
00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.630
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it would be exciting if it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was true.</v>

1052
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:02.060
<v Speaker 3>They just run with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was interesting what he</v>

1053
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:04.310
<v Speaker 3>said actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like because it's highly</v>

1054
00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:06.160
<v Speaker 3>classified information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not allowed.</v>

1055
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.380
<v Speaker 3>He's not allowed to go out there and say</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not true because that would,</v>

1056
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:10.850
<v Speaker 3>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1057
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.420
<v Speaker 3>sure would put them in a weird place of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the then you know,</v>

1058
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:17.840
<v Speaker 3>what top secret information isn't true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he has to keep quiet about it.</v>

1059
00:42:17.841 --> 00:42:19.910
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when he's doing these interviews,</v>

1060
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:20.631
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there,</v>

1061
00:42:20.631 --> 00:42:22.210
<v Speaker 3>there are a rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1062
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:25.910
<v Speaker 3>when there is under investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's given these statements,</v>

1063
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.200
<v Speaker 3>how do they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1064
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:31.730
<v Speaker 3>justified then how does he say it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>true because isn't that still top</v>

1065
00:42:31.731 --> 00:42:33.460
<v Speaker 3>secret?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because this is,</v>

1066
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's under oath and they're asking him I</v>

1067
00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:39.140
<v Speaker 3>guess is the only reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are definitely some questions</v>

1068
00:42:39.141 --> 00:42:40.010
<v Speaker 3>where he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not allowed to,</v>

1069
00:42:40.011 --> 00:42:41.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't say that in an open hearing.</v>

1070
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I figured was one of the</v>

1071
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:46.550
<v Speaker 3>reasons why trump could fire him because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't be able to talk about the</v>

1072
00:42:46.551 --> 00:42:50.300
<v Speaker 3>investigation until they hired a special</v>
<v Speaker 3>prosecutor and all this stuff that</v>

1073
00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:53.290
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would assume that people will like</v>

1074
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.920
<v Speaker 3>call comedy's going to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1075
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:56.300
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't really talk.</v>

1076
00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.300
<v Speaker 3>That'S one of the reasons why trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>could fire him because that guy is under</v>

1077
00:42:59.301 --> 00:43:02.470
<v Speaker 3>oath and rather all the stuff that he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

1078
00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:05.000
<v Speaker 3>what's he allowed to talk about now that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gone to st?</v>

1079
00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.620
<v Speaker 3>That same rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's top secret.</v>

1080
00:43:06.621 --> 00:43:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Everything's top secret.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet he's not allowed to talk about his</v>

1081
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:11.570
<v Speaker 3>job at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet they could fire up not firing</v>

1082
00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.700
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they could arrest him if he.</v>

1083
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:15.530
<v Speaker 3>Because he admitted today that he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>

1084
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.120
<v Speaker 3>He admitted the leaks and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1085
00:43:17.121 --> 00:43:18.520
<v Speaker 3>but he leaks stuff that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>unclassified.</v>

1086
00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:22.190
<v Speaker 3>He just leaked is memos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't classified and people were</v>

1087
00:43:22.191 --> 00:43:23.890
<v Speaker 3>freaking out about it like no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1088
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.590
<v Speaker 3>he did it because it was real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to be the one who was</v>

1089
00:43:27.591 --> 00:43:31.370
<v Speaker 3>making the statement and the way he</v>
<v Speaker 3>described that he had a funny</v>

1090
00:43:31.371 --> 00:43:32.810
<v Speaker 3>description.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said it would be like feeding</v>

1091
00:43:32.811 --> 00:43:35.510
<v Speaker 3>seagulls at the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would just follow them around and</v>

1092
00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.490
<v Speaker 3>look for more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

1093
00:43:37.491 --> 00:43:39.440
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to get the information out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1094
00:43:39.441 --> 00:43:44.441
<v Speaker 3>So I had someone put it out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was honest about it and you know,</v>

1095
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:49.100
<v Speaker 3>it lets you understand that that's how</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people do business and this is one</v>

1096
00:43:49.101 --> 00:43:51.550
<v Speaker 3>of the ways that information does get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just.</v>

1097
00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.800
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of it is guys like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't a movie all the president's men.</v>

1098
00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:57.340
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a lot of guys who think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're gonna.</v>

1099
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.840
<v Speaker 3>If they get the scoop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have a hit book and</v>

1100
00:43:59.841 --> 00:44:01.020
<v Speaker 3>then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1101
00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:03.730
<v Speaker 3>brad pitt's going to play them in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking movie.</v>

1102
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:06.470
<v Speaker 3>If they get this fucking scoop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's also that.</v>

1103
00:44:06.471 --> 00:44:09.590
<v Speaker 3>but then there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're an investigative journalist</v>

1104
00:44:09.591 --> 00:44:12.050
<v Speaker 3>and you're covering the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States and this unprecedented</v>

1105
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:16.460
<v Speaker 3>event where reality stars become the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking president and he's a liar and he</v>

1106
00:44:16.461 --> 00:44:19.280
<v Speaker 3>just keeps lying about shit and getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>caught lying about shit.</v>

1107
00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:21.230
<v Speaker 3>And there's a bunch of people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>care that he's a lIar.</v>

1108
00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.680
<v Speaker 3>He's like everybody loves and they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>jump on in with it and you don't expect</v>

1109
00:44:24.681 --> 00:44:29.210
<v Speaker 3>a higher standard of behavior from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>number one most influential person in</v>

1110
00:44:29.211 --> 00:44:31.230
<v Speaker 3>the free world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1111
00:44:31.231 --> 00:44:35.250

<v Speaker 3>people that suck in people who get</v>

1112
00:44:35.251 --> 00:44:37.200
<v Speaker 3>terrible ratings.</v>

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:12.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not,</v>

1153
00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:16.110
<v Speaker 3>you're not talKing about teens and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>medieval France.</v>

1154
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:16.741
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1155
00:46:16.741 --> 00:46:19.380
<v Speaker 3>that's just a sign of a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1156
00:46:19.381 --> 00:46:22.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only if that's your viewpoinT,</v>

1157
00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.610
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be smart enough to know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's only going to hurt your,</v>

1158
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:28.080
<v Speaker 3>your where you're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

1159
00:46:28.081 --> 00:46:31.080
<v Speaker 3>she did this press conference in paint</v>
<v Speaker 3>herself out to be a victim.</v>

1160
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:34.860
<v Speaker 3>She's seen he's a bully and he's trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to ruin her career.</v>

1161
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:38.520
<v Speaker 3>And then she was like celebrating the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of comedy she does.</v>

1162
00:46:38.521 --> 00:46:39.780
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1163
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.030
<v Speaker 3>I've always pusheD the boundaries and</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1164
00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:42.571
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1165
00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:43.710
<v Speaker 3>my comedy is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1166
00:46:43.711 --> 00:46:45.000
<v Speaker 3>it's not for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1167
00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:50.220
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like relishing the moment to express how</v>

1168
00:46:50.221 --> 00:46:54.250
<v Speaker 3>she feels about her comedy or two to</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of describe comedy.</v>

1169
00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.100
<v Speaker 3>And it's not a free speech thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1170
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:58.350
<v Speaker 3>no one's saying she didn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right to do it.</v>

1171
00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:01.110
<v Speaker 3>We're just all saying it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking lame.</v>

1172
00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:02.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an attention thing.</v>

1173
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:04.620
<v Speaker 3>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's purely an attention thing to the</v>

1174
00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:08.560
<v Speaker 3>point where there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no entertainment value to it.</v>

1175
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:13.790
<v Speaker 3>Like it's one thing if you have some</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous idea in your head that is</v>

1176
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.070
<v Speaker 3>funny or is entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1177
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:18.810
<v Speaker 3>What was the best case scenario?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

1178
00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.250
<v Speaker 3>there was nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no thought.</v>

1179
00:47:20.251 --> 00:47:21.300
<v Speaker 3>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do this.</v>

1180
00:47:21.301 --> 00:47:22.134
<v Speaker 3>People are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See it.</v>

1181
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only funny part for me was that like</v>

1182
00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.020
<v Speaker 3>mike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who does all the photoshopping for joey</v>

<v Speaker 2>griffin.</v>

1192
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.610
<v Speaker 4>I didn't hear about the kathy griffin</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing until I saw her apology.</v>

1193
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.790
<v Speaker 4>That's how I found out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found out about it through her apology</v>

1194
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:59.791
<v Speaker 4>on instagram and so I was clicking on</v>
<v Speaker 4>this video and it was her apology and</v>

1195
00:47:59.951 --> 00:48:02.830
<v Speaker 4>she looked like hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So literally she hadn't slept and she</v>

1196
00:48:02.831 --> 00:48:05.650
<v Speaker 4>was freaking out as opposed to when she</v>
<v Speaker 4>looked awesome as opposed to when she</v>

1197
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:06.450
<v Speaker 4>looks hot as fuck.</v>

1198

<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

1202
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I pairs perfectly.</v>

1203
00:48:16.941 --> 00:48:18.920

1204
00:48:18.921 --> 00:48:20.270
<v Speaker 4>same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think she has a beard dude.</v>

1205
00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.330
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw the apology and just,</v>

1206
00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.990
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did she do?</v>

1207
00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:28.730
<v Speaker 4>Like she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went too far.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I went too far.</v>

1211
00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.780
<v Speaker 4>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a comedian and sometimes we go too</v>

1212
00:48:35.781 --> 00:48:36.910
<v Speaker 4>far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1213
00:48:36.911 --> 00:48:40.010
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck did she do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I went and saw what she did and</v>

1214
00:48:40.011 --> 00:48:40.844
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1215
00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:44.570
<v Speaker 2>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think.</v>

1216
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you heard anybody even in the</v>

1217
00:48:48.331 --> 00:48:49.980
<v Speaker 2>comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you heard anybody defending her?</v>

1218
00:48:49.981 --> 00:48:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1220
00:48:54.021 --> 00:48:57.950
<v Speaker 4>but it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a defense of the intent behind</v>

1221
00:48:57.951 --> 00:48:59.090
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I agree with.</v>

1222
00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:00.950
<v Speaker 4>The intent behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning,</v>

1223
00:49:00.951 --> 00:49:04.370
<v Speaker 4>which she was trying to do is be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was trying to get some attention.</v>

1224
00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.870
<v Speaker 4>She was trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a joke that you do that fall</v>

1225
00:49:06.871 --> 00:49:08.390
<v Speaker 4>short,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like here's a perfect example.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Got damn.</v>

1230
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:22.250
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking voice upon the senator</v>
<v Speaker 4>from Nebraska I believe.</v>

1231
00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:26.480
<v Speaker 4>Said you should come visit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can have you work in the fields.</v>

<v Speaker 4>not me.</v>

1233
00:49:28.971 --> 00:49:31.010

<v Speaker 4>That's what he said.</v>

1234
00:49:31.011 --> 00:49:33.200
<v Speaker 4>And everybody was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was trying to be naughty.</v>

<v Speaker 4>for hbo.</v>

1247
00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.880

1248
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.670
<v Speaker 4>extreme amount of demands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot going on behind the</v>

1249
00:50:08.671 --> 00:50:10.890
<v Speaker 4>scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's probably working very hard.</v>

1250
00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:15.660
<v Speaker 4>He's probably tired and he's in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>middle of this interview and he's trying</v>

1251
00:50:15.661 --> 00:50:18.450
<v Speaker 4>to make something entertainment.</v>

<v Speaker 4>shocking because he's,</v>

1257
00:50:31.521 --> 00:50:33.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he tries to be that naughty,</v>

<v Speaker 4>When I see his shows,</v>

1261
00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:45.320
<v Speaker 4>it seems like he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he makes a joke and they don't,</v>

1262
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:47.330
<v Speaker 4>he gets mad when they don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking left.</v>

<v Speaker 4>he was just trying to be funny.</v>

1266
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:57.800
<v Speaker 4>Like he was trying to entertain people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's important to him.</v>

1267
00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:00.620
<v Speaker 4>His show's important to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very good show.</v>

1268
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:04.580
<v Speaker 4>He works hard at it and most of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>jokes are really funny and there's a lot</v>

1269
00:51:04.581 --> 00:51:07.520
<v Speaker 4>of edgy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>controversial jokes on the bill maher</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's the line he pushes in.</v>

1271
00:51:11.661 --> 00:51:13.880
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you cross that line and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>crossed that line.</v>

1272
00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.860
<v Speaker 4>Is he racist?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck no.</v>

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:17.240
<v Speaker 4>Is he a bad guy?</v>

1274
00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:19.290
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1275
00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.830
<v Speaker 4>He was a fucking mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a human being.</v>

1276
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.770
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like the n word slipped out</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking derogatory about,</v>

1277
00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:26.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was trying to exact point about</v>

1278
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:29.210
<v Speaker 4>slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just trying to be silly.</v>

1279
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:30.470
<v Speaker 4>He was trying to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

1280
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.150
<v Speaker 4>he's not like being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember when dog,</v>

1281
00:51:32.151 --> 00:51:35.960
<v Speaker 4>the bounty hunter got caught dropping a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of bombs about people.</v>

1282
00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:37.400
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a way.</v>

1283
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.070
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no words that are forbidden and</v>

1284
00:51:40.071 --> 00:51:45.071
<v Speaker 4>the idea that the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's that word exists in countless rap</v>

1285
00:51:45.291 --> 00:51:48.320
<v Speaker 4>songs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't sing along to those rap</v>

1286
00:51:48.321 --> 00:51:50.350
<v Speaker 4>songs and yet ransom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>walmart.</v>

1287
00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think those rap songs are banned from</v>

1288
00:51:53.031 --> 00:51:55.310
<v Speaker 4>walmart too though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You and I found out recently,</v>

1290
00:51:59.781 --> 00:52:00.620
<v Speaker 4>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they take out the cuss words.</v>

1292
00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:06.350
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I know that I fucking ordered a,</v>

1293
00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:09.380
<v Speaker 4>an itunes once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a copy of a,</v>

1294
00:52:09.381 --> 00:52:11.090
<v Speaker 4>one of the dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not dead presidents.</v>

1295
00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:16.880
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was one of those hardcore rap bands</v>

1296
00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:20.810
<v Speaker 4>and as I was listening to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was all this backwards fit.</v>

1297
00:52:20.811 --> 00:52:21.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1298
00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:25.720
<v Speaker 4>like bleeped out or like it was like</v>
<v Speaker 4>empty spots where there was the,</v>

1299
00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.480
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I downloaded a m and m album.</v>

1300
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.090
<v Speaker 4>I heard all these backwards sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was like,</v>

1301
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:33.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the old sergeant pepper shit.</v>

1302
00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.830
<v Speaker 4>I guess they took it out the bad words</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just played them backyard even</v>

1303
00:52:36.831 --> 00:52:39.770
<v Speaker 4>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listened to one from gangstarr and</v>

1304
00:52:39.771 --> 00:52:42.500
<v Speaker 4>they had alternative words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alternative words,</v>

1305
00:52:42.501 --> 00:52:44.120
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

1306
00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:49.330
<v Speaker 4>you can't have alternate world star hip</v>
<v Speaker 4>hop guys like jay z or some big I go</v>

1307
00:52:50.001 --> 00:52:52.670
<v Speaker 4>fuck this way and doing this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're not doing it anymore,</v>

1308
00:52:52.671 --> 00:52:54.230
<v Speaker 4>but the reason why they do this for</v>
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>

1309
00:52:54.231 --> 00:52:55.730
<v Speaker 4>there's so much money out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1310
00:52:55.731 --> 00:52:58.760
<v Speaker 4>if they can get their shit played on</v>
<v Speaker 4>radio and get the more.</v>

1311
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.350
<v Speaker 4>It's all about exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1312
00:53:00.351 --> 00:53:02.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all about the most amount of people</v>

1313
00:53:02.661 --> 00:53:04.070
<v Speaker 4>that you could reach with your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1314
00:53:04.071 --> 00:53:06.020
<v Speaker 4>Well they asked me to do a clean</v>
<v Speaker 4>version.</v>

1315
00:53:06.021 --> 00:53:07.310

<v Speaker 4>good for you.</v>

1316
00:53:07.311 --> 00:53:08.800

<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

1319
00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.380

<v Speaker 4>money because it'll,</v>

1320
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:22.790

<v Speaker 3>They're opinions.</v>

1548
01:02:25.321 --> 01:02:30.270
<v Speaker 3>Are there strategic sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conglomeration of ideas that they think</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1553
01:02:37.381 --> 01:02:40.170
<v Speaker 3>I was getting pissed because there were</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of weak companies who wanted to</v>

1554
01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:43.740
<v Speaker 3>sponsor some of my tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's too complicated right now</v>

1555
01:02:43.741 --> 01:02:46.410
<v Speaker 3>because how different states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it could be like I could get</v>

1556
01:02:46.411 --> 01:02:49.380
<v Speaker 3>arrested in certain states just for just</v>
<v Speaker 3>for advertising advertising,</v>

1557
01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:50.310
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>LIke,</v>

1558
01:02:50.311 --> 01:02:51.900
<v Speaker 3>so I couldn't put it on a tour bus or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1559
01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:53.490
<v Speaker 3>So there's no way to really do it right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1560
01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:55.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you also become a target in the</v>

1561
01:02:55.441 --> 01:02:59.520
<v Speaker 3>states where it's very illegal where</v>
<v Speaker 3>cops have been arresting people for a</v>

1562
01:02:59.521 --> 01:03:00.120
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

1563
01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.620
<v Speaker 3>You've got them trained to arrest</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1564
01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.270
<v Speaker 3>Then all of a sudden you tell them they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't.</v>

1565
01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:04.333
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have asked me to partner up with</v>

1608
01:04:42.901 --> 01:04:45.960
<v Speaker 3>them or to get involved and I'm like an</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight at the time yet.</v>

1609
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You'd be target number one.</v>

1611
01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:52.500
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's worth it financially,</v>

1612
01:04:52.501 --> 01:04:55.950
<v Speaker 3>but it's not worth in terms of like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental mortgage that you have to pay to</v>

1613
01:04:55.951 --> 01:04:58.110
<v Speaker 3>be involved with something that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal.</v>

1614
01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:00.920
<v Speaker 3>I've always wondered about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I always wondered like,</v>

1615
01:05:00.921 --> 01:05:02.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like snoop dogg's on tour,</v>

1616
01:05:02.401 --> 01:05:03.840
<v Speaker 3>if you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see snoop dogg's bus,</v>

1617
01:05:03.841 --> 01:05:05.250
<v Speaker 3>why wouldn't the cut?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's been arrested before.</v>

1620
01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:11.010
<v Speaker 3>it's weird to just be that adamant about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1621
01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:13.230
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1623
01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're,</v>

1624
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:21.160
<v Speaker 3>if you're A stoner and known stoner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you have to do is just know somEbody</v>

1625
01:05:21.161 --> 01:05:23.410
<v Speaker 3>in a town like you don't have to travel</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it,</v>

1626
01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:27.190
<v Speaker 3>like traveling with it as stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people that get busted with weed,</v>

1627
01:05:27.191 --> 01:05:28.570
<v Speaker 3>like don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know there's a weed where you're</v>

1628
01:05:28.571 --> 01:05:29.800
<v Speaker 3>going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1629
01:05:29.801 --> 01:05:32.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've gotten off stage once</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there hasn't been a joint ready for</v>

1630
01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:34.060
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for somebody that I've never even met.</v>

1631
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:35.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always something.</v>

1632
01:05:35.471 --> 01:05:37.630
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you smoke that weed?</v>

1633
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:40.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I usually do,</v>

1634
01:05:40.631 --> 01:05:42.640

<v Speaker 3>couple.</v>

1635
01:05:42.641 --> 01:05:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Every once in a while I'll smoke it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then later that night I'm like,</v>

1636
01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:46.640

<v Speaker 3>people are going hardcore.</v>

1638
01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Some dude was telling me about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>spray that he invented.</v>

1639
01:05:55.480 --> 01:06:00.480
<v Speaker 3>That's an acid spray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's lsd in spray form and he goes,</v>

1640
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:06.340
<v Speaker 3>just as many pumps as you take off of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this spray is how deep you go into</v>

1641
01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:10.450
<v Speaker 3>alice's rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What jesus christ.</v>

<v Speaker 3>His documentary out,</v>

1644
01:06:15.461 --> 01:06:16.900
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't actually.</v>

1645
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a big grateful dead fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a documentary out now about</v>

1646
01:06:19.841 --> 01:06:22.810
<v Speaker 3>them that feels like it's pretty crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching them in the old fucking days.</v>

1647
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:26.520
<v Speaker 3>I lacked the grateful dead dead jean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you like I don't get it.</v>

1648
01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:29.020
<v Speaker 3>I watched this to try to get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was.</v>

1649
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.870
<v Speaker 3>The acid tests they were doing back then</v>
<v Speaker 3>were fucking crazy.</v>

1650
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:33.640
<v Speaker 3>they would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would dose the fucking record</v>

1651
01:06:33.641 --> 01:06:35.260
<v Speaker 3>company dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1652
01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:38.380
<v Speaker 3>Well people just dose people back then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the things I think is</v>

1653
01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:39.640
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing a dick move.</v>

1654
01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the things we're seeing</v>

1655
01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:44.410
<v Speaker 3>with his bill cosby thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people had a different opinion</v>

1656
01:06:44.411 --> 01:06:48.610
<v Speaker 3>about dosing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think bill cosby was amongst a group</v>

1657
01:06:48.611 --> 01:06:51.820
<v Speaker 3>of many people that we're dosing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back then,</v>

1658
01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:56.170
<v Speaker 3>I think it was super common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was super common because they</v>

1659
01:06:56.171 --> 01:06:58.290
<v Speaker 3>joked around about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1660
01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:03.300
<v Speaker 3>bill cosby had a whole routine about</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving people spanish fly and he's joked</v>

1661
01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:07.420
<v Speaker 3>around about dosing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the tv Show he did.</v>

1662
01:07:07.421 --> 01:07:09.820
<v Speaker 3>He did a routine on someone's late night</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk show.</v>

1663
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:11.950

<v Speaker 3>spanish.</v>

<v Speaker 3>king's or laughing as I would've because</v>

1666

<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

1755
01:10:53.711 --> 01:10:57.390
<v Speaker 2>And they actually led to the lawsuit</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what,</v>

1756
01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.020
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you weren't allowed that you</v>

1757
01:10:59.021 --> 01:11:03.850
<v Speaker 2>weren't allowed to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>test drugs on students?</v>

1758
01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:04.773
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1759
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:07.710
<v Speaker 4>But he didn't know they did that to um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ins,</v>

1760
01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:10.010
<v Speaker 4>the unabomber,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the unabomber.</v>

1761
01:11:10.011 --> 01:11:11.980
<v Speaker 4>Ted kaczynski was a part of the harvard</v>
<v Speaker 4>ellis</v>

1762
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:14.400
<v Speaker 3>experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No way.</v>

1763
01:11:14.401 --> 01:11:15.350
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1764
01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:17.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing what to dosing him up.</v>

1765
01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:20.820
<v Speaker 3>They toast the shIt out of that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they originally think of some kind</v>

1766
01:11:20.821 --> 01:11:23.250
<v Speaker 3>of truth serum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they didn't know what it was.</v>

1767
01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:26.040
<v Speaker 3>So they were trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I will Albert Hoffman and figured</v>

1768
01:11:26.041 --> 01:11:26.581
<v Speaker 3>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1769
01:11:26.581 --> 01:11:29.190
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he accidentally discovered it.</v>

1770
01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:32.760
<v Speaker 3>I think he was coming up with a drug to</v>
<v Speaker 3>induce labor.</v>

1771
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:38.030
<v Speaker 3>I think that was the original premise</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind creating lsd and he got some of</v>

1772
01:11:38.641 --> 01:11:42.540
<v Speaker 3>it in his hands and then on his drive</v>
<v Speaker 3>home through absorption through the</v>

1773
01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:44.730
<v Speaker 3>skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was tripping as fucking balls off</v>

1774
01:11:44.731 --> 01:11:48.270
<v Speaker 3>riding his bike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole story behind the</v>

1775
01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:52.560
<v Speaker 3>understanding of lsd as a psychoactive</v>
<v Speaker 3>substance and human beings.</v>

1776
01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:54.600
<v Speaker 3>So they started doing all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies.</v>

1777
01:11:54.601 --> 01:11:58.200
<v Speaker 3>There's some videos from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was the british army.</v>

1778
01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:01.800
<v Speaker 3>They dose their their soldiers up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they filmed them and they're running</v>

1779
01:12:01.801 --> 01:12:04.710
<v Speaker 3>around laughing and giggling and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't do anything.</v>

1780
01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like a black and white footage</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1781
01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.910
<v Speaker 3>I want to say like the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1782
01:12:08.911 --> 01:12:12.540
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of that crazy footage in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that because I don't think,</v>

1783
01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's hard to say because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously influenced a lot of great</v>

1784
01:12:15.571 --> 01:12:17.750
<v Speaker 3>fucking music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also they were like,</v>

1785
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:21.760
<v Speaker 3>they were so taken so much acid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a part in the movie where the</v>

1786
01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.940
<v Speaker 3>drummer for the grateful dead was</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling the record company guy.</v>

1787
01:12:23.941 --> 01:12:26.820
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I alwaYs love these kind of drugged out</v>

1788
01:12:26.821 --> 01:12:27.960
<v Speaker 3>hippie stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy goes,</v>

1789
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.220
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to take a microphone and we want</v>

1790
01:12:31.221 --> 01:12:32.640
<v Speaker 3>to record the small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1791
01:12:32.670 --> 01:12:36.660
<v Speaker 3>like we wouldn't go out to the desert</v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's clean air and record clean</v>

1792
01:12:36.661 --> 01:12:38.850
<v Speaker 3>air and put the two sounds together.</v>

1793
01:12:38.850 --> 01:12:42.060
<v Speaker 3>That's our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll be a rhythm track that's a lot</v>

1794
01:12:42.061 --> 01:12:44.280
<v Speaker 3>of acid and to take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they wanted that to be the drum</v>

1795
01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:47.670
<v Speaker 3>track and some guy at warner brothers</v>
<v Speaker 3>records into suits.</v>

1796
01:12:47.671 --> 01:12:50.580
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you talking dead jean?</v>

1797
01:12:50.581 --> 01:12:54.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't have that gene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like if you could play the dead</v>

1798
01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:59.820
<v Speaker 3>to like a young fan of rap music that</v>
<v Speaker 3>like never,</v>

1799
01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:03.740
<v Speaker 3>never heard the dead like a young black</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude just like sit him down like,</v>

1800
01:13:03.810 --> 01:13:06.270
<v Speaker 3>tell me what you think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be like,</v>

1801
01:13:06.271 --> 01:13:08.790
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I feel.</v>

1802
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just don't get it.</v>

1803
01:13:11.150 --> 01:13:13.080
<v Speaker 3>It just sounds to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1804
01:13:13.081 --> 01:13:17.430
<v Speaker 3>like a bunch of drugged out hippies just</v>
<v Speaker 3>noodling around when you're on acid at</v>

1805
01:13:17.431 --> 01:13:18.720
<v Speaker 3>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

1806
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:21.870
<v Speaker 3>I've heard people say that I was never a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fan of the grateful dead until I saw</v>

1807
01:13:21.871 --> 01:13:22.280
<v Speaker 3>them when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1808
01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.770
<v Speaker 3>when I was on acid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more than willing to agree to that</v>

1809
01:13:25.771 --> 01:13:30.180
<v Speaker 3>because there's some songs that I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>heard when I was tripping that like you</v>

1810
01:13:30.181 --> 01:13:31.020
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1811
01:13:31.021 --> 01:13:32.190
<v Speaker 3>now I understand.</v>

1812
01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:35.400
<v Speaker 3>I remember the first time I got stone</v>
<v Speaker 3>her and black sabbath and I remember</v>

1813
01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:38.250
<v Speaker 3>saying to my friend like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people who listen to this without</v>

1814
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:39.143
<v Speaker 3>being stoned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1815
01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:41.430
<v Speaker 3>what does it sound like if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the point?</v>

1816
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.990
<v Speaker 3>What's the point of fucking black</v>
<v Speaker 3>sabbath?</v>

1817
01:13:42.991 --> 01:13:44.760
<v Speaker 3>if you're not stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even make sense to me,</v>

1818
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:48.210
<v Speaker 3>but you have a black sabbatH to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can still listen to even not stolen.</v>

1819
01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.400
<v Speaker 3>They've got some bright jams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1820
01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:54.330
<v Speaker 3>there's something about the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>hippie nature of the grateful dead</v>

1821
01:13:54.331 --> 01:13:55.920
<v Speaker 3>people too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always like,</v>

1822
01:13:55.921 --> 01:13:57.480
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just running away from life.</v>

1823
01:13:57.510 --> 01:14:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Go get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You stinky fucks fucking dirty here.</v>

1824
01:14:00.911 --> 01:14:03.640
<v Speaker 3>But then my own cousin became a dead</v>
<v Speaker 3>head for awhile.</v>

1825
01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:06.810
<v Speaker 3>She's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She traveled with the dead for years and</v>

1826
01:14:06.811 --> 01:14:08.370
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those people that lived out of</v>

1827
01:14:08.371 --> 01:14:09.900
<v Speaker 3>the back of a vw band,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would,</v>

1828
01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 3>they would go to a store and buy bacon</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

1829
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.970
<v Speaker 4>eggs and cook them up for the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were in the,</v>

1830
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:16.030
<v Speaker 4>in the concert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they would sell them and shit.</v>

1831
01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:18.640
<v Speaker 4>And that's how they got by that sell</v>
<v Speaker 4>bracelets and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>she traveled around with the dead.</v>

1834
01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was kind of because they,</v>

1835
01:14:25.551 --> 01:14:26.960
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a big kind of country</v>

1836
01:14:26.961 --> 01:14:28.970
<v Speaker 2>influenced what they did according to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the documentary.</v>

1837
01:14:28.971 --> 01:14:30.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I love the idea that they were making</v>

1840
01:14:33.621 --> 01:14:35.380
<v Speaker 2>kind of trippy kind of country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:37.070
<v Speaker 2>that's not what I'm hearing in my ear.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but I feel like that's like food,</v>

1844
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:45.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's certain people that I just know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>their taste buds are just wired</v>

1852
01:15:04.941 --> 01:15:07.970
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can just take in a different level</v>

1853
01:15:07.971 --> 01:15:09.930
<v Speaker 4>of spice than I can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

1854
01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:13.790
<v Speaker 4>it must be affecting their body</v>
<v Speaker 4>differently and I know for me like I</v>

1855
01:15:13.791 --> 01:15:15.680
<v Speaker 4>have friends that don't like anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>spicy.</v>

1856
01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:18.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't always say shit just doesn't get</v>
<v Speaker 4>to them.</v>

01:15:20.031 --> 01:15:22.910
<v Speaker 4>I eat jalapenos pretty much every day of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the week.</v>

1859
01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put hot sauce on everything.</v>

1860
01:15:25.401 --> 01:15:27.380

<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

1861
01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.510
<v Speaker 4>but some people it just doesn't</v>

1862
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:32.540
<v Speaker 2>work with only thing I can say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried these shots of like super.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was like there's some little shot you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can take.</v>

1864
01:15:35.571 --> 01:15:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was coming down with</v>
<v Speaker 2>something on the road once and they gave</v>

01:15:37.641 --> 01:15:41.900

<v Speaker 2>with vitamins and had some kind of</v>

1866
01:15:41.901 --> 01:15:43.190
<v Speaker 2>pepper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was supposed to help me.</v>

1867
01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That definitely helps.</v>

1870
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:49.840

1871
01:15:49.841 --> 01:15:52.000
<v Speaker 4>cayenne pepper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they always like to add it to those</v>

1872
01:15:52.001 --> 01:15:54.610
<v Speaker 4>wellness shots to make you feel like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's doing something.</v>

1873
01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.230

<v Speaker 4>It opens up.</v>

1874
01:15:56.231 --> 01:15:59.110
<v Speaker 4>You're not studying the way they market</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1875
01:15:59.310 --> 01:16:01.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you feel great right after you</v>

<v Speaker 2>can't believe you got it down.</v>

1878
01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.880
<v Speaker 4>There was this place that we went to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The doesn't exist anymore.</v>

1879
01:16:08.881 --> 01:16:13.020
<v Speaker 4>There was an encino is called chili my</v>
<v Speaker 4>soul and it was a chilly place that had</v>

1880
01:16:13.021 --> 01:16:16.740
<v Speaker 4>levels of chili like from mild all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way up to like.</v>

1881
01:16:16.741 --> 01:16:20.310
<v Speaker 4>I think I forget what their system was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the x system or a number system.</v>

1882
01:16:20.311 --> 01:16:24.120
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a number system and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think the top was like 10 and one day I</v>

1883
01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:27.840
<v Speaker 4>tried an eight and they would give you a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sample and it was like the size of</v>

1884
01:16:27.841 --> 01:16:29.940
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know those little paper cups that</v>

1885
01:16:29.941 --> 01:16:32.540
<v Speaker 4>you get like at a hamburger joint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are supposed to fill up a catch up</v>

1886
01:16:32.850 --> 01:16:36.510
<v Speaker 4>like it was that small,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a tiny little thimble full of.</v>

1887
01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.540
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is so little.</v>

1888
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:41.220
<v Speaker 4>Just try it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just try for a sample and I put that</v>

1889
01:16:41.221 --> 01:16:43.980
<v Speaker 4>fucking tiny spoon in like an ice cream</v>
<v Speaker 4>spoon,</v>

1890
01:16:43.981 --> 01:16:47.730
<v Speaker 4>like a sample spoon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put it on my tongue and I just started</v>

1891
01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:52.850
<v Speaker 4>sneezing and hiccuping out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Snot was pouring down my nose.</v>

1892
01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:55.200
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe how fucking hot it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

1893
01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:56.340
<v Speaker 4>And that was just an eight.</v>

1894
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking I had one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1895
01:16:58.170 --> 01:17:00.780
<v Speaker 2>not probably not that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking like I'm never going</v>

1896
01:17:00.781 --> 01:17:03.470
<v Speaker 2>to recover like my mouth was burning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember sitting on the toilet just</v>

1897
01:17:03.471 --> 01:17:04.870
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1898
01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I was like apologizing to my asshole for</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'd done to it.</v>

1899
01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:08.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1900
01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:10.430
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a [inaudible] attack,</v>

1901
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:11.720
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I worried about,</v>

1902
01:17:11.721 --> 01:17:12.740
<v Speaker 3>especially on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1903
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:15.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see how like,</v>

1904
01:17:15.081 --> 01:17:17.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a big bank and go eat the wrong</v>

1905
01:17:17.721 --> 01:17:19.010
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get up there and fucking shit your</v>

1906
01:17:19.011 --> 01:17:19.701
<v Speaker 3>pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1907
01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:21.620
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also something about really</v>

1908
01:17:21.621 --> 01:17:24.170
<v Speaker 3>spicy food that makes your shit just</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to get out of your body</v>

1909
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.250
<v Speaker 3>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no.</v>

1910
01:17:25.251 --> 01:17:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

1911
01:17:25.730 --> 01:17:27.830
<v Speaker 3>It was like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone had been in that stall at</v>

1912
01:17:27.831 --> 01:17:30.110
<v Speaker 3>that restaurant that in this particular</v>
<v Speaker 3>case I'm talking about,</v>

1913
01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.650
<v Speaker 3>it would have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've fucking toward through my</v>

1914
01:17:33.651 --> 01:17:35.810
<v Speaker 3>fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to shit,</v>

1915
01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:38.180
<v Speaker 3>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that shit in the sink or the</v>

1916
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:40.490
<v Speaker 3>garbage can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which way would you go?</v>

1917
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:43.010
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at that point I would have just</v>

1918
01:17:43.011 --> 01:17:44.390
<v Speaker 3>probably those shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your pants.</v>

1919
01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:45.111
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have taken.</v>

1920
01:17:45.111 --> 01:17:46.330
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably wouldn't want to ruin,</v>

1921
01:17:46.331 --> 01:17:46.910
<v Speaker 3>ruin my pants.</v>

1922
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:48.130
<v Speaker 3>I probably would have just pulled them</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1923
01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:51.470
<v Speaker 3>Just shit like on the fucking bathroom</v>
<v Speaker 3>floor.</v>

1924
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:53.780
<v Speaker 3>I'll bet you think it's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to know.</v>

1925
01:17:53.781 --> 01:17:56.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the move though was if you want</v>

1926
01:17:56.181 --> 01:17:58.250
<v Speaker 3>to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet there'd be a lot of arguments.</v>

1927
01:17:58.251 --> 01:17:59.630
<v Speaker 3>I probably would have gone to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>urinal.</v>

1928
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.430
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit in the urinal.</v>

1929
01:18:01.431 --> 01:18:02.390
<v Speaker 3>That's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

01:18:02.391 --> 01:18:04.280
<v Speaker 3>if a guys got to clean that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1933
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:09.020

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1934
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:11.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't have been too nice to do it</v>

1935
01:18:11.651 --> 01:18:12.540
<v Speaker 3>on the fucking floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1936
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:15.410
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the rare things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to a public place,</v>

1937
01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.820
<v Speaker 3>like a restaurant or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1942
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:23.900

<v Speaker 3>Before I ever hit the road,</v>

1943
01:18:23.901 --> 01:18:25.800
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to some other weird.</v>

01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:27.800
<v Speaker 3>some other musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were just like,</v>

1946
01:18:27.801 --> 01:18:29.650
<v Speaker 3>the main thing about the road is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you may be,</v>

1948
01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.410
<v Speaker 3>It's all about finding good places and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1949
01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.350
<v Speaker 3>I put my heart and soul into these</v>
<v Speaker 3>records.</v>

1950
01:18:36.351 --> 01:18:37.790
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just gotta be more to it than</v>

1952
01:18:39.291 --> 01:18:41.390
<v Speaker 3>given up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've just given up on their</v>

1953
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.250
<v Speaker 3>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Play drums on the road.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1956
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:47.240

<v Speaker 3>If you're in this town,</v>

1957
01:18:47.241 --> 01:18:48.730
<v Speaker 3>there's this one restaurant that</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't,</v>

1958
01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:50.600
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't check you make sure you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating.</v>

<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1963
01:18:57.091 --> 01:18:58.820
<v Speaker 3>if that's my biggest problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be fine.</v>

1964
01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:02.510
<v Speaker 3>There's something about shitting and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>past the bathroom at a gas station</v>

1965
01:19:02.511 --> 01:19:04.880
<v Speaker 3>that's actually kind of satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1966
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:05.870
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's disgusting,</v>

1967
01:19:05.871 --> 01:19:08.440
<v Speaker 3>but you're not going to ruin it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You took a terrible dumping.</v>

1968
01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.890
<v Speaker 3>That bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just liked this one.</v>

1969
01:19:09.891 --> 01:19:13.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm here for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or a park when you go to a park and they</v>

1970
01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:16.400
<v Speaker 3>have those stainless steel toilets that</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even have a lid and you just sit</v>

1971
01:19:16.401 --> 01:19:20.300
<v Speaker 3>down on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta wipe all the piss off at first</v>

1972
01:19:20.301 --> 01:19:21.230
<v Speaker 3>before you sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1973
01:19:21.231 --> 01:19:23.510

1976
01:19:27.411 --> 01:19:30.020
<v Speaker 3>you can mess them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird thing that that's where</v>

1977
01:19:30.021 --> 01:19:34.540
<v Speaker 3>dudes chose to go to get together when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were gay and in hiding like</v>

1978
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:36.620
<v Speaker 3>throughout the fifties in the sixties</v>
<v Speaker 3>and seventies.</v>

1979
01:19:36.621 --> 01:19:38.120
<v Speaker 3>That was like the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1980
01:19:38.121 --> 01:19:42.320
<v Speaker 3>they'd go to get rest stops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like a who's a hacky joke in</v>

1981
01:19:42.321 --> 01:19:45.620
<v Speaker 3>the early days of standup comedy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a new song.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Truckers are one of the few people that</v>

1984
01:19:55.761 --> 01:19:57.860
<v Speaker 3>definitely still have cd players.</v>

01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:09.840
<v Speaker 3>can we do to shout out to the truckers?</v>

1991

<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need some god damn content.</v>

<v Speaker 3>technology that well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>with that kind of technology,</v>

2000
01:20:31.051 --> 01:20:33.990
<v Speaker 3>like entertainment technology that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't take in while they're driving than</v>

2029
01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:36.210
<v Speaker 3>this and driving cars that keep you</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight up.</v>

2032
01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:42.700
<v Speaker 3>They say the lumbar things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big one because it makes you,</v>

2033
01:21:42.730 --> 01:21:45.730
<v Speaker 3>it forces your body to say straight</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of that like hump thing.</v>

2034
01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:47.830
<v Speaker 3>He was going to say there's probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable shit that's probably good</v>

2035
01:21:47.831 --> 01:21:49.210
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes your back.</v>

2036
01:21:49.690 --> 01:21:51.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you're supposed to sit like this.</v>

2037
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:54.810
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to sit straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they say like those balance</v>

2038
01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:56.650
<v Speaker 3>balls are really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like sitting on balance.</v>

2039
01:21:56.660 --> 01:21:59.140
<v Speaker 3>Paul's are good because you kind of have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sit up straight.</v>

2040
01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guitars have a lot of back</v>

2041
01:22:00.881 --> 01:22:02.620
<v Speaker 3>problems because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put it on it and it's.</v>

2042
01:22:02.621 --> 01:22:06.160
<v Speaker 3>And it's not really that heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just a little bit of weight every</v>

2043
01:22:06.161 --> 01:22:07.840
<v Speaker 3>night of your fucking life,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a little bit.</v>

2045
01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:11.980

<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

2046
01:22:11.981 --> 01:22:15.490
<v Speaker 3>I feel that same place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like people that wear backpacks</v>

2047
01:22:15.491 --> 01:22:16.400
<v Speaker 3>probably the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2048
01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:20.590
<v Speaker 3>It's pulling on you to slowly but surely</v>
<v Speaker 3>a women with purses.</v>

2049
01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:24.040
<v Speaker 3>They say women with big tits.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I know people who have had a breast</v>

2052
01:22:28.330 --> 01:22:29.960
<v Speaker 3>reductions because it's helped their</v>
<v Speaker 3>bed.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I new girl had one in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing too.</v>

2054
01:22:33.051 --> 01:22:36.850
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're a funeral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that sort of funeral for her old</v>

<v Speaker 6>All I can say is that I'm still working</v>

2093
01:24:15.091 --> 01:24:19.140

<v Speaker 6>that's been thrown at me so many times.</v>

2095
01:24:27.311 --> 01:24:32.311
<v Speaker 6>That Question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what's so thrilling about.</v>

2096
01:24:32.710 --> 01:24:34.500
<v Speaker 6>Is it true?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really doN't know,</v>

2097
01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:38.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not the only man in the world.</v>

2098
01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:44.620
<v Speaker 6>There are better men than me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course you would have to show them to</v>

2099
01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:48.130
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>

2100
01:24:48.131 --> 01:24:53.131
<v Speaker 6>I've had a little success with it</v>
<v Speaker 6>even recently at ada,</v>

2101
01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:58.500
<v Speaker 6>so it seems quite true</v>
<v Speaker 6>online.</v>

2102
01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:03.340
<v Speaker 6>Know</v>
<v Speaker 6>that when I get an erection</v>

2103
01:25:04.490 --> 01:25:09.490
<v Speaker 3>I black out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2104
01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:13.940
<v Speaker 3>I really do hope that he was getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>laid at 88.</v>

2105
01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:20.860
<v Speaker 3>They say that I had a friend and I'm one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of her friends worked at a nursing home</v>

2106
01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:27.800
<v Speaker 3>and she was saying that they just fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cats and dogs in that place.</v>

2107
01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:32.460
<v Speaker 3>I believe dudes get ahold of viagra and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't give a fuck and there it's</v>

2108
01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:34.580
<v Speaker 3>like a dormitory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like they don't have any</v>

2109
01:25:34.581 --> 01:25:38.550
<v Speaker 3>responsibilities because look changed</v>
<v Speaker 3>their whole fucking.</v>

2110
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:39.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it changed the game.</v>

2111
01:25:39.531 --> 01:25:41.240
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think about people in nursing</v>

2112
01:25:41.241 --> 01:25:42.074
<v Speaker 3>homes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2113
01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.330
<v Speaker 3>Essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one can take in,</v>

2114
01:25:44.331 --> 01:25:45.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be in a nursing home because</v>

2115
01:25:45.711 --> 01:25:49.280
<v Speaker 3>your family can handle you anymore or</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just you need assistance.</v>

2116
01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:51.080
<v Speaker 3>So as soon as you start getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>assistance,</v>

2117
01:25:51.081 --> 01:25:52.280
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get assisted living.</v>

2118
01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:56.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's also you have less</v>

2119
01:25:56.111 --> 01:25:58.330
<v Speaker 3>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less things to think about,</v>

2120
01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:01.790
<v Speaker 3>less things to Worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in this assisted living place and</v>

2121
01:26:01.791 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 3>you're with a bunch of other checks that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are just like you</v>

2122
01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:07.730
<v Speaker 4>in the same boat and like come on girls</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not like you get to a certain</v>

2123
01:26:07.731 --> 01:26:09.170
<v Speaker 4>age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just get tired of dick.</v>

2124
01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:12.110
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>TheY probably still want some dick and</v>

2125
01:26:12.111 --> 01:26:15.500
<v Speaker 4>they probably remember when only 30</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago when they were young and hot</v>

2126
01:26:15.501 --> 01:26:17.330
<v Speaker 4>and the guys can kind of remember it</v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

2127
01:26:17.331 --> 01:26:18.950
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just do this.</v>

2128
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:20.960
<v Speaker 4>What else are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Play bingo.</v>

2129
01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.290
<v Speaker 4>But also the other nephews come by with</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking love chocolates and you much</v>

2130
01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:27.260

<v Speaker 4>Then probablY someone's coming by trying</v>

2131
01:26:27.261 --> 01:26:29.480
<v Speaker 4>to change the will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get on the science of shit's probably</v>

2132
01:26:29.481 --> 01:26:31.910
<v Speaker 4>gross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine talking to your relatives,</v>

2133

<v Speaker 4>they're trying to weasel you out of</v>

<v Speaker 4>other son found out about it and they</v>

01:28:16.730 --> 01:28:18.350
<v Speaker 2>but I have but I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2174
01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:21.440
<v Speaker 2>like I'm putting everything I have into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new band,</v>

2175
01:28:21.441 --> 01:28:22.270
<v Speaker 2>into the new.</v>

2176
01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:24.730

<v Speaker 4>sold?</v>

2177
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:26.640
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's.</v>

2178
01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:31.800
<v Speaker 2>It was a crazy number for physical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like over 50,000 physical copies,</v>

2179
01:28:32.241 --> 01:28:34.790
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seems rare,</v>

2180
01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:36.860
<v Speaker 2>which to me it didn't seem like very</v>
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

2181
01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:39.950
<v Speaker 4>but someone brought me in a cd just a</v>
<v Speaker 4>few days ago and I was like,</v>

2182
01:28:39.951 --> 01:28:41.360
<v Speaker 4>look at this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was it?</v>

2193
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.060
<v Speaker 3>been saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking pissed at spotify right now.</v>

2199
01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:15.540
<v Speaker 3>What are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's my issue with spotify is,</v>

2200
01:29:15.570 --> 01:29:16.403
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2201
01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you guys use spotify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but almost everybody does and people</v>

2202
01:29:22.131 --> 01:29:23.510
<v Speaker 2>don't know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get the truth out,</v>

2203
01:29:23.511 --> 01:29:27.260
<v Speaker 2>which is those big giAnt numbers you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the thing that people do.</v>

2204
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:29.510
<v Speaker 2>People not like me and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's these playlists that are</v>

2205
01:29:29.511 --> 01:29:32.180
<v Speaker 2>fucking huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some people just go on spotify to</v>

2206
01:29:32.190 --> 01:29:34.220
<v Speaker 2>listen to like country hits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2207
01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:38.800

<v Speaker 2>I don't know why the fuck they refused</v>

2208
01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:42.530
<v Speaker 2>to fucking playlist me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everyone else's has these inflated</v>

2209
01:29:42.531 --> 01:29:45.580
<v Speaker 2>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I did your.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably sent to send you that info</v>

2212
01:29:52.851 --> 01:29:54.830
<v Speaker 2>became the.</v>

<v Speaker 2>one most viral song in the on the</v>

2215
01:30:01.221 --> 01:30:02.420
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After I did your show,</v>

2216
01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:04.860
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well now can you put me on some of your</v>

2217
01:30:04.861 --> 01:30:06.140
<v Speaker 2>like country play?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen shit.</v>

2218
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:10.130
<v Speaker 2>And the guy who's the guy who runs the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country playlist,</v>

2219
01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:13.290
<v Speaker 2>it's expect to the meet the new boss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same as the old boss shit.</v>

2220
01:30:13.650 --> 01:30:15.380
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy from country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy they hired a guy from,</v>

2221
01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.500
<v Speaker 2>from terrestrial country radio who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who designed those playlists and he</v>

2222
01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:22.850
<v Speaker 2>won't put me on the fucking playlist</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I say fucking dirty words.</v>

2223
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:26.150
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm losing tons of listeners and I</v>

2224
01:30:26.151 --> 01:30:26.380
<v Speaker 3>can't</v>

2225
01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:27.213
<v Speaker 2>get on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2226
01:30:27.610 --> 01:30:30.850
<v Speaker 2>like when you see Florida Georgia line</v>
<v Speaker 2>with 100 million listens.</v>

2227
01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:34.060
<v Speaker 2>A lot of those are just from automatic</v>
<v Speaker 2>listens just from those fucking playlist</v>

2228
01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:35.020
<v Speaker 2>and people don't know that shit.</v>

2229
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:38.570
<v Speaker 3>We had an offer to do one of those was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>spotify or the other one.</v>

2230
01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.410
<v Speaker 3>Pandora or spotify.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2231
01:30:42.411 --> 01:30:43.660
<v Speaker 3>They do podcasts and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2232
01:30:43.710 --> 01:30:45.230
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what do you,</v>

2233
01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:47.750
<v Speaker 3>what you guys have an app?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you guys have money?</v>

2234
01:30:47.751 --> 01:30:49.670
<v Speaker 3>Like what's going on with this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is this?</v>

2235
01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:55.190
<v Speaker 3>You guys are just distributing content</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you must be making some money.</v>

2236
01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:57.320
<v Speaker 3>I didn'T want to pay you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's very,</v>

2237
01:30:57.321 --> 01:30:58.190
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

2238
01:30:58.191 --> 01:30:59.390
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very little.</v>

2239
01:30:59.391 --> 01:31:02.230
<v Speaker 3>It's just doesn't make any sense that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would actually.</v>

2240
01:31:02.231 --> 01:31:04.640
<v Speaker 3>I actually make when they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it gets played,</v>

2241
01:31:04.641 --> 01:31:08.660
<v Speaker 3>actually make decent money from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>combine because I didn't want to say how</v>

2242
01:31:08.661 --> 01:31:11.090
<v Speaker 3>much online but I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2243
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:14.030
<v Speaker 3>because I own my own label,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of those artists have to,</v>

2244
01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:17.660
<v Speaker 3>the label takes all their spotify money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's confusing to me is like what's</v>

2245
01:31:17.661 --> 01:31:20.200
<v Speaker 3>the benefit other than like being</v>
<v Speaker 3>introduced to stuff that you never would</v>

2246
01:31:20.201 --> 01:31:23.120
<v Speaker 3>have heard of before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the benefit of spotify is the same</v>

2247
01:31:23.121 --> 01:31:26.030
<v Speaker 3>benefit you would get from radio except,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but streaming,</v>

2248
01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:27.500
<v Speaker 3>except it's in real time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2249
01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me then better to.</v>

2250
01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:31.250
<v Speaker 3>The benefit to me is to listen to what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2251
01:31:31.251 --> 01:31:33.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't listened to this zeplin</v>

2252
01:31:33.261 --> 01:31:34.580
<v Speaker 3>element a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have it,</v>

2253
01:31:34.581 --> 01:31:38.060
<v Speaker 3>but so like you can make a spotify</v>
<v Speaker 3>playlist and people can listen to your</v>

2254
01:31:38.061 --> 01:31:38.894
<v Speaker 3>playlist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the,</v>

2255
01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:39.830
<v Speaker 3>is that the case?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

2256
01:31:40.090 --> 01:31:42.850
<v Speaker 7>You could make one and everyone could</v>
<v Speaker 7>listen to like the updated one you</v>

2257
01:31:42.851 --> 01:31:45.480
<v Speaker 7>share.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Diplo is a popular producer and he has</v>

2258
01:31:45.481 --> 01:31:47.320
<v Speaker 7>an updated hip hop list.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He makes.</v>

2259
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:51.090
<v Speaker 7>He updates it every few days,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there's no official spotify one</v>

2260
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:54.250
<v Speaker 7>that's separate from las.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Bought a fire official playlist.</v>

2261
01:31:54.251 --> 01:31:58.150
<v Speaker 7>It's just when you searched for him and</v>
<v Speaker 7>follow an influencer you like.</v>

2262
01:31:58.660 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 7>So I started a</v>

2263
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.500
<v Speaker 3>playlist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could put your song on my playlist</v>

2264
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:05.320
<v Speaker 3>and then it would be on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2265
01:32:05.370 --> 01:32:07.300
<v Speaker 3>But the people for some reason they go</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2266
01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:10.120
<v Speaker 3>they own the interface so they make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there were offIcial ones are the big</v>

2267
01:32:10.121 --> 01:32:12.640
<v Speaker 3>ones on the page.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just went over here.</v>

2268
01:32:12.670 --> 01:32:16.070
<v Speaker 3>The country hits like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This album's going to be in the top 10.</v>

2269
01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:19.420
<v Speaker 3>They won't fucking play it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm in,</v>

2270
01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:22.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying I'm banned but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they ain't gonna put me on the</v>

2271
01:32:22.061 --> 01:32:24.580
<v Speaker 3>playlist and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm at a disadvantage.</v>

2272
01:32:24.581 --> 01:32:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Like who the fuck cares about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean is it that big a deal?</v>

2273
01:32:28.730 --> 01:32:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Say hey you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they do pay you when it goes on.</v>

2274
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:33.760
<v Speaker 3>You actually make like get check when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2275
01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:34.863
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when my,</v>

2276
01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:35.860
<v Speaker 3>when people listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>

2277
01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:36.753
<v Speaker 3>I get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2278
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.990
<v Speaker 3>See this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2279
01:32:38.250 --> 01:32:40.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think when I.</v>

2280
01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:43.880
<v Speaker 7>There's a band of like a year,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't do this now,</v>

2281
01:32:43.881 --> 01:32:48.080
<v Speaker 7>but they gameD the system and they made</v>
<v Speaker 7>it an album that was silence and told</v>

2282
01:32:48.081 --> 01:32:52.100
<v Speaker 7>their fans to stream at all night long</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so they made a bunch of money just</v>

2283
01:32:52.101 --> 01:32:55.640
<v Speaker 7>off of the streams being played of</v>
<v Speaker 7>silence for like eight hours a day.</v>

2284
01:32:55.710 --> 01:32:58.390
<v Speaker 7>How could you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But there was no way.</v>

2285
01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:01.040
<v Speaker 7>They didn't have any writing to stop</v>
<v Speaker 7>someone from doing that,</v>

2286
01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:02.540
<v Speaker 7>from uploaded.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They stop it now.</v>

2287
01:33:02.541 --> 01:33:03.560
<v Speaker 7>You Can't do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2288
01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:05.060
<v Speaker 7>that's the limit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There is someone up.</v>

2289
01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:07.400
<v Speaker 7>I saw the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you couldn't someone up like eight hours</v>

2290
01:33:07.401 --> 01:33:12.050
<v Speaker 7>of rain so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well that's someone's going to get paid</v>

2291
01:33:12.051 --> 01:33:14.100
<v Speaker 7>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That rain track someone owns.</v>

2292
01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:17.370
<v Speaker 3>Is that recording here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to make sure that you didn't</v>

2293
01:33:17.371 --> 01:33:20.610
<v Speaker 3>steal it from youtube or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also someone had to actually be up for</v>

2294
01:33:20.611 --> 01:33:23.540
<v Speaker 3>eight hours recording.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You deserve a little bit of money and</v>

2295
01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:25.380
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people you got to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that until their fans,</v>

2296
01:33:25.381 --> 01:33:27.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to this song.</v>

2297
01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:29.550
<v Speaker 3>I just put it on repeat or with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>seems ridiculous.</v>

2298
01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:32.520
<v Speaker 3>That's a silly request and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2299
01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:33.840
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's unfair.</v>

2300
01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:34.621
<v Speaker 3>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2301
01:33:34.621 --> 01:33:35.640
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make me some money.</v>

2302
01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:38.980
<v Speaker 7>They used to do back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>call your radio station and request my</v>

2303
01:33:38.981 --> 01:33:40.950
<v Speaker 7>song on the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It makes you different though.</v>

2304
01:33:40.951 --> 01:33:41.040
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2305
01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:43.730
<v Speaker 3>and requesting a song and you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear it.</v>

2306
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:48.500
<v Speaker 3>That's saying you want to hear it saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>stream my rain 24 hours a day.</v>

2307
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:50.000
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these playlists,</v>

2308
01:33:50.001 --> 01:33:50.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost,</v>

2309
01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.790
<v Speaker 3>it's payola again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's one guy who's</v>

2310
01:33:52.791 --> 01:33:55.210
<v Speaker 3>controlling basically all the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2311
01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:56.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like this one dude is just doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2312
01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Just like if you're his buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2313
01:33:59.981 --> 01:34:03.320
<v Speaker 3>Any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like whether it's pandora or</v>

2314
01:34:03.321 --> 01:34:08.321
<v Speaker 3>whether it's spotify or what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing is you're selling or distributing</v>

2315
01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:11.540
<v Speaker 3>other people's work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're basically just a distribution</v>

2316
01:34:11.541 --> 01:34:13.880
<v Speaker 3>center.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's all it is.</v>

2317
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Other than like the unique features of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the distribution.</v>

2318
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:18.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can make playlists or oh,</v>

2319
01:34:18.801 --> 01:34:21.620
<v Speaker 3>you can do this and people can recommend</v>
<v Speaker 3>things to,</v>

2320
01:34:21.621 --> 01:34:24.320
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's algorithms and if they could</v>

2321
01:34:24.321 --> 01:34:26.660
<v Speaker 3>find out what you like and then you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>seek out those things.</v>

2322
01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:29.810
<v Speaker 3>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's no things to seek out,</v>

2323
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:34.700
<v Speaker 3>you don't really sell anything like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>youtube people suing them.</v>

2324
01:34:34.701 --> 01:34:37.340
<v Speaker 3>Like youtube isn't anything right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a player.</v>

2325
01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:42.110
<v Speaker 3>But youtube has bandwidth and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>bandwidth is extremely expensive.</v>

2326
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:45.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a different animal because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about they,</v>

2327
01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:48.320
<v Speaker 3>they're not just streaming something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're streaming video.</v>

2328
01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Video is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2329
01:34:50.730 --> 01:34:52.420
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would kind of fucking.</v>

2330
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:54.950
<v Speaker 3>And they have to be able to store it</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they upload it.</v>

2331
01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:57.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of storage?</v>

2332
01:34:57.170 --> 01:34:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Fucking youtube</v>

2333
01:34:58.270 --> 01:35:00.680
<v Speaker 4>and where is it all fucking stored?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your mom's house.</v>

2334
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:02.830
<v Speaker 4>Fucking my upper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>upper fucking cunt.</v>

2335
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:05.670
<v Speaker 7>Is it different than like a museum,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a,</v>

2336
01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:09.360
<v Speaker 7>maybe like youtube where our museum is a</v>
<v Speaker 7>building and they store a bunch of stuff</v>

2337
01:35:09.361 --> 01:35:12.240
<v Speaker 7>that people come to look at and they</v>
<v Speaker 7>have to make some sort of money to keep</v>

2338
01:35:12.241 --> 01:35:16.200
<v Speaker 7>it running and to keep people there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I Tried to make this argument the other</v>

2339
01:35:16.201 --> 01:35:17.610
<v Speaker 7>day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was talking to someone about it.</v>

2340
01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:20.460
<v Speaker 7>Is it the same or is it completely</v>
<v Speaker 7>different?</v>

2341
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.550
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is an argument that it's in the</v>

2342
01:35:23.551 --> 01:35:24.384
<v Speaker 4>ballpark.</v>

2343
01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the argument with like when youtube</v>

2344
01:35:26.681 --> 01:35:29.380
<v Speaker 2>originally sold for like billions right</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>

2345
01:35:29.381 --> 01:35:32.350
<v Speaker 2>it was mainly just clips of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's shows back in the old.</v>

2346
01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:35.890
<v Speaker 2>Now they have original content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they have people that they pay</v>

2347
01:35:35.891 --> 01:35:37.300
<v Speaker 2>people to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But back when it was sold,</v>

2348
01:35:37.301 --> 01:35:40.690
<v Speaker 2>people make people made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were dudes who made hundreds of</v>

2349
01:35:40.690 --> 01:35:43.180
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars basically stealing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>selling off,</v>

2350
01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:45.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clips of fucking was content.</v>

2351
01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Other music videos.</v>

2352
01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:49.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is an issue or was a giant issue</v>

2353
01:35:49.371 --> 01:35:51.260
<v Speaker 4>with youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they seem to have ironed out a lot</v>

2354
01:35:51.261 --> 01:35:53.630
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if we put up someone's content,</v>

2355
01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:56.900
<v Speaker 4>like if someone has an like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happens a lot with me with animal</v>

2356
01:35:56.901 --> 01:35:59.650
<v Speaker 4>attack videos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like anytime in animals attacking</v>

2357
01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:03.500
<v Speaker 4>another animal or some nature of video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you try to put that up on youtube,</v>

2358
01:36:03.501 --> 01:36:05.630
<v Speaker 4>you will get flagged and pulled off and</v>
<v Speaker 4>illegally.</v>

2359
01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Remember last time we got pulled</v>

2360
01:36:07.570 --> 01:36:10.200
<v Speaker 2>because for putting on my song and I was</v>

2379
01:36:48.121 --> 01:36:51.540
<v Speaker 4>if you took that video and uploaded it</v>

<v Speaker 4>just starts uploading your content,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which happens all the time.</v>

2402
01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:39.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it around a lot,</v>

2403
01:37:39.271 --> 01:37:40.420
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2404
01:37:40.890 --> 01:37:42.780
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have anybody that flags</v>
<v Speaker 4>out for you?</v>

2405
01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's a,</v>

2406
01:37:48.190 --> 01:37:50.860
<v Speaker 2>there's a um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>algorithm on youtube that catches it</v>

2407
01:37:51.970 --> 01:37:53.890
<v Speaker 2>that because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2408
01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:54.600
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

2409
01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:57.300
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my d distribution goes through this</v>

2410
01:37:57.330 --> 01:37:58.670
<v Speaker 2>distribution company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2411
01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:03.960
<v Speaker 2>And I think they have someone on their</v>
<v Speaker 2>team who does like to fly,</v>

2412
01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:05.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2413
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:07.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how they know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's definitely,</v>

2414
01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:08.730
<v Speaker 2>there's some kind of algorithm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2415
01:38:08.731 --> 01:38:11.250
<v Speaker 2>like you said when you put it in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's that everlast songs,</v>

2416
01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:13.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's someone that does</v>

2417
01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:15.300
<v Speaker 2>flag it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

2418
01:38:15.301 --> 01:38:17.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're finding out too,</v>

2419
01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:18.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where the fuck my money's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>

2420
01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:25.780
<v Speaker 4>You should do some sort of an online</v>
<v Speaker 4>video series like where you're giving</v>

2421
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:28.850
<v Speaker 4>people access to you getting on the tour</v>
<v Speaker 4>bus,</v>

2422
01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:31.760
<v Speaker 4>traveling and going different places</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

2423
01:38:31.761 --> 01:38:34.140
<v Speaker 4>you're doing this podcast now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Think that would add,</v>

2424
01:38:34.190 --> 01:38:35.570
<v Speaker 4>that would sort of compliment that.</v>

2425
01:38:36.150 --> 01:38:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Well that'd be good too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll hopefully the,</v>

2426
01:38:37.841 --> 01:38:38.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2427
01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:40.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing rick was shooting that'll,</v>

2428
01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:44.290
<v Speaker 2>if that's around enough will show enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind this,</v>

2429
01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:45.163
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that be a,</v>

2430
01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:48.560
<v Speaker 2>a bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a version of something like that.</v>

2431
01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:49.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2432
01:38:49.130 --> 01:38:50.660
<v Speaker 4>they'll definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>

2433
01:38:50.661 --> 01:38:55.100
<v Speaker 4>if you start doing it from showtime and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then take it to youtube or wherever and</v>

2434
01:38:55.101 --> 01:38:57.380
<v Speaker 4>start streaming it on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a great idea for you.</v>

2435
01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been cool though.</v>

2436
01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:01.400
<v Speaker 2>It's weird too because you get back into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole like,</v>

2437
01:39:01.401 --> 01:39:03.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2438
01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:04.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving.</v>

2439
01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:06.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving my music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2440
01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:06.990
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2441
01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:09.080
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tv thing is going to be for myself.</v>

2442
01:39:09.081 --> 01:39:11.720
<v Speaker 2>So how much do I sell myself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The music,</v>

2443
01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:12.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2444
01:39:13.250 --> 01:39:16.880
<v Speaker 2>do I do I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to rip them off on the fucking</v>

2445
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:18.520
<v Speaker 2>price of the music?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2446
01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:19.810
<v Speaker 2>because I want the thing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>

2447
01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:22.890
<v Speaker 2>It's very weird areas where people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2448
01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:24.260
<v Speaker 2>try to talk you out of just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2449
01:39:24.261 --> 01:39:26.640
<v Speaker 2>just give me the fucking music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2450
01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:30.340
<v Speaker 2>like if you do a standup special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's,</v>

2451
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:33.950
<v Speaker 2>they've had negotiations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not speaking for you,</v>

2452
01:39:33.951 --> 01:39:34.910
<v Speaker 2>but there's probably times where there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2453
01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:36.830
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this suspicious is going to help you,</v>

2454
01:39:37.190 --> 01:39:39.200
<v Speaker 2>so take fucking less money here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do that.</v>

2455
01:39:39.230 --> 01:39:40.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like they're doing you a</v>

2456
01:39:40.701 --> 01:39:41.840
<v Speaker 2>favor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a general.</v>

2457
01:39:42.230 --> 01:39:44.330
<v Speaker 4>They can do stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can say,</v>

2458
01:39:44.630 --> 01:39:46.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're right,</v>

2459
01:39:46.581 --> 01:39:47.600
<v Speaker 4>they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they're not,</v>

2460

<v Speaker 4>I mean if you're chris rock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not right.</v>

2462
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:53.510
<v Speaker 4>They have to pay chris rock like it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>good for them more than it's good for</v>

2463
01:39:53.511 --> 01:39:53.890
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

2464

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying like if you ever had any</v>

2465

<v Speaker 2>issues with like I'm telling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well guess what,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2467
01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:02.630
<v Speaker 4>My last one was netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My one before that was comedy central</v>

2468
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:06.780
<v Speaker 2>and like you want them to like market it</v>
<v Speaker 2>more of your head issues and they're</v>

2469
01:40:06.781 --> 01:40:07.614
<v Speaker 2>just let you know.</v>

2470
01:40:07.670 --> 01:40:09.710
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately no.</v>

2471
01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:12.140
<v Speaker 4>Comedy central was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was going to say the other thing</v>

2472
01:40:12.141 --> 01:40:14.630
<v Speaker 4>too is you've got a bigger marketing</v>
<v Speaker 4>outlet than any of them,</v>

2473
01:40:14.631 --> 01:40:15.950
<v Speaker 4>so now I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2474
01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:19.250
<v Speaker 4>And netflix doesn't really market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put up a few billboards and just</v>

2475
01:40:19.251 --> 01:40:21.890
<v Speaker 4>leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They like let people word of mouth,</v>

2476
01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:24.260
<v Speaker 4>but that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if someone puts out a comedy,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2484
01:40:39.711 --> 01:40:42.190

<v Speaker 4>specials because the main</v>

2485
01:40:42.190 --> 01:40:43.690
<v Speaker 2>thing with my records,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was it,</v>

2486
01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:46.600
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot of which I really loved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that it was,</v>

2487
01:40:47.050 --> 01:40:49.060
<v Speaker 2>it was old school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was literally word of mouth.</v>

2488
01:40:49.061 --> 01:40:53.290
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there wasn't means until it</v>

2489
01:40:53.291 --> 01:40:56.830
<v Speaker 2>wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Memes are fucking youtube ads and all</v>

2490
01:40:56.831 --> 01:40:57.664
<v Speaker 2>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

2491
01:40:57.730 --> 01:41:00.250
<v Speaker 2>you got to hear this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was found out about it.</v>

2492
01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I found out about it from people send</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2493
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:04.060
<v Speaker 2>sending it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You already knew you were doing</v>

2494
01:41:04.061 --> 01:41:05.830
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then people just started.</v>

2495
01:41:05.890 --> 01:41:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Just started sending me shit just</v>
<v Speaker 2>randomly.</v>

2496

<v Speaker 2>That didn't even know I knew you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I th,</v>

2497
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.020

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2498
01:41:11.021 --> 01:41:12.700
<v Speaker 2>I think what happened is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2499
01:41:12.701 --> 01:41:13.534
<v Speaker 2>it's like</v>

2500
01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:17.010
<v Speaker 2>they'd never heard country music used</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this.</v>

2501
01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:17.761
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2507
01:41:27.001 --> 01:41:31.050
<v Speaker 2>I guess is maybe what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to believe that you were the</v>

2508
01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:34.790
<v Speaker 2>first guy that figured out sort of the</v>

2511
01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:43.670
<v Speaker 2>sort of shock comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
