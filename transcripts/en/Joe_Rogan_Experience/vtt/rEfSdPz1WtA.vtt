<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were just telling me before this,</v>

9
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about social media and</v>

10
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The greatest part about social media as</v>

11
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>he get in contact with everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst part about social media is</v>

12
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>that you get in contact with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just this tiny percentage of</v>

13
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>people that won't let it rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was looking at something that you</v>

14
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>posted and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was something about some,</v>

15
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>like you had a great time doing some</v>
<v Speaker 1>race and like one of the first tweets,</v>

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.390
<v Speaker 1>one of the first comments was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as good at times running away from drug</v>

18
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>toasts are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

19
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.193
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

20
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did we,</v>

21
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm at posted the other day.</v>

22
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

23
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>we were putting our Christmas tree up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my family,</v>

24
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all the kids there and Anna and the</v>

25
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>lights and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ornaments and it's at the</v>

26
00:00:57.751 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>fucking Christmas tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

27
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>of course most people love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think it's a cute picture.</v>

28
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:04.450
<v Speaker 1>But then there's always the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>the tree is the tree juiced or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

30
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just always,</v>

31
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>which I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just part of it,</v>

32
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the best we got?</v>

33
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.163
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

34
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I deserved,</v>

35
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like give it a rest sometimes.</v>

36
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you definitely deserve some of it,</v>

37
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

38
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.630
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way around of course this,</v>

39
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things about this</v>

40
00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>whole scandal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing,</v>

41
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 1>it illuminated the real issue and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>real issue is the entire,</v>

42
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>and this is what we're talking about.</v>

43
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Bill Byrd did that thing on Conan or he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying,</v>

44
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking whole sport is like this.</v>

45
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was all the people that won the</v>

46
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Tour de France and all the years that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did it.</v>

47
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>If you go back to people that either</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't implicated or didn't test</v>

48
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:55.070
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is it,</v>

49
00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>like 18th place or something fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy like that,</v>

50
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's probably generous.</v>

51
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

52
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be,</v>

53
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be hard to know,</v>

54
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>hard to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

55
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

56
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are all easy for me to,</v>

57
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>to sit here and say and talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people would say,</v>

58
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course he says that.</v>

59
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course he thinks that talks on the</v>

60
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>table now you really don't have anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get it,</v>

61
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:22.160
<v Speaker 1>but is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

62
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

63
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I guess it is,</v>

64
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to talk about that.</v>

65
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to talk about my issue and</v>

66
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:34.740
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess also understandable.</v>

67
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it was a,</v>

68
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:38.690
<v Speaker 1>it was a fucked up time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

69
00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>and you had this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were at this crossroads of have a</v>

70
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.650
<v Speaker 1>very hard sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I very hard event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some would say one of the hardest</v>

72
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>sporting events in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three weeks,</v>

73
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 1>2,500 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>

74
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.540
<v Speaker 1>terrain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

75
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that meets really the perfect drug.</v>

76
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>When you have a drug that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's incredibly beneficial and at the</v>

77
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>totally undetectable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

78
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody dove in.</v>

79
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.530
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

80
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>

81
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>nobody wanted to be in that position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like any of us growing up as</v>

82
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>kids thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

83
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to Europe and get all</v>

84
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:17.960
<v Speaker 1>doped up and tried to went packers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

85
00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>nobody wanted to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

86
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>we all went with pure intentions.</v>

87
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>We got there and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm talking about to this crop of</v>

88
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Americans that went to Europe and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit was messy.</v>

89
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

90
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

91
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>do we go home or do we stay in fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

92
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>

93
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everybody stayed and fought and</v>

94
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:43.950
<v Speaker 1>they fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fought the way that,</v>

95
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>that the fight was being fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

96
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

97
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>and that all meets with where we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

98
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>And the people who were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think can speak to it.</v>

99
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Me and my teammates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my peers,</v>

100
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>my rivals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the competition.</v>

101
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have a unique perspective on it</v>

102
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 1>because we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in the war,</v>

103
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 1>but the person on main street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

104
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 1>the corner of main and first wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and they don't understand it.</v>

105
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>And so they can't really speak to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't change the fact that</v>

106
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>they're disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

107
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>they're really disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That disappointed me,</v>

108
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>that disappointing the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

109
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>they might hate me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might hate the sport.</v>

110
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they were most likely defenders of</v>

111
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're pissed off.</v>

112
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.030
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>it's taken me a long time to really</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that.</v>

114
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll spend the rest of my life</v>

115
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to work that one out with that</v>

116
00:04:38.741 --> 00:04:39.521
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

117
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:40.354
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

118
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>they're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're millions of them,</v>

119
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

120
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.420
<v Speaker 2>well they have a legitimate point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's also,</v>

121
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 2>there's people out there that want you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be wrong and want you,</v>

122
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.090
<v Speaker 2>they want to find someone who's done</v>
<v Speaker 2>something bad and never let it go.</v>

123
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.270
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely some of that going</v>

124
00:04:59.271 --> 00:05:01.880
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's also people that they don't</v>

125
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.170
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of sympathy for people who've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been extremely successful.</v>

126
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.200
<v Speaker 2>And I've made mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it gives them the green light to</v>

127
00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:11.990
<v Speaker 2>just decide to just continually attack</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

128
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.690
<v Speaker 2>But if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I tried to do,</v>

129
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.540
<v Speaker 2>when this whole thing was going down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I tried to put myself in your</v>

130
00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:20.990
<v Speaker 2>position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're this worldclass biker,</v>

131
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 2>it's 1994 and that's right around when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you started using [inaudible] 95 95.</v>

132
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.700
<v Speaker 2>So around this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you realize what those 20 years</v>

133
00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:35.540
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years ago,</v>

134
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.553
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

135
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.870
<v Speaker 2>When you realize that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pretty much all the best guys,</v>

136
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:43.820
<v Speaker 2>we're doing this now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that feeling like when you're</v>

137
00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:44.241
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

138
00:05:44.241 --> 00:05:47.150
<v Speaker 2>I've got a crossover into this deceptive</v>
<v Speaker 2>territory.</v>

139
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Now all of a sudden I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

140
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.680
<v Speaker 2>I have to lie about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to hide this and have to be a</v>

141
00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:56.681
<v Speaker 2>part of this sort of underground thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this underground aspect that's a part of</v>

142
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>great sport,</v>

143
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

144
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>W we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we held off as long as you know,</v>

145
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

146
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>epl came along in the early nineties.</v>

147
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we SORTA got to Europe in [inaudible] 92</v>

148
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>93.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

149
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.370
<v Speaker 1>and then it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it by that point,</v>

150
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:17.890
<v Speaker 1>by nine fords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 1>full on and we're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

152
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>this isn't good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but surely they're going to have a test</v>

153
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:25.980
<v Speaker 1>for this free flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

154
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 1>and we waited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we waited and it just never came.</v>

155
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

156
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 1>then we get to 95.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's tremendous pressure on the team</v>

157
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.150
<v Speaker 1>within the team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

158
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 1>we're losing the sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will the sponsor renew?</v>

159
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 1>The team wants results and we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

160
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're really fucked here.</v>

161
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 1>And so we all collectively made the</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision in spring of [inaudible] 95</v>

162
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:49.140
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

163
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 1>we have to go play ball the first time</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shot that stuff.</v>

164
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 1>What was that like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it's not,</v>

165
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.821
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

166
00:06:57.821 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew you were going to ask these</v>

167
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:02.144
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

168
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that type of drug.</v>

169
00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

170
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean like cocaine or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's not,</v>

171
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.150
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

172
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met was there a feeling like,</v>

173
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.741
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

174
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:15.470
<v Speaker 1>we've crossed into this land of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheating.</v>

175
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.390
<v Speaker 1>It was so long ago and that would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

176
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:22.391
<v Speaker 1>that was 21 years ago or 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little tough to remember exactly.</v>

177
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

178
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also too,</v>

179
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:28.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean it wasn't as if there were other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things we did before that,</v>

180
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean their eco is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this hugely powerful drug.</v>

181
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was,</v>

182
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sort of,</v>

183
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call them gateway drugs.</v>

184
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:37.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

185
00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:38.584
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

186
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.950
<v Speaker 1>if people is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.960
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the myth of performance enhancing</v>

188
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:45.794
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

189
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.000
<v Speaker 1>there's marijuana too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

190
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:49.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a lighter sort of entry level</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that,</v>

191
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.210
<v Speaker 1>what was the entry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the first time cortisone?</v>

192
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there another is to relieve pain or</v>

193
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.490
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

194
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is,</v>

195
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:01.250
<v Speaker 1>but it also works for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for racing bikes.</v>

196
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:04.190
<v Speaker 1>But how does it work for racing bikes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

197
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a strong anti-inflammatory</v>

198
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.800
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that you just inevitably,</v>

199
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:12.720
<v Speaker 1>you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's physically you feel better,</v>

200
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.310
<v Speaker 1>a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just a euphoria that comes with</v>

201
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:17.870
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

202
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who knows what,</v>

203
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of it,</v>

204
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a drug that,</v>

205
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:26.630
<v Speaker 1>I love it when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know,</v>

207
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.730
<v Speaker 1>in cycling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took cortisone,</v>

208
00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:29.600
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would be,</v>

209
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 1>it would be banned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However you under your watch,</v>

210
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the NFL and then somebody gets,</v>

211
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.550
<v Speaker 1>gets banged up in the first half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go in at halftime,</v>

212
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.370
<v Speaker 1>they come out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 1>the announcer says they went in and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>

214
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.000
<v Speaker 1>They got a cortisone injection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be,</v>

215
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.160
<v Speaker 1>they're going to play the second half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They rest for a hundred yards.</v>

216
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:47.330
<v Speaker 1>They win the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hero.</v>

217
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

218
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

219
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.650
<v Speaker 1>so it is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is weird.</v>

220
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.180
<v Speaker 1>It's weird what we've</v>

221
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 2>talked about that a bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and my friends,</v>

222
00:08:59.251 --> 00:09:04.251
<v Speaker 2>like when you go to Gnc or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the UFC has this company,</v>

223
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle farm which sells a bunch of</v>

224
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 2>supplements and things along those</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines,</v>

225
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 2>but yet they ban performance enhancing</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

226
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what are these supplements do?</v>

227
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they enhance you some way,</v>

228
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 2>like a certain level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we'll allow,</v>

229
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.880
<v Speaker 2>allow a certain level of improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain level of aid in recovery.</v>

230
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 2>But anything past that as cheating,</v>

231
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.140
<v Speaker 1>well it's all performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A nap,</v>

232
00:09:29.141 --> 00:09:33.730
<v Speaker 1>his performance in his short vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know that.</v>

233
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

234
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.300
<v Speaker 1>but they're also a two has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to be critical of</v>

235
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:42.130
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the UFC is efforts to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to combat doping or are you sought or</v>

236
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.510
<v Speaker 1>water or the anybody or any major sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to draw the line somewhere.</v>

237
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.060
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get asked that all the time</v>

238
00:09:49.061 --> 00:09:51.640
<v Speaker 1>because people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get frustrated with the issue and</v>

239
00:09:51.641 --> 00:09:53.200
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of throw their hands up and</v>

240
00:09:53.201 --> 00:09:53.560
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

241
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.150
<v Speaker 1>we should just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should just all be legal.</v>

242
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.260
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.470
<v Speaker 1>they said that to me and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking I'm going to go,</v>

244
00:09:59.471 --> 00:10:00.304
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

245
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.280
<v Speaker 1>But you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the answer either.</v>

246
00:10:03.281 --> 00:10:07.240
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a structure in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be aligned.</v>

247
00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:09.310
<v Speaker 1>And it might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that line might seem weird or fuzzy to</v>

248
00:10:09.311 --> 00:10:10.600
<v Speaker 1>people sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but shit,</v>

249
00:10:10.601 --> 00:10:12.970
<v Speaker 1>you have to have something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

250
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.300
<v Speaker 1>and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

251
00:10:16.301 --> 00:10:16.991
<v Speaker 1>it's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

252
00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.880
<v Speaker 1>anytime you mix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

253
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.940
<v Speaker 1>athletes that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are super motivated with,</v>

254
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:23.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with money,</v>

255
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:28.060
<v Speaker 1>with a pressure that comes with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>temptation that comes with that.</v>

256
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are for the rest of,</v>

257
00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

258
00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original Olympic Games they were,</v>

259
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.900
<v Speaker 1>there were there was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

260
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you have to think that it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen forever.</v>

261
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.650
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the substances will change over time.</v>

262
00:10:41.651 --> 00:10:43.300
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

263
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:44.920
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>

264
00:10:44.921 --> 00:10:45.750
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the game.</v>

265
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.020
<v Speaker 2>So the original writers like way back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the early days of the Tour de France,</v>

266
00:10:49.021 --> 00:10:51.240
<v Speaker 2>before they had drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were using alcohol.</v>

267
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all the,</v>

268
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of stories about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

269
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.320
<v Speaker 1>whether it's alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>

270
00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and crazy substances.</v>

271
00:10:59.511 --> 00:11:02.540
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time you had guys,</v>

272
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.000
<v Speaker 1>the Tour de France is a hundred years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

273
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.013
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

274
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doping is cheating.</v>

275
00:11:07.641 --> 00:11:08.750
<v Speaker 1>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's other ways.</v>

276
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys would hang on to cars,</v>

277
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.880
<v Speaker 1>guys would get in trains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were guys,</v>

278
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.070
<v Speaker 1>they would take a cork out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of a wine bottle and they would put</v>

279
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:23.150
<v Speaker 1>this is this fucking crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would have fishing string in the</v>

280
00:11:23.151 --> 00:11:23.751
<v Speaker 1>cork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

281
00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:25.820
<v Speaker 1>So wired up and they would have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.430
<v Speaker 1>they have a car off the road and they'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it in the neuro cheat.</v>

283
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

284
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:31.970
<v Speaker 1>just a subtle pole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

285
00:11:31.971 --> 00:11:33.080
<v Speaker 1>did they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.670
<v Speaker 1>any way to get ahead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

287
00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:36.140
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

288
00:11:36.141 --> 00:11:36.974
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

289
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sport is just that it's a brutal</v>

290
00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:42.860
<v Speaker 1>sport and you're not getting your face</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounded in like ufc,</v>

291
00:11:42.861 --> 00:11:46.010
<v Speaker 1>but you certainly feel like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting your face pounded.</v>

292
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically it's almost more</v>

293
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.930
<v Speaker 2>devastating cause it's so grinding when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about something that</v>

294
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.950
<v Speaker 2>three weeks and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it 2100 2,500 miles?</v>

295
00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>2,500.</v>

296
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an insane amount of time pushing</v>

297
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:02.360
<v Speaker 2>your body</v>

298
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.720
<v Speaker 1>a hundred miles a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you get to the top level,</v>

299
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.670
<v Speaker 1>it's remarkable how efficient it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

300
00:12:07.671 --> 00:12:11.360
<v Speaker 1>you have 200 guys going down the road on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a normal day.</v>

301
00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:13.790
<v Speaker 1>If it's a flat day and there's not wind</v>
<v Speaker 1>or crosswind,</v>

302
00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or rain or you know,</v>

303
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.410
<v Speaker 1>the conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty easy to be honest.</v>

304
00:12:18.411 --> 00:12:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's conversational.</v>

305
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.000
<v Speaker 1>The final is tough on the final gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast and people are competing for the</v>

306
00:12:23.001 --> 00:12:23.834
<v Speaker 1>stage went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

307
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

308
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those three weeks aren't like three</v>

309
00:12:28.521 --> 00:12:30.000
<v Speaker 1>weeks on the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

310
00:12:30.001 --> 00:12:30.500
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.840
<v Speaker 1>in the red line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to pace yourself.</v>

312
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.460
<v Speaker 1>The peloton paces itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

313
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of pace and police for,</v>

314
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:42.410
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

315
00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:43.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the mountains and the time</v>

316
00:12:43.761 --> 00:12:47.480
<v Speaker 1>trials or where the race is decided and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the hardest moments</v>

317
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.250
<v Speaker 2>when they first started introducing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

318
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.710
<v Speaker 2>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

319
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started using the transfusions</v>

320
00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:57.360
<v Speaker 2>and things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of an improvement did it have</v>

321
00:12:57.361 --> 00:12:58.194
<v Speaker 2>on the times?</v>

322
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

323
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:02.471
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

324
00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:05.890
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to say because the Times that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

325
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.740
<v Speaker 1>people look at our era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at my generation and they say,</v>

326
00:13:08.741 --> 00:13:09.970
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the time supposed to be,</v>

327
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly faster and be immediately,</v>

328
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.170
<v Speaker 1>but you can't compare cycling to track</v>
<v Speaker 1>and field or cycling to another sport</v>

329
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:21.670
<v Speaker 1>that's had had a rough patch and is now</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to clean itself up because</v>

330
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:24.550
<v Speaker 1>technology changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>road surfaces change.</v>

331
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Obviously training has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

332
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you go back to the 84 games</v>
<v Speaker 1>right here in Los Angeles,</v>

333
00:13:30.731 --> 00:13:34.260
<v Speaker 1>that was really the first major exposure</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had for,</v>

334
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.080
<v Speaker 1>for transfusions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

335
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.840
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the American team did in rolling</v>

336
00:13:38.841 --> 00:13:40.770
<v Speaker 1>stone exposed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

337
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.490
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transfusion is just a,</v>

338
00:13:43.491 --> 00:13:46.510
<v Speaker 1>it was an old school hipo replace that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

339
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Because you had a transfusion is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>adding red sales to your system,</v>

340
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.490
<v Speaker 1>which carries oxygen and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gives you more oxygen.</v>

341
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Then you had a drug came along that did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that for you.</v>

342
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.760
<v Speaker 1>So you didn't have to extract the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't have to put it back in.</v>

343
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:00.603
<v Speaker 1>It made it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.000
<v Speaker 1>it made it a lot easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when the test,</v>

345
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.150
<v Speaker 1>when they refined the protest and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately came up with it,</v>

346
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

347
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.270
<v Speaker 1>then people went back to the old school</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

348
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.580
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

349
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:18.330
<v Speaker 1>and then came other ways to detect that</v>
<v Speaker 1>through not so much through a test,</v>

350
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>but just through what they call the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological passport.</v>

351
00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:25.000
<v Speaker 1>So just studying parameters and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood,</v>

352
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:28.710
<v Speaker 1>whether it's ridiculous sites or red</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells or you know,</v>

353
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.630
<v Speaker 1>all of these things that the smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can come up with tests for.</v>

354
00:14:31.631 --> 00:14:34.630
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was more of a screening method to</v>

355
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.660
<v Speaker 1>detect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

356
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:41.020
<v Speaker 1>a transfusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's Kinda fucked up about all this is</v>

357
00:14:41.021 --> 00:14:41.854
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

358
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:46.870
<v Speaker 2>you won the Tour de France seven times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You obviously trained like a demon,</v>

359
00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:51.410
<v Speaker 2>pushed yourself to the limits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You beat everyone in the competition and</v>

360
00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 2>they were all doing the same thing you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing right.</v>

361
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Yet you're the one who was demonized and</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet you're the one who takes all the</v>

362
00:14:58.401 --> 00:14:59.030
<v Speaker 2>grief.</v>

363
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

364
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.793
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

365
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.610
<v Speaker 2>there's a situation that happens when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're involved.</v>

366
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.520
<v Speaker 2>You're involving money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're involving sponsors,</v>

367
00:15:08.521 --> 00:15:09.570
<v Speaker 2>you're involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

368
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.230
<v Speaker 2>once you first start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the ball starts rolling and the</v>

369
00:15:13.231 --> 00:15:17.760
<v Speaker 2>first deception has been launched out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there into the ether.</v>

370
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way to take it back if you</v>

371
00:15:19.621 --> 00:15:20.820
<v Speaker 2>want to keep racing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

372
00:15:20.821 --> 00:15:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

373
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people look,</v>

374
00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean my situ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my story and,</v>

375
00:15:28.141 --> 00:15:31.030
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear you loud and clear and you can</v>

376
00:15:31.031 --> 00:15:32.470
<v Speaker 1>say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can never say that.</v>

377
00:15:32.471 --> 00:15:33.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

378
00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.540
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were to say things like that,</v>

379
00:15:34.541 --> 00:15:36.340
<v Speaker 1>people would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would nuke me.</v>

380
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.110
<v Speaker 1>But it is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>

381
00:15:38.111 --> 00:15:40.430
<v Speaker 1>But that's anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

382
00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.700
<v Speaker 1>there was the doping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

383
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Which led to the lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

384
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Which led to the treatment of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

385
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.190
<v Speaker 1>I think by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can have the perspective that you</v>

386
00:15:51.191 --> 00:15:51.911
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can say,</v>

387
00:15:51.911 --> 00:15:53.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks to me like everybody did it.</v>

388
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.240
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

389
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they can look to the line and they,</v>

390
00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.800
<v Speaker 1>that's where they really start to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>

391
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.110
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy lied to us repeatedly,</v>

392
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.400
<v Speaker 1>but of course you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

393
00:16:03.401 --> 00:16:04.840
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no defense to that.</v>

394
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.290
<v Speaker 1>But if I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could share any personal insight.</v>

395
00:16:08.291 --> 00:16:09.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you lie,</v>

396
00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:12.820
<v Speaker 1>once you just keep lying to keep lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as if I'm going to sit here,</v>

397
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is 15 years ago and Joe,</v>

398
00:16:15.371 --> 00:16:17.530
<v Speaker 1>you're a nice guy and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

399
00:16:17.531 --> 00:16:21.220
<v Speaker 1>if I was on this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would lied to your fucking face a</v>

400
00:16:21.221 --> 00:16:23.110
<v Speaker 1>million times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so you know,</v>

401
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I would've just shown you now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know.</v>

402
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.830
<v Speaker 1>But that's not a surprise to you or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else,</v>

403
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.080
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you're in there,</v>

404
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.160
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if I'm going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:16:33.161 --> 00:16:34.990
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy joe seems like a really nice</v>

406
00:16:34.991 --> 00:16:35.950
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to be real.</v>

407
00:16:35.951 --> 00:16:38.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna be honest with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much money.</v>

408
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.030
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can't once that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

409
00:16:40.031 --> 00:16:41.770
<v Speaker 1>So I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was stuck,</v>

410
00:16:41.771 --> 00:16:44.350
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

411
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.540
<v Speaker 1>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that lie or that deception?</v>

412
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.410
<v Speaker 1>But then the way that I took my</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive nature,</v>

413
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.630
<v Speaker 1>which served me well in training and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>racing,</v>

414
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.290
<v Speaker 1>and took it into the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took it into a press conference,</v>

415
00:16:56.291 --> 00:16:59.800
<v Speaker 1>took it into a personal relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took it into former teammates.</v>

416
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my relationship with that,</v>

417
00:17:01.721 --> 00:17:03.160
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the part where people go,</v>

418
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.230
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this guy forever.</v>

419
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

420
00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.410
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

421
00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.270
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

422
00:17:10.271 --> 00:17:13.030
<v Speaker 1>you've got sort of the three phases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of them are good,</v>

423
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.910
<v Speaker 1>but as it got further away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

424
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.530
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

425
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of respect for others is the thing</v>

426
00:17:21.011 --> 00:17:23.410
<v Speaker 1>that totally fucked me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

427
00:17:23.411 --> 00:17:25.080
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would,</v>

428
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I would say to anybody that I understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

429
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may be in their timeout forever.</v>

430
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

431
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only thing I will add that,</v>

432
00:17:34.421 --> 00:17:36.610
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may sound like I'm trying to defend</v>

433
00:17:36.611 --> 00:17:40.150
<v Speaker 1>myself as I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to make amends with all those</v>

434
00:17:40.151 --> 00:17:41.080
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

435
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.330
<v Speaker 1>The ones that we all know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones people talk about,</v>

436
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I've traveled the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've sat with them,</v>

437
00:17:45.161 --> 00:17:46.600
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've looked them in the eyes and said</v>

438
00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:49.620
<v Speaker 1>what I did was totally unacceptable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

439
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost everybody has accepted the</v>

440
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:54.040
<v Speaker 1>apology and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

441
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.160
<v Speaker 1>and we've moved on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

442
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't get to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

443
00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this crowd of people that,</v>

444
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:04.890
<v Speaker 1>that you can't sit with face to face and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say you're sorry.</v>

445
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can talk to you,</v>

446
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:09.330
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people may view that as an apology</v>

447
00:18:09.331 --> 00:18:10.280
<v Speaker 1>or are or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

448
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.500
<v Speaker 1>but the ones that I could go sit with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

449
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's all that I would add to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

450
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:16.950
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

451
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud that most of those people,</v>

452
00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:21.630
<v Speaker 1>and I say most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everybody,</v>

453
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.420
<v Speaker 1>because not everybody's ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of those people said,</v>

454
00:18:24.421 --> 00:18:25.254
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

455
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:26.490
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're done.</v>

456
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.800
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

457
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.900
<v Speaker 1>if it was my son and he acted that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

458
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck are you doing?</v>

459
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.260
<v Speaker 1>You can't act that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had no,</v>

460
00:18:34.261 --> 00:18:36.090
<v Speaker 1>nobody was standing over me going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

461
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.670
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you,</v>

462
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.110
<v Speaker 1>you're acting like an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

463
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Nobody did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

464
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.340
<v Speaker 1>but if my son did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say you get over there and you</v>

465
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:48.090
<v Speaker 1>make it right with that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where it is.</v>

466
00:18:48.091 --> 00:18:50.220
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

467
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:54.540
<v Speaker 1>You're also in this bizarre position at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time to be the only famous cycler</v>

468
00:18:54.541 --> 00:18:58.030
<v Speaker 1>and the entire country cyclist cycler</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't on it.</v>

469
00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:03.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a cycler cycling drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiker,</v>

470
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.360
<v Speaker 1>biker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a bikers like sons of anarchy and</v>

471
00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:07.200
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

472
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of got burned out on that series.</v>

473
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.680
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

474
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the story weight to carry around.</v>

475
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the cancer</v>

476
00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:21.810
<v Speaker 1>organizations live strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of it has a lot of weight you're</v>

477
00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:24.210
<v Speaker 1>carrying around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I speak to it all the time.</v>

478
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a huge wave,</v>

479
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.640
<v Speaker 1>but you're also balancing out so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>good with this lie and this lie is</v>

480
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.570
<v Speaker 1>helping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All is good,</v>

481
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the live strong foundation is</v>

482
00:19:35.191 --> 00:19:37.500
<v Speaker 1>generating hundreds of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars helping all these people with</v>

483
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:39.890
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen you in the hospitals with</v>

484
00:19:39.891 --> 00:19:42.390
<v Speaker 1>these kids and it makes it mean me</v>
<v Speaker 1>having kids myself,</v>

485
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:45.930
<v Speaker 1>it makes me cry seeing these kids with</v>
<v Speaker 1>face masks on because their immune</v>

486
00:19:45.931 --> 00:19:47.760
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so compromise and they don't have any</v>

487
00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:51.030
<v Speaker 1>hair and they're just devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're hanging out with these kids</v>

488
00:19:51.031 --> 00:19:53.730
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're generating all this positive</v>

489
00:19:53.731 --> 00:19:56.310
<v Speaker 1>energy for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generating all this money,</v>

490
00:19:56.311 --> 00:19:59.280
<v Speaker 1>all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this research that's being funded.</v>

491
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.200
<v Speaker 1>So there's all this good as well.</v>

492
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.580
<v Speaker 1>You start telling the truth that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped.</v>

493
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.770
<v Speaker 1>We know what happens because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

494
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did happen.</v>

495
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.130
<v Speaker 1>It happened to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we dried up.</v>

496
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any of those fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>bracelets anymore.</v>

497
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn,</v>

498
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.510
<v Speaker 1>things were everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

499
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>

500
00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.870
<v Speaker 1>We had a good run and 85 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>bracelets.</v>

501
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

502
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody to be mistaken.</v>

503
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.740
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my interests were selfish.</v>

504
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

505
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.553
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

506
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.810

<v Speaker 1>defending myself and protecting myself.</v>

507
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

508
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.390
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't just myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was protecting,</v>

509
00:20:32.391 --> 00:20:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I was protecting the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was protecting our sponsors.</v>

510
00:20:35.251 --> 00:20:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I was protecting the tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was protecting the foundation.</v>

511
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

512
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just hard to say I'm going to,</v>

513
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

514
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.930
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what we just said.</v>

515
00:20:45.931 --> 00:20:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we now know on all of those things,</v>

516
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know what's happened to the</v>

517
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 1>foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know what's happened to the sport,</v>

518
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.460
<v Speaker 1>we know what's happened to the sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know,</v>

519
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.360
<v Speaker 1>and we can now see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

520
00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.470
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a devastating tall and,</v>

521
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.020
<v Speaker 1>most would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

523
00:21:02.021 --> 00:21:04.000
<v Speaker 1>that's all your fault lance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

524
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:05.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

525
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:06.700
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

526
00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:07.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

527
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.320
<v Speaker 1>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

528
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Speaker 1>did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on the foundations I did,</v>

529
00:21:11.801 --> 00:21:15.160
<v Speaker 1>it just breaks my heart to see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

530
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:20.050
<v Speaker 1>the effect it's had on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>effectiveness,</v>

531
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.480
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be way more complicated</v>

532
00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:23.591
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just your,</v>

533
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:24.570
<v Speaker 2>all your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

534
00:21:24.571 --> 00:21:26.860
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way more complicated because when</v>

535
00:21:26.861 --> 00:21:29.560
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about and tire sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's dirty.</v>

536
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better word,</v>

537
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.620
<v Speaker 2>an entire sport that's being deceptive</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire sport that's using these</v>

538
00:21:35.621 --> 00:21:39.700
<v Speaker 2>performance enhancing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're talking about you</v>

539
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.230
<v Speaker 2>because you're this weird outlier here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one guy who is incredibly</v>

540
00:21:44.231 --> 00:21:47.200
<v Speaker 2>successful at it in a country where</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody gave a fuck about the Tour de</v>

541
00:21:47.201 --> 00:21:48.940
<v Speaker 2>France until you came along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

542
00:21:48.941 --> 00:21:50.630
<v Speaker 2>he's Greg Lamon you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

543
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

544
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

545
00:21:54.311 --> 00:21:55.580
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only,</v>

546
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.130
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

547
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.400
<v Speaker 1>the story in the story being what it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cancer survivor that comes back that</v>

548
00:22:02.401 --> 00:22:06.510
<v Speaker 1>when's this event the transcends the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sport that brings a sport to psych.</v>

549
00:22:06.511 --> 00:22:10.650
<v Speaker 1>And although greg to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a tremendous job really,</v>

550
00:22:10.651 --> 00:22:14.070
<v Speaker 1>that was like the first blow up of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cycling and the United States and then</v>

551
00:22:14.071 --> 00:22:16.020
<v Speaker 1>comes my story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

552
00:22:16.021 --> 00:22:18.020
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story was soap.</v>

553
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.740
<v Speaker 1>The story was too big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

554
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the reason that,</v>

555
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.220
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that incentivized and motivated people</v>

556
00:22:26.221 --> 00:22:27.270
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

557
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.060
<v Speaker 1>like Novitsky and like the feds to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>along and say,</v>

558
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:30.960
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

559
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.300
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent.</v>

560
00:22:32.301 --> 00:22:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>

561
00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.960
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing that to save the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

562
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.630
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing that to save the</v>
<v Speaker 2>children no matter what.</v>

563
00:22:37.631 --> 00:22:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Ulterior motives that they might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

564
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.280
<v Speaker 2>try to list as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wanted to make sure the children</v>

565
00:22:42.281 --> 00:22:44.140
<v Speaker 2>don't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wanted to send a great message.</v>

566
00:22:44.141 --> 00:22:45.350
<v Speaker 2>We have bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

567
00:22:45.351 --> 00:22:50.351
<v Speaker 2>it's a high profile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high publicity v Avenue for them to</v>

568
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:52.090
<v Speaker 2>achieve notoriety.</v>

569
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

570
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.461
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

571
00:22:53.461 --> 00:22:54.960
<v Speaker 1>And we will get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

572
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

573
00:22:56.281 --> 00:22:57.570
<v Speaker 1>my rival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you take,</v>

574
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:58.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my main main,</v>

575
00:22:58.421 --> 00:22:59.580
<v Speaker 1>main rivals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's young,</v>

576
00:22:59.581 --> 00:23:04.320
<v Speaker 1>old rick or Baso are bulkier been tawny</v>
<v Speaker 1>or their star factor,</v>

577
00:23:04.321 --> 00:23:06.320
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just,</v>

578
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.770
<v Speaker 1>was just different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

579
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't cancerous wasn't,</v>

580
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.000
<v Speaker 1>so it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

581
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.690
<v Speaker 1>there was this disparity which the sport</v>
<v Speaker 1>enabled there to be because it just kind</v>

582
00:23:15.691 --> 00:23:18.630
<v Speaker 1>of an old school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Janky sport in terms of the way it's</v>

583
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.770
<v Speaker 1>organized and run as a business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

584
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.080
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a,</v>

585
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a South American economy.</v>

586
00:23:27.061 --> 00:23:28.920
<v Speaker 1>There was really the haves and the have</v>
<v Speaker 1>nots.</v>

587
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.980
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy way of putting it.</v>

588
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:32.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

589
00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:34.080
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have something like that,</v>

590
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.880
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you need to,</v>

591
00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those ships need to rise with</v>

592
00:23:40.831 --> 00:23:41.231
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See.</v>

593
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:41.930
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

594
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably didn't do a good enough job,</v>

595
00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying</v>

596
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.840
<v Speaker 2>to push for that in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my time.</v>

597
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't you have only a certain amount</v>

598
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:51.200
<v Speaker 2>of resources?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

599
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:52.490
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I've always said</v>

600
00:23:52.491 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 2>about extreme winters is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

601
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.620
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a borderline between greatness</v>

602
00:23:57.621 --> 00:24:00.110
<v Speaker 2>and madness and he crosses back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

603
00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say the greatest and madness are</v>

604
00:24:01.641 --> 00:24:04.790
<v Speaker 2>next door neighbors and they borrow each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other's sugar because there's almost no</v>

605
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:09.500
<v Speaker 2>way you can get that good without almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>losing your fucking mind.</v>

606
00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

607
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.940
<v Speaker 2>I haven't met some people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic at things,</v>

608
00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:15.590
<v Speaker 2>the great ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've met great ones,</v>

609
00:24:15.591 --> 00:24:18.920
<v Speaker 2>especially great fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're all fucking crazy.</v>

610
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you can't,</v>

611
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:24.530
<v Speaker 2>you can't not be because every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be a regular guy and get</v>

612
00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:25.364
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

613
00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.070
<v Speaker 2>I probably was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably still am a little crazy.</v>

614
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:28.963
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>

615
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.200
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't tell you.</v>

616
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Definitely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

617
00:24:31.461 --> 00:24:33.380
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're bad.</v>

618
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're a bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

619
00:24:35.181 --> 00:24:36.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know you that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

620
00:24:36.631 --> 00:24:40.160
<v Speaker 2>I just think you have to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sharpness.</v>

621
00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have that,</v>

622
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.640
<v Speaker 2>that grit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have that aggressive</v>

623
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:47.120
<v Speaker 2>competitive nature in order to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially in some fucking thing where</v>

624
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:50.150
<v Speaker 2>everyone's doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of creativity</v>

625
00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:53.300
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of the variables.</v>

626
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.420
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking pushing yourself and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine yourself.</v>

627
00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.310
<v Speaker 2>You're pumping your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

628
00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.181
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

629
00:24:59.181 --> 00:25:01.100
<v Speaker 2>can't fake to the left and go to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ride.</v>

630
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.280
<v Speaker 2>He can't fucking throw up some new moves</v>
<v Speaker 2>that no one's ever seen before.</v>

631
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.290
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

632
00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:07.250
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking wishing yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

633
00:25:07.251 --> 00:25:09.170
<v Speaker 2>You definitely had some of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>

634
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.290
<v Speaker 2>you're on a fucking bike and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>else is on a bike and you're going up</v>

635
00:25:12.291 --> 00:25:15.170
<v Speaker 2>the Goddamn same hill and there were no</v>
<v Speaker 2>secrets.</v>

636
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Dat,</v>

637
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:22.060
<v Speaker 2>dat concentrates down what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive nature is to like the edge.</v>

638
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Who's got the sharper edge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's more intense and you John,</v>

639
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:28.010
<v Speaker 2>because of that and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

640
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 2>He's getting riled up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get riled up,</v>

641
00:25:29.481 --> 00:25:30.210
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

642
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna step back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

643
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.720
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't jump across this table.</v>

644
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that a big old Kettlebell over</v>

645
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.090
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should come over here.</v>

646
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Just settle down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that what it is?</v>

647
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.130
<v Speaker 2>That it has to be what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the only way to win.</v>

648
00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.080
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an endurance event so you have to</v>

649
00:25:45.081 --> 00:25:48.030
<v Speaker 2>be a little careful with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are those moments where you</v>

650
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.680
<v Speaker 2>just have to unleash everything you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to unleash them in</v>

651
00:25:51.681 --> 00:25:54.320
<v Speaker 2>training or an in racing and yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes,</v>

652
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.260
<v Speaker 2>that seems like a really good point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you just put that up is there's,</v>

653
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.760
<v Speaker 2>you have to be careful with that.</v>

654
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:03.470
<v Speaker 2>You have to know when to put like how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to know your body like really</v>

655
00:26:03.471 --> 00:26:06.830
<v Speaker 2>intimately as far as you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to manage it over the course of</v>

656
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.800
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many women say the marathon,</v>

657
00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean nobody takes off and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a hundred yard dash.</v>

658
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to manage that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you have the experience of</v>

659
00:26:15.891 --> 00:26:19.670
<v Speaker 2>knowing what that effort is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look and feel like and you know how to</v>

660
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:21.740
<v Speaker 2>manage all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

661
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean three weeks long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

662
00:26:23.751 --> 00:26:25.790
<v Speaker 2>you've gotta be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be careful.</v>

663
00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a moment where you remember</v>

664
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:34.810
<v Speaker 2>like during the race where you wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>push but you had to back down like there</v>

665
00:26:35.551 --> 00:26:37.120
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there moments where you like you're</v>

666
00:26:37.121 --> 00:26:38.900
<v Speaker 2>managing don't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

667
00:26:38.901 --> 00:26:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Where you feel like this is not a smart</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to go.</v>

668
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:44.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

669
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.420
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you can,</v>

670
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.583
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we raised,</v>

671
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in the old days people just drained</v>

672
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:50.730
<v Speaker 1>and they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

673
00:26:50.731 --> 00:26:52.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna go hard today and I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go easy tomorrow.</v>

674
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.580
<v Speaker 1>And then it came the heart rate monitor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they followed their heart rate and</v>

675
00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:57.090
<v Speaker 1>they met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

676
00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.240
<v Speaker 1>they manage their training or racing</v>
<v Speaker 1>through that and then came the power</v>

677
00:27:00.241 --> 00:27:01.980
<v Speaker 1>meters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so now there's all these,</v>

678
00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are these devices where you can</v>

679
00:27:04.741 --> 00:27:07.440
<v Speaker 1>really monitor all of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're out there,</v>

680
00:27:07.441 --> 00:27:10.350
<v Speaker 1>you're not just sort of driving around</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind.</v>

681
00:27:10.351 --> 00:27:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually can see what you're doing</v>

682
00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.180
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that makes managing that effort a</v>

683
00:27:15.181 --> 00:27:16.014
<v Speaker 1>lot easier.</v>

684
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.160
<v Speaker 3>What is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the differences in the numbers?</v>

685
00:27:18.161 --> 00:27:20.080
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go back to like a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

686
00:27:20.081 --> 00:27:22.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you assuming that people weren't using</v>

687
00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:27.180
<v Speaker 3>corkscrews and or corks and fishing line</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whatever other ways she didn't.</v>

688
00:27:27.311 --> 00:27:28.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

689
00:27:28.391 --> 00:27:33.391
<v Speaker 3>what is like a realistic difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between the early days of winning and to</v>

690
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.070
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

691
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.340
<v Speaker 1>it's like a modern site clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

692
00:27:35.341 --> 00:27:36.740
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

693
00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:39.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bike basically got to the,</v>

694
00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bikes and the wheels and these</v>

695
00:27:40.851 --> 00:27:42.320
<v Speaker 1>things got to where they are today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

696
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:44.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

697
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:45.860
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

698
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.250
<v Speaker 1>they're fast now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

699
00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.860
<v Speaker 1>these guys are fast and that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

700
00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.510
<v Speaker 1>two things have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number One,</v>

701
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.310
<v Speaker 1>my story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

702
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.940
<v Speaker 1>got exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then people question everybody,</v>

703
00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.820
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Chris froome who won the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tour de France this year,</v>

704
00:27:58.821 --> 00:28:00.560
<v Speaker 1>or somebody that wins the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>championships,</v>

705
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.990
<v Speaker 1>they questioned them because of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they say,</v>

706
00:28:03.991 --> 00:28:04.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

707
00:28:04.221 --> 00:28:05.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

708
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.550
<v Speaker 1>he's dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like everybody's dirty,</v>

709
00:28:07.551 --> 00:28:10.100
<v Speaker 1>so you must be dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they go to the times,</v>

710
00:28:10.101 --> 00:28:10.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look at,</v>

711
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.250
<v Speaker 1>they look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

712
00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.500
<v Speaker 1>they look at my times in the Tour de</v>
<v Speaker 1>France and they look at the Peloton is</v>

713
00:28:15.501 --> 00:28:18.740
<v Speaker 1>times and they see now that the times</v>
<v Speaker 1>are actually either the same or better.</v>

714
00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:19.371
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

715
00:28:19.371 --> 00:28:22.160
<v Speaker 1>then of course that that supports my</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument that you're dirty,</v>

716
00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:24.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's it?</v>

717
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's fat,</v>

718
00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

719
00:28:26.361 --> 00:28:27.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

720
00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

721
00:28:29.001 --> 00:28:29.750
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

722
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I get asked all the time what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>now or what's,</v>

723
00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

724
00:28:33.171 --> 00:28:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so far removed from cycling that I</v>

725
00:28:36.291 --> 00:28:38.990
<v Speaker 1>have no earthly idea of what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not going on.</v>

726
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.850
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think it's necessarily fair</v>
<v Speaker 1>to blame those guys.</v>

727
00:28:43.851 --> 00:28:45.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand it,</v>

728
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.300
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

729
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:48.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

730
00:28:48.351 --> 00:28:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have these athletes might be a</v>

731
00:28:50.691 --> 00:28:52.850
<v Speaker 1>lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The training might be a lot better.</v>

732
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I do think technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bikes,</v>

733
00:28:54.861 --> 00:28:57.920
<v Speaker 1>the wheels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even road surfaces are a lot better.</v>

734
00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:58.920
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

735
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.930
<v Speaker 3>is there a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there any part of you that's kind of</v>

736
00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:04.140
<v Speaker 3>pissed off that there are performance</v>
<v Speaker 3>enhancing drugs?</v>

737
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.880
<v Speaker 3>Like if there was nothing and if we just</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to be Mano a Mano,</v>

738
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.000
<v Speaker 1>same result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have the same result.</v>

739
00:29:11.001 --> 00:29:13.520
<v Speaker 1>I would have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is my belief that</v>

740
00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.300
<v Speaker 3>that the results would be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'll be a few seconds slower or</v>

741
00:29:17.301 --> 00:29:18.800
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it would be.</v>

742
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.480
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if the overall time</v>
<v Speaker 1>slower.</v>

743
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.160
<v Speaker 1>What matters is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

744
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.020
<v Speaker 1>is if you were five minutes ahead of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next guy,</v>

745
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:26.550
<v Speaker 1>that's what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what matters.</v>

746
00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my belief.</v>

747
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.070
<v Speaker 1>But there are others that don't hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>that belief.</v>

748
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.670
<v Speaker 1>There are others that say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean doping effects other individuals</v>

749
00:29:35.671 --> 00:29:37.290
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

750
00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't know.</v>

751
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:40.600
<v Speaker 1>You might have one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or you might've went none.</v>

752
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean is that some people</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't doping correctly,</v>

753
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.620
<v Speaker 1>but look at once you're doping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're doping and the other guy's</v>

754
00:29:47.621 --> 00:29:48.760
<v Speaker 1>doping better than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

755
00:29:48.761 --> 00:29:50.590
<v Speaker 1>well then you're not doing your job</v>
<v Speaker 1>doping.</v>

756
00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:52.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not being a good competitive</v>

757
00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:54.760
<v Speaker 1>doper bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

758
00:29:54.761 --> 00:29:55.780
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

759
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it make sense?</v>

760
00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.421
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

761
00:29:58.421 --> 00:30:01.780
<v Speaker 1>it gets complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And W we would talk forever and,</v>

762
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:04.210
<v Speaker 1>and people would argue with us forever</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

763
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.820
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not here,</v>

764
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:07.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

765
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:11.680
<v Speaker 1>just who they are if you're listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my perspective is,</v>

766
00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.120
<v Speaker 1>is really clear on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

767
00:30:13.121 --> 00:30:15.130
<v Speaker 1>I think if you have a sport where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's,</v>

768
00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were both talking about the bill</v>

769
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.410
<v Speaker 1>birth thing that he did on Conan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

770
00:30:20.411 --> 00:30:22.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our psychopath is Beth and you're a</v>

771
00:30:22.361 --> 00:30:23.680
<v Speaker 1>psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

772
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.990
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it is.</v>

773
00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:28.750
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that.</v>

774
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could they take away,</v>

775
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.940
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things that drove me</v>
<v Speaker 1>the craziest about this.</v>

776
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Like what did they do with the seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>years where you one where they said,</v>

777
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:39.730
<v Speaker 1>you're not the winter anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

778
00:30:39.731 --> 00:30:42.370
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck wanted then that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

779
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.380
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you find the guy who wanted show?</v>

780
00:30:44.381 --> 00:30:45.214
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

781
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.200
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's in the record books.</v>

782
00:30:47.201 --> 00:30:48.670
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's empty.</v>

783
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Empty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empty,</v>

784
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:51.540
<v Speaker 1>empty for seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

785
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:54.900
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

786
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.000
<v Speaker 1>I you you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you,</v>

787
00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:03.070
<v Speaker 1>but you can say that I cannot say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I will say is that I don't,</v>

788
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>far be it for me to talk about what's</v>

789
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:09.790
<v Speaker 1>fair or not fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's fair for the</v>

790
00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:13.030
<v Speaker 1>sport to leave those empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's crazy.</v>

791
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.720
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and compare and contrast.</v>

792
00:31:14.721 --> 00:31:16.120
<v Speaker 1>So when the tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the Yellow Jersey,</v>

793
00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.570
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy who wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the Polka Dot Jersey is</v>

794
00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:22.530
<v Speaker 1>technically the best climber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the Green Jersey who</v>

795
00:31:22.531 --> 00:31:27.531
<v Speaker 1>was technically the best sprinter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those seven years were the Green Jersey</v>

796
00:31:27.551 --> 00:31:31.180
<v Speaker 1>was one by Zabul who admitted to having</v>
<v Speaker 1>dope all seven of those years.</v>

797
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:35.290
<v Speaker 1>The polka Dot Jersey was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was was one by veranique from France who</v>

798
00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:37.060
<v Speaker 1>admitted to having dumped all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

799
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.240
<v Speaker 1>those all stand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's still there.</v>

800
00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:43.360
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Yellow Jersey has been erased,</v>

801
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:44.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second place,</v>

802
00:31:44.621 --> 00:31:46.420
<v Speaker 1>third place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those places are still there.</v>

803
00:31:46.421 --> 00:31:48.800
<v Speaker 1>The years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the years prior to me where it's</v>

804
00:31:48.801 --> 00:31:51.850
<v Speaker 1>somebody was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had admitted or was caught all still</v>

805
00:31:51.851 --> 00:31:54.310
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's just an asterisk in first</v>

806
00:31:54.311 --> 00:31:55.690
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to Wikipedia,</v>

807
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.460
<v Speaker 1>it's just there's just a line through</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

808
00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so strange.</v>

809
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

810
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:04.780
<v Speaker 1>It's strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

811
00:32:04.781 --> 00:32:07.240
<v Speaker 1>And it's strange for me and I it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it makes me,</v>

812
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.190
<v Speaker 1>it makes me sad because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

813
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:11.261
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna look,</v>

814
00:32:11.261 --> 00:32:13.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe I won the races.</v>

815
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>

816
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:14.711
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

817
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:17.020
<v Speaker 1>you did win the races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you won the race.</v>

818
00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.100
<v Speaker 1>People to ask are the ones that got</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat.</v>

819
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you ask them,</v>

820
00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.380
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're asking Keon if you asked to do</v>

821
00:32:24.381 --> 00:32:25.214
<v Speaker 1>a left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he asked,</v>

822
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>below.</v>

823
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.070
<v Speaker 1>If you ask any of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say he won those bike races.</v>

824
00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.740
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

827
00:32:35.711 --> 00:32:36.880
<v Speaker 1>your house and I'd have to give them</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

828
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:37.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

829
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She put it on an instagram picture of</v>

830
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:42.170
<v Speaker 1>him every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

831
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:44.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

832
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:46.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to put that picture up</v>

833
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:48.650
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was a great picture though.</v>

834
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you chilling on the couch at seven</v>

835
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.820
<v Speaker 1>yellow jerseys on your wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

836
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:54.410
<v Speaker 1>I got a note for that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

837
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.060
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get new no matter what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

838
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.240
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

839
00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.610
<v Speaker 1>I look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

840
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.890
<v Speaker 1>they're up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're up and,</v>

841
00:33:01.891 --> 00:33:02.724
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

842
00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:04.890
<v Speaker 1>and I'm proud of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really am.</v>

843
00:33:04.891 --> 00:33:06.840
<v Speaker 1>And I'm proud of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing too,</v>

844
00:33:06.841 --> 00:33:09.810
<v Speaker 1>is that as weird as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as strange as it is,</v>

845
00:33:09.811 --> 00:33:12.630
<v Speaker 1>that there's just a line through those</v>
<v Speaker 1>years as if they did not happen.</v>

846
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

847
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was paid to do a job,</v>

848
00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.240
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As messy as the job was,</v>

849
00:33:18.241 --> 00:33:19.440
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was paid to do it.</v>

850
00:33:19.441 --> 00:33:21.000
<v Speaker 1>And I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

851
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:24.120
<v Speaker 1>and I wanted to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to capture those memories for</v>

852
00:33:24.121 --> 00:33:27.330
<v Speaker 1>myself and for my teammates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't,</v>

853
00:33:27.331 --> 00:33:31.260
<v Speaker 1>nobody can take those away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still hold those memories to myself.</v>

854
00:33:31.261 --> 00:33:32.670
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

855
00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.261
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

856
00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:35.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's had a complicated ending,</v>

857
00:33:35.191 --> 00:33:36.480
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

858
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still view those as victories and I</v>

859
00:33:38.851 --> 00:33:43.080
<v Speaker 1>still view those memories is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The caring round,</v>

860
00:33:43.081 --> 00:33:46.770
<v Speaker 1>the lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being interrogated and questioned.</v>

861
00:33:46.771 --> 00:33:48.870
<v Speaker 1>And it was that the hardest part about</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it,</v>

862
00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

863
00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I was only interrogated are questioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the press and,</v>

864
00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.670
<v Speaker 1>and even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

865
00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:58.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

866
00:33:58.661 --> 00:34:00.510
<v Speaker 1>if it would have been in this day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>age with,</v>

867
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.500
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with twitter and facebook and social</v>

868
00:34:02.501 --> 00:34:04.000
<v Speaker 1>media and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

869
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.130
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been a thousand times</v>

870
00:34:06.131 --> 00:34:06.580
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

871
00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:07.413
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>

872
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

873
00:34:09.281 --> 00:34:11.110
<v Speaker 1>this was in the late nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

874
00:34:11.111 --> 00:34:13.180
<v Speaker 1>think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a long time ago.</v>

875
00:34:13.181 --> 00:34:17.620
<v Speaker 1>And so the level of scrutiny while it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was high wasn't nearly as high as it</v>

876
00:34:17.621 --> 00:34:19.600
<v Speaker 1>would have been today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

877
00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.420
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

878
00:34:22.421 --> 00:34:23.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you dig in,</v>

879
00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:24.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with these,</v>

880
00:34:24.851 --> 00:34:25.661
<v Speaker 1>with these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

881
00:34:25.661 --> 00:34:29.560
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once you finally came clean,</v>

882
00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously there was a lot of blow back,</v>

883
00:34:31.301 --> 00:34:35.750
<v Speaker 1>but was there also a relief?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

884
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.990
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not immediately.</v>

885
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:40.131
<v Speaker 1>Not immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

886
00:34:40.131 --> 00:34:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

887
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get asked that a lot and I think</v>

888
00:34:42.981 --> 00:34:44.640
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

889
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people expect me to say,</v>

890
00:34:47.271 --> 00:34:47.781
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

891
00:34:47.781 --> 00:34:50.480
<v Speaker 1>it was just this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just this huge relief off your</v>

892
00:34:50.481 --> 00:34:52.540
<v Speaker 1>shoulders when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talked to oprah or you or</v>

893
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.460
<v Speaker 1>whatever you did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can now move forward and live</v>

894
00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.460
<v Speaker 1>the life of an honest man and et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

895
00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.670
<v Speaker 1>But it's taken me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just sum it up.</v>

896
00:35:01.671 --> 00:35:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting here today,</v>

897
00:35:02.661 --> 00:35:05.300
<v Speaker 1>having this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would much prefer to have this</v>

898
00:35:05.301 --> 00:35:09.500
<v Speaker 1>conversation then the one where I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>align to your fucking face 15 times,</v>

899
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.710
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd much rather us talk like this.</v>

900
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:14.930
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a relief.</v>

901
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

902
00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.030
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

903
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I walked out of sitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Oprah and was like,</v>

904
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:21.620
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel amazing.</v>

905
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:24.920
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was an ass weapon.</v>

906
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:26.223
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

907
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.830
<v Speaker 1>so was it like sitting there with Oprah?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's asking,</v>

908
00:35:30.831 --> 00:35:33.470
<v Speaker 1>she's drilling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask you questions about that start.</v>

909
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.520
<v Speaker 1>She came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she came out hot,</v>

910
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:36.830
<v Speaker 1>yes or no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no.</v>

911
00:35:36.831 --> 00:35:37.940
<v Speaker 1>The one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes or no.</v>

912
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:40.830
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought she did a good job.</v>

913
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.660
<v Speaker 2>She did a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought she did a good job.</v>

914
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was very compelling because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way she structured the beginning</v>

915
00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:47.990
<v Speaker 2>part of the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

916
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.340
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that on television.</v>

917
00:35:50.341 --> 00:35:52.030
<v Speaker 2>You want to capture people and keep them</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

918
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.670
<v Speaker 2>You kind of have to approach it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

919
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I thought she did a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

920
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that it wasn't well received and</v>

921
00:35:59.221 --> 00:36:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I lean in what way?</v>

922
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.870
<v Speaker 1>You mean people didn't like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and that way he wasn't low</v>

923
00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.890
<v Speaker 1>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's two things.</v>

924
00:36:07.891 --> 00:36:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

925
00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't emotionally ready to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

926
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

927
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in a place where I think that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit today where it's,</v>

928
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:23.130
<v Speaker 1>it is a position of contrition and</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the tremendous sense of</v>

929
00:36:23.191 --> 00:36:28.080
<v Speaker 1>betrayal that's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my perception of that today is much</v>

930
00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:30.570
<v Speaker 1>sharper than it was three years ago when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat with her.</v>

931
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 1>The feds and other lawsuits forced my</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

932
00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I had to sit there with that cause I</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew I was going to be sitting with her</v>

933
00:36:37.891 --> 00:36:41.760
<v Speaker 1>or with you or with Tom Brokaw hall or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to be sitting with a</v>

934
00:36:41.761 --> 00:36:45.780
<v Speaker 1>government lawyer being deposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being videoed and being leaked.</v>

935
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.340
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

936
00:36:47.341 --> 00:36:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find the place that I'd</v>

937
00:36:49.321 --> 00:36:53.160
<v Speaker 1>rather sit down and talk about this as</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to a grainy video that the</v>

938
00:36:53.161 --> 00:36:56.550
<v Speaker 1>government leaks to the world and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>your coming out party.</v>

939
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.790
<v Speaker 1>So I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

940
00:36:58.791 --> 00:37:03.360
<v Speaker 1>the thing about Oprah is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is aside from me just not being ready at</v>

941
00:37:03.361 --> 00:37:04.710
<v Speaker 1>the time to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

942
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.770
<v Speaker 1>people sensed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most importantly for the diehard</v>

943
00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.260
<v Speaker 1>cycling fans and sports fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say enough.</v>

944
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.880
<v Speaker 1>You didn't name names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>

945
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.060
<v Speaker 1>you didn't call anybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] wasn't detailed enough.</v>

946
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:19.860
<v Speaker 1>You're holding back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're protecting people.</v>

947
00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:23.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very small percentage of the</v>

948
00:37:23.131 --> 00:37:25.590
<v Speaker 1>population for the majority of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

949
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Those first five minutes was way too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much information.</v>

950
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:33.060
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did I just hear?</v>

951
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Like blood bags hipo testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 1>transfusions,</v>

952
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:40.590
<v Speaker 1>cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was way too much.</v>

953
00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:44.510
<v Speaker 1>So you had people that were at one camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a smaller camp said he didn't say it.</v>

954
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Now he's holding back here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other campus like,</v>

955
00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.593
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

956
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.020
<v Speaker 1>that's more than I needed to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so everybody was pissed.</v>

957
00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they would think it's</v>

958
00:37:54.141 --> 00:37:55.040
<v Speaker 2>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

959
00:37:55.041 --> 00:37:57.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that logic because it</v>

960
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.080
<v Speaker 2>is reality or grandma</v>

961
00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:00.360
<v Speaker 1>duluth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

962
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:02.700
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you and you supported the cancer.</v>

963
00:38:02.701 --> 00:38:02.820
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

964
00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:06.000
<v Speaker 2>survivor clause isn't real and you hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

965
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:07.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting there going,</v>

966
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.940
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

967
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:11.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't like anything about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

968
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:13.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I see,</v>

969
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:16.580
<v Speaker 2>because they were also supporting lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drawing,</v>

970
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also supporting the stores.</v>

971
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:23.430
<v Speaker 2>How much of an effect did it have like</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost immediately on your foundation?</v>

972
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:26.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was asked to leave the</v>

973
00:38:26.011 --> 00:38:28.560
<v Speaker 2>foundation before that and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't been back,</v>

974
00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:30.300
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not,</v>

975
00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:32.520
<v Speaker 2>and I don't ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it still around?</v>

976
00:38:32.521 --> 00:38:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

977
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.020
<v Speaker 2>But it must've taken a devastating,</v>

978
00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:36.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

979
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:40.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean it takes a hit in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

980
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 1>obviously in terms of fundraising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which directly leads to its,</v>

981
00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:47.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its effectiveness in terms of helping</v>

982
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.440
<v Speaker 1>create change for cancer survivors are</v>
<v Speaker 1>all around the world.</v>

983
00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:52.420
<v Speaker 1>You need to raise money in order to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

984
00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staff layoffs.</v>

985
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

986
00:38:57.041 --> 00:38:57.781
<v Speaker 1>you name it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

987
00:38:57.781 --> 00:38:58.890
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

988
00:38:58.891 --> 00:39:02.650
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have specifics because once I</v>

989
00:39:02.651 --> 00:39:06.310
<v Speaker 1>left the board and left the organization</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they legally changed the name,</v>

990
00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:08.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

991
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:09.610
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

992
00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.100
<v Speaker 2>none of it was shocking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

993
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew,</v>

994
00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I knew that every,</v>

995
00:39:16.011 --> 00:39:18.320
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who was a professional</v>
<v Speaker 2>cycler,</v>

996
00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.660
<v Speaker 2>just say his name is John Cyclist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cyclist.</v>

997
00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get this right.</v>

998
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

999
00:39:23.931 --> 00:39:25.400
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to write it down.</v>

1000
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Cyclist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1001
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.590
<v Speaker 2>He's up by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people say the ultimate fighting</v>

1002
00:39:30.591 --> 00:39:31.910
<v Speaker 2>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's championship.</v>

1003
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and see,</v>

1004
00:39:34.851 --> 00:39:36.110
<v Speaker 2>I would say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1005
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.790
<v Speaker 2>but challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1006
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:39.440
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend John was a professional</v>

1007
00:39:39.441 --> 00:39:40.550
<v Speaker 2>cyclist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1008
00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.420
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1009
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.750
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1010
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:45.290
<v Speaker 2>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe three,</v>

1011
00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:46.183
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>

1012
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:47.480
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1013
00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.010
<v Speaker 2>he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

1014
00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.180
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were all,</v>

1015
00:39:50.181 --> 00:39:51.710
<v Speaker 2>we're all on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1016
00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.990
<v Speaker 2>guys would get off the bus in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the night.</v>

1017
00:39:53.991 --> 00:39:57.380
<v Speaker 2>You'd hear them taking off their bikes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going for a ride because their blood</v>

1018
00:39:57.381 --> 00:39:58.214
<v Speaker 2>got too thick.</v>

1019
00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.280
<v Speaker 1>There are those old stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1020
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:01.790
<v Speaker 1>that's from EPL,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1021
00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.340
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1022
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:05.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard those stories.</v>

1023
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:06.970
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never saw that,</v>

1024
00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:08.500
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my friend John,</v>

1025
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it was on the crazy team or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1026
00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:14.410
<v Speaker 1>And back in the day before they got it</v>
<v Speaker 1>dialed in.</v>

1027
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:15.303
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they,</v>

1028
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:18.280
<v Speaker 1>what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there was no test,</v>

1029
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no sport had a test,</v>

1030
00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:23.420
<v Speaker 1>whether it's cycling or swimming or</v>
<v Speaker 1>running or boxing or who,</v>

1031
00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:26.380
<v Speaker 1>whatever sport is using epo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have a test for EPO.</v>

1032
00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.410
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1033
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.231
<v Speaker 1>and with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1034
00:40:29.231 --> 00:40:31.090
<v Speaker 1>one of the side effects of epo or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

1035
00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:33.400
<v Speaker 1>or increasing your red cell count is</v>
<v Speaker 1>your blood.</v>

1036
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:36.490
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's literally a question of viscosity,</v>

1037
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:38.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all your oil and your hotel royal.</v>

1038
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1039
00:40:39.071 --> 00:40:41.110
<v Speaker 1>that's the only time you ever think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word viscosity,</v>

1040
00:40:41.111 --> 00:40:42.250
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is your motor oil.</v>

1041
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:47.170
<v Speaker 1>But more red cells means thicker blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your blood is too thick.</v>

1042
00:40:47.171 --> 00:40:48.400
<v Speaker 1>We know what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1043
00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.670
<v Speaker 1>it isn't a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the sport had to go to,</v>

1044
00:40:51.671 --> 00:40:54.610
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't test for the science</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't there yet.</v>

1045
00:40:54.611 --> 00:40:57.760
<v Speaker 1>So they went to these sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>preventative screening methods,</v>

1046
00:40:57.761 --> 00:40:59.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then they started testing the</v>

1047
00:40:59.891 --> 00:41:02.050
<v Speaker 1>viscosity or the thickness of people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloods,</v>

1048
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.090
<v Speaker 1>otherwise known as hematocrit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1049
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that they would use that as a</v>

1050
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:10.360
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody above 50% hematocrit couldn't</v>

1051
00:41:10.361 --> 00:41:13.090
<v Speaker 1>race that you weren't positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't get banned,</v>

1052
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.640
<v Speaker 1>but you were put on the side for two</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks as a,</v>

1053
00:41:15.641 --> 00:41:19.770
<v Speaker 1>as a health measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone under 50% it was fine to race.</v>

1054
00:41:19.771 --> 00:41:21.220
<v Speaker 1>So everybody took that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1055
00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:23.350
<v Speaker 1>before that there were people that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>

1056
00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:26.290
<v Speaker 1>64%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys might be getting up in the</v>

1057
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:27.190
<v Speaker 1>middle of the night going for a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>spin,</v>

1058
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.160
<v Speaker 1>but at 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1059
00:41:30.161 --> 00:41:32.800
<v Speaker 1>they deemed that sort of the healthiest</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

1060
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people pushed it right up to 50.</v>

1061
00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's some side effects and</v>

1062
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:40.250
<v Speaker 1>there's some possible potential health</v>
<v Speaker 1>risks as far as like strokes and things</v>

1063
00:41:40.251 --> 00:41:41.330
<v Speaker 1>along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

1064
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Did anybody that was on the tour ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped dead from epo?</v>

1065
00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1066
00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:47.970
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

1067
00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:48.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1068
00:41:48.631 --> 00:41:50.820
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1069
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are a lot of documented</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases,</v>

1070
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.200
<v Speaker 1>especially in the 80s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1071
00:41:55.201 --> 00:41:58.080
<v Speaker 1>When hipo I guess was first hitting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>

1072
00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:03.680
<v Speaker 1>There was this wave of Dutch cyclists</v>
<v Speaker 1>that passed away in the night and you</v>

1073
00:42:03.691 --> 00:42:04.650
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the night,</v>

1074
00:42:04.651 --> 00:42:06.240
<v Speaker 1>huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In their sleep.</v>

1075
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:07.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably when it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1076
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1077
00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:09.551
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1078
00:42:09.551 --> 00:42:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1079
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do the autopsy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1080
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.310
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if anybody's ever proven</v>

1081
00:42:14.311 --> 00:42:14.820
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

1082
00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.010
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1083
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say that was the myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was,</v>

1084
00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Eco,</v>

1085
00:42:23.731 --> 00:42:25.560
<v Speaker 1>the drug took the blame for those</v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths.</v>

1086
00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.740
<v Speaker 1>And so it hasn't happened since and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen,</v>

1087
00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:30.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1088
00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our generation.</v>

1089
00:42:31.351 --> 00:42:33.450
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1090
00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:37.950
<v Speaker 1>But my point being that it can be fairly</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

1091
00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Well if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if your blood,</v>

1092
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:43.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine if it gets to the SEC.</v>

1093
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.890
<v Speaker 1>So at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would not be one of the things that</v>

1094
00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:49.830
<v Speaker 1>it didn't surprise me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1095
00:42:49.831 --> 00:42:51.210
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you came clean,</v>

1096
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:52.890
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well good for him.</v>

1097
00:42:52.891 --> 00:42:54.690
<v Speaker 1>That was really what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1098
00:42:54.691 --> 00:42:57.600
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of fucked up that he was lying</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this time and it's kind of fucked up</v>

1099
00:42:57.601 --> 00:43:02.040
<v Speaker 1>that he was suing people that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that he was telling lies and,</v>

1100
00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.610
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that shocked me</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>

1101
00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:06.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about it,</v>

1102
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:10.320
<v Speaker 1>was that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had recovered from cancer.</v>

1103
00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.080
<v Speaker 1>You had one of your testicles removed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had brain surgery,</v>

1104
00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:14.790
<v Speaker 1>lung cancer.</v>

1105
00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:18.780
<v Speaker 1>You mean your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body was ravaged by this and yet</v>

1106
00:43:18.781 --> 00:43:21.460
<v Speaker 1>you still were taking drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1107
00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.520
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what got me,</v>

1108
00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:27.570
<v Speaker 1>I was like that what a crazy desire to</v>
<v Speaker 1>win that you,</v>

1109
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.840
<v Speaker 1>you got to this place where your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1110
00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were on death's door and recover</v>

1111
00:43:34.291 --> 00:43:36.230
<v Speaker 1>from it and then put yourself back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrist.</v>

1112
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1113
00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1114
00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:41.570
<v Speaker 1>saying it like that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1115
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:44.970
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no justifying that other than</v>

1116
00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.910
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in this sport that,</v>

1117
00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.440
<v Speaker 1>that I really wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1118
00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:53.370
<v Speaker 1>to be in and stay in and after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease I wanted to go back to,</v>

1119
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:57.300
<v Speaker 1>and that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the landscape.</v>

1120
00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.560
<v Speaker 1>And so you viewed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you thought,</v>

1121
00:43:58.561 --> 00:44:01.560
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not ideal,</v>

1122
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:05.940
<v Speaker 1>but you asked the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I really,</v>

1123
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>

1124
00:44:07.021 --> 00:44:08.340
<v Speaker 1>knowing my health history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1125
00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:10.070
<v Speaker 1>with cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the,</v>

1126
00:44:10.071 --> 00:44:15.071
<v Speaker 1>all that I went through is going back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sport and taking epo a risk to that,</v>

1127
00:44:15.391 --> 00:44:16.400
<v Speaker 1>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1128
00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.780
<v Speaker 1>to my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my disease or to my health.</v>

1129
00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1130
00:44:20.671 --> 00:44:23.370
<v Speaker 1>and the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously my answer to myself was,</v>

1131
00:44:23.371 --> 00:44:25.650
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really didn't think that it was a</v>

1132
00:44:25.651 --> 00:44:27.990
<v Speaker 1>risk to push your body like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1133
00:44:27.991 --> 00:44:32.991
<v Speaker 1>and to put all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean stuff,</v>

1134
00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:37.170
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in a lot of ways,</v>

1135
00:44:37.171 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 1>they're pushing your body in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnatural way or to an unnatural level.</v>

1136
00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Testosterone and human growth hormone</v>
<v Speaker 1>epo and all these and that.</v>

1137
00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Sheila really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the only difference that that</v>

1138
00:44:50.011 --> 00:44:51.120
<v Speaker 1>was made was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1139
00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:56.121
<v Speaker 1>I had a slight experience with growth</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone before the disease and then</v>

1140
00:44:56.281 --> 00:44:58.530
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the diagnosis and the treatment</v>

1141
00:44:58.531 --> 00:45:00.030
<v Speaker 1>and recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1142
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:00.511
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1143
00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:02.370
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does not sound like a good idea.</v>

1144
00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:06.510
<v Speaker 1>It's too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps in my own fucked up way,</v>

1145
00:45:06.511 --> 00:45:07.111
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1146
00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:11.750
<v Speaker 1>that would lead to the growth of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to have most of,</v>

1147
00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a malignant cell,</v>

1148
00:45:13.201 --> 00:45:13.860
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

1149
00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.060
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1150
00:45:15.061 --> 00:45:17.850
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't view those two the simplest.</v>

1151
00:45:17.851 --> 00:45:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think hgh is for cycling.</v>

1152
00:45:20.221 --> 00:45:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's very effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

1153
00:45:21.481 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you alter your diet?</v>

1154
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1155
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what changes did you make when you,</v>

1156
00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:31.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you came back from having cancer?</v>

1157
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:31.913
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1158
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.440
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the stuff that we can talk</v>

1159
00:45:34.441 --> 00:45:36.720
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked about forever and you know,</v>

1160
00:45:36.721 --> 00:45:38.910
<v Speaker 1>and it's almost sort of mocked now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1161
00:45:38.911 --> 00:45:41.790
<v Speaker 1>cause we talked about the change in diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the increased,</v>

1162
00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensity of training and the</v>

1163
00:45:44.131 --> 00:45:46.440
<v Speaker 1>reconnaissance and the technology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wind tunnel.</v>

1164
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:49.140
<v Speaker 1>And we did all of those things and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>all worked,</v>

1165
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.470
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I say their mock now because people</v>

1166
00:45:52.471 --> 00:45:54.150
<v Speaker 1>now know the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know the truth.</v>

1167
00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:55.020
<v Speaker 1>And people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1168
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.780
<v Speaker 1>he told us it was all that other</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

1169
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:59.190
<v Speaker 1>He told us it was the training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told us it was his diet.</v>

1170
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Well now we know it was just the doping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1171
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:05.130
<v Speaker 1>well it wasn't though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the doping end.</v>

1172
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.440
<v Speaker 1>That was the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the final piece,</v>

1173
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.920
<v Speaker 1>which just was unfortunately isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it,</v>

1174
00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:11.790
<v Speaker 1>as we've said numerous times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just an,</v>

1175
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.310
<v Speaker 1>it was unfortunate and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitable.</v>

1176
00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was the final piece and the,</v>

1177
00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.350
<v Speaker 1>and it was also the piece that we never</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about.</v>

1178
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1179
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the weight you're carrying</v>

1180
00:46:22.861 --> 00:46:23.510
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1181
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm what I'm asking you about your die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally didn't know that you had</v>

1182
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:28.920
<v Speaker 1>discussed this ad nauseum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1183
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:30.570
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're carrying this around.</v>

1184
00:46:30.571 --> 00:46:34.980
<v Speaker 1>You're always assuming that if you look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at me racing in [inaudible] 96 before I</v>

1185
00:46:34.981 --> 00:46:37.450
<v Speaker 1>was diagnosed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you look at me winning the tour</v>

1186
00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.540
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 99,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed 20 pounds difference.</v>

1187
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:43.590
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went and I had this when I got out of,</v>

1188
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of my cancer mission,</v>

1189
00:46:47.281 --> 00:46:47.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1190
00:46:47.691 --> 00:46:49.350
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and recovered and took a year and a half</v>

1191
00:46:49.351 --> 00:46:51.660
<v Speaker 1>away and went back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I view,</v>

1192
00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I viewed racing bikes as life,</v>

1193
00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.830
<v Speaker 1>life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I viewed it,</v>

1194
00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I viewed my disease as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a competitive event,</v>

1195
00:46:58.681 --> 00:47:01.440
<v Speaker 1>as a sporting event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's me versus the opposition,</v>

1196
00:47:01.441 --> 00:47:02.940
<v Speaker 1>looking at the scoreboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we doing.</v>

1197
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:04.940
<v Speaker 1>And then when I got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1198
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.570
<v Speaker 1>when I got back on the bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1199
00:47:06.571 --> 00:47:08.310
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like life and death and so</v>

1200
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.670
<v Speaker 1>everything was intensified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starving yourself,</v>

1201
00:47:11.671 --> 00:47:14.310
<v Speaker 1>training your ass off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being,</v>

1202
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:18.120
<v Speaker 1>as you said a minute ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being generally fucking totally</v>

1203
00:47:18.121 --> 00:47:20.310
<v Speaker 1>crazy for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a result.</v>

1204
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not mad,</v>

1205
00:47:22.741 --> 00:47:25.020
<v Speaker 1>but madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were starving yourself to be</v>

1206
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:25.860
<v Speaker 1>lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1207

<v Speaker 2>six hours a day and not eating.</v>

1233
00:48:31.021 --> 00:48:35.280
<v Speaker 1>guy from 1999 like if I was winning in</v>

00:48:35.281 --> 00:48:36.720
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

1235
00:48:36.721 --> 00:48:40.170
<v Speaker 1>somebody from 1983 I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

1236
00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Don't ask me that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why are you asking me?</v>

1237
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Well some do 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here today.</v>

1238
00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's</v>

1239
00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:50.780
<v Speaker 2>well that's the craziest thing about you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the sport.</v>

1240
00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:55.670
<v Speaker 2>You are inexorably tied to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way to pull it away from you.</v>

1241
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Like that scandal was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in the United States,</v>

1242
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.330
<v Speaker 2>it was one of the biggest aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sport ever.</v>

1243
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:04.100
<v Speaker 2>It's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it any,</v>

1244
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:06.530
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any story that gets written.</v>

1245
00:49:06.531 --> 00:49:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't if you fall of track and field</v>

1246
00:49:08.631 --> 00:49:11.180
<v Speaker 2>or all of this stuff that came out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Johnson,</v>

1247
00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:13.720
<v Speaker 2>too old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

1248
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:17.540
<v Speaker 2>there was just this revelation that came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of international track and field and</v>

1249
00:49:17.541 --> 00:49:21.410
<v Speaker 2>the Russian Federation and the covers up</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and all of those stories that get</v>

1250
00:49:21.411 --> 00:49:23.870
<v Speaker 2>written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's on deadspin or the New York</v>

1251
00:49:23.871 --> 00:49:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Times or on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all reference the story as well,</v>

1252
00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.330
<v Speaker 2>so you get put back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1253
00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's a good or a bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1254
00:49:31.671 --> 00:49:32.790
<v Speaker 2>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1255
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:35.440
<v Speaker 2>it brings people back to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1256
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:36.283
<v Speaker 2>to my history.</v>

1257
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's baseball and Barry bonds</v>

1258
00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:40.670
<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are tied,</v>

1259
00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:43.370
<v Speaker 2>there's just no way they're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to separate the two of them</v>

1260
00:49:43.371 --> 00:49:44.204
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1261
00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.353
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1262
00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:49.700
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be a very bizarre thing for</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people that are racing.</v>

1263
00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's them.</v>

1264
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should,</v>

1265
00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:54.310
<v Speaker 2>don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to,</v>

1266
00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.030
<v Speaker 2>so he knows who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most fucked up thing about</v>

1267
00:49:57.031 --> 00:49:57.980
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're like,</v>

1268
00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:04.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean in a way like Tony Hawk is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>only skateboarder I have ever heard of.</v>

1269
00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:06.770
<v Speaker 2>It's the only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm sure I've met a few other</v>

1270
00:50:06.771 --> 00:50:07.370
<v Speaker 2>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

1271
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:08.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember their names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1272
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:11.210
<v Speaker 2>but Tony Hawk is that guy like you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>a skateboarding thing?</v>

1273
00:50:11.211 --> 00:50:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Could Tony Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think of bike racing?</v>

1274
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.790
<v Speaker 2>I think of Lance Armstrong and now that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think of swimming,</v>

1275
00:50:16.791 --> 00:50:18.110
<v Speaker 2>you think of Michael Phelps?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1276
00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:19.220
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1277
00:50:19.221 --> 00:50:20.170
<v Speaker 2>there's a few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1278
00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Greg Lamont is a diver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think of him,</v>

1279
00:50:22.041 --> 00:50:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's kind of a swimmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These buttons on this.</v>

1280
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg Gain Louganis sorry,</v>

1281
00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least you said cyclist.</v>

1282
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:34.490
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting better.</v>

1283
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Greg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg Lamont's probably like what the</v>

1284
00:50:38.811 --> 00:50:40.020
<v Speaker 2>fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1285
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:43.430
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird when you have a sport that's</v>

1286
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:47.720
<v Speaker 2>where the public locks onto one person</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't know any of the other</v>

1287
00:50:47.721 --> 00:50:49.160
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like if it's football,</v>

1288
00:50:49.161 --> 00:50:52.910
<v Speaker 2>there's like fucking hundreds of guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing hundreds of guys.</v>

1289
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:58.390
<v Speaker 2>But with cycling there's just so few and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you carrying the weight of that sport in</v>

1290
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:04.620
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to popularize it and as well as a</v>

1291
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.850
<v Speaker 2>holding onto this lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1292
00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.431
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1293
00:51:09.431 --> 00:51:10.264
<v Speaker 1>Dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1294
00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that when I hear you say that,</v>

1295
00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:14.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1296
00:51:14.561 --> 00:51:15.250
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1297
00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:18.190
<v Speaker 1>and you may not be defending me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sounds as if you're defending me.</v>

1298
00:51:18.191 --> 00:51:20.540
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily want,</v>

1299
00:51:20.541 --> 00:51:20.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1300
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:22.700
<v Speaker 2>That I'm not defending you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1301
00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:26.420
<v Speaker 2>What I'm doing and I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>aluminate reality in a pretty objective</v>

1302
00:51:26.421 --> 00:51:27.230
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1303
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:30.840
<v Speaker 2>you could do that on your next podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>because me sitting here right now each</v>

1304
00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:31.910
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1305
00:51:31.911 --> 00:51:33.560
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make me uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1306
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm of the belief that nobody wants to</v>

1307
00:51:36.361 --> 00:51:37.950
<v Speaker 1>hear that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there's still,</v>

1308
00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I think people are upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they're upset.</v>

1309
00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:42.053
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1310
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:43.730
<v Speaker 2>some people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1311
00:51:43.731 --> 00:51:44.270
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you get,</v>

1312
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.470
<v Speaker 2>you gotta have people that are upset?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1313
00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:48.500
<v Speaker 2>I think what we're dealing with when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to the Internet is just a gigantic</v>

1314
00:51:48.501 --> 00:51:50.960
<v Speaker 2>number of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too many people to like say,</v>

1315
00:51:50.961 --> 00:51:53.600
<v Speaker 2>some people aren't this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he can't,</v>

1316
00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:56.690
<v Speaker 2>he can't manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's hundreds of millions of people</v>

1317
00:51:56.691 --> 00:52:00.260
<v Speaker 2>who can get on their facebook or get on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the twitter and just start giving their</v>

1318
00:52:00.261 --> 00:52:02.570
<v Speaker 2>input right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's never happened before.</v>

1319
00:52:02.571 --> 00:52:06.560
<v Speaker 2>And when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be understandably</v>

1320
00:52:06.561 --> 00:52:08.210
<v Speaker 2>sensitive to the outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1321
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1322
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:13.220
<v Speaker 2>What was the blow back like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you,</v>

1323
00:52:13.221 --> 00:52:16.160
<v Speaker 2>when you did the oprah thing and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just went out into the public,</v>

1324
00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:18.410
<v Speaker 2>did you just try to lay low for awhile?</v>

1325
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to,</v>

1326
00:52:20.061 --> 00:52:20.894
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

1327
00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:26.560
<v Speaker 1>there was several variations of quote</v>
<v Speaker 1>unquote blowback or there was just the</v>

1328
00:52:26.991 --> 00:52:28.970
<v Speaker 1>public's perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I walked down the street,</v>

1329
00:52:28.971 --> 00:52:32.990
<v Speaker 1>which I have to admit was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was better than I expected.</v>

1330
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peep nobody.</v>

1331
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:37.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not as if I left talking with Oprah</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I walked out on the street and you</v>

1332
00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:39.230
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were throwing shit at me.</v>

1333
00:52:39.231 --> 00:52:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just,</v>

1334
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:42.020
<v Speaker 1>that's never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could happen one day,</v>

1335
00:52:42.021 --> 00:52:44.270
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the blow back,</v>

1336
00:52:44.271 --> 00:52:46.880
<v Speaker 1>which is the most important part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the way my kids were treated.</v>

1337
00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:48.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got five kids,</v>

1338
00:52:48.141 --> 00:52:50.180
<v Speaker 1>three older ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1339
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very concerned with what they</v>

1340
00:52:53.391 --> 00:52:54.750
<v Speaker 1>heard in the hallways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1341
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:57.050
<v Speaker 1>what they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they saw and their social media</v>

1342
00:52:57.051 --> 00:52:58.610
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1343
00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1344
00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:02.990
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that news due to them that is</v>

1345
00:53:02.991 --> 00:53:04.050
<v Speaker 1>the most important thing.</v>

1346
00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:09.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's a real credit to the city of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin and the schools that they go to</v>

1347
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:13.540
<v Speaker 1>our community and their friends and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids in the school very little blow</v>

1348
00:53:13.541 --> 00:53:14.331
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>

1349
00:53:14.331 --> 00:53:15.050
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

1350
00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:17.630
<v Speaker 1>that was like the biggest relief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people can throw shit at me and say</v>

1351
00:53:17.631 --> 00:53:21.410
<v Speaker 1>shit all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if my kids were treated roughly,</v>

1352
00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would just,</v>

1353
00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.210
<v Speaker 1>that would break your heart when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean devastating.</v>

1354
00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be the,</v>

1355
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:28.200
<v Speaker 1>by far the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>

1356
00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was very fortunate that,</v>

1357
00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:32.880
<v Speaker 1>that there was not seamless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1358
00:53:32.881 --> 00:53:36.390
<v Speaker 1>there was some stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they managed it and we managed it in</v>

1359
00:53:36.391 --> 00:53:37.620
<v Speaker 1>the community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>managed it pretty well.</v>

1360
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:40.410
<v Speaker 1>And then there was the legal blow back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

1361
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:42.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was pretty nasty.</v>

1362
00:53:42.181 --> 00:53:42.501
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1363
00:53:42.501 --> 00:53:46.440
<v Speaker 1>I got there as soon as I stepped off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage with Oprah,</v>

1364
00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:48.390
<v Speaker 1>call it a stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1365
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:51.600
<v Speaker 1>the lawsuit just piled up and piled up</v>
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>

1366
00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.660
<v Speaker 2>And how many of them are still ongoing</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now?</v>

1367
00:53:54.661 --> 00:53:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Just one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one.</v>

1368
00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:58.880
<v Speaker 2>One the federal government when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal case and the federal [inaudible]</v>

1369
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.240
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were,</v>

1370
00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:02.130
<v Speaker 1>and some of them were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

1371
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 1>were highly publicized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1372
00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:07.620
<v Speaker 1>and some were not some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem,</v>

1373
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:09.060
<v Speaker 1>the team was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1374
00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:12.630
<v Speaker 1>insuring all of my salaries and all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my bonuses unbeknownst to me.</v>

1375
00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:15.000
<v Speaker 1>And so because they didn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1376
00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.480
<v Speaker 1>And so when this goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these companies came back and</v>

1377
00:54:18.481 --> 00:54:19.314
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's our money?</v>

1378
00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:20.041
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1379
00:54:20.041 --> 00:54:21.060
<v Speaker 1>who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1380
00:54:21.061 --> 00:54:22.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're so the team,</v>

1381
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I knew about one situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1382
00:54:24.991 --> 00:54:26.220
<v Speaker 1>The big one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the SCA case,</v>

1383
00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:27.390
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1384
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.580
<v Speaker 1>which has been settled since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were many,</v>

1385
00:54:29.581 --> 00:54:31.710
<v Speaker 1>many others and some were public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some were private.</v>

1386
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they all had to get settled.</v>

1387
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:39.390
<v Speaker 1>And so we've navigated that landscape</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we're just down to the postal</v>

1388
00:54:39.391 --> 00:54:40.440
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the federal case.</v>

1389
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:43.290
<v Speaker 1>And when is that going to be resolved?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1390
00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:46.110
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been going on a long time.</v>

1391
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it came on the heels of a two or</v>

1392
00:54:50.761 --> 00:54:54.090
<v Speaker 1>three year criminal investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you're well aware of through</v>

1393
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:56.600
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Novitsky and through the US</v>

1394
00:54:56.610 --> 00:55:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Attorney's office here in Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once that case was closed,</v>

1395
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.390
<v Speaker 1>then the civil division picked up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>postal case.</v>

1396
00:55:03.391 --> 00:55:05.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's been ongoing for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1397
00:55:05.771 --> 00:55:06.170
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1398
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:09.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sort of finished that first phase of</v>

1399
00:55:09.021 --> 00:55:14.021
<v Speaker 2>litigation and that it'll go to trial</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a year from now in Washington DC.</v>

1400
00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:17.240
<v Speaker 2>We talked about this very briefly before</v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast.</v>

1401
00:55:17.241 --> 00:55:18.890
<v Speaker 2>We wanted to kind of save it for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

1402
00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand the criminal</v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation.</v>

1403
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:25.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand the allocation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources towards someone who was bike</v>

1404
00:55:25.011 --> 00:55:28.820
<v Speaker 2>racing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like in a world where we have</v>

1405
00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:32.930
<v Speaker 2>bankers that causes gigantic 2008</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial collapse,</v>

1406
00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:36.200
<v Speaker 2>we have pharmaceutical companies are</v>
<v Speaker 2>making billions of dollars.</v>

1407
00:55:36.201 --> 00:55:41.201
<v Speaker 2>Getting people hooked on Oxycontin is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we have crime and murder and all</v>

1408
00:55:41.331 --> 00:55:46.331
<v Speaker 2>the fucking problems we have in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture to spend taxpayers' dollars on</v>

1409
00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:50.840
<v Speaker 2>bike racing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy who may have cheated or definitely</v>

1410
00:55:50.841 --> 00:55:53.420
<v Speaker 2>cheated in a sport where everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheating.</v>

1411
00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems kind of fun.</v>

1412
00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

1413
00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:57.680
<v Speaker 1>it's mccarthyism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1414
00:55:57.681 --> 00:55:59.490
<v Speaker 1>you can have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1415
00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:01.580
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cyclists don't have any lobbyists.</v>

1416
00:56:01.581 --> 00:56:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's out protecting us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>W W W whatever we did or didn't do in</v>

1417
00:56:05.121 --> 00:56:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Europe 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the banks do,</v>

1418
00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:09.890
<v Speaker 1>big Pharma does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

1419
00:56:09.891 --> 00:56:13.550
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of a good old boys club</v>

1420
00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:14.750
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're not a part of.</v>

1421
00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:16.391
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1422
00:56:16.391 --> 00:56:18.260
<v Speaker 1>and we've talked about this offline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1423
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:20.840
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have a federal agent in a guy</v>

1424
00:56:20.841 --> 00:56:22.630
<v Speaker 1>like Novitsky whose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose,</v>

1425
00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:26.050
<v Speaker 1>he has made his career with these types</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cases,</v>

1426
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:28.210
<v Speaker 1>whether it's balco or bonds or Marion</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones,</v>

1427
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:30.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1428
00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:32.110
<v Speaker 1>when you have a guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1429
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:35.440
<v Speaker 1>that all of a sudden is interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna happen.</v>

1430
00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.130
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1431
00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.630
<v Speaker 1>and when you have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1432
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 1>particular agent or any agent that walks</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a interview,</v>

1433
00:56:43.931 --> 00:56:47.020
<v Speaker 1>a witness or interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old teammate with a badge and a gun,</v>

1434
00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:49.060
<v Speaker 1>they're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1435
00:56:49.061 --> 00:56:49.990
<v Speaker 1>it gets weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1436
00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't just kind of investigation.</v>

1437
00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so of course you,</v>

1438
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:56.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1439
00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I heard what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1440
00:56:57.431 --> 00:56:59.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it makes much sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

1441
00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I was at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the cross hairs.</v>

1442
00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:01.750
<v Speaker 1>So people are going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1443
00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 1>of course you don't think it makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

1444
00:57:02.861 --> 00:57:04.400
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1445
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:05.470
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1446
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:06.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1447
00:57:06.491 --> 00:57:09.790
<v Speaker 1>and I listened to your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your podcast with Novitsky and,</v>

1448
00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:11.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

1449
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:15.890
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1450
00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:19.570
<v Speaker 1>there's some bullshit in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what specifically,</v>

1451
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:22.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1452
00:57:22.931 --> 00:57:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1453
00:57:24.431 --> 00:57:25.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1454
00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:26.770
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1455
00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:29.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't work for the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't work for the US Attorney's</v>

1456
00:57:29.831 --> 00:57:31.840
<v Speaker 1>office here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the idea that he was brought</v>

1457
00:57:31.841 --> 00:57:36.841
<v Speaker 1>into the investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that that's necessarily</v>

1458
00:57:37.211 --> 00:57:39.010
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1459
00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:40.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1460
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:42.670
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Jeff,</v>

1461
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:45.850
<v Speaker 1>but I think he went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he looked for those cases.</v>

1462
00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:46.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1463
00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:48.310
<v Speaker 1>and whether or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

1464
00:57:48.550 --> 00:57:50.980
<v Speaker 1>when you're an agent for the food and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drug Administration,</v>

1465
00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1466
00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:55.090
<v Speaker 1>all of these things have missions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

1467
00:57:55.091 --> 00:57:56.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was an agent for the irs.</v>

1468
00:57:56.741 --> 00:57:58.570
<v Speaker 1>And so then that's when balco and bond</v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

1469
00:57:58.571 --> 00:57:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1470
00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:04.540
<v Speaker 1>the doping and baseball as an irs issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno that doping in cycling 20 years</v>

1471
00:58:04.541 --> 00:58:06.190
<v Speaker 1>ago is an issue for the FDA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1472
00:58:06.191 --> 00:58:10.120
<v Speaker 1>they regulate who makes aspirin and who</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you your lettuce and your eggs and</v>

1473
00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:14.080
<v Speaker 1>what does that have to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he,</v>

1474
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I think he was opportunistic when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>came to,</v>

1475
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:17.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these cases,</v>

1476
00:58:17.771 --> 00:58:20.710
<v Speaker 1>whether it's barry bonds or myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1477
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:21.681
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1478
00:58:21.681 --> 00:58:22.670
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1479
00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:24.070
<v Speaker 1>he thrived on that.</v>

1480
00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you look at it two ways in one</v>

1481
00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:30.230
<v Speaker 2>on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he certainly capitalizes on these high</v>

1482
00:58:30.231 --> 00:58:32.570
<v Speaker 2>profile cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He certainly goes after that.</v>

1483
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:37.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>him capitalizing and being the,</v>

1484
00:58:37.871 --> 00:58:41.690
<v Speaker 2>the rabbit investigator that he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it highlights the issues that are going</v>

1485
00:58:41.691 --> 00:58:42.380
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1486
00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:45.120
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the real problems,</v>

1487
00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:48.290
<v Speaker 2>the allocation of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how much money is being spent on</v>

1488
00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:49.520
<v Speaker 2>these cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1489
00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:53.870
<v Speaker 2>he told me that the barry bonds case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only spent like $100,000.</v>

1490
00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.270
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't expect that.</v>

1491
00:58:56.690 --> 00:59:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I didn't question them and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>research it beforehand.</v>

1492
00:59:00.321 --> 00:59:01.830
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that that was even going</v>

1493
00:59:01.831 --> 00:59:05.000
<v Speaker 2>to come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then once I did research it,</v>

1494
00:59:05.001 --> 00:59:08.510
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it was a a fuck load.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More money than $100,000.</v>

1495
00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:09.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

1496
00:59:09.291 --> 00:59:10.970
<v Speaker 1>that's obviously that's laughable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1497
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:14.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the number was,</v>

1498
00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:14.910
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1499
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:15.743
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1500
00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:17.390
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a hundred thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

1501
00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:19.790
<v Speaker 1>it was probably not as much as what was</v>
<v Speaker 1>reported.</v>

1502
00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1503
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.480
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

1504
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:27.260
<v Speaker 2>that's the United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they get to do.</v>

1505
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.530
<v Speaker 2>And also you get a guy like him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's how these issues get</v>

1506
00:59:30.531 --> 00:59:33.080
<v Speaker 2>highlighted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we know about it because</v>

1507
00:59:33.081 --> 00:59:37.790
<v Speaker 2>he was so aggressive in his tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was so aggressive and chasing down</v>

1508
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:40.010
<v Speaker 2>anybody that he thought was doing these</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

1509
00:59:40.011 --> 00:59:43.940
<v Speaker 2>That's why we know about these cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's such an extreme detail.</v>

1510
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1511
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.781
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

1512
00:59:47.781 --> 00:59:48.614
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1513
00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:49.690
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1514
00:59:49.690 --> 00:59:51.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't pleasant watching that are</v>

1515
00:59:51.891 --> 00:59:53.280
<v Speaker 2>listening to that podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1516
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:56.600
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're bullshitting me</v>

1517
00:59:56.601 --> 00:59:57.920
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he wanted to do the</v>

1518
00:59:57.921 --> 00:59:59.900
<v Speaker 2>podcast with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh he did?</v>

1519
01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He asked to do it.</v>

1520
01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of crazy is that?</v>

1521
01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he wanted to find out like how</v>

1522
01:00:07.731 --> 01:00:11.060
<v Speaker 2>do we felt about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it feels like now.</v>

1523
01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:12.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants to,</v>

1524
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it needs ongoing.</v>

1525
01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:16.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he works right now doing drug</v>

1526
01:00:16.221 --> 01:00:20.240
<v Speaker 2>investigations for the UFC and he's done</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fantastic job to the point where,</v>

1527
01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:23.810
<v Speaker 2>as I was telling you before the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen radical changes in fighters</v>

1528
01:00:23.811 --> 01:00:28.400
<v Speaker 2>physiques and their performances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys like guys who were world beaters</v>

1529
01:00:28.401 --> 01:00:33.401
<v Speaker 2>have dropped off substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the word in the mixed martial</v>

1530
01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:35.810
<v Speaker 2>arts community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I talked to fighters,</v>

1531
01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:38.600
<v Speaker 2>when I talked to trainers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's had a gigantic impact and they're</v>

1532
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:41.600
<v Speaker 2>terrified because they've imposed these</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strict,</v>

1533
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:45.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fines and a probationary periods.</v>

1534
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you also said before the podcast,</v>

1535
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:49.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a sport where,</v>

1536
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bigger and stronger your physically,</v>

1537
01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:54.590
<v Speaker 2>the more you're pummeling somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>else's head in.</v>

1538
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:56.240
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>

1539
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:57.120
<v Speaker 2>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1540
01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.600
<v Speaker 2>It's different than his stall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is definitely different.</v>

1541
01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:03.020
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much more important.</v>

1542
01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Is this sport just as exciting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty damn exciting.</v>

1543
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.430
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard to say if it's just as</v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting or not.</v>

1544
01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think there's a lot of great</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters who were world champions who</v>

1545
01:01:14.001 --> 01:01:16.010
<v Speaker 2>are clean cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>

1546
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.870
<v Speaker 2>it's like some of the all time greats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1547
01:01:17.871 --> 01:01:20.450
<v Speaker 2>there's great guys right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankie Edgar clean as a whistle.</v>

1548
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.100
<v Speaker 2>Chris Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very clean,</v>

1549
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.830
<v Speaker 2>rockhold clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the new champion in the</v>

1550
01:01:24.831 --> 01:01:26.810
<v Speaker 2>middleweight division.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of great fighters that are</v>

1551
01:01:26.811 --> 01:01:28.430
<v Speaker 2>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1552
01:01:28.431 --> 01:01:30.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to tell.</v>

1553
01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.450
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of fighters who weren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean,</v>

1554
01:01:32.451 --> 01:01:34.820
<v Speaker 2>who are fucking awesome when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't clean.</v>

1555
01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Vito Belfort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1556
01:01:36.441 --> 01:01:39.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went on this wild run for like a,</v>

1557
01:01:39.041 --> 01:01:43.850
<v Speaker 2>at 36 years old when he a w they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the apartments.</v>

1558
01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.870
<v Speaker 2>One of the big problems with the UFC was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had legal testosterone</v>

1559
01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:52.160
<v Speaker 2>replacement for a short period of time</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a few years and guys were just</v>

1560
01:01:52.161 --> 01:01:54.260
<v Speaker 2>fucking juice into the tits.</v>

1561
01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.550
<v Speaker 2>They didn't like it was skittles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1562
01:01:55.551 --> 01:01:58.880
<v Speaker 2>they would come back with these hyper</v>
<v Speaker 2>human level so that they would test them</v>

1563
01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:01.430
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a normal person in your</v>

1564
01:02:01.431 --> 01:02:05.060
<v Speaker 2>testosterone level would be like a low</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

1565
01:02:05.061 --> 01:02:06.680
<v Speaker 2>high eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>800.</v>

1566
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Vito was like 1,475 and he looked like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking silver back and just hyper</v>

1567
01:02:13.191 --> 01:02:14.750
<v Speaker 2>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super confident.</v>

1568
01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:15.950
<v Speaker 2>That's different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1569
01:02:15.951 --> 01:02:17.060
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's dangerous.</v>

1570
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:20.310
<v Speaker 2>And winning and beating guys to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1571
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.390
<v Speaker 2>to a pulp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1572
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:24.570
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a different situation.</v>

1573
01:02:24.571 --> 01:02:25.860
<v Speaker 2>It's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1574
01:02:25.861 --> 01:02:28.190
<v Speaker 2>you're not talking about an extreme</v>
<v Speaker 2>endurance sport like that.</v>

1575
01:02:28.191 --> 01:02:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Like that kind of aggression and</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosion wouldn't benefit you in</v>

1576
01:02:32.161 --> 01:02:34.890
<v Speaker 2>cycling because it's such a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>endurance race.</v>

1577
01:02:34.891 --> 01:02:38.880
<v Speaker 2>And also the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the benefit isn't the end result is in</v>

1578
01:02:38.881 --> 01:02:42.510
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's health doesn't get compromised</v>

1579
01:02:42.511 --> 01:02:43.344
<v Speaker 2>by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1580
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:44.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1581
01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:45.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean that's,</v>

1582
01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that sport that well and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what people's feelings</v>

1583
01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:51.920
<v Speaker 1>are in and amongst the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1584
01:02:51.921 --> 01:02:53.570
<v Speaker 1>you just give a pretty good perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

1585
01:02:53.571 --> 01:02:54.404
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1586
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:55.970
<v Speaker 1>more power to him there.</v>

1587
01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:59.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's messy to pull it out.</v>

1588
01:02:59.350 --> 01:03:04.350
<v Speaker 2>It's messy because it was so pervasive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if they had figured out it's</v>

1589
01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.030
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the tour,</v>

1590
01:03:07.031 --> 01:03:10.090
<v Speaker 2>if half the guys were clean and half the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys were dirty,</v>

1591
01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:14.680
<v Speaker 2>the Tour de France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they figured out how to pull</v>

1592
01:03:14.681 --> 01:03:17.440
<v Speaker 2>the drugs out from half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be messy.</v>

1593
01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.670
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because then it'd be like,</v>

1594
01:03:18.671 --> 01:03:19.401
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why?</v>

1595
01:03:19.401 --> 01:03:21.790
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why were these guys doing so well and</v>

1596
01:03:21.791 --> 01:03:23.950
<v Speaker 2>now they're not the guys who are winning</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not winning,</v>

1597
01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:28.030
<v Speaker 2>but if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tour seems like it's so pervasive</v>

1598
01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.910
<v Speaker 2>that if they pull the drugs out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same guys would be winning the</v>

1599
01:03:30.911 --> 01:03:31.830
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be slower</v>

1600
01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what happened?</v>

1601
01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>What happened was primarily I guess the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude Novitsky his investigation,</v>

1602
01:03:38.861 --> 01:03:43.861
<v Speaker 1>which which when was closed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he more or less handed everything to you</v>

1603
01:03:43.971 --> 01:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw the picked up the investigation</v>

1604
01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.690
<v Speaker 1>and then they acted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave me the lifetime ban that left,</v>

1605
01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:55.030
<v Speaker 1>like when the world reads that in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the summer of 2012 the world</v>

1606
01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>reads that the impression is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when I do oprah,</v>

1607
01:03:58.421 --> 01:04:00.400
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has three or four months later,</v>

1608
01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:04.390
<v Speaker 1>the impression is that we were hanging a</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood bag six months ago.</v>

1609
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a current event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels,</v>

1610
01:04:06.941 --> 01:04:11.941
<v Speaker 1>although it had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had been seven years before any line</v>

1611
01:04:12.131 --> 01:04:14.800
<v Speaker 1>had ever been crossed ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even during the compact.</v>

1612
01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it made it current.</v>

1613
01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>The comeback made it current for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Novitsky investigating,</v>

1614
01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting everybody to speak through his</v>

1615
01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>own tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1616
01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>it made it a current event when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it really,</v>

1617
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>it really wasn't.</v>

1618
01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1619
01:04:31.121 --> 01:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember sitting there in 2012</v>

1620
01:04:33.191 --> 01:04:35.590
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the shit's going down.</v>

1621
01:04:35.591 --> 01:04:37.600
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is unbelievable.</v>

1622
01:04:38.110 --> 01:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Being in the middle of it being me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is unreal.</v>

1623
01:04:40.391 --> 01:04:42.580
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1624
01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:45.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're talking about 1999 through</v>

1625
01:04:45.191 --> 01:04:46.850
<v Speaker 1>2005,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's use 99 as,</v>

1626
01:04:46.851 --> 01:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking to myself,</v>

1627
01:04:49.661 --> 01:04:52.140
<v Speaker 1>who won the superbowl in [inaudible] 99</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was the,</v>

1628
01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:55.480
<v Speaker 1>the broncos and elway was the MVP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking to myself,</v>

1629
01:04:55.481 --> 01:05:00.481
<v Speaker 1>what if I open the paper today and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>NFL is opened a case against John La in</v>

1630
01:05:00.911 --> 01:05:03.280
<v Speaker 1>2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have read that and gone,</v>

1631
01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:04.570
<v Speaker 1>this is a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1632
01:05:04.571 --> 01:05:05.410
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>April fools.</v>

1633
01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't like an old guy who stands on</v>

1634
01:05:07.881 --> 01:05:09.200
<v Speaker 1>the sideline now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1635
01:05:09.970 --> 01:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>so it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were able to go way,</v>

1636
01:05:12.881 --> 01:05:14.300
<v Speaker 1>way back and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1637
01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:19.310
<v Speaker 1>and sidestep and ignore any sort of due</v>
<v Speaker 1>process and statute of limitations and</v>

1638
01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>they made it a current event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1639
01:05:22.211 --> 01:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not blaming them or defending</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

1640
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1641
01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1642
01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not totally accurate,</v>

1643
01:05:31.151 --> 01:05:31.460
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1644
01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:34.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because it was so long.</v>

1645
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:38.090
<v Speaker 2>It went on for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you remember they had that Nike</v>

1646
01:05:38.091 --> 01:05:41.600
<v Speaker 2>commercial when that Nike Commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were doing it live strong Nike,</v>

1647
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Nike commercial and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're riding your bike and you're</v>

1648
01:05:44.571 --> 01:05:46.290
<v Speaker 2>talking about people calling you a</v>
<v Speaker 2>doper.</v>

1649
01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:49.410
<v Speaker 2>This is before you had come clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was in 2000 yeah.</v>

1650
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:50.810
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is before,</v>

1651
01:05:50.811 --> 01:05:53.180
<v Speaker 2>you'd never failed any tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was not,</v>

1652
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:56.480
<v Speaker 2>but you still had to address it in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Nike commercial.</v>

1653
01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was,</v>

1654
01:05:57.711 --> 01:05:59.990
<v Speaker 2>this was something that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was ill advised.</v>

1655
01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:01.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems,</v>

1656
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:04.490
<v Speaker 2>but that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of this,</v>

1657
01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.280
<v Speaker 2>whether it's</v>

1658
01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.750
<v Speaker 1>agreeing to that commercial or the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>you treated,</v>

1659
01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>I needed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1660
01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.420
<v Speaker 1>somebody in my life to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1661
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:17.220
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read this script or this</v>

1662
01:06:17.221 --> 01:06:19.290
<v Speaker 1>storyboard and I think that's a real bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

1663
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:21.750
<v Speaker 1>But did you have anybody like that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life?</v>

1664
01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly not,</v>

1665
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:25.140
<v Speaker 1>but did anybody suggest it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1666
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.490
<v Speaker 1>No one but no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1667
01:06:26.491 --> 01:06:27.420
<v Speaker 1>but I was,</v>

1668
01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.220
<v Speaker 2>but isn't that hard though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're such a fucking winner.</v>

1669
01:06:30.221 --> 01:06:31.870
<v Speaker 2>You're lucky you're on top of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1670
01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

1671
01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:33.880
<v Speaker 2>don't do that</v>

1672
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.280
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you're,</v>

1673
01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:39.370
<v Speaker 1>when you're in that position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>

1674
01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:40.810
<v Speaker 1>everybody's saying yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1675
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:41.501
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1676
01:06:41.501 --> 01:06:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great idea.</v>

1677
01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lance.</v>

1678
01:06:43.721 --> 01:06:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1679
01:06:44.951 --> 01:06:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1680
01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:48.640
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then nobody's sitting there playing the</v>

1681
01:06:48.641 --> 01:06:50.830
<v Speaker 1>devil's advocate or saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a bad idea.</v>

1682
01:06:50.831 --> 01:06:53.580
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have that north star man and,</v>

1683
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:54.400
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1684
01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.530
<v Speaker 1>the fucking buck stops with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1685
01:06:57.330 --> 01:07:00.300
<v Speaker 1>I should have been mature enough and</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldly enough to go</v>

1686
01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.790
<v Speaker 2>bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's make another commercial are bad</v>

1687
01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:04.451
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lance.</v>

1688
01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:06.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's say something else in the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>press conference.</v>

1689
01:07:06.311 --> 01:07:09.070
<v Speaker 2>But it seems like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weight of it all in the air of it</v>

1690
01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:13.660
<v Speaker 2>all was so thick that you kind of had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>address it all the time because it was</v>

1691
01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:15.910
<v Speaker 2>being thrown at you all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1692
01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:20.740
<v Speaker 2>I peripherally watched cycling</v>
<v Speaker 2>peripherally and I knew about it.</v>

1693
01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knew about it right on</v>

1694
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:22.700
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1695
01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:27.230
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more defensive I became and the</v>

1696
01:07:27.231 --> 01:07:30.380
<v Speaker 1>more aggressive I became in the denials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that does,</v>

1697
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:32.270
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what it might a piece.</v>

1698
01:07:32.271 --> 01:07:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Some people are support is good lad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

1699
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.850
<v Speaker 1>I heard it in his voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>

1700
01:07:37.851 --> 01:07:41.300
<v Speaker 1>But what it really did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with the press was it just,</v>

1701
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:46.400
<v Speaker 1>it just made the next occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next question,</v>

1702
01:07:46.401 --> 01:07:49.670
<v Speaker 1>the next episode even more inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it just,</v>

1703
01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:53.060
<v Speaker 1>it added fuel to that fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

1704
01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.580
<v Speaker 1>looking back in hindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should've just said like,</v>

1705
01:07:55.581 --> 01:07:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going not gonna talk about it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the answer was.</v>

1706
01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.070
<v Speaker 1>But instead of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1707
01:08:01.071 --> 01:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>it was literally like finger in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>chest,</v>

1708
01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:08.810
<v Speaker 1>fuck you don't ask me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is when you're guilty.</v>

1709
01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:13.960
<v Speaker 1>That's a real bad approach and it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that I took and quite honestly it's,</v>

1710
01:08:16.311 --> 01:08:18.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the main reasons that,</v>

1711
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>that we're sitting here today talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

1712
01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think you took that approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>when looking back on it?</v>

1713
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that is the approach that I took</v>

1714
01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.270
<v Speaker 1>and training and in racing and even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are guys that I raced</v>

1715
01:08:32.271 --> 01:08:34.670
<v Speaker 1>against that I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would make up reasons to fucking</v>

1716
01:08:34.671 --> 01:08:36.380
<v Speaker 1>hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd read something and be like,</v>

1717
01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:39.230
<v Speaker 1>look at this asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you read what he's,</v>

1718
01:08:39.231 --> 01:08:40.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean he probably didn't even say</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1719
01:08:40.641 --> 01:08:42.170
<v Speaker 1>I'd take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

1720
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe he said just as fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just his motivation.</v>

1721
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:48.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's all fine and good when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>training and your racing.</v>

1722
01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:52.250
<v Speaker 1>And you're competing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you step off the bike that you</v>

1723
01:08:52.251 --> 01:08:53.720
<v Speaker 1>have to have that switch to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1724
01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:55.570
<v Speaker 1>that's been done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won the written,</v>

1725
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:57.440
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to go treat another</v>

1726
01:08:57.441 --> 01:08:58.760
<v Speaker 1>human being that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1727
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.863
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just uh,</v>

1728
01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.690
<v Speaker 1>in a professional context or in a press</v>
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

1729
01:09:03.230 --> 01:09:04.580
<v Speaker 1>you gotta turn it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1730
01:09:04.581 --> 01:09:06.380
<v Speaker 1>And I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was,</v>

1731
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I had my finger in people's chest on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bike,</v>

1732
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:11.750
<v Speaker 1>off the bike everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

1733
01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:14.270
<v Speaker 1>my bad dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1734
01:09:14.271 --> 01:09:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have the,</v>

1735
01:09:15.861 --> 01:09:18.410
<v Speaker 1>the ability to turn that off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1736
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:21.740
<v Speaker 1>it's good to be a competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not good to be too competitive.</v>

1737
01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:24.980
<v Speaker 2>And once you start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you took that approach,</v>

1738
01:09:24.981 --> 01:09:27.890
<v Speaker 2>once you started with that approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you feel like there was like a</v>

1739
01:09:27.891 --> 01:09:32.390
<v Speaker 2>weight of momentum behind you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like to dig your heels in and stop it</v>

1740
01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:35.570
<v Speaker 2>and try a new approach would be very</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>

1741
01:09:35.610 --> 01:09:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1742
01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:37.830
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once it gets rolling,</v>

1743
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:40.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough to ducted.</v>

1744
01:09:41.190 --> 01:09:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Halter,</v>

1745
01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:44.680
<v Speaker 2>what was it like with the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were close to?</v>

1746
01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Obviously the people that you trained</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1747
01:09:46.631 --> 01:09:49.690
<v Speaker 2>they knew what you were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what about your family and your</v>

1748
01:09:49.691 --> 01:09:52.060
<v Speaker 2>close friends?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of them were aware of what was</v>

1749
01:09:52.061 --> 01:09:52.730
<v Speaker 2>going on?</v>

1750
01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:56.420
<v Speaker 1>I think by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1751
01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have asked him and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have asked me.</v>

1752
01:09:58.731 --> 01:10:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it was sort of this to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Don't ask.</v>

1756
01:10:05.091 --> 01:10:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1757

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

1758
01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.520
<v Speaker 1>You know they probably didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to know.</v>

1759
01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Do you have close friends outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cycling?</v>

1760
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they didn't ask you?</v>

1761
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well no they didn't,</v>

1762
01:10:17.241 --> 01:10:19.640

<v Speaker 1>I mean they might also ride bikes so</v>

1763
01:10:19.641 --> 01:10:21.000
<v Speaker 1>they're not in the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1764
01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:24.500
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody sat at the bar.</v>

1765

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:30.710
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy.</v>

1769
01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:32.150
<v Speaker 2>If I was your friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1770
01:10:32.151 --> 01:10:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I would've got you fucked up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1775
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:40.640
<v Speaker 2>I would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that time I got him all</v>

1776
01:10:40.641 --> 01:10:44.510
<v Speaker 2>fucked up and he admitted it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would've never said a word until you</v>

1777
01:10:44.511 --> 01:10:46.340
<v Speaker 2>came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once he came out,</v>

1778
01:10:46.341 --> 01:10:49.490
<v Speaker 2>then I woulda told until the guy with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the badge and the gun showed up and then</v>

1779
01:10:49.491 --> 01:10:52.540
<v Speaker 2>you would have said everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have ducked Jeff Novitsky.</v>

1780
01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1781
01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:55.200
<v Speaker 2>I would have hired some lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

1782
01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:57.020
<v Speaker 2>You got to sit with me when this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What do you want to know?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Don't sweat.</v>

1802
01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:30.631
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go take it.</v>

01:11:30.631 --> 01:11:31.590
<v Speaker 2>Go take a leak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please do.</v>

1804
01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:33.750
<v Speaker 2>Just one thing about athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they drink.</v>

1805
01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Fuck loads of water lenses here</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounding.</v>

1806
01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:39.600
<v Speaker 2>He's hung over to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a very specific schedule.</v>

1807
01:11:39.601 --> 01:11:42.000
<v Speaker 2>He told me he drinks two cups of coffee</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning.</v>

1808
01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:45.840
<v Speaker 2>Then it takes a shit and he drinks water</v>
<v Speaker 2>all day and then he waits until about</v>

1809
01:11:45.841 --> 01:11:47.070
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about five.</v>

1810
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.943
<v Speaker 2>Then he started drinking.</v>

1811
01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.640
<v Speaker 2>That's a good drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to ask him about marijuana</v>

1812
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:57.600
<v Speaker 2>cause if he smoked marijuana and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>holding in all those lies,</v>

1813
01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:01.200
<v Speaker 2>that shit would fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll smoke some weed and uh,</v>

1814
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.490
<v Speaker 2>I'll think about a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told them highschool,</v>

1815
01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't fuck with me</v>
<v Speaker 2>really well.</v>

1816
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll think about some shit that I did in</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school and make me go,</v>

1817
01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:12.450
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck did I say that?</v>

1818
01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Like it net.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the one of the crazy things about</v>

1819
01:12:16.141 --> 01:12:19.990
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and never lets you forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll bring those things up to you</v>

1820
01:12:19.991 --> 01:12:21.630
<v Speaker 2>trying to hide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But alcohol.</v>

1821
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:23.490
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1822
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:26.850
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buzzy alcohol is the best drug.</v>

1823
01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.780
<v Speaker 2>If you're trying to hold back a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just throw that down.</v>

1824
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:33.240
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you can't walk straight,</v>

1825
01:12:33.241 --> 01:12:35.100
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you're,</v>

1826
01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:35.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1827
01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.760
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about the song was</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing,</v>

1828
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:41.160
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about your whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about other things.</v>

1829
01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.910
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good close your focus drug.</v>

1830
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Whereas pot is the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pot is a open your focus.</v>

1831
01:12:49.730 --> 01:12:52.020
<v Speaker 2>This is fascinating though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a Jamie forget you have a secret.</v>

1832
01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You forget.</v>

1833
01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:54.780
<v Speaker 2>You don't give a fuck about your</v>
<v Speaker 2>secrets.</v>

1834
01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:57.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why people make horrible sexual</v>

1835
01:12:57.631 --> 01:13:00.150
<v Speaker 2>decisions when they're drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1836
01:13:00.151 --> 01:13:02.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also why people think that people</v>

1837
01:13:02.401 --> 01:13:04.950
<v Speaker 2>that are drunk shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't have sex with someone</v>

1838
01:13:04.951 --> 01:13:06.570
<v Speaker 2>who's drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're drunk.</v>

1839
01:13:06.571 --> 01:13:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why they're the crazy feminist</v>

1840
01:13:08.701 --> 01:13:11.820
<v Speaker 2>tried to say that that's rape and ended</v>
<v Speaker 2>up man and woman have sex in there</v>

1841
01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:13.610
<v Speaker 2>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's rape while they say it.</v>

1842
01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Because you're obviously not exactly of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sound.</v>

1843
01:13:16.951 --> 01:13:19.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean it depends on how drunk you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1844
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.430
<v Speaker 2>But at a certain level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're certainly impaired and you can't</v>

1845
01:13:23.431 --> 01:13:25.960
<v Speaker 2>make good decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1846
01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.820
<v Speaker 2>it's funny though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a guy who was just such a,</v>

1847
01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.430
<v Speaker 2>an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifelong athlete,</v>

1848
01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.560
<v Speaker 2>fucking pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>UCC like that.</v>

1849
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:36.450
<v Speaker 2>And ask him how long does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about marijuana and</v>

1850
01:13:36.451 --> 01:13:37.320
<v Speaker 2>whether or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1851
01:13:37.321 --> 01:13:41.490
<v Speaker 2>you used marijuana while you were a</v>
<v Speaker 2>holding back all those lies and how it</v>

1852
01:13:41.491 --> 01:13:42.890
<v Speaker 2>would fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when I was,</v>

1853
01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.230
<v Speaker 2>I'll think I'll get high and I'll think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about some shit I lied about in high</v>

1854
01:13:46.231 --> 01:13:48.070
<v Speaker 2>school and it will go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1855
01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:54.210
<v Speaker 2>paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it'll illuminate areas of your life</v>

1856
01:13:54.211 --> 01:13:55.460
<v Speaker 2>that you're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1857
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:56.940
<v Speaker 2>avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1858
01:13:57.510 --> 01:14:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The economy of all this is a fascinating</v>

1859
01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:06.380
<v Speaker 2>aspect of it because there were a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that were making money off of you</v>

1860
01:14:08.971 --> 01:14:12.880
<v Speaker 2>racing a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a gigantic industry.</v>

1861
01:14:13.090 --> 01:14:18.090
<v Speaker 2>And for them to pretend that they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what I knew as a fucking comedian</v>

1862
01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.820
<v Speaker 2>who w again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peripherally watch cycling,</v>

1863
01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:23.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd watch you win and I be like,</v>

1864
01:14:23.981 --> 01:14:25.330
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that motherfucker want again.</v>

1865
01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1866
01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:27.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1867
01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never raced raced bikes.</v>

1868
01:14:30.131 --> 01:14:33.460
<v Speaker 2>I never rode bikes is so for me and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew,</v>

1869
01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:34.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1870
01:14:34.601 --> 01:14:37.240
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck does the US post office not</v>
<v Speaker 2>know?</v>

1871
01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:40.510
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck does Nike not know how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck does they know?</v>

1872
01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:41.590
<v Speaker 2>They know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know.</v>

1873
01:14:41.591 --> 01:14:44.320
<v Speaker 2>They can pretend they don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they know if they didn't,</v>

1874
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:49.210
<v Speaker 2>if they didn't know then they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>irresponsible.</v>

1875
01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:53.800
<v Speaker 2>It's irresponsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they kind of knew and they just</v>

1876
01:14:53.801 --> 01:14:54.640
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all right.</v>

1877
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:56.980
<v Speaker 2>We're getting away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are getting away with it.</v>

1878
01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.520
<v Speaker 2>But then once the shit came down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they all wanted their money back.</v>

1879
01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:01.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1880
01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:01.853
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

1881
01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.950
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't talk too much about this,</v>

1882
01:15:06.951 --> 01:15:07.471
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>

1883
01:15:07.471 --> 01:15:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't get sensitive for the post</v>

1884
01:15:09.501 --> 01:15:10.550
<v Speaker 2>office one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tricky.</v>

1885
01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Definitely toughest one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you can't talk about it,</v>

1886
01:15:13.191 --> 01:15:18.191
<v Speaker 2>but can you talk about this is this is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality when you are accused of</v>

1887
01:15:18.411 --> 01:15:22.550
<v Speaker 2>defrauding the federal government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what they're saying because you</v>

1888
01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:27.551
<v Speaker 2>were riding for the US post office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the team and you won x amount</v>

1889
01:15:28.251 --> 01:15:29.950
<v Speaker 2>of money during that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1890
01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:33.350
<v Speaker 2>they can sue you for three times that</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

1891
01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1892
01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:40.060
<v Speaker 2>So they want a hundred million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1893
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:44.150
<v Speaker 2>A lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that going?</v>

1894
01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.780
<v Speaker 1>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1895
01:15:46.781 --> 01:15:48.910
<v Speaker 1>honestly it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1896
01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:51.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the only active case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that one does get a little trickier</v>

1897
01:15:51.671 --> 01:15:53.430
<v Speaker 1>to talk about just from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1898
01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:56.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be crushed by my</v>

1899
01:15:56.141 --> 01:15:58.960
<v Speaker 1>lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we like our case.</v>

1900
01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.390
<v Speaker 1>W W we think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1901
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:03.640
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're confident in the case.</v>

1902
01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:08.080
<v Speaker 1>We believe that the postal service a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while none of this story is,</v>

1903
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:09.040
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1904
01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:11.650
<v Speaker 1>is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1905
01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.620
<v Speaker 1>we believe that the postal service and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1906
01:16:13.621 --> 01:16:16.750
<v Speaker 1>and their own numbers support it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Postal Service Commission</v>

1907
01:16:16.751 --> 01:16:20.230
<v Speaker 1>three separate studies to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to analyze the effect of the sponsorship</v>

1908
01:16:20.231 --> 01:16:21.650
<v Speaker 1>on the team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1909
01:16:21.730 --> 01:16:24.600
<v Speaker 1>we believe they made hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars and,</v>

1910
01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:28.600
<v Speaker 1>and we know that they were also using</v>
<v Speaker 1>the team as a sales vehicle.</v>

1911
01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:33.490
<v Speaker 1>So coming to the two during the tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing over potential new clients,</v>

1912
01:16:33.491 --> 01:16:37.030
<v Speaker 1>bringing over new clients there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually converting their business to</v>

1913
01:16:37.031 --> 01:16:39.370
<v Speaker 1>the postal service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that happened and we know that</v>

1914
01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.580
<v Speaker 1>equaled a significant increase in</v>
<v Speaker 1>revenue.</v>

1915
01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:46.900
<v Speaker 1>So we like our case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1916
01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:47.431
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1917
01:16:47.431 --> 01:16:49.570
<v Speaker 1>and at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1918
01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:51.880
<v Speaker 1>what I like to have all legal issues out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my life.</v>

1919
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But settlements not an option.</v>

1920
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:59.380
<v Speaker 1>And so we have to just fall back on what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think is the strength of the case.</v>

1921
01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they made a ton of money while you</v>

1922
01:17:03.821 --> 01:17:08.470
<v Speaker 2>were being dishonest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that exonerate you from owing the</v>

1923
01:17:08.471 --> 01:17:09.710
<v Speaker 2>money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how does that work?</v>

1924
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a lawyer,</v>

1925
01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My view of,</v>

1926
01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:15.500
<v Speaker 1>of of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called a key tm case,</v>

1927
01:17:15.501 --> 01:17:17.960
<v Speaker 1>which is a false claims case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My view is,</v>

1928
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.940
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think is one that,</v>

1929
01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.480
<v Speaker 1>that our side shares is it's about</v>
<v Speaker 1>damages,</v>

1930
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was the postal service damaged and</v>

1931
01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:31.370
<v Speaker 1>what can we prove to be the damages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1932
01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there are no damages,</v>

1933
01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:38.210
<v Speaker 1>then I would like to think then there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was no case.</v>

1934
01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:41.330
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is.</v>

1935
01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:44.780
<v Speaker 1>The federal government is interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Department of Justice is interested</v>

1936
01:17:44.781 --> 01:17:46.520
<v Speaker 1>in the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1937
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:48.350
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have no choice but to fight it.</v>

1938
01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.491
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1939
01:17:49.491 --> 01:17:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the,</v>

1940
01:17:51.861 --> 01:17:53.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dozen previous lawsuits,</v>

1941
01:17:53.721 --> 01:17:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in a position to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really cut any more checks.</v>

1942
01:17:56.841 --> 01:17:59.660
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm in a position where I have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1943
01:17:59.950 --> 01:18:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I have to go fight this one out.</v>

1944
01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:06.260
<v Speaker 1>How do you get by financially now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1945
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:09.450
<v Speaker 1>well the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that,</v>

1946
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:11.150
<v Speaker 1>that I did was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1947
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:13.670
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I saw this coming into this,</v>

1948
01:18:13.671 --> 01:18:15.290
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen is your life was</v>
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>

1949
01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a three houses.</v>

1950
01:18:16.281 --> 01:18:17.390
<v Speaker 1>We had a jet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we had the whole,</v>

1951
01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:19.880
<v Speaker 1>so you just take that burn rate way</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1952
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:21.910
<v Speaker 1>So you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1953
01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:24.540
<v Speaker 1>your overhead goes way down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1954
01:18:24.541 --> 01:18:25.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crazy thing is,</v>

1955
01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:28.160
<v Speaker 1>is if you'd have told me before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1956
01:18:28.161 --> 01:18:30.710
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go sell a bunch of shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so your plane,</v>

1957
01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:31.581
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1958
01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:35.280
<v Speaker 1>that is life is going to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that a plane?</v>

1959
01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:37.281
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1960
01:18:37.281 --> 01:18:39.440
<v Speaker 1>the house and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1961
01:18:39.441 --> 01:18:40.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bragging,</v>

1962
01:18:40.701 --> 01:18:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you what really</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1963
01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.260
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would've thought,</v>

1964
01:18:45.261 --> 01:18:46.094
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this life is,</v>

1965
01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.150
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be terrible.</v>

1966
01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:50.870
<v Speaker 1>As you take it down and you live a</v>
<v Speaker 1>simpler life and you get your burn rate</v>

1967
01:18:50.871 --> 01:18:54.530
<v Speaker 1>down and you get it manageable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life's exactly the same.</v>

1968
01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the happiness factor is exactly</v>

1969
01:19:00.351 --> 01:19:02.990
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that shit he's on that they've</v>

1970
01:19:02.991 --> 01:19:05.300
<v Speaker 1>done studies on the none of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more convenient.</v>

1971
01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously getting going direct somewhere</v>

1972
01:19:07.551 --> 01:19:10.690
<v Speaker 1>and not dealing with a terminal and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1973
01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:13.490
<v Speaker 1>fucking Tsa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's different but it takes</v>

1974
01:19:13.491 --> 01:19:14.930
<v Speaker 1>some more time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1975
01:19:15.010 --> 01:19:19.040
<v Speaker 1>around more people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just as happy as I was.</v>

1976
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Heel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done studies on people that</v>

1977
01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:24.260
<v Speaker 1>actually complicate their lives with</v>
<v Speaker 1>more success,</v>

1978
01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:27.080
<v Speaker 1>more houses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more things in it actually makes you</v>

1979
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:29.220
<v Speaker 1>more tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you more to think about.</v>

1980
01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Well you got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1981
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:32.480

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1982
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:37.100
<v Speaker 1>you have to feed that beast and so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a little bit of the dog Jason,</v>

1983
01:19:37.101 --> 01:19:40.130
<v Speaker 1>the tail going on and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1984
01:19:40.131 --> 01:19:42.860
<v Speaker 1>life life was moving real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real fast for me then.</v>

1985
01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.540
<v Speaker 1>And it moves a lot slower now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1986
01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:46.453
<v Speaker 1>which I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1987
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be a little slow for my taste</v>

1988
01:19:48.531 --> 01:19:49.400
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

1989
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:54.500
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it when it was that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you cut back on all the expenses and</v>

1990
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:56.600
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do earn money now?</v>

1991

<v Speaker 1>Like what do you do to earn money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1992
01:19:58.251 --> 01:19:59.031
<v Speaker 1>occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll,</v>

1993
01:19:59.031 --> 01:19:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

1994

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1995
01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:04.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm paid to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1996
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.980
<v Speaker 1>and then they're just other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other appearances.</v>

1997
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:09.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still have some investments that,</v>

1998
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:10.870

<v Speaker 1>and who knows what the future holds.</v>

2001
01:20:18.121 --> 01:20:20.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if that stuff dries up forever or</v>

2002
01:20:20.911 --> 01:20:22.740
<v Speaker 1>comes back or who knows?</v>

2003
01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:26.620
<v Speaker 2>What does it like to sit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While this was all going on and watching</v>

2004
01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:31.570
<v Speaker 2>the economy of this story grow and</v>
<v Speaker 2>develop because it's not,</v>

2005

<v Speaker 2>it wasn't just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lawsuits.</v>

01:20:43.361 --> 01:20:45.190
<v Speaker 2>is all these people that are dedicating</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this time,</v>

2010
01:20:45.191 --> 01:20:48.820
<v Speaker 2>like their careers become a big part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their careers,</v>

2011
01:20:48.821 --> 01:20:51.160
<v Speaker 2>become telling the Lance Armstrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

2012
01:20:51.190 --> 01:20:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2013
01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:51.861
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2014
01:20:51.861 --> 01:20:53.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a small industry.</v>

2015
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2016
01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was the industries that benefited</v>

2017
01:20:57.310 --> 01:20:59.320
<v Speaker 1>on the way up and I was one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>industries.</v>

2018
01:20:59.350 --> 01:21:00.220
<v Speaker 1>There were the sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2019
01:21:00.221 --> 01:21:03.790
<v Speaker 1>you look at trek bicycles for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean before the first tour that I</v>

2020
01:21:03.791 --> 01:21:07.060
<v Speaker 1>think we did 125 million in sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a billion now.</v>

2021
01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:09.250
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was big difference.</v>

2022
01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

2023
01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.900
<v Speaker 1>so you have those sort of industries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

2024
01:21:13.930 --> 01:21:14.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the way down.</v>

2025
01:21:14.801 --> 01:21:17.770
<v Speaker 1>So those are all people are making money</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the way up and then on the way down,</v>

2026
01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2027
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:19.870
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

2028
01:21:20.170 --> 01:21:22.480
<v Speaker 1>it did happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably normal and natural</v>

2029
01:21:22.481 --> 01:21:24.940
<v Speaker 1>that people capitalize on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the way down.</v>

2030
01:21:24.941 --> 01:21:25.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at Bill Clinton.</v>

2031
01:21:25.841 --> 01:21:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he's going through everything he went</v>

2032
01:21:27.881 --> 01:21:28.271
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

2033
01:21:28.271 --> 01:21:30.370
<v Speaker 1>there were plenty of people going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

2034
01:21:30.371 --> 01:21:33.490
<v Speaker 1>It's my turn to make some money and fair</v>
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

2035
01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just the way it is.</v>

2036
01:21:35.291 --> 01:21:36.280
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2037
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:39.880
<v Speaker 1>some people may think that's bs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but shit,</v>

2038
01:21:39.970 --> 01:21:41.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was hopping on,</v>

2039
01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way down.</v>

2040
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to write.</v>

2041
01:21:44.671 --> 01:21:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is a,</v>

2042
01:21:45.921 --> 01:21:48.600
<v Speaker 2>it was a gigantic story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're,</v>

2043
01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:54.170
<v Speaker 2>your friends did know what you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing when it came out.</v>

2044
01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.130
<v Speaker 2>How many of them had a hard time with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

2045
01:21:56.131 --> 01:21:59.250
<v Speaker 2>How many of them were cool with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what was it like,</v>

2046
01:21:59.251 --> 01:21:59.400
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

2047
01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.090
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2048
01:22:00.090 --> 01:22:01.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2049
01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2050
01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:05.010
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sponsors fled,</v>

2051
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:06.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did any of them stay?</v>

2052
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:08.640
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

2053
01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:11.970
<v Speaker 1>How many did you have at a time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe 10.</v>

2054
01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.340
<v Speaker 1>But they have to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2055
01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of them are publicly traded</v>

2056
01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:18.330
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they have concerns about that.</v>

2057
01:22:18.331 --> 01:22:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are just covering their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass,</v>

2058
01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:21.390
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all gone.</v>

2059
01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and friends are interesting.</v>

2060
01:22:25.081 --> 01:22:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2061
01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just use the [inaudible] foundation is</v>

2062
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.600
<v Speaker 1>as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2063
01:22:30.601 --> 01:22:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2064
01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:31.920
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on the board,</v>

2065
01:22:31.921 --> 01:22:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I was the chairman of the board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the founder.</v>

2066
01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.230
<v Speaker 1>The board was my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these are the friends that say,</v>

2067
01:22:37.231 --> 01:22:37.980
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out.</v>

2068
01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:41.070
<v Speaker 1>And so I get it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there might be a strategic reason</v>

2069
01:22:41.071 --> 01:22:43.840
<v Speaker 1>for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when you never hear from them,</v>

2070
01:22:43.890 --> 01:22:46.080
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear from your life.</v>

2071
01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I sum it up is,</v>

2072
01:22:47.701 --> 01:22:49.860
<v Speaker 1>is anytime anybody goes through</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

2073
01:22:49.861 --> 01:22:51.690
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if you've had some</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy shit in your life,</v>

2074
01:22:51.691 --> 01:22:55.890
<v Speaker 1>but when you're going through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people either lean in or they lean out</v>

2075
01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:00.330
<v Speaker 1>and some people lean out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they run away.</v>

2076
01:23:00.630 --> 01:23:02.490
<v Speaker 1>And you're surprised by that and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2077
01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.630
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2078
01:23:03.631 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 1>that guy was at every champagne party we</v>
<v Speaker 1>threw in Paris.</v>

2079
01:23:06.670 --> 01:23:09.580
<v Speaker 1>And right now he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard from the dude in three years.</v>

2080
01:23:09.850 --> 01:23:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's strange.</v>

2081
01:23:10.930 --> 01:23:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2082
01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:16.250
<v Speaker 1>but he probably has his own motivate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either covering his own ass or maybe he</v>

2083
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.730
<v Speaker 1>one of these people that has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous sense of betrayal and it's</v>

2084
01:23:18.731 --> 01:23:21.250
<v Speaker 1>just so pissed still and hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have to,</v>

2085
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to be receptive to that.</v>

2086
01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they're the ones who lean in,</v>

2087
01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:25.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2088
01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:28.030
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of those people don't surprise</v>

2089
01:23:28.031 --> 01:23:29.320
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there are others that lean in</v>

2090
01:23:29.321 --> 01:23:30.310
<v Speaker 1>and they surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2091
01:23:30.311 --> 01:23:32.200
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

2092
01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you had my back like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you get surprised on both sides</v>

2093
01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:37.570
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the end of it all,</v>

2094
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:39.610
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look around and you're like,</v>

2095
01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:40.840
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2173
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:47.270
<v Speaker 1>they will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will grow into this like at some</v>

2174
01:26:47.271 --> 01:26:49.190
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my six year old boy who said just a</v>

2175
01:26:49.191 --> 01:26:52.190
<v Speaker 1>fanatical athlete and everything is</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports and sports and sports.</v>

2176
01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:54.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I hear his,</v>

2177
01:26:54.771 --> 01:26:57.350
<v Speaker 1>him and his friends talk about Tom Brady</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of his friends like,</v>

2178
01:26:57.351 --> 01:26:58.170
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a cheater.</v>

2179
01:26:58.170 --> 01:26:59.720
<v Speaker 1>My son loves Tom Brady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2180
01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:00.321
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a cheater.</v>

2181
01:27:00.321 --> 01:27:03.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ain't going to be long before Max</v>

2182
01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong is at school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some kid in another class goes,</v>

2183
01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:09.770
<v Speaker 1>isn't your dad that cheater?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's going to be like,</v>

2184
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:11.750
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

2185
01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:12.830
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

2186
01:27:12.831 --> 01:27:16.160
<v Speaker 1>so he's going to grow into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that conversation will then be had at</v>

2187
01:27:16.161 --> 01:27:18.020
<v Speaker 1>that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to have it with a six year</v>

2188
01:27:18.021 --> 01:27:19.370
<v Speaker 1>old today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2189
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:22.310
<v Speaker 1>so I know that's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2190
01:27:22.311 --> 01:27:23.870
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have the experience of having</v>

2191
01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:27.500
<v Speaker 1>dealt with it with a 16 year old boy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time was 13.</v>

2192
01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2193
01:27:28.971 --> 01:27:31.100
<v Speaker 1>and still dealing with it with those</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

2194
01:27:31.101 --> 01:27:32.960
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far,</v>

2195
01:27:32.961 --> 01:27:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we've been super proactive,</v>

2196
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:36.840
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2197
01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Anna and Kristen probably think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>should've been more proactive.</v>

2198
01:27:39.230 --> 01:27:40.730
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2199
01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:43.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's in a good spot.</v>

2200
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:47.390
<v Speaker 1>So you have group therapy sessions where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just discuss.</v>

2201
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:50.060
<v Speaker 1>So I've sat with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all three kids,</v>

2202
01:27:50.150 --> 01:27:51.440
<v Speaker 1>the older kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2203
01:27:51.441 --> 01:27:53.890
<v Speaker 1>and it's just sort of free for all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2204
01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they had no idea until the scandal</v>

2205
01:27:57.831 --> 01:27:58.664
<v Speaker 1>broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2206
01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:02.720
<v Speaker 1>And what was their reaction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2207
01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:04.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girls were,</v>

2208
01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.960
<v Speaker 1>they were nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they were still,</v>

2209
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:07.370
<v Speaker 1>they were young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2210
01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:10.040
<v Speaker 1>a nine year old girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really didn't have a reaction.</v>

2211
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Luke was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2212
01:28:11.130 --> 01:28:12.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2213
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:14.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 13 year old boy.</v>

2214
01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:15.290
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were 11,</v>

2215
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:17.330
<v Speaker 1>so luke was 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were 11.</v>

2216
01:28:17.331 --> 01:28:19.520
<v Speaker 1>They still sort of immune to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2217
01:28:19.521 --> 01:28:20.930
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2218
01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean he watched when he watched oprah</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it airdrie or four days later I</v>

2219
01:28:25.311 --> 01:28:28.820
<v Speaker 1>had sort of fled to Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2220
01:28:28.821 --> 01:28:30.460
<v Speaker 1>he called me up cause I talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>luke on,</v>

2221
01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.180
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on her show,</v>

2222
01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the whole idea that I know he's</v>

2223
01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:37.190
<v Speaker 1>defending me at school.</v>

2224
01:28:37.190 --> 01:28:39.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was enough smoke that people were</v>

2225
01:28:39.591 --> 01:28:40.071
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2226
01:28:40.071 --> 01:28:41.440
<v Speaker 1>you're dad's a doper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

2227
01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:45.380
<v Speaker 1>And he was defending me and my point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oprah was that at this point I get to</v>

2228
01:28:45.381 --> 01:28:46.790
<v Speaker 1>say to Luke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop defending me.</v>

2229
01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.800
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to defend me anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2230
01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.920
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he watched that,</v>

2231
01:28:51.921 --> 01:28:54.290
<v Speaker 1>which is probably a heavy moment for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for him.</v>

2232
01:28:54.291 --> 01:28:55.970
<v Speaker 1>It would have been awful watching it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>

2233
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he called me and said,</v>

2234
01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I understand and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love you.</v>

2235
01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:03.120
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2236
01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:04.441
<v Speaker 1>but we still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2237
01:29:04.441 --> 01:29:06.990
<v Speaker 1>that was three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still have to talk about these</v>

2238
01:29:06.991 --> 01:29:07.501
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2239

<v Speaker 2>not often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2242
01:29:11.161 --> 01:29:15.470
<v Speaker 2>It's still occasionally comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're talking about the</v>

2243
01:29:15.471 --> 01:29:18.060
<v Speaker 2>importance of being honest and truthful</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2244
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:20.330
<v Speaker 2>and having character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2245
01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:22.030
<v Speaker 1>And he's an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2246
01:29:22.031 --> 01:29:22.451
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2247
01:29:22.451 --> 01:29:25.120
<v Speaker 1>not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only thing that I will,</v>

2248
01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.350
<v Speaker 1>and I will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2249
01:29:26.351 --> 01:29:29.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't want a ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my son's huge,</v>

2250
01:29:29.861 --> 01:29:30.790

2251
01:29:30.791 --> 01:29:33.230
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>230 pounds plays offensive line.</v>

2252
01:29:33.231 --> 01:29:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2253
01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:34.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

2254
01:29:34.990 --> 01:29:36.760
<v Speaker 2>That is not too many people would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking with him.</v>

2255
01:29:37.710 --> 01:29:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2256
01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:39.460
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's good there,</v>

2257
01:29:39.461 --> 01:29:40.294
<v Speaker 2>but he's also a real</v>

2258
01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.750
<v Speaker 1>sweet guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's not,</v>

2259
01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:43.700
<v Speaker 1>he's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not an anybody's face.</v>

2260
01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want him to say his football</v>

2261
01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:49.470
<v Speaker 1>passion or,</v>

2262
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:50.460
<v Speaker 2>or career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what call it,</v>

2263
01:29:50.461 --> 01:29:52.290
<v Speaker 2>what you will ends up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2264
01:29:52.291 --> 01:29:54.120
<v Speaker 2>at a high level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2265
01:29:54.121 --> 01:29:56.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't want him in a messy spot where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got to make tough choices.</v>

2266
01:29:56.820 --> 01:29:57.571
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2267
01:29:57.571 --> 01:30:01.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And football is a sport where you have</v>

2268
01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:03.570
<v Speaker 2>to make tough choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2269
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a football player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can,</v>

2270
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:07.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine.</v>

2271
01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.420
<v Speaker 2>I have friends that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2272
01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.680
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2273
01:30:10.890 --> 01:30:14.490
<v Speaker 2>That's mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also open and it's also brought</v>

2274
01:30:14.491 --> 01:30:17.130
<v Speaker 2>up by coaches and it's also brought up</v>
<v Speaker 2>by trainers.</v>

2275
01:30:17.550 --> 01:30:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a,</v>

2276
01:30:18.810 --> 01:30:22.260
<v Speaker 2>it's a part of the game as much as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure it is in cycling.</v>

2277
01:30:22.261 --> 01:30:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2278
01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:30.190
<v Speaker 2>That had to be just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just how to like be chewing you</v>

2279
01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:33.730
<v Speaker 2>apart when you know that your kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending you and you know it's going to</v>

2280
01:30:33.731 --> 01:30:34.690
<v Speaker 2>come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2281
01:30:34.691 --> 01:30:37.630
<v Speaker 2>he's having these conversations at</v>
<v Speaker 2>school and he's like,</v>

2282
01:30:37.631 --> 01:30:39.250
<v Speaker 2>my dad's not a cheater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2283
01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know it was going to come out.</v>

2284
01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

2285
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:47.530
<v Speaker 1>even when the Wicki was investigating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

2286
01:30:47.531 --> 01:30:49.240
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that case went away.</v>

2287
01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we thought at that point,</v>

2288
01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe we're done and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2289
01:30:54.150 --> 01:30:54.791
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2290
01:30:54.791 --> 01:30:55.541
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2291
01:30:55.541 --> 01:30:57.170
<v Speaker 1>you sought a picked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2292
01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:59.040
<v Speaker 1>the investigation and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2293
01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2294
01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:04.090
<v Speaker 1>based on all his work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they picked it up and then it came up.</v>

2295
01:31:05.170 --> 01:31:08.050
<v Speaker 1>But I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happened fast,</v>

2296
01:31:08.230 --> 01:31:11.840
<v Speaker 1>like get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was seemingly like instantaneous man.</v>

2297
01:31:11.841 --> 01:31:13.160
<v Speaker 1>It be an enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2298
01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:17.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2299
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:18.201
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2300
01:31:18.201 --> 01:31:18.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's,</v>

2301
01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it surprised me,</v>

2302
01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:21.853
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

2303
01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.190
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody would have been surprised I</v>

2304
01:31:24.191 --> 01:31:26.170
<v Speaker 1>suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just surreal,</v>

2305
01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:27.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

2306
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:28.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2307
01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:32.090
<v Speaker 1>it all came out and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2308
01:31:32.110 --> 01:31:37.110
<v Speaker 1>and in the method at which they sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertised the findings,</v>

2309
01:31:38.561 --> 01:31:39.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2310
01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:41.100
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a whole strip,</v>

2311
01:31:41.101 --> 01:31:42.250
<v Speaker 1>but to their credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2312
01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:44.500
<v Speaker 1>there was a strategy on their end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

2313
01:31:44.501 --> 01:31:47.620
<v Speaker 1>let's take Novitsky keys work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do some additional investigations,</v>

2314
01:31:48.130 --> 01:31:51.820
<v Speaker 1>let's package it and what's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>they called the reason decision and then</v>

2315
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:55.580
<v Speaker 1>let's go out and talk about it all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place like that,</v>

2316
01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:57.550
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of unbelievable to me.</v>

2317
01:31:58.070 --> 01:32:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think they spent so much time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and resources going after you,</v>

2318
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:05.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to all the other people who</v>

2319
01:32:05.401 --> 01:32:06.234
<v Speaker 2>have one b?</v>

2320
01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they needed a landmark case that</v>

2321
01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:13.110
<v Speaker 1>I think there's plenty of people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

2322
01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm just guessing I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not based on any proof.</v>

2323
01:32:18.691 --> 01:32:20.480
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've had conversations with,</v>

2324
01:32:20.481 --> 01:32:20.991
<v Speaker 1>you saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2325
01:32:20.991 --> 01:32:25.991
<v Speaker 1>I think we're still getting to the point</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we can do stuff together or have a</v>

2326
01:32:26.001 --> 01:32:28.670
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not trying to criticize them.</v>

2327
01:32:28.671 --> 01:32:29.504
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there,</v>

2328
01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:30.980
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there ought to be a place for them,</v>

2329
01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:35.240
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's also realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in reality there are,</v>

2330
01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:36.980
<v Speaker 1>there are people that think they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>ineffective.</v>

2331
01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.500
<v Speaker 1>They think they spend 10 or 20 or 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute,</v>

2332
01:32:39.501 --> 01:32:41.600
<v Speaker 1>whatever the number is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars a year.</v>

2333
01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:44.570
<v Speaker 1>And they don't catch anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2334
01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>positives is,</v>

2335
01:32:46.971 --> 01:32:50.360
<v Speaker 1>must be less than 1%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2336
01:32:50.361 --> 01:32:51.690
<v Speaker 1>if I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Joe,</v>

2337
01:32:51.710 --> 01:32:54.200
<v Speaker 1>we're all good man is less than 1%</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing positive,</v>

2338
01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:56.030
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would right.</v>

2339
01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:57.880
<v Speaker 1>You think that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2340
01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:00.980
<v Speaker 1>So they needed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they needed a landmark case to say,</v>

2341
01:33:01.190 --> 01:33:02.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are effective.</v>

2342
01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:05.510
<v Speaker 1>And here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2343
01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:08.870
<v Speaker 1>and I think also from a legal</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective at set some legal precedents</v>

2344
01:33:08.871 --> 01:33:13.640
<v Speaker 1>for them that they can use going forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other cases with future future cases.</v>

2345
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:16.663
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2346
01:33:17.210 --> 01:33:20.540
<v Speaker 1>and then you add in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a ginormous story that was</v>

2347
01:33:20.541 --> 01:33:25.541
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed to get a lot of press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it still pains me to,</v>

2348
01:33:25.810 --> 01:33:26.930
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look,</v>

2349
01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:28.970
<v Speaker 1>I know what went on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know what went on,</v>

2350
01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.450
<v Speaker 1>but I can't take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2351
01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:34.820
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I hear that,</v>

2352
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:38.630
<v Speaker 1>that this program or this particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete being me was the greatest fraud</v>

2353
01:33:38.631 --> 01:33:41.050
<v Speaker 1>in the history of sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2354
01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.370
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not true.</v>

2355
01:33:44.110 --> 01:33:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you hear that,</v>

2356
01:33:45.351 --> 01:33:46.510
<v Speaker 1>are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2357
01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:50.480
<v Speaker 1>our teams doping program was the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated program in the history of</v>

2358
01:33:50.481 --> 01:33:51.550
<v Speaker 1>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2359
01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:53.540
<v Speaker 1>we also know that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2360
01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are,</v>

2361
01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:59.240
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the final one was,</v>

2362
01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:02.380
<v Speaker 1>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think bothered a lot of people that,</v>

2363
01:34:02.410 --> 01:34:07.370
<v Speaker 1>that this person being me forced young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impressionable young men to put</v>

2364
01:34:07.371 --> 01:34:09.500
<v Speaker 1>dangerous substances into their body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2365
01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:12.620
<v Speaker 1>That just is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2366
01:34:12.621 --> 01:34:14.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I heard somebody,</v>

2367
01:34:14.211 --> 01:34:17.300
<v Speaker 1>if somebody said that about one of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>son's friends,</v>

2368
01:34:17.301 --> 01:34:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I would be pissed off too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd be like,</v>

2369
01:34:19.190 --> 01:34:20.630
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screw that guy.</v>

2370
01:34:21.450 --> 01:34:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we all made our own choices.</v>

2371
01:34:24.951 --> 01:34:27.530
<v Speaker 1>We were all grown men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were bad choices,</v>

2372
01:34:27.531 --> 01:34:29.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So most would say we would say,</v>

2373
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:30.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2374
01:34:30.710 --> 01:34:33.920
<v Speaker 1>but there was no forcing to do that.</v>

2375
01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:37.700
<v Speaker 2>What is it like now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in a,</v>

2376
01:34:37.701 --> 01:34:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean I want you to personal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your personal life,</v>

2377
01:34:40.011 --> 01:34:43.820
<v Speaker 2>like people value honesty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most important things in</v>

2378
01:34:43.821 --> 01:34:48.821
<v Speaker 2>friends and lovers when you have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing where you're on video over and</v>

2379
01:34:52.371 --> 01:34:54.680
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2380
01:34:54.681 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 2>being deceptive over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending when you,</v>

2381
01:34:58.490 --> 01:35:00.290
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you come out and say it's all a</v>

2382
01:35:00.291 --> 01:35:03.140
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this like database of</v>

2383
01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:05.750
<v Speaker 2>lying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what is it like,</v>

2384
01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:08.360
<v Speaker 2>like trying to get people to trust you,</v>

2385
01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

2386
01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:14.350
<v Speaker 1>that's [inaudible] this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I talked about in the</v>

2387
01:35:14.351 --> 01:35:16.200
<v Speaker 1>beginning is that that that road is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2388
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:17.650
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is net that will be,</v>

2389
01:35:18.810 --> 01:35:22.300
<v Speaker 1>that is a never ending path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will be walking that walk the rest of</v>

2390
01:35:22.301 --> 01:35:25.840
<v Speaker 1>my life and there were a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll say,</v>

2391
01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:28.570
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never trusting this guy ever again.</v>

2392
01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how apologetic or tried he</v>

2393
01:35:32.621 --> 01:35:33.454
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

2394
01:35:34.030 --> 01:35:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

2395
01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:38.710
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the key is that I have to be committed</v>

2396
01:35:38.711 --> 01:35:39.700
<v Speaker 1>to that path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2397
01:35:39.701 --> 01:35:42.670
<v Speaker 1>And so I can walk that walk and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2398
01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:45.680
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and take each case individually and one</v>

2399
01:35:45.681 --> 01:35:47.140
<v Speaker 1>on one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2400
01:35:47.290 --> 01:35:49.800
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about in drumming,</v>

2401
01:35:49.810 --> 01:35:52.300
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about endurance that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the longest,</v>

2402
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:55.690
<v Speaker 1>the longest walk or the longest journey</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my life.</v>

2403
01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:59.970
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a code that you follow now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2404
01:35:59.971 --> 01:36:01.610
<v Speaker 2>have you imposed like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2405
01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:06.000
<v Speaker 2>a stringent set of rules on yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>where like,</v>

2406
01:36:06.001 --> 01:36:06.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2407
01:36:06.481 --> 01:36:11.040
<v Speaker 2>because of this history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't lie about anything ever?</v>

2408
01:36:12.090 --> 01:36:12.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2409
01:36:13.890 --> 01:36:14.723
<v Speaker 1>I haven't thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2410
01:36:14.890 --> 01:36:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I guess the answer's no because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't,</v>

2411
01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.150
<v Speaker 1>there's not been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2412
01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:20.910
<v Speaker 1>sort of a new mission statement or sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these key,</v>

2413
01:36:20.911 --> 01:36:25.230
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean</v>

2414
01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:30.240
<v Speaker 1>life was pretty transparent anyways</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that.</v>

2415
01:36:30.330 --> 01:36:33.060
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was obviously there was the huge</v>

2416
01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:36.180
<v Speaker 1>deception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2417
01:36:36.181 --> 01:36:37.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2418
01:36:38.530 --> 01:36:41.160
<v Speaker 1>anything crazy out there outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2419
01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2420
01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:42.880
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2421
01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:44.200

<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

2422
01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:49.460
<v Speaker 2>that's a big thing with people to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to trust our friends or you'll be</v>

2423
01:36:49.461 --> 01:36:51.250
<v Speaker 2>able to trust their boyfriend or</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend,</v>

2424
01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.113
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2425
01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:56.800
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is life like for Lance Armstrong</v>

2426
01:36:56.801 --> 01:36:57.640
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is a,</v>

2427
01:36:57.641 --> 01:37:01.600
<v Speaker 2>is everything calmed down to the point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the stress has minimized except</v>

2428
01:37:01.601 --> 01:37:02.434
<v Speaker 2>for the lawsuit?</v>

2429
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2430
01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:04.891
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2431
01:37:04.891 --> 01:37:07.380
<v Speaker 1>as I said a sec a second ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just simple,</v>

2432
01:37:07.381 --> 01:37:07.761
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2433
01:37:07.761 --> 01:37:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2434
01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.840
<v Speaker 1>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love to workout,</v>

2435
01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:12.600
<v Speaker 1>so I train every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what he'd do.</v>

2436
01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2437
01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I primarily run and then I'll do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of gym work and then,</v>

2438
01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:20.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll ride occasionally,</v>

2439
01:37:20.311 --> 01:37:22.620
<v Speaker 1>although very rarely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rarely get on a bike.</v>

2440
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

2441
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:29.490
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes too much time and it's just,</v>

2442
01:37:29.730 --> 01:37:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I take so much time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2443
01:37:31.831 --> 01:37:33.150
<v Speaker 1>you could run for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2444
01:37:33.151 --> 01:37:34.740
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do a hard run for an hour,</v>

2445
01:37:34.741 --> 01:37:37.740
<v Speaker 1>you got to go ride for three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's two more hours that you,</v>

2446
01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:40.950
<v Speaker 1>unless you got to get all this shit on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go out and deal with traffic.</v>

2447
01:37:40.951 --> 01:37:44.310
<v Speaker 1>And it does it psychologically fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you when you get on a bike.</v>

2448
01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:45.240
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2449
01:37:46.170 --> 01:37:49.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have some bitterness there towards</v>

2450
01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.460
<v Speaker 1>what we've talked about primarily in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the economy of it,</v>

2451
01:37:53.461 --> 01:37:54.294
<v Speaker 1>how it was.</v>

2452
01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:55.500
<v Speaker 1>And now everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2453
01:37:55.501 --> 01:37:56.310
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

2454
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:58.290
<v Speaker 1>We're out or we don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2455
01:37:58.360 --> 01:37:59.191
<v Speaker 1>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2456
01:37:59.191 --> 01:38:00.450
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2457
01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:01.920
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's on me.</v>

2458
01:38:01.921 --> 01:38:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I got to work that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not,</v>

2459
01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.400
<v Speaker 1>that's not their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my fault.</v>

2460
01:38:05.401 --> 01:38:08.400
<v Speaker 1>So there's some of that and it's nice to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

2461
01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I love to run on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up,</v>

2462
01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I ran before I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

2463
01:38:11.341 --> 01:38:13.830
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to go into something where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can still get,</v>

2464
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:15.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I view working out,</v>

2465
01:38:15.091 --> 01:38:17.010
<v Speaker 1>you probably view it the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a therapy.</v>

2466
01:38:17.011 --> 01:38:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Like you're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're suffering,</v>

2467
01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.390
<v Speaker 1>you're just working shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2468
01:38:20.391 --> 01:38:22.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I do when I,</v>

2469
01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I work out or go for a long run.</v>

2470
01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:28.130
<v Speaker 1>So I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2471
01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:29.160
<v Speaker 1>a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have,</v>

2472
01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:30.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have five kids are in four different</v>

2473
01:38:30.811 --> 01:38:31.850
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's um,</v>

2474
01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:36.300
<v Speaker 1>like an uber driver for my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But traffic in Austin is not like la,</v>

2475
01:38:36.301 --> 01:38:37.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2476
01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:40.800
<v Speaker 1>This again bad now and so all I do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive my kids around.</v>

2477
01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:42.960
<v Speaker 2>Too many people talk about how Great</v>
<v Speaker 2>Austin is.</v>

2478
01:38:42.961 --> 01:38:43.630
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>

2479
01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the,</v>

2480
01:38:44.691 --> 01:38:48.940
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't build that city 50 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago to accommodate 2 million people.</v>

2481
01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.070
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2482
01:38:51.071 --> 01:38:52.330
<v Speaker 1>I played a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I play a lot of golf,</v>

2483
01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:54.650
<v Speaker 1>which is why we're going to end this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast will,</v>

2484
01:38:54.710 --> 01:38:56.690
<v Speaker 1>that's why I can go play Riviera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They man,</v>

2491
01:39:08.830 --> 01:39:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Someone's calling me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's on him.</v>

2492
01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you got the hunter book.</v>

2493
01:39:13.751 --> 01:39:14.920
<v Speaker 1>We got to talk a little bit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter.</v>

2494
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

2495
01:39:16.110 --> 01:39:18.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you were a fan until I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2496
01:39:18.190 --> 01:39:22.570
<v Speaker 1>maybe bill burr retweeted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're a tweet that said,</v>

2497
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:25.300
<v Speaker 1>if anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's one person that's dead that,</v>

2498
01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:26.310
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2499
01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:28.900
<v Speaker 1>that I could meet today or was alive</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be hunter.</v>

2500
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a instagram post that I made</v>

2501
01:39:31.041 --> 01:39:33.710
<v Speaker 2>about one of his incredible quotes</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2502
01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:36.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was about heroes and it was,</v>

2503
01:39:36.921 --> 01:39:40.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was particularly poignant about a,</v>

2504
01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:42.140
<v Speaker 2>it was after Ronda Rousey got knocked</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

2505
01:39:42.370 --> 01:39:44.910
<v Speaker 2>but I posted it that people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2506
01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:49.920
<v Speaker 2>they love the idea of someone who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a superhuman person,</v>

2507
01:39:51.681 --> 01:39:53.300
<v Speaker 2>like someone who's a legend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who,</v>

2508
01:39:53.690 --> 01:39:58.180
<v Speaker 2>who can defy the odds because it gives</v>
<v Speaker 2>them hope in this crazy world,</v>

2509
01:39:58.490 --> 01:40:02.300
<v Speaker 2>boredom and cubicles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm doing a shitty job of</v>

2510
01:40:02.301 --> 01:40:04.400
<v Speaker 2>paraphrasing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a fantastic quote.</v>

2511
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:06.530
<v Speaker 2>And then you got a hold of me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2512
01:40:06.531 --> 01:40:09.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had that incredible book sent to me.</v>

2513
01:40:09.171 --> 01:40:11.840
<v Speaker 2>What an a hunter was running for sheriff</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Aspen.</v>

2514
01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2515
01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

2516
01:40:13.551 --> 01:40:14.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2517
01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:15.240
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2518
01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.240
<v Speaker 1>he kind of ruled the valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2519
01:40:17.241 --> 01:40:18.590
<v Speaker 1>he lived down in Woody Creek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2520
01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:20.900
<v Speaker 1>but the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2521
01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:24.800
<v Speaker 1>the whole valley was the roaring fork</v>
<v Speaker 1>valley was kind of his domain and he was</v>

2522
01:40:24.801 --> 01:40:27.260
<v Speaker 1>just in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his best friend was,</v>

2523
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:29.840
<v Speaker 1>was our longtime sheriff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the sheriff for 26 years.</v>

2524
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Bob Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a great friend of mine,</v>

2525
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:35.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his under sheriff is probably my best</v>

2526
01:40:35.391 --> 01:40:37.430
<v Speaker 1>bud there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy named by the name of Joe de Salvo.</v>

2527
01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:41.480
<v Speaker 1>So how a kid from Brooklyn ends up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aspen is now the sheriff is on a second</v>

2528
01:40:41.481 --> 01:40:43.470
<v Speaker 1>term.</v>

2529
01:40:43.471 --> 01:40:45.990
<v Speaker 1>were hunters best buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2533
01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.510
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy that was shared for 26</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2534
01:40:55.511 --> 01:40:56.620
<v Speaker 1>He says to me one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

2535
01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:00.220
<v Speaker 1>he calls me champ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also funny.</v>

2536
01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:01.750
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jampie says,</v>

2537
01:41:01.751 --> 01:41:03.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you ever meet hunter?</v>

2538
01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:04.061
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2539
01:41:04.061 --> 01:41:06.970
<v Speaker 1>I never met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he pauses for a long time.</v>

2540
01:41:06.971 --> 01:41:07.870
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2541
01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:11.120
<v Speaker 1>he would have loved you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2542
01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:12.033
<v Speaker 1>I took that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>was nuts and,</v>

2546
01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:19.090
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know,</v>

2547
01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had such a diverse group of friends,</v>

2548
01:41:21.161 --> 01:41:23.230
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was our sheriff or whether it</v>

2549
01:41:23.231 --> 01:41:26.520
<v Speaker 1>was lyle lovett or whether it was Johnny</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depp or whether it was Doug Brinkley.</v>

2550
01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:27.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2551
01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:31.870
<v Speaker 1>just this diverse group of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>artists and thinkers and lawmen and,</v>

2554
01:41:39.161 --> 01:41:41.290
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably can't even talk about it.</v>

2555
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's dead.</v>

01:46:36.181 --> 01:46:40.320
<v Speaker 3>the reality versus the narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always messy.</v>

2679
01:46:40.350 --> 01:46:42.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's so many variables that don't</v>

2680
01:46:42.451 --> 01:46:45.390
<v Speaker 3>get discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's so many aspects of it that</v>

2681
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:48.370
<v Speaker 3>they're flexible and they move around</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2682
01:46:48.371 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2683
01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more now,</v>

2684
01:46:51.351 --> 01:46:53.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transparency we see in our society</v>

2685
01:46:53.811 --> 01:46:57.170
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's politicians or politics or</v>

2686
01:46:57.171 --> 01:46:59.580
<v Speaker 1>sports or entertainment and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2687
01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:01.280
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you imagine,</v>

2688
01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:02.390
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say like,</v>

2689
01:47:02.391 --> 01:47:02.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2690
01:47:02.850 --> 01:47:04.400
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I give you three names that were</v>

2691
01:47:04.401 --> 01:47:05.780
<v Speaker 1>alive today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Sinatra,</v>

2692
01:47:05.781 --> 01:47:06.351
<v Speaker 1>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2693
01:47:06.351 --> 01:47:11.351
<v Speaker 1>just had celebrated his hundredth</v>
<v Speaker 1>birthday [inaudible] you took Sinatra,</v>

2694
01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:14.150
<v Speaker 1>JFK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Michael Jordan,</v>

2695
01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:16.340
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were at their peak today.</v>

2696
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:22.200
<v Speaker 2>TMZ alone would be nuking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2697
01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:23.920
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2698
01:47:24.010 --> 01:47:25.150
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2699
01:47:25.390 --> 01:47:28.000
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just getting deeper and deeper</v>

2700
01:47:28.001 --> 01:47:28.950
<v Speaker 2>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2701
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is just,</v>

2702
01:47:31.001 --> 01:47:32.530
<v Speaker 2>there's no end to the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2703
01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:33.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2704
01:47:33.070 --> 01:47:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what's going on with technology</v>

2705
01:47:34.961 --> 01:47:39.580
<v Speaker 2>too is we're seeing this very obvious</v>
<v Speaker 2>trend that the boundaries between people</v>

2706
01:47:39.581 --> 01:47:42.310
<v Speaker 2>and thoughts and ideas and reality and</v>
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>

2707
01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're getting smaller and smaller and</v>

2708
01:47:44.141 --> 01:47:46.030
<v Speaker 2>smaller to the point where they're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be erased.</v>

2709
01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:47.860
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know how it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

2710
01:47:47.861 --> 01:47:51.700
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's going to happen with</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that connects us and in a much</v>

2711
01:47:51.701 --> 01:47:55.180
<v Speaker 2>more personal way than peripheral</v>
<v Speaker 2>devices like laptops or phones.</v>

2712
01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I think there's gonna be some technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>that connects us body to body,</v>

2713
01:48:00.460 --> 01:48:04.030
<v Speaker 2>whether it's some sort of a neural</v>
<v Speaker 2>implant or something along those lines.</v>

2714
01:48:04.031 --> 01:48:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

2715
01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I think it's on inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2716
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:09.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the symbiotic relationship that we have</v>

2717
01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:12.220
<v Speaker 2>with cell phones right now is</v>
<v Speaker 2>undeniable.</v>

2718
01:48:12.250 --> 01:48:13.330
<v Speaker 2>I leave my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

2719
01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:14.980
<v Speaker 2>you dropped your phone and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

2720
01:48:14.981 --> 01:48:16.510
<v Speaker 2>where's my phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My phone's broken.</v>

2721
01:48:16.511 --> 01:48:17.111
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

2722
01:48:17.111 --> 01:48:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Fuck</v>

2723
01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:18.413
<v Speaker 1>no here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2724
01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2725
01:48:20.611 --> 01:48:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I dropped it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I did drop my phone,</v>

2726
01:48:21.811 --> 01:48:24.390
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like fucking scratching myself</v>

2727
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:26.100
<v Speaker 1>because I haven't had the phone for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three hours.</v>

2728
01:48:26.101 --> 01:48:26.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2729
01:48:26.821 --> 01:48:28.740
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ain't good.</v>

2730
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:29.663
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not good.</v>

2731
01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:33.510
<v Speaker 2>I leave my phone sometimes in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the car when I go do the podcast and</v>

2732
01:48:33.511 --> 01:48:36.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't realize that I left it and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>be in the middle of a great podcast.</v>

2733
01:48:36.530 --> 01:48:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Like my phone's not here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even gonna use it.</v>

2734
01:48:39.181 --> 01:48:40.470
<v Speaker 2>It's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't touch it.</v>

2735
01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:43.800
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that it's not physically</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I want it right there.</v>

2736
01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:47.030
<v Speaker 1>You know you're on here and you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>start like,</v>

2737
01:48:47.190 --> 01:48:49.490
<v Speaker 1>you know you've got some guests on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like texting him and the guests</v>

2738
01:48:49.491 --> 01:48:51.120
<v Speaker 1>will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

2739
01:48:51.130 --> 01:48:51.830
<v Speaker 1>What's he do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2740
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I come all the way over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This godforsaken valley and that la</v>

2741
01:48:56.001 --> 01:48:56.400
<v Speaker 1>traffic</v>

2742
01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.000
<v Speaker 2>and the guy's on his phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2743
01:48:58.001 --> 01:49:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Well I have had people that are guests</v>
<v Speaker 2>that start checking their twitter.</v>

2744
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.460
<v Speaker 2>Like Neal Brennan would try and start</v>
<v Speaker 2>checking his twitter in the middle of</v>

2745
01:49:03.461 --> 01:49:04.660
<v Speaker 2>pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you doing?</v>

2746
01:49:04.690 --> 01:49:05.920
<v Speaker 2>I want to see what people are saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

2747
01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Talk to them afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just flip your people.</v>

2748
01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:11.290
<v Speaker 2>You don't let people call in and ask</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions or ask questions.</v>

2749
01:49:12.250 --> 01:49:14.290
<v Speaker 2>We've done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is that people that want</v>

2750
01:49:14.291 --> 01:49:16.080
<v Speaker 2>to do it are usually trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2751
01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:21.840
<v Speaker 2>some of those might be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like if I wanted that kind of a show,</v>

2752
01:49:22.151 --> 01:49:24.250
<v Speaker 2>I would do an all call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she did a talk,</v>

2753
01:49:24.251 --> 01:49:26.770
<v Speaker 2>I did a talk a couple of couple months</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago</v>

2754
01:49:26.770 --> 01:49:31.530
<v Speaker 1>in Denver and the 600 people and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a moderated q and a and then we,</v>

2755
01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:34.420
<v Speaker 1>and then the audience was allowed to ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and people were cool.</v>

2756
01:49:34.421 --> 01:49:37.390
<v Speaker 1>They were asking questions in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moderator says in,</v>

2757
01:49:37.391 --> 01:49:40.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a line to get to the mic desk</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and the guy says,</v>

2758
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:41.870
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that this light,</v>

2759
01:49:41.871 --> 01:49:44.170

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2760
01:49:44.171 --> 01:49:46.010
<v Speaker 1>calling her a troll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the guy says,</v>

2761
01:49:46.011 --> 01:49:48.340
<v Speaker 1>is anybody in really</v>

2762

<v Speaker 2>she's like me,</v>

2764
01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:55.060
<v Speaker 2>she comes trucking up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2765
01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:56.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2784
01:50:36.250 --> 01:50:37.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was his birthday last night.</v>

2785
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:42.640
<v Speaker 2>We went out to dinner and just we got w</v>
<v Speaker 2>way too drunk.</v>

2786
01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:46.930
<v Speaker 2>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens.</v>

2787
01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we were talking about about</v>

2788
01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:54.240
<v Speaker 2>technology though about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing people closer together in this,</v>

2789
01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:56.620
<v Speaker 2>the fact that there's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2790
01:50:56.621 --> 01:50:58.180
<v Speaker 2>I really think there's going to be no</v>
<v Speaker 2>secrets.</v>

2791
01:50:58.181 --> 01:51:00.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody's going to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>secrets from anybody in the future.</v>

2792
01:51:00.401 --> 01:51:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
