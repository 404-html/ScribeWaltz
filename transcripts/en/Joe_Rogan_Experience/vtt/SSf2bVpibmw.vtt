<v Speaker 2>There's only been two people ever.</v>

4
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 2>The dentist Mckenna's record recommended</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this podcast.</v>

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 2>You and josh worker him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that puts you in very lofty company.</v>

6
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Dahmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way Daimler.</v>

7
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 2>Dame French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dumb air.</v>

8
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 2>But is that how your family pronounces </v>
<v Speaker 2>it the correct way?</v>

9
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Damers the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do your friends call you a dumb air </v>

10
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 2>buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like give you full respect in the French</v>

11
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 2>heritage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

12
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a thousand years ago.</v>

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.040
<v Speaker 2>They gave it up after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave it up after they invaded </v>

14
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ten 66.</v>

15
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 2>That's clever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good move.</v>

16
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.120
<v Speaker 2>You've got a very unusual background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

17
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis would not stop raving about you </v>

18
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.130
<v Speaker 2>and then when I started doing research </v>
<v Speaker 2>on you,</v>

19
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were.</v>

20
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 2>This is the craziest story of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not not the craziest,</v>

21
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:13.341
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were in burning man during Katrina </v>

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 2>with you are partying and Bernie Mann </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people who work in the Pentagon.</v>

23
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Katrina went down camp ply a gun.</v>

24
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 2>That is the most ridiculous thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives me great discomfort to know.</v>

25
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 2>The people who work in the Pentagon are </v>
<v Speaker 2>partying at burning man rocking.</v>

26
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 2>We called for Blackhawks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we got the order tonight,</v>

27
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 2>but that's a whole other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole story.</v>

28
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

29
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 2>We'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Katrina was happening,</v>

30
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 2>you guys were amongst the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were in burning man,</v>

31
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 2>the very few that had a connection to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the outside world.</v>

32
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.310
<v Speaker 1>If we had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.530
<v Speaker 1>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our camp was doing the Wifi and the </v>

34
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Internet for burning man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the public and emergency networks,</v>

35
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:59.261
<v Speaker 1>the private network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we had a dish and we could </v>

36
00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>takeover satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of our guys took over recon </v>

37
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>satellite.</v>

38
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Is it a Pentagon move?</v>

39
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Is it depending on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

40
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.690
<v Speaker 1>So he took this thing offline and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually been at a,</v>

41
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>a is NRO national reconnaissance office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been at an nro launch just the </v>

42
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>year before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I look over and I see the logo </v>

43
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.680
<v Speaker 1>on the laptop and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing,</v>

44
00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:29.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this man who remain nameless.</v>

45
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.200
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up and turned his laptop away.</v>

46
00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:37.201
<v Speaker 1>And he pounded in a code and he took </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing off line and so our iridium </v>

47
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>phone rang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.710
<v Speaker 1>this Pentagon wireless satellite phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the,</v>

49
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the general on the other side is saying </v>

50
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>what's going on and basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he instructed the guy not to answer.</v>

51
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 1>So we then had control of this thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could watch Katrina come in because </v>

52
00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 1>the government wasn't doing with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this national resource assets to,</v>

53
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.310
<v Speaker 1>to help people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was the frustration that he </v>

54
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.310
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

55
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.220
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to be evacuated to be taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>out off Playa with Black Hawks and heavy</v>

56
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>duty helicopters because he had just </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back from the Asian tsunami,</v>

57
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the event.</v>

58
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.800
<v Speaker 1>And then he went straight to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Afghanistan and then he went to </v>

59
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Baghdad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he came to burning man.</v>

60
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I looked at this man's face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like lying deeply,</v>

61
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just unbelievable stress.</v>

62
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine this was his job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He works under title 10 money,</v>

63
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>doing extreme comms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme emergency relief efforts.</v>

64
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.430
<v Speaker 1>And he's invented all this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cell phones that come down on </v>

65
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>parachutes that'll run for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people pick up these cell phones and</v>

66
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:48.841
<v Speaker 1>push a button and there's somebody who </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaks tagalog the right on right there </v>

67
00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you need?</v>

68
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>What are your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your position in that?</v>

69
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

70
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cell phones run for a month.</v>

71
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.900
<v Speaker 1>They're like in rubberized cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy has invented all this </v>

72
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.900
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this rubber Rebecca</v>

73
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.090
<v Speaker 2>case just has a massive battery in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sentence</v>

74
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 1>recharged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

75
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy is really thinking.</v>

76
00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:11.301
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we have a natural disaster </v>

77
00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:11.301
<v Speaker 1>happening in our own country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

78
00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:15.410
<v Speaker 1>barreling in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody at burning man knows about it </v>

79
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.640
<v Speaker 1>because there's no cell phone service </v>
<v Speaker 1>fan back in 2007.</v>

80
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.150
<v Speaker 1>It's barreling in and 2005 rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we watch it coming in.</v>

81
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Now the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amazing thing is we,</v>

82
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 1>we saw you could watch a video for more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on this screen,</v>

83
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:36.051
<v Speaker 1>on this guy screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could watch people walking down </v>

84
00:04:36.051 --> 00:04:39.780
<v Speaker 1>like we saw levy breach the first levy </v>
<v Speaker 1>breach in the ninth ward or something.</v>

85
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.230
<v Speaker 1>We saw that on the screen from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from our camp at burning man.</v>

86
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
<v Speaker 2>So when you say you took over </v>
<v Speaker 2>satellites,</v>

87
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 2>satellites that are broadcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

88
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Broadcasting media like news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fresno,</v>

89
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 2>high risk reconnaissance imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

90
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 2>So it's a satellite that is like one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those spying on bad guy satellites.</v>

91
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

92
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't eat.</v>

93
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can talk about this.</v>

94
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone finds out about that,</v>

95
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 2>is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this an issue?</v>

96
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's something that would be </v>

97
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:15.840
<v Speaker 2>really frowned upon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the,</v>

98
00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 2>the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the iridium phone kept ringing.</v>

99
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like your dad's call and you're </v>

100
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.000
<v Speaker 2>having a party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The neighbors are calling your dad </v>

101
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.000
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

102
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what your son's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

103
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.750
<v Speaker 2>the lights are on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a million people on your front </v>

104
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.750
<v Speaker 2>lawn and the phone just keeps ringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

105
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.750
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

106
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.850
<v Speaker 1>but these guys knew who they're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

107
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:37.851
<v Speaker 1>This is this innovative genius type guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is totally respected and </v>

108
00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:42.650
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the general that initiated the </v>

109
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.370
<v Speaker 1>inquiry was covering for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

110
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the general could then contact space </v>

111
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.440
<v Speaker 1>command and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get any of.</v>

112
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

113
00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

114
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.680
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had put the satellite in some kind of</v>

115
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.090
<v Speaker 2>a failsafe fallback mode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they would spend the several days </v>

116
00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.670
<v Speaker 2>trying to get back into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

117
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.190
<v Speaker 2>He was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we kept passing it and keeping them out </v>

118
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 2>and burn hydrazine and locate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

119
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 2>stuff on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Playa.</v>

120
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tell me all the details,</v>

121
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 2>but he's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you know,</v>

122
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

123
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 2>what kind of satellite Internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection was available in 2005.</v>

124
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:22.330
<v Speaker 2>It was a very small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow upward,</v>

125
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 2>a little bit quicker download,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still pretty whack.</v>

126
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By that time you have the next year I </v>

127
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 2>think they got the big tower on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plier which had the dish.</v>

128
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 2>They went right to gurlack with </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] three connection.</v>

129
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 2>But what does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

130
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 2>What'd you just sick of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really fast.</v>

131
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.580
<v Speaker 2>A sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a radar less.</v>

132
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 2>What is girl girl?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

133
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:42.060
<v Speaker 2>you haven't been out there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah No.</v>

134
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love hippies in small doses.</v>

135
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Hippies to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like pizza.</v>

136
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.940
<v Speaker 2>We just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't eat pizza every day for like a </v>

137
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.210
<v Speaker 2>month I was with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can hang around ply a gun </v>

138
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Pentagon people and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could probably hang around your camp.</v>

139
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Went out there with and they're dirty </v>
<v Speaker 2>people with Sherpas,</v>

140
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Sherpas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sherpas,</v>

141
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Sherpas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're white people,</v>

143
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.510
<v Speaker 2>White Sherpas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>servers for the billionaires and they're</v>

144
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 2>billionaire camps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's too much.</v>

145
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.720
<v Speaker 2>And they have walls of motor homes or I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to hang out with 100,000</v>

146
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.080
<v Speaker 2>air camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hang out with ability of</v>

147
00:07:16.081 --> 00:07:21.081
<v Speaker 2>Eric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to hang out with people who </v>

148
00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:21.590

<v Speaker 2>everybody's clean.</v>

149

<v Speaker 2>But I don't need Sherpas will come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I.</v>

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 2>here's a secret that I'll tell you on </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

151
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh well it won't be a secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A secret.</v>

152
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.200
<v Speaker 2>My of my mit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Dennis hasn't been to burning man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I told him that.</v>

157
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell you that Dennis would only go to</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

159
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 2>did you do it the opposite way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's against each other.</v>

160
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:47.320
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.830
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't work with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but thanks.</v>

162
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.150
<v Speaker 2>That's sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would go anywhere with him though,</v>

163
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.480
<v Speaker 2>anywhere with Dennis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really would go with him just to talk </v>

164
00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:58.480
<v Speaker 2>to them for days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

165
00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

166
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 2>he's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world's most amazing teddy bear.</v>

167
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's uh,</v>

168
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.880
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He explained the stoned ape theory in a </v>

169
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.961
<v Speaker 2>way that I've never heard anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>explain before with science and the way </v>

170
00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:13.910
<v Speaker 2>that psilocybin interacts with the human</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind in a way was like,</v>

171
00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

172
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:17.000
<v Speaker 2>that had to be a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

173
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:20.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's many factors that led </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the increase in human brain size,</v>

174
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:22.260
<v Speaker 2>but when he describes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

175
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.310
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking mushrooms has to be.</v>

176
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.540
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were at a meeting,</v>

177
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.200
<v Speaker 2>an event yesterday where all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>silicide when research was being </v>

178
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.171
<v Speaker 2>presented by the Johns Hopkins teams and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ucla and Madison thinks these people are</v>

179
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:42.130
<v Speaker 2>doing silicide funded research to for </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking cessation,</v>

180
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.950
<v Speaker 2>end of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reduction of anxiety and ptsd.</v>

181
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 2>And this one young researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>

182
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:56.141
<v Speaker 2>that we talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he basically said this amazing thing </v>

183
00:08:56.141 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not</v>

184
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.730
<v Speaker 1>plugging up neurotransmitter portals to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with addiction here.</v>

185
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.550
<v Speaker 1>We seem to be hitting higher order brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>functions much higher rather than </v>

186
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.860
<v Speaker 1>plugging up your desire for nicotine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're when we watched the FMRS,</v>

187
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.930
<v Speaker 1>when we put people under the magnet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means put them in an Fmri try </v>

188
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 1>realtime brain scanning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We watched this,</v>

189
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 1>the parts of the brain talking to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other like the default mode network </v>

190
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:25.410
<v Speaker 1>seems to be changed</v>

191
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.630
<v Speaker 3>and is this while you're under while </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're on mushrooms.</v>

192
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:34.010
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have to think that suicide </v>

193
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 3>suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the thing that would radically </v>

194
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.570
<v Speaker 3>affect your experience because it an Mri</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Fmri.</v>

195
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.360
<v Speaker 3>Similar because I've been an MRI before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like bang,</v>

196
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

197
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang.</v>

198
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.480
<v Speaker 3>If I was on mushrooms and I was in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mri,</v>

199
00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 3>I would freak the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

200
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:54.040
<v Speaker 3>I've never been in a functional Mri.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been in Mr and Oh,</v>

201
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 3>I was in one less than a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>

202
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:02.470
<v Speaker 3>an issue with my back and I had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bulging disc in my back,</v>

203
00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:06.850
<v Speaker 3>so I had to get an examined by an MRI </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you lie down on a plank,</v>

204
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:12.180
<v Speaker 3>like a little skinny little gurney thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they roll you into this tube machine</v>

205
00:10:12.641 --> 00:10:17.641
<v Speaker 3>that's a giant magnet and all I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of some story that I had heard </v>

206
00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:21.271
<v Speaker 3>about some kid who died because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>left a fire extinguisher in the room and</v>

207
00:10:21.711 --> 00:10:26.711
<v Speaker 3>then turned on the Mri and it sucked the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fire extinguisher into the bag and </v>

208
00:10:27.041 --> 00:10:31.300
<v Speaker 3>killed one freak incident out of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>billion usage.</v>

209
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.750
<v Speaker 3>It was like a torpedo that killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>

210
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very claustrophobic and </v>

211
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.391
<v Speaker 3>strange experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You roll into this thing and just lay </v>

212
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:43.170
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't move and you can't bang,</v>

213
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:43.950
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

214
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.700
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

215
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.100
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

216
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.110
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kick around your head.</v>

217
00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.150
<v Speaker 3>It's all just echoing around you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

218
00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:57.151
<v Speaker 3>you get earplugs put ear plugs on and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you close your eyes and just deal with </v>

219
00:10:57.151 --> 00:11:00.271
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would imagine that tripping on </v>

220
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:02.491
<v Speaker 3>that would be incredibly strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would think if for MRI is very </v>

221
00:11:02.591 --> 00:11:07.120
<v Speaker 3>similar to its functional Mri,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's the same machine,</v>

222
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.080
<v Speaker 3>that would mean the old adage is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

223
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.310
<v Speaker 3>five grams and silent darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

224
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.320
<v Speaker 3>That's what terence always described her</v>
<v Speaker 3>as kind of prescribed or buddy this is </v>

225
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.420
<v Speaker 3>like the opposite of five grams and </v>
<v Speaker 3>silent dark desks</v>

226
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:25.070
<v Speaker 1>like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe they've got it down to a </v>

227
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:25.070
<v Speaker 1>baseball cap now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

228
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they do.</v>

229
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.040
<v Speaker 3>I've had two Mris actually in the past </v>
<v Speaker 3>year and a half,</v>

230
00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:30.000
<v Speaker 3>so I'm pretty sure</v>

231
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:35.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe by the 2015 will all be like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a theory that I have of where it all </v>

232
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.420
<v Speaker 1>this is going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I can</v>

233
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.710
<v Speaker 3>revealed to you later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

234
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.820
<v Speaker 3>excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm absolutely interested.</v>

235
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.120
<v Speaker 3>But what all I was thinking was that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole experience of siliciden depends </v>

236
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.740
<v Speaker 3>very much so on where you're at while </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're experiencing it.</v>

237
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.860
<v Speaker 3>If you're in a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>peaceful place,</v>

238
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:54.150
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

239
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:59.450
<v Speaker 2>the colors are brighter and you see like</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of cool visions and you have </v>

240
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.280
<v Speaker 2>this connection to nature where you feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're grounded and.</v>

241
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.620
<v Speaker 2>But if you were in like some horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>place and you were on suicide and you </v>

242
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.350
<v Speaker 2>would be very sensitive to that horrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

243
00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:13.351
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine like doing psilocybin</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going to like a war zone and </v>

244
00:12:13.351 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 2>experiencing war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

245
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:17.110
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything else horrible like the gym.</v>

246
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.880
<v Speaker 2>What was the movie that depicted the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam fats?</v>

247
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

248
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Was that a Jacob's ladder?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

249
00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:29.670
<v Speaker 2>the ones where they got high in Vietnam </v>
<v Speaker 2>on all said.</v>

250
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what movie?</v>

251
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.730
<v Speaker 2>One movie A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Apocalypse now.</v>

252
00:12:33.731 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 2>Apocalypse now weren't an acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

253
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:37.950
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martin Sheen was on acid when he punched</v>

254
00:12:37.951 --> 00:12:40.930
<v Speaker 2>him when he did karate and his hotel </v>
<v Speaker 2>room and punch the mayor.</v>

255
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 2>I know there's another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a video of British soldiers on </v>

256
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 2>acid and the fifties.</v>

257
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.670
<v Speaker 2>You remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're all thing and they can't be </v>

258
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.401
<v Speaker 2>made to fear the enemy or put fear into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the enemy or be a part of any </v>

259
00:12:53.401 --> 00:12:57.700
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what the British army was about</v>

260
00:12:57.701 --> 00:12:58.500
<v Speaker 2>to become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

261
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful video.</v>

262
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:05.790
<v Speaker 2>I love that video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was peace and love before the </v>

263
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Beatles even got rolling and 59,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

264
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

265
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:12.841
<v Speaker 2>it shows you also what a incredible like</v>
<v Speaker 2>transformative drug that isn't really </v>

266
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.650
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all psychedelics have that capacity,</v>

267
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.050
<v Speaker 2>so incredibly transformative capacity </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're here,</v>

268
00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:23.800
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with people whose job is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill folks.</v>

269
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what their job is and what are </v>
<v Speaker 2>they doing?</v>

270
00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:31.540
<v Speaker 2>They're giggling and they're falling </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and they're not thinking about war.</v>

271
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:32.980
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

272
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.880
<v Speaker 2>they think everything's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

273
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.960
<v Speaker 2>And it's just amazing when you look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the transformation in our culture from </v>

274
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:45.460
<v Speaker 2>the 1950 [inaudible] to 1970 when </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was clamped down on.</v>

275
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:50.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a radical couple of decades of </v>

276
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:50.850
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

277
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.691
<v Speaker 2>people don't realize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I trying to explain to people </v>

278
00:13:54.691 --> 00:13:56.200
<v Speaker 2>that if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a technology historian,</v>

279
00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:58.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the Dog Barn Computer Museum,</v>

280
00:13:58.061 --> 00:14:03.061
<v Speaker 2>I've got like 30 tons of vintage </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer hardware in the barn and I've </v>

281
00:14:03.061 --> 00:14:05.440
<v Speaker 2>interviewed a thousand people on how did</v>
<v Speaker 2>this all happen?</v>

282
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:10.470
<v Speaker 2>How did the Arpanet get made?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How to apple found and all that sort of </v>

283
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.741
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that the years between 1945 and </v>

284
00:14:13.741 --> 00:14:14.260
<v Speaker 2>1970,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

285
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.210
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the change that happened.</v>

286
00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>

287
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:21.910
<v Speaker 2>And really if you drive into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood like even around here,</v>

288
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.720
<v Speaker 2>San Fernando valley houses built in like</v>
<v Speaker 2>1962.</v>

289
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.040
<v Speaker 2>The only difference in technology is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's ether net,</v>

290
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.470
<v Speaker 2>like there's an internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a network and there's computers.</v>

291
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:37.750
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise House of 1970,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had microwave ovens and a cable TV in</v>

292
00:14:38.141 --> 00:14:39.470
<v Speaker 2>the beginning and all that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

293
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot of difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the digital tech.</v>

294
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.810
<v Speaker 2>That's the only really big thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>come in and that model has now spread to</v>

295
00:14:46.811 --> 00:14:50.230
<v Speaker 2>the whole planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So China did it in shorter time,</v>

296
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:55.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I lived in Czechoslovakia and they </v>

297
00:14:55.231 --> 00:14:55.231
<v Speaker 2>did the whole transition in like eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

298
00:14:55.231 --> 00:14:56.990
<v Speaker 2>This incredible South Africans at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition,</v>

299
00:14:56.991 --> 00:15:01.580
<v Speaker 2>like 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just boom to our model shopping center,</v>

300
00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>off ramp,</v>

301
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wired into the Matrix,</v>

302
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consumer culture,</v>

303
00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Boone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole world just went bang,</v>

304
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:10.400
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

305
00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

306
00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 2>adopting that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange time,</v>

307
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.600
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

308
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's rushing to that model.</v>

309
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:17.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

310
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.430
<v Speaker 2>no stopping it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

311
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.710
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's tied into it now too,</v>

312
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:23.390
<v Speaker 2>which is really spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

313
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:28.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm absolutely fascinated by ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures,</v>

314
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.580
<v Speaker 2>by the idea that there were great </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations that fell apart and like </v>

315
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.810
<v Speaker 2>what caused it wasn't natural disaster </v>
<v Speaker 2>was at this,</v>

316
00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:36.380
<v Speaker 2>was that.</v>

317
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.480
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at grain ham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Graham Hancock on last month,</v>

318
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Speaker 2>I've had grandma a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's awesome.</v>

319
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.640
<v Speaker 2>And I've also had Randall Carlson on </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's also really enlightening when it </v>

320
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 2>comes to that subject because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>true expert in cataclysmic disasters.</v>

321
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Particularly the comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the putative comment impairment that </v>

322
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.920
<v Speaker 2>created all that flooding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

323
00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 2>one of his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>

324
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.600
<v Speaker 2>he's an expert on pretty much every </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant traceable impact and it's </v>

325
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:10.220
<v Speaker 2>really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can drive his suv and read land.</v>

326
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:15.221
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can sort of read the teaching him </v>

327
00:16:15.221 --> 00:16:15.221
<v Speaker 2>about what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

328
00:16:15.221 --> 00:16:18.140
<v Speaker 2>he'll show you some things on satellite </v>
<v Speaker 2>images that if you looked at it,</v>

329
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.550
<v Speaker 2>you would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

330
00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:22.910
<v Speaker 2>that's just some hills and heal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the way he described it,</v>

331
00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:24.050
<v Speaker 2>he'll draw it out for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

332
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:29.230
<v Speaker 2>here's where the crater is and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the craters in the middle of this </v>

333
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 2>ocean and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this part of the ocean.</v>

334
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:34.870
<v Speaker 2>And if you follow that crater out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize these are where the waves </v>

335
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.351
<v Speaker 2>hit toward the landscape apart like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at a gigantic version of </v>

336
00:16:38.451 --> 00:16:43.451
<v Speaker 2>what you see when you see the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave marks on the sand when high tide </v>

337
00:16:43.521 --> 00:16:48.521
<v Speaker 2>comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're seeing this unbelievably </v>

338
00:16:48.521 --> 00:16:49.820
<v Speaker 2>extreme version of it that probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened instantaneously.</v>

339
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
<v Speaker 2>You remember Jerry personnel and Larry </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nibins Scifi classic Lucifer's Hammer.</v>

340
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fantastic.</v>

341
00:16:56.991 --> 00:17:01.400
<v Speaker 2>It was about a comment impact on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pacific and the scene.</v>

342
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:06.780
<v Speaker 2>These are master Saifai writers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both live in here in the San </v>

343
00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Fernando Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this wave was a 1200 feet tall and </v>

344
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:15.011
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They describe it coming across the </v>

345
00:17:15.011 --> 00:17:15.110
<v Speaker 2>southland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's this surfer now,</v>

346
00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:17.720
<v Speaker 2>the surfers out on Santa Monica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

347
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Decides to take this wave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what's happening before the wave </v>

348
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.240
<v Speaker 2>arrives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the ocean is roaring at hundred miles</v>

349
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.850
<v Speaker 2>an hour out toward the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy has been carried out,</v>

350
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 miles out to sea because it's wave is</v>

351
00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:37.190
<v Speaker 2>sucking down the coastline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he knows what is going on because he</v>

352
00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:40.370
<v Speaker 2>saw the fireball because I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>die anyway.</v>

353
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:45.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to take this wave and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a great scifi novel and he does </v>

354
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:50.441
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens is the wave comes </v>

355
00:17:50.441 --> 00:17:50.441
<v Speaker 2>across,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks down</v>

356
00:17:50.441 --> 00:17:55.400
<v Speaker 1>and he can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on the face of this wave is coming </v>

357
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.880
<v Speaker 1>across Los Angeles and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's looking down at the city,</v>

358
00:17:56.881 --> 00:18:01.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 800 feet below as this wave is </v>

359
00:18:01.881 --> 00:18:05.270
<v Speaker 1>because he has on the face of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's managing his board and then he </v>

360
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.160
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he looks up and the,</v>

361
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the language is great.</v>

362
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:09.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like in the first interstate </v>
<v Speaker 1>building,</v>

363
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.920
<v Speaker 1>hit like a flyswatter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

364
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy way to die in the wave </v>
<v Speaker 1>crashed.</v>

365
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:20.580
<v Speaker 1>It went inland to like a palm springs </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of indio.</v>

366
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.820
<v Speaker 1>That's where.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it created sort of Lucifer's hammer </v>

367
00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.360
<v Speaker 1>worth getting worth getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the reading.</v>

368
00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Niven and Jerry poor now are the </v>

369
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.750
<v Speaker 1>two great hardcore Saifai writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Larry told me about 15 years ago,</v>

370
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.230
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you something,</v>

371
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:46.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in my office when there was this </v>

372
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.401
<v Speaker 1>earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you've been in the south line long </v>

373
00:18:49.401 --> 00:18:49.401
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

374
00:18:49.401 --> 00:18:52.210
<v Speaker 1>There's this earthquakes every x amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time and they do a certain amount of </v>

375
00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:52.210
<v Speaker 1>damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like northridge was big,</v>

376
00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:55.710
<v Speaker 1>but before northridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry sit in his office at like eight in</v>

377
00:18:55.711 --> 00:19:00.711
<v Speaker 1>the morning and an earthquake hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the whittier quake or </v>

378
00:19:00.711 --> 00:19:03.771
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last thing he remembers this a </v>

379
00:19:03.771 --> 00:19:03.870
<v Speaker 1>bookshelf coming right at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

380
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.560
<v Speaker 1>And he comes to and he is blacked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

381
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.190
<v Speaker 1>he's blacked out for a couple of hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

382
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:14.160
<v Speaker 1>And he has this vision comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sees a spine of books and one of them</v>

383
00:19:14.161 --> 00:19:19.161
<v Speaker 1>says Lucifer's hammer hardcover edition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he realizes I was almost killed by </v>

384
00:19:20.671 --> 00:19:23.970
<v Speaker 1>my life's work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

385
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.910
<v Speaker 1>And Lucifer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samara knocked him out.</v>

386
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he bolted the shelf to the wall for </v>

387
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.230
<v Speaker 1>the next one.</v>

388
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.540
<v Speaker 3>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bolting shelves.</v>

389
00:19:31.541 --> 00:19:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Always good move here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We started this off talking about,</v>

390
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being fascinated with ancient </v>

391
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.040
<v Speaker 3>civilizations and the fact that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>really like,</v>

392
00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:44.490
<v Speaker 3>we know quite a bit about ancient Egypt </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

393
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.160
<v Speaker 3>in sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at it,</v>

394
00:19:48.161 --> 00:19:52.330
<v Speaker 3>the fact that it's 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>plus BC and we know quite a bit.</v>

395
00:19:52.331 --> 00:19:57.331
<v Speaker 3>That's a long time ago and we have some </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty incredible structures are still </v>

396
00:19:57.331 --> 00:19:58.150
<v Speaker 3>remained from them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty amazing.</v>

397
00:19:58.151 --> 00:20:03.151
<v Speaker 3>But no writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean just hieroglyphs we don't have </v>

398
00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:06.061
<v Speaker 3>books for the library of Alexandria was </v>
<v Speaker 3>burned to the ground and who knows what </v>

399
00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:07.210
<v Speaker 3>was in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

400
00:20:07.211 --> 00:20:12.211
<v Speaker 3>there's so much lost when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient civilizations and one of the </v>

401
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:16.141
<v Speaker 3>things that I worry about is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving everything digital and </v>

402
00:20:16.141 --> 00:20:17.170
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even more than just digital.</v>

403
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:22.350
<v Speaker 3>People are storing things in the cloud </v>
<v Speaker 3>like crazy and that when we get a </v>

404
00:20:23.351 --> 00:20:25.120
<v Speaker 3>Lucifer's hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all gone.</v>

405
00:20:25.121 --> 00:20:30.121
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing is if we left behind </v>

406
00:20:30.121 --> 00:20:32.770
<v Speaker 3>some flash drives and some hard drives </v>
<v Speaker 3>in some old computers and stuff and then</v>

407
00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:38.550
<v Speaker 3>everybody else died except for like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few thousand people that live like </v>

408
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.400
<v Speaker 3>nomads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long would that stuff even make it?</v>

409
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.590
<v Speaker 3>How long would it take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd all be absorbed by the earth.</v>

410
00:20:41.591 --> 00:20:41.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

411
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:46.900
<v Speaker 1>You remember wally trying to get all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trash compacted and everything and he's </v>

412
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>choosing things that he would know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>volley</v>

413
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.310
<v Speaker 2>of the robot from the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Pixar movie and he's like,</v>

414
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.630
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep that.</v>

415
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's,</v>

416
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:58.140
<v Speaker 2>he's making a library apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he hit himself going skins of going </v>

417
00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:02.281
<v Speaker 2>for 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years this way and the shit he's </v>

418
00:21:02.281 --> 00:21:05.431
<v Speaker 2>throwing away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he does keep an ipod because it </v>

419
00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:05.680
<v Speaker 2>plays his favorite movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

420
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:07.780
<v Speaker 2>and he's able to rig it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a robot,</v>

421
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a little macintosh robot,</v>

422
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:10.920
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

423
00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.980
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to see the pixars </v>
<v Speaker 2>depiction of what is going to trash and </v>

424
00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.020
<v Speaker 2>when the earth is so toxic and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>covered with trash and the people have a</v>

425
00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.690
<v Speaker 2>VAT evacuating our living aboard a ship </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the earth detoxified.</v>

426
00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.620
<v Speaker 2>But we're sort of banking on the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that nothing happens when we have like </v>

427
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.230
<v Speaker 2>the Georgia guidestones which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>dubious.</v>

428
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.130
<v Speaker 2>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So key population to $500,000,</v>

429
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.200
<v Speaker 2>$500,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million worldwide or something like </v>

430
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.200
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

431
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.250
<v Speaker 2>it's like very interesting rules to live</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

432
00:21:39.251 --> 00:21:42.460
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't tell you anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to set up solar power,</v>

433
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the Internet,</v>

434
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.380
<v Speaker 2>how is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does it connect China to the UK,</v>

435
00:21:47.381 --> 00:21:48.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's none of that.</v>

436
00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.860
<v Speaker 2>So here's an interesting thing for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britton,</v>

437
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:56.100
<v Speaker 2>southern Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Rome fell right and the Romans </v>

438
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.720
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one was there to maintain lead pipes.</v>

439
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:03.990
<v Speaker 2>So the Romans invented fantastic bath </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems with lead pipes that that could </v>

440
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:06.250
<v Speaker 2>run cold water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot wire,</v>

441
00:22:06.251 --> 00:22:11.251
<v Speaker 2>that valves and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all this stuff went to potty and </v>

442
00:22:11.251 --> 00:22:15.121
<v Speaker 2>the roads went bluey and the Roman roads</v>
<v Speaker 2>were straight and they had these </v>

443
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.390
<v Speaker 2>mountains on either side that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have watchers and stuff like that.</v>

444
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.670
<v Speaker 2>And it was super high tech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

445
00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:24.670
<v Speaker 2>And then Roman went away and all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff just fell into ruin.</v>

446
00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:26.560
<v Speaker 2>And the British forgot how to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>bricks.</v>

447
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.620
<v Speaker 2>So there are no brick buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

448
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:33.660
<v Speaker 2>they had to go back to knocking out </v>
<v Speaker 2>stone to build the first Christian </v>

449
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.411
<v Speaker 2>churches in England were made out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they did not have brick </v>

450
00:22:37.411 --> 00:22:39.740
<v Speaker 2>technology gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the classic example of like,</v>

451
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.450
<v Speaker 2>what's going on right now is we have so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many things that we need.</v>

452
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a joke that I was doing about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how uh,</v>

453
00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:52.170
<v Speaker 2>what I thought happened with Egypt was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the dumb people just out fuck the </v>

454
00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:56.641
<v Speaker 2>smart people and left behind a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that didn't understand and that if </v>

455
00:22:56.641 --> 00:22:59.170
<v Speaker 2>I left you alone in the woods right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a hatchet,</v>

456
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.270
<v Speaker 2>how long before you could send me an </v>
<v Speaker 2>email,</v>

457
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

458
00:23:01.931 --> 00:23:04.990
<v Speaker 2>we have so much that we rely on on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>daily basis.</v>

459
00:23:04.991 --> 00:23:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might not understand it,</v>

460
00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:09.640
<v Speaker 2>but I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people that use it don't understand</v>

461
00:23:09.641 --> 00:23:11.920
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most terrifying TV shows I've</v>

462
00:23:11.921 --> 00:23:14.680
<v Speaker 2>ever seen about this as James Burke's </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections,</v>

463
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.700
<v Speaker 2>which came around 1980.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the first episode,</v>

464
00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:20.610
<v Speaker 2>what you see is this British guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

465
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.540
<v Speaker 2>he's a master presenter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

466
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:28.170
<v Speaker 2>And he's walking up to a screen door on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a farm and he's saying the electricity </v>

467
00:23:28.631 --> 00:23:30.640
<v Speaker 2>has been off for a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two weeks,</v>

468
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:31.660
<v Speaker 2>four weeks.</v>

469
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.050
<v Speaker 2>The people are starving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are trying to leave the city.</v>

470
00:23:35.051 --> 00:23:38.560
<v Speaker 2>You escape the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You managed to get to this farm.</v>

471
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.260
<v Speaker 2>The farm is abandoned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

472
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:46.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the places you could </v>

473
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:46.980
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are coming up to the door.</v>

474
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 2>The people are not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

475
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.530
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see this a milking machine,</v>

476
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:53.570
<v Speaker 2>you can't use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no electricity.</v>

477
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:59.200
<v Speaker 2>You see everything that you can't use to</v>
<v Speaker 2>farm even though you maybe you </v>

478
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 2>understand farming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but modern farming.</v>

479
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Then you go up into the attic of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>barn and you find a discarded plow from </v>

480
00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.220
<v Speaker 2>like the 19 tense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is your tool.</v>

481
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.910
<v Speaker 2>You have to know how to use that and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to put that onto animals,</v>

482
00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:16.850
<v Speaker 2>onto pulling draft animals to break the </v>
<v Speaker 2>soil.</v>

483
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.660
<v Speaker 2>You're now in the 11th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't master that plow,</v>

484
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:25.661
<v Speaker 2>if you can find that plow and know </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything there is to do about that </v>

485
00:24:25.661 --> 00:24:26.420
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're Outta luck.</v>

486
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:31.810
<v Speaker 2>Everything else is just trashed at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point and that would go away in a </v>

487
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:35.060
<v Speaker 2>thousand years if that was still left </v>
<v Speaker 2>around 10,000</v>

488
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:36.050
<v Speaker 2>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be nothing.</v>

489
00:24:36.051 --> 00:24:41.051
<v Speaker 2>No plows and knowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how much do you think happened like </v>

490
00:24:41.051 --> 00:24:42.140
<v Speaker 2>that with like ancient Egypt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

491
00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:47.141
<v Speaker 2>how much of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just whatever they built or whatever </v>

492
00:24:47.141 --> 00:24:47.480
<v Speaker 2>they designed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we were essentially,</v>

493
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.720
<v Speaker 2>we have fossil remanence of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

494
00:24:50.721 --> 00:24:54.860
<v Speaker 2>We have what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what survived and pottery form and stone</v>

495
00:24:54.861 --> 00:24:59.861
<v Speaker 2>form the papers all gone either burned </v>
<v Speaker 2>or destroyed or thrown in rivers or </v>

496
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:02.540
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very little.</v>

497
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

498
00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:09.230
<v Speaker 2>how much of what we have today would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>around in just like a thousand years.</v>

499
00:25:09.231 --> 00:25:11.380
<v Speaker 2>All the computers would be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cars would be gone.</v>

500
00:25:11.381 --> 00:25:13.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that great tv.</v>

501
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.300
<v Speaker 2>Was it on discovery or history or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>showed the earth after people are center</v>

502
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.690
<v Speaker 2>people and man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you knew watch Manhattan,</v>

503
00:25:20.691 --> 00:25:23.600
<v Speaker 2>you watch the at 500 years.</v>

504
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Brooklyn Bridge finally comes down </v>

505
00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:28.810
<v Speaker 2>because it's so well built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

506
00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case ons are all incredibly strongly</v>

507
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:36.641
<v Speaker 2>that the cable ties and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured it would take about 500 </v>

508
00:25:36.641 --> 00:25:38.120
<v Speaker 2>years for those cables to rush through </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the finally the decking,</v>

509
00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:41.720
<v Speaker 2>whatever's left of it to come down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing has nothing.</v>

510
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.400
<v Speaker 2>But that would be the last piece in New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York as this.</v>

511
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.990
<v Speaker 2>Their skeletal framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blackberry bushes would come back,</v>

512
00:25:47.991 --> 00:25:51.200
<v Speaker 2>the streams would come back in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal of Manhattan island,</v>

513
00:25:51.201 --> 00:25:52.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would just come back.</v>

514
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Deer would come back in and when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last things would be this,</v>

515
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:59.780
<v Speaker 2>this Brooklyn Bridge coming down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so crazy,</v>

516
00:25:59.781 --> 00:26:03.650
<v Speaker 2>but that totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean nothing.</v>

517
00:26:03.651 --> 00:26:05.570
<v Speaker 2>None of that stuff lasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to lie.</v>

518
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:07.490
<v Speaker 2>We don't build mean the pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that?</v>

519
00:26:07.491 --> 00:26:12.491
<v Speaker 2>The pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know this when we had this </v>

520
00:26:12.491 --> 00:26:15.850
<v Speaker 2>wonderful lecture by an Egyptologist </v>
<v Speaker 2>who've worked on the Giza plateau for </v>

521
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.871
<v Speaker 2>like 20 years and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've discovered so many things about </v>

522
00:26:19.871 --> 00:26:24.641
<v Speaker 2>the city of artisans and craftsmen teams</v>
<v Speaker 2>that built the pyramids by excavating </v>

523
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.610
<v Speaker 2>this massive area now that they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

524
00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:32.240
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we discovered as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pyramids were classed clad with polished</v>

525
00:26:32.241 --> 00:26:36.220
<v Speaker 2>limestone and they used it all to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cairo that chipped it all away.</v>

526
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.560
<v Speaker 2>It and you find this in vases in China </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this stuff was taken off the </v>

527
00:26:42.621 --> 00:26:43.430
<v Speaker 2>cladding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

528
00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:44.060
<v Speaker 2>The pyramids</v>

529
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 1>used to be shine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These to be like a prism,</v>

530
00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.010
<v Speaker 1>say blind you if you're coming at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain angle in the desert,</v>

531
00:26:50.011 --> 00:26:55.011
<v Speaker 1>in the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just this incredible shining </v>

532
00:26:55.011 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 1>pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine the power on the average</v>

533
00:26:55.801 --> 00:26:58.680
<v Speaker 1>nomads?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing that with a gold cap too.</v>

534
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.850
<v Speaker 1>There was a golden cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like our money,</v>

535
00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:05.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the little icon on the top.</v>

536
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

537
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:10.020
<v Speaker 1>And so people will rip the stuff off and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took it and it's all over the world</v>

538
00:27:10.021 --> 00:27:13.080
<v Speaker 1>and various holes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assholes ruin everything.</v>

539
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.550
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

540
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:19.551
<v Speaker 1>he showed us this initially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went to the Giza plateau in the </v>

541
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.760
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was part of some kind of a cult that </v>

542
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.881
<v Speaker 1>believes the parents were built by </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraterrestrials and he was literally </v>

543
00:27:28.881 --> 00:27:32.481
<v Speaker 1>in this cult and he went to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was sort of like sent there by the </v>

544
00:27:32.611 --> 00:27:37.611
<v Speaker 1>cult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got so interested in excavation and the </v>

545
00:27:37.611 --> 00:27:38.220
<v Speaker 1>reality of trying to really solve it.</v>

546
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.630
<v Speaker 1>He sort of left the cult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went back,</v>

547
00:27:39.631 --> 00:27:44.130
<v Speaker 1>got a phd and he's been working there </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 20 years and he gave us.</v>

548
00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

549
00:27:45.091 --> 00:27:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he showed us,</v>

550
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:52.510
<v Speaker 1>like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the Hollywood mythology of slaves </v>

551
00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:52.650
<v Speaker 1>building the pyramids and was all </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete.</v>

552
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.660
<v Speaker 1>You know who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

553
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:59.690
<v Speaker 1>here's the plan of the city of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>artisans and the construction teams and </v>

554
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:02.130
<v Speaker 1>the contractors that built a pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>central avenue,</v>

555
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:06.000
<v Speaker 1>big hospital complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best one in the ancient world,</v>

556
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:11.270
<v Speaker 1>huge bakery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bakery would make conical bread </v>

557
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.990
<v Speaker 1>loaves that the guys could put a rope </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

558
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:17.310
<v Speaker 1>throw over their backs and then go up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the job site and they ate the bread.</v>

559
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:23.030
<v Speaker 1>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kept cutting down through sand </v>

560
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.290
<v Speaker 1>through these clay layers that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that they shouldn't be there.</v>

561
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:26.000
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

562
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:29.850
<v Speaker 1>20 feet down and there's a layer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>clay.</v>

563
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:34.020
<v Speaker 1>They figured out the clay was from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarry up up the Amazon App,</v>

564
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.100
<v Speaker 1>denial rather no wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring going in the wrong place.</v>

565
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:39.330
<v Speaker 1>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

566
00:28:39.331 --> 00:28:44.331
<v Speaker 1>what on earth is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they started excavating </v>

567
00:28:44.331 --> 00:28:45.480
<v Speaker 1>horizontally and they found that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>were clay tracks.</v>

568
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.980
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

569
00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:49.350
<v Speaker 1>what on earth is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they started seeing these.</v>

570
00:28:49.351 --> 00:28:54.351
<v Speaker 1>These clay tracks matter a lot there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just leftover layers in the desert </v>

571
00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:59.540
<v Speaker 1>and then they map them out and there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole network of them and what they </v>

572
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.561
<v Speaker 1>were were low friction slipways and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they said they put the blocks on some </v>

573
00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:09.510
<v Speaker 1>kind of a canvas on some kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

574
00:29:09.511 --> 00:29:14.511
<v Speaker 1>They had mastered low friction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd figured out that clay and an a </v>

575
00:29:14.511 --> 00:29:19.011
<v Speaker 1>layer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a micro layer of water on it </v>

576
00:29:19.011 --> 00:29:21.510
<v Speaker 1>creates a hydraulic system that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>move massive tonnage on.</v>

577
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:27.020
<v Speaker 1>And so they built one of them using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same clay from the same quarry up the </v>

578
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Nile they made when they brought all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these Cairo University engineering </v>

579
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.761
<v Speaker 1>students out or probably mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering and they put like a </v>

580
00:29:34.761 --> 00:29:38.181
<v Speaker 1>multivitamin block on canvas on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>track and these guys pulled and they </v>

581
00:29:38.791 --> 00:29:42.290
<v Speaker 1>were able to get it up to some speed of </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 kilometers an hours.</v>

582
00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is how they move the volume of </v>

583
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:47.330
<v Speaker 1>the blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

584
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And it was probably started out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

585
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 1>they've been building pyramids for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand years before that.</v>

586
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:56.800
<v Speaker 1>And so there's the famous bending </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid that's like not collapsed,</v>

587
00:29:56.801 --> 00:30:01.801
<v Speaker 1>but about two because they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand foundation because you can't </v>

588
00:30:01.801 --> 00:30:04.240
<v Speaker 1>build a foundation for a pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on sand.</v>

589
00:30:04.241 --> 00:30:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Most of them were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the time of Giza,</v>

590
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:10.460
<v Speaker 1>they mastered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fill the area with water like you,</v>

591
00:30:10.461 --> 00:30:14.200
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you basically packs and down huge area,</v>

592
00:30:14.201 --> 00:30:16.990
<v Speaker 1>acres and acres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fill it with water.</v>

593
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.580
<v Speaker 1>And then the teams would go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would pack the sand up to the level</v>

594
00:30:21.581 --> 00:30:22.780
<v Speaker 1>of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water's flat.</v>

595
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:28.650
<v Speaker 1>And then when they started laying down </v>
<v Speaker 1>their sort of first case ons that would </v>

596
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.800
<v Speaker 1>evenly compressed the sands is the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is,</v>

597
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 1>is massive compressive strength evenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the area so that the thing will not</v>

598
00:30:35.321 --> 00:30:37.300
<v Speaker 1>abandon fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

599
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.780
<v Speaker 3>And they had to do it so accurately that</v>
<v Speaker 3>over 2 million,</v>

600
00:30:40.781 --> 00:30:45.781
<v Speaker 3>500,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>blocks or could be like such little </v>

601
00:30:45.781 --> 00:30:47.830
<v Speaker 3>deviation to line up at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's so incredible.</v>

602
00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.130
<v Speaker 1>They learned that these guys had </v>
<v Speaker 1>mastered a whole field,</v>

603
00:30:51.131 --> 00:30:53.750
<v Speaker 1>which we lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we didn't even know exist.</v>

604
00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:58.751
<v Speaker 1>It's sand hydraulics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these guys were literally using </v>

605
00:30:58.751 --> 00:31:01.720
<v Speaker 1>hydraulic sand is a flowing things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

606
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an hour glass,</v>

607
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:07.660
<v Speaker 1>it looks like water flowing down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's sand and so to,</v>

608
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.090
<v Speaker 1>to set keystones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have a column,</v>

609
00:31:10.091 --> 00:31:15.091
<v Speaker 1>a sand get the keystone to the top and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would pull plugs out and the sand </v>

610
00:31:15.251 --> 00:31:20.251
<v Speaker 1>would come down and it would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The keystone would come down absolutely </v>

611
00:31:20.251 --> 00:31:23.851
<v Speaker 1>perfectly in the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Hydraulics sound foundations,</v>

612
00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:27.670
<v Speaker 1>clay for slipways smart dudes.</v>

613
00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:32.200
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it amazing when you say what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>said a thousand years like they had been</v>

614
00:31:32.201 --> 00:31:36.370
<v Speaker 3>making pyramids for a thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can barely comprehend what a thousand</v>

615
00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:41.370
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A thousand years to us is like if you </v>

616
00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:43.831
<v Speaker 3>want to go back to 1014,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we even like Genghis Khan Times for </v>

617
00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Speaker 3>him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course theater cathedrals took a </v>

618
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Speaker 3>thousand years to master.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

619
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.290
<v Speaker 3>So think about the fact that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that,</v>

620
00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 3>making these things for a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

621
00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:58.750
<v Speaker 3>And even though as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have electronics,</v>

622
00:31:58.751 --> 00:32:01.570
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have any of these things.</v>

623
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.690
<v Speaker 3>They still have the human mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human mind,</v>

624
00:32:04.691 --> 00:32:07.290
<v Speaker 3>without electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without engine,</v>

625
00:32:07.291 --> 00:32:12.090
<v Speaker 3>the contemplate of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they had a culture that supported it</v>

626
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.290
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also had this incredible connection</v>

627
00:32:14.291 --> 00:32:19.291
<v Speaker 3>with the cosmos because of the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't dealing with light </v>

628
00:32:19.291 --> 00:32:22.111
<v Speaker 3>pollution like we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've done a really weird thing in our </v>

629
00:32:22.111 --> 00:32:22.180
<v Speaker 3>arrogance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

630
00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:27.181
<v Speaker 3>it's not arrogant that we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did it out of innovation that have </v>

631
00:32:27.181 --> 00:32:30.640
<v Speaker 3>this burning desire to continually </v>
<v Speaker 3>create new and better things.</v>

632
00:32:30.641 --> 00:32:35.641
<v Speaker 3>But our cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the giant population centers </v>

633
00:32:35.641 --> 00:32:39.720
<v Speaker 3>we've ascended essentially cut off our </v>
<v Speaker 3>view of the cosmos almost entirely is </v>

634
00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:39.900
<v Speaker 3>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dan didn't,</v>

635
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

636
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.310
<v Speaker 2>they were entirely invested in not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cosmos,</v>

637
00:32:43.311 --> 00:32:45.680
<v Speaker 2>but there are positions in the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

638
00:32:45.681 --> 00:32:48.890
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the astrological charts and where things</v>

639
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:53.891
<v Speaker 2>lined up and where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shafts in the great pyramid that </v>

640
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 2>would lead to various constellation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then the lay lines of Europe.</v>

641
00:32:57.411 --> 00:33:02.411
<v Speaker 2>And then incredible Denison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I in August for rent running around </v>

642
00:33:02.411 --> 00:33:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Macha Picchu and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to find the observatory.</v>

643
00:33:05.361 --> 00:33:08.900
<v Speaker 2>We've got to find the observatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he knows this place pretty well.</v>

644
00:33:08.901 --> 00:33:13.901
<v Speaker 2>I had a wonderful tour of it from him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we found it and it has this rock </v>

645
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:19.030
<v Speaker 2>that has all these angled pieces in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a star map or a big,</v>

646
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.400
<v Speaker 2>big rock multi-tone rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's carved.</v>

647
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:27.640
<v Speaker 2>So if you look this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna you're gonna position on </v>

648
00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.311
<v Speaker 2>this star and position on that star and </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the and it had a sort of a portal at</v>

649
00:33:30.681 --> 00:33:34.160
<v Speaker 2>the top and this is what's remaining of </v>
<v Speaker 2>much peaches observatory.</v>

650
00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:39.820
<v Speaker 2>So it's like all these people have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge gap as long as people stay </v>

651
00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.310
<v Speaker 2>alive and they keep innovating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

652
00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:46.010
<v Speaker 2>they do it differently than we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>currently experiencing it right now,</v>

653
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.830
<v Speaker 2>but they figured out a way to do it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some really intense,</v>

654
00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.500
<v Speaker 2>very sophisticated way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you compare,</v>

655
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.190
<v Speaker 2>what does that Jamie the observatory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it?</v>

656
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:56.300
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

657
00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.530
<v Speaker 2>that looks like and the thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

658
00:34:00.531 --> 00:34:05.531
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like at least a thousand years </v>

659
00:34:05.531 --> 00:34:05.531
<v Speaker 2>ago that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifteen hundred.</v>

660
00:34:05.531 --> 00:34:05.940
<v Speaker 2>1,400.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

661
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.340
<v Speaker 2>So less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less.</v>

662
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

663
00:34:08.661 --> 00:34:13.661
<v Speaker 2>the Inca complexes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis and I and our group are running </v>

664
00:34:13.661 --> 00:34:16.811
<v Speaker 2>around a lot of income complexes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including peace sack and the other </v>

665
00:34:16.811 --> 00:34:16.811
<v Speaker 2>places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

666
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:20.330
<v Speaker 2>those dudes knew how to cut rock so </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly.</v>

667
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you know how they did that,</v>

668
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not known.</v>

669
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:27.290
<v Speaker 2>They could have used ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever watched ancient aliens?</v>

670
00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

671
00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:31.550
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen that it was alien.</v>

672
00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Everything's dealings I've ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>that show.</v>

673
00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:35.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm a born skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Canadian,</v>

674
00:34:35.661 --> 00:34:38.160
<v Speaker 2>so a more skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

675
00:34:38.161 --> 00:34:39.860
<v Speaker 2>much more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less religious.</v>

676
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:45.030
<v Speaker 2>So where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a basically armchair views of </v>

677
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:49.301
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up watching all Canadians who </v>

678
00:34:49.381 --> 00:34:54.381
<v Speaker 2>have watch America with exhilaration and</v>
<v Speaker 2>horror and admiration of your porch from</v>

679
00:34:55.301 --> 00:34:56.210
<v Speaker 2>our porch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

680
00:34:56.211 --> 00:35:01.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say there's a joke about North </v>

681
00:35:01.211 --> 00:35:01.211
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

682
00:35:01.211 --> 00:35:05.270
<v Speaker 2>there's a three story apartment block in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle apartment is this out of </v>

683
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:08.600
<v Speaker 2>control fricking party and beer bottles </v>
<v Speaker 2>and crapping thrown.</v>

684
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:12.800
<v Speaker 2>That's America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the bottom is Mexico and all the beer</v>

685
00:35:12.801 --> 00:35:15.530
<v Speaker 2>bottles in the crap are falling on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment.</v>

686
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.670
<v Speaker 2>And up above is Canada and Canadians are</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaning over the balcony scene.</v>

687
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Can You keep it down a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's problem was Toronto has rob </v>

688
00:35:25.431 --> 00:35:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Ford.</v>

689
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto.</v>

690
00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:28.850
<v Speaker 2>And Arab for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's changing.</v>

691
00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:32.180
<v Speaker 2>You're getting more American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll soon be exported.</v>

692
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Thinks so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we should have him on the show.</v>

693
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I would have them on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

694
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I'd them high get an absolute crack </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>

695
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:44.930
<v Speaker 2>I would smoke crack with them just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get them to do it right here on the </v>

696
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:45.480
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one drug to get you in trouble.</v>

697
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.800
<v Speaker 2>You helped Graham break is fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he wanted to.</v>

698
00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.470
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kept talking about it and I'm like,</v>

699
00:35:52.471 --> 00:35:54.860
<v Speaker 2>you want to try it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept looking over your way.</v>

700
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was great though.</v>

701
00:35:57.421 --> 00:36:02.421
<v Speaker 2>He took a little baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit another little baby hit and then he </v>

702
00:36:02.421 --> 00:36:05.871
<v Speaker 2>was off to the races.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see it like the cannabinoids </v>

703
00:36:05.871 --> 00:36:08.700
<v Speaker 2>receptors firing and all the words </v>
<v Speaker 2>flowing hours in his eyes.</v>

704
00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:09.210
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

705
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.840
<v Speaker 2>He became like Terrence Well oiled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

706
00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's back to subject this.</v>

707
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:19.750
<v Speaker 2>It is amazing when you think of the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that these people did have these </v>

708
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:24.501
<v Speaker 2>incredibly sophisticated societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just don't recognize them as </v>

709
00:36:24.501 --> 00:36:28.731
<v Speaker 2>incredibly sophisticated because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have electricity because they </v>

710
00:36:28.731 --> 00:36:31.501
<v Speaker 2>didn't have the combustion engine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are are our benchmarks if you </v>

711
00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:31.920
<v Speaker 2>don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are dopes,</v>

712
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:37.190
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile the reality is they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>some stuff that we still are perplexed </v>

713
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:41.691
<v Speaker 2>by some structures that have taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades upon decades of some of the </v>

714
00:36:42.001 --> 00:36:43.950
<v Speaker 2>greatest archeologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>geologists,</v>

715
00:36:43.951 --> 00:36:48.951
<v Speaker 2>and engineers to try to even get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory as to how they put these things </v>

716
00:36:49.411 --> 00:36:51.480
<v Speaker 2>together and that's all we've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

717
00:36:51.481 --> 00:36:56.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got some pretty good information </v>

718
00:36:56.481 --> 00:36:56.481
<v Speaker 2>on a lot of things like you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the sand hydraulics,</v>

719
00:36:56.481 --> 00:36:59.400
<v Speaker 2>but as far as like the ability to go out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and build one right now,</v>

720
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.520
<v Speaker 2>good fucking luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like it at one of these ruins so </v>

721
00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.080
<v Speaker 2>soon as the Spanish arrived in England </v>
<v Speaker 2>lands right?</v>

722
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.580
<v Speaker 2>What they did was have the inca knocked </v>
<v Speaker 2>down their own temples.</v>

723
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then those stones were carried down </v>

724
00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.420
<v Speaker 2>fucking white piano to build a Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 2>cathedrals.</v>

725
00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Then the next earthquake happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Catholic cathedral is were flattened</v>

726
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 2>and ink and complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're fine,</v>

727
00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:31.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's 12 to 14 degree angles </v>

728
00:37:31.011 --> 00:37:34.041
<v Speaker 2>on all the windows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's built to survive earthquakes for a </v>

729
00:37:34.041 --> 00:37:34.860
<v Speaker 2>thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

730
00:37:34.861 --> 00:37:39.210
<v Speaker 2>And the water channels that has been no </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintenance for 500 years,</v>

731
00:37:39.211 --> 00:37:44.211
<v Speaker 2>they're still pumping out billions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>gallons of water for all of these </v>

732
00:37:44.211 --> 00:37:44.370
<v Speaker 2>firearms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing,</v>

733
00:37:44.371 --> 00:37:49.080
<v Speaker 2>amazing and and I stood there in awe of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a 30 ton block.</v>

734
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.320
<v Speaker 2>You could see this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was above Cusco and this block was </v>

735
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:54.780
<v Speaker 2>carved like doop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doop,</v>

736
00:37:54.781 --> 00:37:56.720
<v Speaker 2>doop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doop and does that mean tube,</v>

737
00:37:56.721 --> 00:37:57.080
<v Speaker 2>tube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tube,</v>

738
00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:58.990
<v Speaker 2>tube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>angles,</v>

739
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:04.880
<v Speaker 2>angles but flat faces and then there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a block next to those was perfectly </v>

740
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.790
<v Speaker 2>matched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean no gaps.</v>

741
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.590
<v Speaker 2>And then the one down below I set the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stone.</v>

742
00:38:08.591 --> 00:38:13.591
<v Speaker 2>Mason stood and studied a pile of rocks </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in his head,</v>

743
00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.030
<v Speaker 2>because he was such a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>profound present engineer expert,</v>

744
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:23.180
<v Speaker 2>he saw the pattern of these rocks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how they could fit together with the </v>

745
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.600
<v Speaker 2>least amount of cutting and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfection.</v>

746
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.040
<v Speaker 2>These guys had this in their heads and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they could like bone.</v>

747
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.180
<v Speaker 2>I know cut that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take that one.</v>

748
00:38:30.181 --> 00:38:35.181
<v Speaker 2>That's going on the center and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to lift them and they had to cut </v>

749
00:38:35.181 --> 00:38:35.530
<v Speaker 2>them first and then lift them into </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

750
00:38:35.531 --> 00:38:39.160
<v Speaker 2>They had to be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy had three dimensional mental</v>

751
00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:44.161
<v Speaker 2>acuity that blows our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean any kind of world of warcraft </v>

752
00:38:44.161 --> 00:38:47.971
<v Speaker 2>player couldn't navigate that space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The three dimensional acuity of these </v>

753
00:38:47.971 --> 00:38:51.871
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet it really is incredible when you </v>

754
00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:55.060
<v Speaker 2>think of what has all been accomplished </v>
<v Speaker 2>long before people invented the Internet</v>

755
00:38:55.061 --> 00:39:00.061
<v Speaker 2>long before people were going to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>library to get their books on all this </v>

756
00:39:00.061 --> 00:39:00.061
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

757
00:39:00.061 --> 00:39:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

758
00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:02.710
<v Speaker 2>library of Alexandria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course right now,</v>

759
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's thought of as primitive,</v>

760
00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:11.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we still think of them as primitive and </v>

761
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:14.251
<v Speaker 2>when you compare the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the work of John Anthony West and Graham</v>

762
00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Hancock and Robert Schoch and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>geologists and people that are pointing </v>

763
00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:21.130
<v Speaker 2>to all these erosion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark's going,</v>

764
00:39:21.131 --> 00:39:26.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might be dealing with some really </v>

765
00:39:26.131 --> 00:39:27.760
<v Speaker 2>ancient civilization mixed in with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>other civilizations that are like,</v>

766
00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.430
<v Speaker 2>well everyone wants to date Egypt around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time,</v>

767
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.760
<v Speaker 2>but there's a growing movement of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are saying you're dealing with some</v>

768
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:36.440
<v Speaker 2>pretty significantly different </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures.</v>

769
00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:42.430
<v Speaker 2>I know Graham cat covered in your show </v>
<v Speaker 2>him your last show.</v>

770
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:47.490
<v Speaker 2>It was just fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousands of years of rainfall erosion </v>

771
00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:49.630
<v Speaker 2>in the last time there was rain fall in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nile Valley was 9,000</v>

772
00:39:49.631 --> 00:39:51.100
<v Speaker 2>BC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And did you know that?</v>

773
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.980
<v Speaker 2>When I was visiting the Sphinx about 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

774
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:59.340
<v Speaker 2>our guide said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you know that this thing has been </v>

775
00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.160
<v Speaker 2>for 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>

776
00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:05.460
<v Speaker 2>But in the last 15 it has been so </v>
<v Speaker 2>damaged by Cairo city sanitation </v>

777
00:40:06.131 --> 00:40:09.460
<v Speaker 2>department raising the water table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every he said,</v>

778
00:40:09.461 --> 00:40:14.461
<v Speaker 2>every toilet flushes in the city of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cairo is taking a chunk out of the </v>

779
00:40:14.461 --> 00:40:18.121
<v Speaker 2>interior of the Sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we are pumping in paraffin wax to </v>

780
00:40:18.121 --> 00:40:18.760
<v Speaker 2>keep from coming apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

781
00:40:18.761 --> 00:40:22.000
<v Speaker 2>look at the destructive power of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization,</v>

782
00:40:22.001 --> 00:40:27.001
<v Speaker 2>just haphazard and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the archeologists that gave us this </v>

783
00:40:27.001 --> 00:40:30.130
<v Speaker 2>tour of the Giza plateau,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excavation,</v>

784
00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:32.560
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

785
00:40:32.561 --> 00:40:37.561
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's modern Cairo coming up over top </v>

786
00:40:37.561 --> 00:40:40.441
<v Speaker 2>of our excavation site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can excavate under that notice the </v>

787
00:40:40.441 --> 00:40:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Warren of chaotic streets and bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>planning and pad everything.</v>

788
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:45.640
<v Speaker 2>And on top of this beautifully thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

789
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:51.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fully functional city of artisans and </v>

790
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.140
<v Speaker 2>construction people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How have we evolved?</v>

791
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:58.200
<v Speaker 2>Tell us the acef fascinating that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>really wacky city is over one of the </v>

792
00:41:00.461 --> 00:41:02.350
<v Speaker 2>greatest ancient cities ever.</v>

793
00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:06.650
<v Speaker 2>Like Kairos is another example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

794
00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:10.750
<v Speaker 2>So how are we evolving exactly while </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing something?</v>

795
00:41:10.751 --> 00:41:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Because the Mexico City during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aztecs,</v>

796
00:41:13.001 --> 00:41:15.430
<v Speaker 2>if they knew what we know now or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>incose,</v>

797
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:20.670
<v Speaker 2>they would have known the Cortez was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole and they were shot him and they </v>

798
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.130
<v Speaker 2>would have never thought he was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>warrior.</v>

799
00:41:21.131 --> 00:41:23.530
<v Speaker 2>That was part God on a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

800
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:28.550
<v Speaker 2>they would have not had any </v>
<v Speaker 2>misconceptions about him because they </v>

801
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.600
<v Speaker 2>would have known what a horse is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have had the internet.</v>

802
00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:32.770
<v Speaker 2>No one horseshit is horseshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

803
00:41:32.771 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 2>literally and figuratively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

804
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:37.190
<v Speaker 1>So here I want to propose you a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

805
00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:41.870
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of captivated me and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly woo and it's partly science,</v>

806
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:43.750
<v Speaker 1>but it'll really is my favorite stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fear.</v>

807
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Favorite stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like half,</v>

808
00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.880
<v Speaker 1>so half of woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

809
00:41:46.881 --> 00:41:50.350
<v Speaker 1>you got a t shirt that has the blue on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the front wheel on the backs of you turn</v>

810
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.470
<v Speaker 1>around your woo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

811
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:57.010
<v Speaker 1>So that the Eleusinian mysteries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know about the La one and mysteries.</v>

812
00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they ran for 1700,</v>

813
00:42:00.201 --> 00:42:01.670
<v Speaker 1>1800 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ran,</v>

814
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:06.970
<v Speaker 1>they started out before Greece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Greek civilization explain people </v>

815
00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:06.970
<v Speaker 1>what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it,</v>

816
00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:11.960
<v Speaker 1>what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a kind of like a burning man or </v>

817
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.430
<v Speaker 1>more serious than I'm burning man was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>initiation ceremony that happened at </v>

818
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:18.620
<v Speaker 1>elusive in Greece and it was run by </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

819
00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:21.380
<v Speaker 1>sort of high class women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were kind of a monopoly.</v>

820
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.860
<v Speaker 1>And when they finally got this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>cranked up,</v>

821
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.140
<v Speaker 1>because we don't know much about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier history,</v>

822
00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:30.890
<v Speaker 1>but you can go to the temple of a to </v>
<v Speaker 1>date was destroyed in the fourth century</v>

823
00:42:30.891 --> 00:42:33.470
<v Speaker 1>by characters that I want to bring up </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

824
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:39.100
<v Speaker 1>This is why we might be still in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture of the people destroyed </v>

825
00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:39.530
<v Speaker 1>ellipsis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they built this thing.</v>

826
00:42:39.531 --> 00:42:44.531
<v Speaker 1>So the fully powered appaloosas theme </v>
<v Speaker 1>park transformational experience was a </v>

827
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:52.030
<v Speaker 1>thousand person buried temple could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could house a thousand initiates buried </v>

828
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:54.410
<v Speaker 1>under the ground so the people couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see out.</v>

829
00:42:54.411 --> 00:42:56.480
<v Speaker 1>So they were totally in an internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

830
00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.210
<v Speaker 1>The initiates came from all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mediterranean.</v>

831
00:42:59.211 --> 00:43:02.150
<v Speaker 1>They included Roman emperors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers,</v>

832
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:07.570
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you had to go to a loose once in </v>

833
00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:08.570
<v Speaker 1>your life because the thought was you </v>
<v Speaker 1>then became a human being.</v>

834
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:12.320
<v Speaker 1>So they cAme off their boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they landed,</v>

835
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.020
<v Speaker 1>they wore the sink garb.</v>

836
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.590
<v Speaker 1>They had a fasting diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sound familiar?</v>

837
00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:22.440
<v Speaker 1>They say I had a fast ramadan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a.</v>

838
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:27.670
<v Speaker 1>What I would say today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like people who are doing </v>

839
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:30.371
<v Speaker 1>initiatory practice iowasca for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to mecca to see people </v>

840
00:43:30.371 --> 00:43:31.910
<v Speaker 1>wearing the same clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

841
00:43:31.911 --> 00:43:36.911
<v Speaker 1>bring them down and so the initiates </v>
<v Speaker 1>would walk through villages and the </v>

842
00:43:36.911 --> 00:43:41.651
<v Speaker 1>villages would come out and their job </v>
<v Speaker 1>was to cat call to to swear and bring </v>

843
00:43:42.801 --> 00:43:43.710
<v Speaker 1>the people down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

844
00:43:43.711 --> 00:43:44.990
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a big nose.</v>

845
00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:50.220
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if it's a noble person who was a lot </v>

846
00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:50.220
<v Speaker 1>of wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting screamed at by villagers</v>

847
00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.150
<v Speaker 1>and they get knocked back to la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock them there,</v>

848
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:57.160
<v Speaker 1>their ego out and and to dissolve them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically a boundary disillusion </v>

849
00:43:57.201 --> 00:44:02.201
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were walking next to fields which </v>

850
00:44:02.201 --> 00:44:03.470
<v Speaker 1>had wheat which had tiny mushroom like </v>
<v Speaker 1>purple.</v>

851
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a purple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a brain is shot today,</v>

852
00:44:06.951 --> 00:44:11.951
<v Speaker 1>but it was basically a rust that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow on the wheat that was used to make </v>

853
00:44:13.071 --> 00:44:18.071
<v Speaker 1>the chi keon drink that would be given </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the initiates after nine days or </v>

854
00:44:18.711 --> 00:44:20.540
<v Speaker 1>eight or eight or nine days.</v>

855
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.780
<v Speaker 1>So this was like some ergot based forgot</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis in there.</v>

856
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Gotta mean sort of an earth based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we know this?</v>

857
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Because I thought that was like a giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystery as to what they were taking.</v>

858
00:44:29.451 --> 00:44:34.451
<v Speaker 1>Like some folks thought that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide and some people felt it was an </v>

859
00:44:34.451 --> 00:44:34.451
<v Speaker 1>erg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got beer,</v>

860
00:44:34.451 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 1>there was some sort of an origami beer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

861
00:44:36.331 --> 00:44:41.331
<v Speaker 1>hoffman's book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talks about it apparently being in </v>

862
00:44:41.331 --> 00:44:43.941
<v Speaker 1>ercot beer of some sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was definitely an inefficient </v>

863
00:44:43.941 --> 00:44:48.620
<v Speaker 1>potion that was extremely powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what makes you think that it was </v>

864
00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:49.040
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

865
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.310
<v Speaker 1>because you can find this in the area of</v>
<v Speaker 1>alyssa's today.</v>

866
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:55.020
<v Speaker 1>You can find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm no expert.</v>

867
00:44:55.021 --> 00:44:56.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean you should have an expert on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

868
00:44:56.641 --> 00:44:59.400
<v Speaker 1>on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read a number of books about this,</v>

869
00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:01.710
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I pieced this together,</v>

870
00:45:01.711 --> 00:45:06.711
<v Speaker 1>so there's a fantastic book called </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelia by patrick lundberg that </v>

871
00:45:06.711 --> 00:45:07.620
<v Speaker 1>came out last year.</v>

872
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:12.620
<v Speaker 1>He paSsed away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately the author is quite a </v>

873
00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:13.620
<v Speaker 1>young man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the first chapter he details this</v>

874
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:17.220
<v Speaker 1>and what he says is the initiatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>would come in,</v>

875
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.090
<v Speaker 1>they would go into the temple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were on this fasting diet,</v>

876
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.930
<v Speaker 1>the temple of the people who are running</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temple.</v>

877
00:45:24.931 --> 00:45:29.931
<v Speaker 1>It was sound and music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all factory smoke color and they </v>

878
00:45:31.351 --> 00:45:35.250
<v Speaker 1>were driven to this intense state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they were given the kike ian.</v>

879
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:37.200
<v Speaker 1>And I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

880
00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:42.610
<v Speaker 1>a philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greek philosophers and others have </v>

881
00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:44.901
<v Speaker 1>written about their experience it </v>
<v Speaker 1>appaloosas and they would emerge a </v>

882
00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:49.320
<v Speaker 1>really an incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they got incredibly high,</v>

883
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:52.830
<v Speaker 1>maybe their boundaries or dissolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they emerged with visionary,</v>

884
00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming back with vision of what to do,</v>

885
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.500
<v Speaker 1>what to do in their world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when they,</v>

886
00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:01.710
<v Speaker 1>when they went home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they boarded their ships and whatnot and</v>

887
00:46:01.711 --> 00:46:02.190
<v Speaker 1>they went home.</v>

888
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:04.020
<v Speaker 1>And what did we see happening in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>period?</v>

889
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Greek theatre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics.</v>

890
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.980
<v Speaker 1>The academy road construction had </v>
<v Speaker 1>hydraulics,</v>

891
00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:16.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a city organizational </v>

892
00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:17.190
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the republic,</v>

893
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.310
<v Speaker 1>the idea of polity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of representation.</v>

894
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:25.680
<v Speaker 1>And the indian mystery school was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of many that were going on.</v>

895
00:46:25.681 --> 00:46:27.510
<v Speaker 1>But ellis was a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

896
00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Looses was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was destroyed partly in some periods and</v>

897
00:46:31.261 --> 00:46:33.360
<v Speaker 1>then a roman emperor would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would reboot it.</v>

898
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:35.040
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally,</v>

899
00:46:35.041 --> 00:46:40.041
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was the end of the fourth</v>
<v Speaker 1>century coming in from the north were </v>

900
00:46:40.041 --> 00:46:44.661
<v Speaker 1>sort of the savage germanic tribes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were basically taken out the whole </v>

901
00:46:44.661 --> 00:46:49.161
<v Speaker 1>western roman empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And guess who was coming in from The </v>

902
00:46:49.161 --> 00:46:51.660
<v Speaker 1>east black robed christians were </v>
<v Speaker 1>described as,</v>

903
00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:57.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cranky fellows with a real sort of </v>

904
00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:01.250
<v Speaker 1>obsessive perfectionist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reductionist kind of negative.</v>

905
00:47:01.771 --> 00:47:03.960
<v Speaker 1>They were described as really nasty </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>

906
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:08.040
<v Speaker 1>They formed this compact and together </v>
<v Speaker 1>they destroyed the temple.</v>

907
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.340
<v Speaker 1>That elusive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my woo woo theory is,</v>

908
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:16.380
<v Speaker 1>are we living in an inferior culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has no initiation,</v>

909
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:21.090
<v Speaker 1>replacing initiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful initiation with what you know,</v>

910
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.840
<v Speaker 1>all these other structures of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of abuse and usury,</v>

911
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.090
<v Speaker 1>church structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate structures,</v>

912
00:47:27.091 --> 00:47:30.930
<v Speaker 1>commercial structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we juvenile in?</v>

913
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Are we were we made juvenile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that we didn't have a </v>

914
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:39.841
<v Speaker 1>powerful initiatory experience at </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolved our boundaries that that </v>

915
00:47:39.841 --> 00:47:43.621
<v Speaker 1>opened us to vision that that made us </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings certainly think that's very</v>

916
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.240
<v Speaker 1>arguable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makeS a lot of sense.</v>

917
00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

918
00:47:47.021 --> 00:47:50.170
<v Speaker 1>if you compare our resources to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>

919
00:47:50.171 --> 00:47:53.380
<v Speaker 1>what we've accomplished and what we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to fuck up in comparison to what</v>

920
00:47:53.381 --> 00:47:58.381
<v Speaker 1>they managed to create with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>combustion engine with no hydraulics </v>

921
00:47:58.381 --> 00:48:02.491
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they had slave cultures and </v>

922
00:48:02.491 --> 00:48:02.491
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

923
00:48:02.491 --> 00:48:05.260
<v Speaker 1>here's the other thing and you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask graham when he's next on that.</v>

924
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear his response to this.</v>

925
00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:11.070
<v Speaker 1>What did you have before the rise of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization?</v>

926
00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Especial in The mediterranean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the upper paleolithic,</v>

927
00:48:14.951 --> 00:48:19.951
<v Speaker 1>you had village cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tribal cultures had quite a bit of </v>

928
00:48:19.951 --> 00:48:23.431
<v Speaker 1>conflict but quite a bit of advancement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was thousands and thousands of </v>

929
00:48:23.771 --> 00:48:28.771
<v Speaker 1>years and then suddenly and for sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had some kInd of initiatory </v>

930
00:48:28.871 --> 00:48:33.871
<v Speaker 1>experience for their youth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for young man because as we </v>

931
00:48:33.871 --> 00:48:33.940
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know in,</v>

932
00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:37.240
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

933
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:42.630
<v Speaker 1>in cultures of indigenous cultures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>still have an initiatory practice.</v>

934
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very important part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

935
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Having some very clear graduation </v>
<v Speaker 1>pRocess and we have it throughout </v>

936
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.270
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have it in grade school,</v>

937
00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.850
<v Speaker 1>we have it in martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts,</v>

938
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:01.900
<v Speaker 1>jujitsu and martial arts is where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing it back,</v>

939
00:49:01.901 --> 00:49:05.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strong initiation because you know,</v>

940
00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:09.340
<v Speaker 1>you probably see this because the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that haven't had that,</v>

941
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:14.170
<v Speaker 1>they think cruz a loss and they know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that have been very apparent,</v>

942
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:16.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pampered and helicopter parenting.</v>

943
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:21.330
<v Speaker 1>We all talk about thIs and they now </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the hoop jumping circus </v>

944
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:26.041
<v Speaker 1>train circus pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids that upper middle class parents </v>

945
00:49:26.041 --> 00:49:26.800
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump through this hoop,</v>

946
00:49:26.801 --> 00:49:28.060
<v Speaker 1>jump through this hoop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

947
00:49:28.061 --> 00:49:33.061
<v Speaker 1>there are three or four years old and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're jumping through these hoops </v>

948
00:49:33.061 --> 00:49:35.311
<v Speaker 1>because why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're being prepped to get </v>

949
00:49:35.311 --> 00:49:38.341
<v Speaker 1>into top level university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they jumped through all these </v>

950
00:49:38.341 --> 00:49:42.511
<v Speaker 1>hoops and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a professor at harvard written the book </v>

951
00:49:42.511 --> 00:49:45.391
<v Speaker 1>about all this and he said he's watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his incoming classes of these kids </v>

952
00:49:45.391 --> 00:49:47.320
<v Speaker 1>that are really good at achieving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals,</v>

953
00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:50.260
<v Speaker 1>but they can't deal with ambiguity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't deal With irony.</v>

954
00:49:50.261 --> 00:49:52.300
<v Speaker 1>They can deal with creatIvity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

955
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:54.340
<v Speaker 1>They just living outside of the box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

956
00:49:54.341 --> 00:49:56.350
<v Speaker 1>So they're gonna jump to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

957
00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.740
<v Speaker 1>the investment bank or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're not very functional,</v>

958
00:49:59.741 --> 00:50:04.741
<v Speaker 1>so because they've not had a practice of</v>
<v Speaker 1>initiation and if not have a leveling </v>

959
00:50:05.741 --> 00:50:07.690
<v Speaker 1>practice of boundary dissolving </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

960
00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:11.380
<v Speaker 1>They've been in this programmatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution and it's dangerous.</v>

961
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I think that there should be some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of graduation process for various stages</v>

962
00:50:16.451 --> 00:50:21.451
<v Speaker 1>in your life that sort of establish the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that you've learned from your </v>

963
00:50:21.451 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Speaker 1>mistakes you've grown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've achieved in,</v>

964
00:50:22.361 --> 00:50:27.361
<v Speaker 1>you've gotten through some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've overcome some adversity in your </v>

965
00:50:27.361 --> 00:50:30.421
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it through scouting and Canada </v>

966
00:50:30.421 --> 00:50:32.591
<v Speaker 1>because we had a total wilderness </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations where we have a bunch of us </v>

967
00:50:33.021 --> 00:50:35.090
<v Speaker 1>almost died a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

968
00:50:35.091 --> 00:50:40.091
<v Speaker 1>we are out in 45 bulleit below a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cracking cold january and we were in a </v>

969
00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:46.400
<v Speaker 1>snowshoe can hike with a 60 pounds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>birch bark vog logs in our backpacks to </v>

970
00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:51.230
<v Speaker 1>tough on ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just during no adults and we were</v>

971
00:50:51.231 --> 00:50:53.190
<v Speaker 1>climbing over a mountain range and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

972
00:50:53.191 --> 00:50:55.970
<v Speaker 1>the cold snap came in and I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

973
00:50:55.971 --> 00:50:57.890
<v Speaker 1>we're this close to hypothermic.</v>

974
00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Somebody dying in this group of like six</v>
<v Speaker 1>or eight of us or 14 years old,</v>

975
00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:08.021
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I went out to take a leak one </v>

976
00:51:08.021 --> 00:51:08.021
<v Speaker 1>night and you can imagine you're wearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>jeans.</v>

977
00:51:08.021 --> 00:51:08.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

978
00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:11.420
<v Speaker 1>we don't have proper clothes even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I took,</v>

979
00:51:11.421 --> 00:51:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I sat down on this rock and I took a </v>
<v Speaker 1>leak and then I came back,</v>

980
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:16.450
<v Speaker 1>pass him the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean my,</v>

981
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:21.490
<v Speaker 1>my piss was freezing on the way out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I realize it's a dead stallion is </v>

982
00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:24.860
<v Speaker 1>frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid wildhorse frozen solid,</v>

983
00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

984
00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:28.050
<v Speaker 1>And it was a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was there.</v>

985
00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:31.310
<v Speaker 1>I sat on it and we saw wolves and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were really skinny,</v>

986
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the distance.</v>

987
00:51:32.331 --> 00:51:35.540
<v Speaker 1>And we realIze we are really close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

988
00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:40.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody goes into hypothermic shock </v>

989
00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:40.910
<v Speaker 1>in that environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done,</v>

990
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another time we were hiking on the </v>

991
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.611
<v Speaker 1>west coast trail and vancouver island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We made a wrong turn and the whole </v>

992
00:51:48.611 --> 00:51:49.400
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found ourselves in this,</v>

993
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:52.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this rock outcropping with a tide coming</v>

994
00:51:52.881 --> 00:51:57.881
<v Speaker 1>in and storm surge and we had to cling </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto this thing all night and we </v>

995
00:51:57.881 --> 00:52:02.260
<v Speaker 1>couldn't set up any kind of camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like those were important </v>

996
00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:02.690
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

997
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.030
<v Speaker 3>rights of passage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>overcome adversity,</v>

998
00:52:05.031 --> 00:52:10.031
<v Speaker 3>all those different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they should probably be </v>

999
00:52:10.031 --> 00:52:10.031
<v Speaker 3>engineered into our cultures and our </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities.</v>

1000
00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.140
<v Speaker 3>I have a theory that goes along with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your theory.</v>

1001
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:17.440
<v Speaker 3>I think your theory is probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely correct that we are a in some</v>

1002
00:52:17.631 --> 00:52:20.390
<v Speaker 3>ways less sophisticated or less advanced</v>
<v Speaker 3>society,</v>

1003
00:52:20.391 --> 00:52:25.391
<v Speaker 3>at least less what will we will most </v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly more materialistic,</v>

1004
00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:33.311
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most certainly more dependent upon the </v>

1005
00:52:33.311 --> 00:52:33.410
<v Speaker 3>internet and most certainly more </v>
<v Speaker 3>dependent upon computers.</v>

1006
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a theory about people,</v>

1007
00:52:36.891 --> 00:52:40.190
<v Speaker 3>and this is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very shaky,</v>

1008
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:45.370
<v Speaker 3>but here's my theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My theory is I think that everything is </v>

1009
00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:48.671
<v Speaker 3>natural and I think that all behavior </v>
<v Speaker 3>like wolves chasing out the beta and the</v>

1010
00:52:49.431 --> 00:52:52.100
<v Speaker 3>alpha taking over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think like,</v>

1011
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:54.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>birds of prey,</v>

1012
00:52:54.411 --> 00:52:59.411
<v Speaker 3>feasting on other birds and bears eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>salMon and all these complex ecosystems </v>

1013
00:53:00.381 --> 00:53:01.430
<v Speaker 3>that we see all over the world.</v>

1014
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:05.180
<v Speaker 3>We just accept them as being natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're a part of the world that</v>

1015
00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:06.920
<v Speaker 3>we didn't alter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But ourselves,</v>

1016
00:53:06.921 --> 00:53:10.580
<v Speaker 3>we don't look as natural because we've </v>
<v Speaker 3>altered ourselves.</v>

1017
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:15.350
<v Speaker 3>But I think we are entirely natural and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I think our society and our civilization</v>

1018
00:53:15.351 --> 00:53:20.351
<v Speaker 3>and our as fucked up as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also natural and I think the </v>

1019
00:53:20.351 --> 00:53:24.620
<v Speaker 3>purpose that it serves is we live to </v>
<v Speaker 3>give birth to technology.</v>

1020
00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:29.970
<v Speaker 3>Marshall mcluhan said that human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>are the sex organs and the machine will </v>

1021
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:33.921
<v Speaker 3>hold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that what we're doing right </v>

1022
00:53:33.921 --> 00:53:35.370
<v Speaker 3>now by our obsession with the newest </v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest iphone,</v>

1023
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:39.240
<v Speaker 3>elon musk just released a tesla that </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes zero to 60 in two seconds.</v>

1024
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1025
00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:45.561
<v Speaker 3>I have to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by continuing to be obsessed with </v>

1026
00:53:45.561 --> 00:53:48.120
<v Speaker 3>acquiring the latest and greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>gadgets,</v>

1027
00:53:48.121 --> 00:53:50.340
<v Speaker 3>we push that innovation further and </v>
<v Speaker 3>further.</v>

1028
00:53:50.341 --> 00:53:55.341
<v Speaker 3>We fuel it with money and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually it's going to give birth to </v>

1029
00:53:55.341 --> 00:53:56.370
<v Speaker 3>an artificial life form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's inEvitable.</v>

1030
00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it will give birth to the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1031
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:04.050
<v Speaker 3>and I think we are like a caterpillar </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is becoming a butterfly and we have</v>

1032
00:54:04.051 --> 00:54:06.960
<v Speaker 3>no idea what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just in the middle of doing it and</v>

1033
00:54:06.961 --> 00:54:08.190
<v Speaker 3>we're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1034
00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.240
<v Speaker 3>so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back in the old days when we chopped </v>

1035
00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.111
<v Speaker 3>wood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why we think that is </v>

1036
00:54:15.111 --> 00:54:16.860
<v Speaker 3>because we know inevitably that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to last.</v>

1037
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:22.070
<v Speaker 3>We know that it's just a matter of x </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of time before we're were </v>

1038
00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:23.760
<v Speaker 3>outdated.</v>

1039
00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Here's something not get to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1040
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I believe you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's a nugget to add for you.</v>

1041
00:54:29.461 --> 00:54:33.270
<v Speaker 1>That goes back to our deepest history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This goes to my practice.</v>

1042
00:54:33.271 --> 00:54:38.271
<v Speaker 1>I do what I call indogenous visioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes in science is called thought </v>

1043
00:54:38.271 --> 00:54:42.171
<v Speaker 1>experiments or get duncan experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can close my eyes mostly closed </v>

1044
00:54:42.171 --> 00:54:46.701
<v Speaker 1>eyes and I could go into worlds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've been using to design </v>

1045
00:54:46.701 --> 00:54:48.630
<v Speaker 1>the spacecraft for nasa and origin of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1046
00:54:48.631 --> 00:54:53.631
<v Speaker 1>I work in the origin of life field and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of visualize molecular storms and </v>

1047
00:54:53.631 --> 00:54:58.191
<v Speaker 1>flows and all that stuff because I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this practice of just doing it and I'm </v>

1048
00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:03.270
<v Speaker 1>not taking anything just doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happened about two years ago,</v>

1049
00:55:03.271 --> 00:55:06.770
<v Speaker 1>I was reading an article in science that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1050
00:55:06.771 --> 00:55:11.771
<v Speaker 1>It was an article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about as like we found a femur </v>

1051
00:55:11.771 --> 00:55:14.901
<v Speaker 1>bone that was this small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a few send parsh portion of a </v>

1052
00:55:15.751 --> 00:55:17.430
<v Speaker 1>centimeter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a female meters.</v>

1053
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:22.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like quarter of an inch long or </v>
<v Speaker 1>half an inch long and that it's a femur </v>

1054
00:55:22.501 --> 00:55:25.890
<v Speaker 1>bone from our ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ancestors of all monkeys,</v>

1055
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:27.780
<v Speaker 1>primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lemurs,</v>

1056
00:55:27.781 --> 00:55:29.810
<v Speaker 1>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of us students.</v>

1057
00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:34.880
<v Speaker 1>It's our common ancestor is $55,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million years old and then they had an </v>

1058
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:38.930
<v Speaker 1>artist's conception of this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would've been about two inches long and </v>

1059
00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.590
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1060
00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:44.580
<v Speaker 1>our ancestor lived in the forest canopy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ate insects.</v>

1061
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.090
<v Speaker 1>We are insectivores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I closed my eyes and I said,</v>

1062
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:49.950
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go back there.</v>

1063
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I want to do an endogenous thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment in science and see what comes</v>

1064
00:55:54.931 --> 00:55:59.931
<v Speaker 1>in from the ether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was our life like fan because </v>

1065
00:55:59.931 --> 00:56:01.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a big clue of who we are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're going.</v>

1066
00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:07.520
<v Speaker 1>And I had this go into a kind of a dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>state serve meditation and breath work </v>

1067
00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:12.261
<v Speaker 1>and when I go into the dream state and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>see this branch at dawn and this a ball,</v>

1068
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:16.560
<v Speaker 1>a ball of us all clumped together </v>
<v Speaker 1>because insectivores,</v>

1069
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:21.680
<v Speaker 1>they protect each other by going close </v>
<v Speaker 1>warmth and all that stuff.</v>

1070
00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:27.590
<v Speaker 1>And I watched as this young proto </v>
<v Speaker 1>primate polar herself away from the </v>

1071
00:56:27.671 --> 00:56:32.671
<v Speaker 1>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So story always comes to me to do this </v>

1072
00:56:32.671 --> 00:56:36.001
<v Speaker 1>kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's creeping out on the limb at </v>

1073
00:56:36.001 --> 00:56:36.160
<v Speaker 1>dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1074
00:56:36.161 --> 00:56:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Because she sees a glistening globule of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1075
00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:42.010
<v Speaker 1>and why is this important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's sugar.</v>

1076
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:47.040
<v Speaker 1>That's tree sap that comes out at night </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the diet of these insectivores are </v>

1077
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:52.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves and flowers and stuff and </v>

1078
00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.411
<v Speaker 1>catching like a dragon fly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a major kill for protein and </v>

1079
00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:57.370
<v Speaker 1>sucking down tree sap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like fries,</v>

1080
00:56:57.371 --> 00:57:02.230
<v Speaker 1>a burger and a shake diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's our diet and an incentive or diet.</v>

1081
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:06.960
<v Speaker 1>And she's creeping out on the limb and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's sucking down this glob.</v>

1082
00:57:06.961 --> 00:57:11.961
<v Speaker 1>You'll have sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one eye is looking back to see if </v>

1083
00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:13.720
<v Speaker 1>the somebody in the community notices </v>
<v Speaker 1>her because she'll get busted,</v>

1084
00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:19.170
<v Speaker 1>sound familiar the other eyes looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward on the limb and it sees this </v>

1085
00:57:19.241 --> 00:57:23.470
<v Speaker 1>very trippy scale pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this trippy pattern of color.</v>

1086
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:26.440
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what it is,</v>

1087
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:31.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a tree snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the tree snake was this sole giant </v>

1088
00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:36.760
<v Speaker 1>predator that survived the impact in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico that killed the dinosaurs.</v>

1089
00:57:36.761 --> 00:57:39.880
<v Speaker 1>And then we rose after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although he may have been earlier,</v>

1090
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:43.720
<v Speaker 1>the tree snake is on the branch waiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for her,</v>

1091
00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:49.410
<v Speaker 1>waiting for her and she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's getting high on all this sugar </v>

1092
00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:53.130
<v Speaker 1>because we still get high on sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we are drinking our coffees right </v>

1093
00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:55.450
<v Speaker 1>with our sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's watching that and that trees,</v>

1094
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:58.570
<v Speaker 1>that pattern of scales is evolve to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mesmerize her.</v>

1095
00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:02.770
<v Speaker 1>It's totally there to captivate her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1096
00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Because of the head is under the branch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The head is about to come up.</v>

1097
00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:09.400
<v Speaker 1>If she doesn't snap out of and leap </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

1098
00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:14.650
<v Speaker 1>it will snap her ass down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this happened for tens of millions of</v>

1099
00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:16.000
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is coevolution.</v>

1100
00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:17.770
<v Speaker 1>What I believe from that.</v>

1101
00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.800
<v Speaker 1>That vision that I had was I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god,</v>

1102
00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:26.220
<v Speaker 1>this is why we're mesmerized by screens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the only animal that is mesmerized</v>

1103
00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:31.170
<v Speaker 1>by this screening of a phone or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1104
00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.610
<v Speaker 1>texture patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

1105
00:58:33.611 --> 00:58:36.940
<v Speaker 1>moving images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally hardwired into us.</v>

1106
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.860
<v Speaker 1>We're also terrified of snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1107
00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:43.890
<v Speaker 1>we have a hardwired circuit in our brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you see something that looks </v>

1108
00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:44.260
<v Speaker 1>like a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just jumped in voluntarily,</v>

1109
00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:45.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's in there too.</v>

1110
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I thought that serpent on that limb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that coa evolved our brain to vision.</v>

1111
00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:57.750
<v Speaker 1>That gave us color vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gave us a three d high acuity,</v>

1112
00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:03.290
<v Speaker 1>a vision that we were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient peoples because we could see </v>

1113
00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:04.000
<v Speaker 1>incredible pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1114
00:59:04.001 --> 00:59:07.480
<v Speaker 1>BecauSe we evolved for for $30 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>years with those guys.</v>

1115
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:10.870
<v Speaker 1>We had to solve that problem and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution for 30 million years.</v>

1116
00:59:10.871 --> 00:59:11.920
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of time.</v>

1117
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of programming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of brain development because </v>

1118
00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:19.651
<v Speaker 1>the ones that got snapped down weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>as good and so good old fashioned </v>

1119
00:59:19.651 --> 00:59:22.940
<v Speaker 1>darwinian evolution and I sometimes have</v>
<v Speaker 1>these conversations with what did I call</v>

1120
00:59:22.941 --> 00:59:23.510
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>andre,</v>

1121
00:59:23.511 --> 00:59:28.511
<v Speaker 1>so I know mother nature or the guy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>planetary plant bolus and I said to her </v>

1122
00:59:29.391 --> 00:59:30.230
<v Speaker 1>at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1123
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:35.500
<v Speaker 1>you co,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you use this technique to evolve us to </v>

1124
00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:39.821
<v Speaker 1>evolve our vision so we could drive cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we could create media and all this </v>

1125
00:59:39.821 --> 00:59:42.920
<v Speaker 1>sort of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is now coiled around the planet,</v>

1126
00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:45.560
<v Speaker 1>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coil around the planet,</v>

1127
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:48.910
<v Speaker 1>squeezing out the lifeblood of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

1128
00:59:48.911 --> 00:59:51.800
<v Speaker 1>And I asked her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this bother you?</v>

1129
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:53.690
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1130
00:59:53.691 --> 00:59:58.691
<v Speaker 1>as long as you do the prerogative of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>prerogative of life's prerogative,</v>

1131
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:03.500
<v Speaker 1>find me a new home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must make a copy.</v>

1132
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:05.780
<v Speaker 1>So what life does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1133
01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:08.300
<v Speaker 1>this planet is a womb and it's a two k.</v>

1134
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>This is all just a crazy vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You crazy vision.</v>

1135
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a womb and attune to home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about space travel,</v>

1136
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>interplanetary space travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1137
01:00:18.311 --> 01:00:23.311
<v Speaker 1>And what we've done as a species in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do a lot of this work for nasa of </v>

1138
01:00:23.311 --> 01:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>designing strange space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>craft and art.</v>

1139
01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is your educational background when it </v>

1140
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:32.090
<v Speaker 1>comes to that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff?</v>

1141
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:32.090
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1142
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:34.610
<v Speaker 1>it was started out as good old usc </v>
<v Speaker 1>trojan,</v>

1143
01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduating in electrical engineering and</v>

1144
01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:42.401
<v Speaker 1>the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course there was hardly any </v>

1145
01:00:42.401 --> 01:00:43.700
<v Speaker 1>software out at that time and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do artificial life in 1987.</v>

1146
01:00:43.701 --> 01:00:48.701
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine this on computers at usc</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to the arpanet and it was too </v>

1147
01:00:49.251 --> 01:00:54.251
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I restarted at 22 years later and I </v>

1148
01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>made a project called the evil grid but </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was too fricking soon.</v>

1149
01:00:56.511 --> 01:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>

1150
01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:59.870
<v Speaker 1>So you're kind of like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the virtual reality.</v>

1151
01:00:59.871 --> 01:01:01.970
<v Speaker 1>People were also too soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were.</v>

1152
01:01:01.971 --> 01:01:06.971
<v Speaker 1>And in 1993,</v>
<v Speaker 1>94 we all read snow crash and we read </v>

1153
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>near romancer and all those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and we watched a,</v>

1154
01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:16.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a minority report and all that sort of </v>

1155
01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.691
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I actually started organizations to </v>

1156
01:01:19.691 --> 01:01:22.340
<v Speaker 1>kickstart virtual worlds on the internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 94 95.</v>

1157
01:01:22.341 --> 01:01:23.780
<v Speaker 1>And we have the first conference that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote,</v>

1158
01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:28.781
<v Speaker 1>a book called avatars and help to </v>
<v Speaker 1>network together and get all these </v>

1159
01:01:28.781 --> 01:01:30.680
<v Speaker 1>people in the same room that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>filming avatar,</v>

1160
01:01:30.681 --> 01:01:33.530
<v Speaker 1>cyberspace and three dimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1161
01:01:33.531 --> 01:01:38.531
<v Speaker 1>move through and you see objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish and people and whatever and they </v>

1162
01:01:38.531 --> 01:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>talk to you and et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

1163
01:01:39.261 --> 01:01:41.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's how I got connected with </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrence.</v>

1164
01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Terrence mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this terrance was fascinated by that.</v>

1165
01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.480
<v Speaker 1>And I was the go to guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he came,</v>

1166
01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:52.900
<v Speaker 1>he came to the farm and sat at our </v>
<v Speaker 1>little table and I put them into these </v>

1167
01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:55.820
<v Speaker 1>virtual worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was an amazingly powerful medium.</v>

1168
01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:00.800
<v Speaker 1>And then we spun that medium into all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this work for nasa for 12 years.</v>

1169
01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Using virtual worlds to model the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface of mars,</v>

1170
01:02:04.341 --> 01:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a rover and how it would work.</v>

1171
01:02:07.431 --> 01:02:12.431
<v Speaker 1>The rigid body dynamics of wheels </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving in bulldozers on the moon and </v>

1172
01:02:13.131 --> 01:02:15.560
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do we build moon basis.</v>

1173
01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.980
<v Speaker 1>But we could use three d graphics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the serpent.</v>

1174
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ability to create these worlds to </v>

1175
01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>figure out how a vehicle would work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>another planet before we built.</v>

1176
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>We built banta any metal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out,</v>

1177
01:02:30.661 --> 01:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>coming back to the life propagation </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1178
01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:38.690
<v Speaker 1>if you go to the curiosity rover or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two rovers on mars and you take you a </v>

1179
01:02:38.851 --> 01:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>screw gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were there,</v>

1180
01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:45.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully the vehicles are dead so </v>

1181
01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:45.680
<v Speaker 1>you're not caught on camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you.</v>

1182
01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>You drop the belly pan off of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

1183
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a dozen species of bacteria that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just there for the ride.</v>

1184
01:02:53.611 --> 01:02:57.620
<v Speaker 1>They're inside the vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't be knocked out any clean room</v>

1185
01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.840
<v Speaker 1>and they're dry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are life,</v>

1186
01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:06.020
<v Speaker 1>so there's life on mars is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This happens to be in the bodies of our </v>

1187
01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:09.501
<v Speaker 1>space craft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no way avoid to avoid that </v>

1188
01:03:09.501 --> 01:03:09.501
<v Speaker 1>really no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to.</v>

1189
01:03:09.501 --> 01:03:14.480
<v Speaker 1>And there's certain species of bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will always be present and in fact </v>

1190
01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.691
<v Speaker 1>the jpl vacuum chamber and where they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the final prep for some of these </v>

1191
01:03:17.691 --> 01:03:20.610
<v Speaker 1>missions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found that because they had created</v>

1192
01:03:20.611 --> 01:03:25.611
<v Speaker 1>the vacuum chamber and the clean rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain types of bacteria evolved to be </v>

1193
01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:29.640
<v Speaker 1>good at living in those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they already good at hitching a ride.</v>

1194
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:35.030
<v Speaker 1>So of course they're inside the vehicle </v>
<v Speaker 1>on there on mars now outside of the </v>

1195
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:37.170
<v Speaker 1>vehicle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's radiation and stuff that make it</v>

1196
01:03:37.171 --> 01:03:41.100
<v Speaker 1>impossible for them to really spread and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into soils and stuff where there was</v>

1197
01:03:41.101 --> 01:03:41.340
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

1198
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:46.700
<v Speaker 3>fascinating podcasts from radio lab </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the galapagos islands and about </v>

1199
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:52.140
<v Speaker 3>how many invasive species have found the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to the galapagos,</v>

1200
01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:57.170
<v Speaker 3>even from just the heels of people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet having seeds ground into their </v>

1201
01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:03.520
<v Speaker 3>pattern of their shoes and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the seeds will get into these </v>

1202
01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.780
<v Speaker 3>grounds and then these invasive species </v>
<v Speaker 3>will start growing and</v>

1203
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:10.430
<v Speaker 1>and jeff goldbloom and jurassic park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

1204
01:04:10.431 --> 01:04:13.340
<v Speaker 1>life will find a way out or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1205
01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:14.670
<v Speaker 1>What they were trying to say is</v>

1206
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:19.490
<v Speaker 3>there really is no clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this idea that you're not going to.</v>

1207
01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:25.080
<v Speaker 3>That a human being entering into some </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular environment is going to not </v>

1208
01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.900
<v Speaker 3>leave a footprint like it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not happening.</v>

1209
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.270
<v Speaker 3>You know that just by virtue of you </v>
<v Speaker 3>being there,</v>

1210
01:04:29.271 --> 01:04:30.930
<v Speaker 3>your bacteria or disease and we're</v>

1211
01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:33.680
<v Speaker 1>carrying around in a single celled </v>
<v Speaker 1>organisms,</v>

1212
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:38.690
<v Speaker 1>bacteria to help us digest food and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and that the body load of that </v>

1213
01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:43.551
<v Speaker 1>stuff out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Numbers of the number of humans that </v>

1214
01:04:43.551 --> 01:04:44.160
<v Speaker 1>have ever lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just in some sense,</v>

1215
01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:47.670
<v Speaker 1>here's a joke for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we come,</v>

1216
01:04:47.671 --> 01:04:50.010
<v Speaker 1>we rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't do the deed,</v>

1217
01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:53.730
<v Speaker 1>we don't create life off the pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just sort of go away.</v>

1218
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Planet goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>runs down 5 billion years from now,</v>

1219
01:04:56.881 --> 01:05:01.370
<v Speaker 1>the sun is a is a red giant and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding and and we come,</v>

1220
01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:06.410
<v Speaker 1>the earth comes and it scrapes the outer</v>
<v Speaker 1>corona and it starts breaking apart </v>

1221
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:09.990
<v Speaker 1>because that's probably what happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the crust comes apart.</v>

1222
01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Now of course we know that bacteria can </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive and all these crustal rocks on </v>

1223
01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:16.980
<v Speaker 1>maybe traveled to other source systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my prediction,</v>

1224
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>the surface bacteria will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

1225
01:05:20.351 --> 01:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>and the ones that are five kilometers </v>
<v Speaker 1>down or three miles down said,</v>

1226
01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:28.450
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen around a billion years ago or 600</v>

1227
01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:33.450
<v Speaker 1>million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was all this surface gigantic </v>

1228
01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>plants and labels and dinosaurs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1229
01:05:34.541 --> 01:05:39.541
<v Speaker 1>and there was one species that did </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and they even took it out a </v>

1230
01:05:39.541 --> 01:05:43.621
<v Speaker 1>little bit and then they just blew it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and went away in the five kilometer </v>

1231
01:05:43.621 --> 01:05:43.621
<v Speaker 1>deep.</v>

1232
01:05:43.621 --> 01:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>A Bacteria will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kidding.</v>

1233
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.490
<v Speaker 1>That was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one told us,</v>

1234
01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:51.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was happening on the surface.</v>

1235
01:05:51.821 --> 01:05:56.821
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're used to just being bacteria on </v>

1236
01:05:56.821 --> 01:05:57.730
<v Speaker 1>planets that never go any further than </v>
<v Speaker 1>just the bacteria phase.</v>

1237
01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the primary idea about how life gets </v>

1238
01:06:03.290 --> 01:06:04.860
<v Speaker 3>moved around about the galaxy is </v>
<v Speaker 3>asteroidal impacts,</v>

1239
01:06:04.861 --> 01:06:08.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the idea of panspermia like that,</v>

1240
01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:13.280
<v Speaker 3>much of what is life sustaining exists </v>
<v Speaker 3>on asteroids can be no acids and water.</v>

1241
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:17.520
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a theory put forth,</v>

1242
01:06:17.521 --> 01:06:20.790
<v Speaker 1>I think in the seventies versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>initially sort of panned,</v>

1243
01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>but month now we're discovering media </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights that have come from mars and </v>

1244
01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:28.410
<v Speaker 1>landed on ice caps on earth and go in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and realize,</v>

1245
01:06:28.411 --> 01:06:33.411
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite possible that things hitched </v>

1246
01:06:33.411 --> 01:06:33.990
<v Speaker 1>a ride and that mars would have cooled </v>
<v Speaker 1>sooner,</v>

1247
01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:39.290
<v Speaker 1>had a liquid ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of more stable environment sooner </v>

1248
01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:43.131
<v Speaker 1>than earth would have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if life arose on mars and got some </v>

1249
01:06:43.131 --> 01:06:45.530
<v Speaker 1>impacts and blew off some crustal </v>
<v Speaker 1>material than we could be all martians.</v>

1250
01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:46.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1251
01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:47.770
<v Speaker 3>That was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1252
01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's the case mean isn't the rover,</v>

1253
01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a very microscopic farmer that.</v>

1254
01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:55.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not an asteroid,</v>

1255
01:06:55.181 --> 01:07:00.181
<v Speaker 3>but it is or something that came from </v>
<v Speaker 3>one body and is now occupying another </v>

1256
01:07:01.421 --> 01:07:02.680
<v Speaker 3>body and it has life on it.</v>

1257
01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:05.220
<v Speaker 1>So here's the other part of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So perhaps,</v>

1258
01:07:05.221 --> 01:07:10.221
<v Speaker 1>and this is all woo woo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bacteria in the mars rovers are </v>

1259
01:07:10.221 --> 01:07:12.000
<v Speaker 1>communicating with the maras bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 1>and saying,</v>

1260
01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.800
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1261
01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:19.490
<v Speaker 1>we got life started on the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went up to a certain point where we </v>

1262
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:23.721
<v Speaker 1>had trial of bites and we had deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming things and they weren't really </v>

1263
01:07:23.721 --> 01:07:24.660
<v Speaker 1>evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we ordered an airstrike,</v>

1264
01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.380
<v Speaker 1>knocked him back and then we got things </v>
<v Speaker 1>on land that crawled,</v>

1265
01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:31.680
<v Speaker 1>but they just basically all he did was </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat and shit,</v>

1266
01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:33.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they got big and whatever,</v>

1267
01:07:33.691 --> 01:07:36.330
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we ordered another air strike,</v>

1268
01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:40.590
<v Speaker 1>kill off the dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we've got this new thing,</v>

1269
01:07:40.591 --> 01:07:45.591
<v Speaker 1>these primate things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we don't know if they're really </v>

1270
01:07:45.591 --> 01:07:48.231
<v Speaker 1>gonna go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we just might order one more air </v>

1271
01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:48.720
<v Speaker 1>strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to start with arachnids,</v>

1272
01:07:48.721 --> 01:07:50.250
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do spiders.</v>

1273
01:07:50.251 --> 01:07:55.251
<v Speaker 1>The next time we gotta we gotta find one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to do the job of getting </v>

1274
01:07:55.251 --> 01:07:55.400
<v Speaker 1>life spread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1275
01:07:55.420 --> 01:08:00.420
<v Speaker 3>so you think that that's where our </v>
<v Speaker 3>primary objective is to get off this </v>

1276
01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:00.420
<v Speaker 3>planet and the spread life throughout </v>
<v Speaker 3>the galaxy.</v>

1277
01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:00.420
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1278
01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:05.020
<v Speaker 1>I Think that life life is so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean life it,</v>

1279
01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:10.130
<v Speaker 1>it pushes into new environments from </v>
<v Speaker 1>early thermal springs on volcanic </v>

1280
01:08:10.791 --> 01:08:15.791
<v Speaker 1>islands and it figured out this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>work I'm doing with my colleagues at uc </v>

1281
01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:19.601
<v Speaker 1>santa and nasa and elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to try to figure out a model of how </v>

1282
01:08:19.601 --> 01:08:22.270
<v Speaker 1>life started in those volcanic springs </v>
<v Speaker 1>in those early on,</v>

1283
01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.400
<v Speaker 1>we've come up with a model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were just actually submitted our </v>

1284
01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.890
<v Speaker 1>paper this week on that model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but life pushes its way in life.</v>

1285
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Had to learn in that model to survive in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oceans and then it could spread.</v>

1286
01:08:34.101 --> 01:08:37.520
<v Speaker 1>And these little bubbles that are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>pre early life,</v>

1287
01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.460
<v Speaker 1>really fragile and don't have much of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>genome,</v>

1288
01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:43.610
<v Speaker 1>but they can persist long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can get to the next island.</v>

1289
01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:46.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life will find a way like jeff goldbloom</v>

1290
01:08:46.311 --> 01:08:51.311
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at where life has gone and </v>

1291
01:08:51.311 --> 01:08:51.311
<v Speaker 1>missing.</v>

1292
01:08:51.311 --> 01:08:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Incredible as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we are spreading wings of the living </v>

1293
01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:57.440
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are a magnificent creation of that.</v>

1294
01:08:57.441 --> 01:09:02.441
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the potential to spread life </v>

1295
01:09:02.441 --> 01:09:05.380
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the other projects I'm </v>

1296
01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:06.200
<v Speaker 1>working on asteroid capture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>retrieval.</v>

1297
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:08.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're wanting to hear about that.</v>

1298
01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1299
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.970
<v Speaker 1>That's a mechanism to actually spread </v>
<v Speaker 1>life in the large scale.</v>

1300
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:16.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's indirect,</v>

1301
01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:21.310
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to fund a project to </v>

1302
01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:21.980
<v Speaker 1>spread life into the solar system or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>so visionary,</v>

1303
01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:27.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty pedestrian than we do </v>

1304
01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:28.850
<v Speaker 1>things for business reasons or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this whole new space movement</v>

1305
01:09:28.851 --> 01:09:29.860
<v Speaker 1>that's come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1306
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:34.130
<v Speaker 1>space x and elon musk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these private entrepreneurs.</v>

1307
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:36.920
<v Speaker 1>They're proposing how to get to mars and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1308
01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:39.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasa still in the game,</v>

1309
01:09:39.621 --> 01:09:41.570
<v Speaker 1>even though they can't launch people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1310
01:09:41.571 --> 01:09:44.030
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be using space x and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few years.</v>

1311
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.170
<v Speaker 1>So nasa has put out this call for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1312
01:09:48.171 --> 01:09:50.510
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can we do with the human crew?</v>

1313
01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>

1314
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:57.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in 2007 when they were going to </v>

1315
01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.930
<v Speaker 1>shut down the shuttle program and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on the books.</v>

1316
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I worked with a team that worked with </v>
<v Speaker 1>headquarters to design what's possibly </v>

1317
01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:06.460
<v Speaker 1>the very first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1318
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:10.280
<v Speaker 1>we can even bring up that video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to get people to an asteroid,</v>

1319
01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:14.300
<v Speaker 1>how to land a human crew using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardware that nasa wanted to build,</v>

1320
01:10:14.301 --> 01:10:16.040
<v Speaker 1>which is called constellation at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1321
01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:18.470
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out it's a tricky thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1322
01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.660
<v Speaker 1>who is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie,</v>

1323
01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:22.210
<v Speaker 1>the deep impact movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1324
01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:27.450
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned Bruce Willis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had one and the other one was morgan </v>

1325
01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:27.450
<v Speaker 1>freeman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

1326
01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:32.080
<v Speaker 1>there was two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a deep Impact and there was </v>

1327
01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.070
<v Speaker 1>harm again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we said is,</v>

1328
01:10:34.071 --> 01:10:35.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all well and good,</v>

1329
01:10:35.901 --> 01:10:37.030
<v Speaker 1>but how do you really do it?</v>

1330
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:40.550
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that an asteroid even </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a half a mile long,</v>

1331
01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.160
<v Speaker 1>has almost no gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not,</v>

1332
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:47.660
<v Speaker 1>you're not actually going to as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>video that this is it.</v>

1333
01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's put it up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie has put it up.</v>

1334
01:10:49.611 --> 01:10:52.940
<v Speaker 1>So there's almost no gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very difficult to land on,</v>

1335
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:55.730
<v Speaker 1>so that's a really big object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it's going what,</v>

1336
01:10:55.731 --> 01:10:57.530
<v Speaker 1>like 45,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour or something.</v>

1337
01:10:57.710 --> 01:10:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Then It's rotating and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1338
01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:02.150
<v Speaker 1>so it's spinning and it's moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's moving.</v>

1339
01:11:02.151 --> 01:11:07.151
<v Speaker 1>So here's our craft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a football because I was </v>

1340
01:11:07.151 --> 01:11:11.140
<v Speaker 1>like a space potato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we are coming down and we're </v>

1341
01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:14.110
<v Speaker 1>using our radar to trying to find a spot</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might not be so crumbling because </v>

1342
01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:16.130
<v Speaker 1>these often rubble piles and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be people are going to land.</v>

1343
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:21.590
<v Speaker 1>This is a human mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's see the ring of airbags that </v>

1344
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:24.940
<v Speaker 1>allows a soft contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vehicles under thrust and it's watch</v>

1345
01:11:24.941 --> 01:11:25.290
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1346
01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Here comes a penetrator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amateurs coming out,</v>

1347
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:34.030
<v Speaker 1>there's a pen of trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a boom penetrates on the edge </v>

1348
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:38.471
<v Speaker 1>of edge of a rope in the penetrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>amateurs or to try to grapple the </v>

1349
01:11:38.471 --> 01:11:38.471
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get tension.</v>

1350
01:11:38.471 --> 01:11:41.370
<v Speaker 1>If you've got tension on three or four </v>
<v Speaker 1>year lines like a rock climber,</v>

1351
01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.260
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got stability.</v>

1352
01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:46.770
<v Speaker 1>So it actually digs into the surface and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface.</v>

1353
01:11:46.771 --> 01:11:48.990
<v Speaker 1>I can anchor and here are the guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out?</v>

1354
01:11:48.991 --> 01:11:50.070
<v Speaker 1>No sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're floating.</v>

1355
01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:52.920
<v Speaker 1>They're coming out on handrails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got nice earth flag.</v>

1356
01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:56.280
<v Speaker 1>They're saluting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is our design from 2007,</v>

1357
01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.260
<v Speaker 1>which was done for a nasa headquarters </v>
<v Speaker 1>study for the administrator actually.</v>

1358
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:03.540
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

1359
01:12:03.541 --> 01:12:05.370
<v Speaker 1>so that was done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1360
01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I unimed barcode it so it was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial at the time because the </v>

1361
01:12:10.651 --> 01:12:15.651
<v Speaker 1>whole bush agenda was to go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moon and this was like another target </v>

1362
01:12:15.651 --> 01:12:15.651
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1363
01:12:15.651 --> 01:12:20.181
<v Speaker 1>we need to go somewhere else if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if human beings are going to ever go to </v>

1364
01:12:20.181 --> 01:12:20.820
<v Speaker 1>mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we go to an asteroid?</v>

1365
01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:21.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

1366
01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:26.710
<v Speaker 1>this was running around the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's sort of an asteroid underground </v>

1367
01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:30.770
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our center director was one of those </v>

1368
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:31.500
<v Speaker 1>dudes and I was sitting in his office </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a two star general.</v>

1369
01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:32.730
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you can,</v>

1370
01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:36.060
<v Speaker 1>you can go public with it because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get fired.</v>

1371
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:37.920
<v Speaker 1>You're know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a civil servant.</v>

1372
01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:41.130
<v Speaker 1>So I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I lined up space.com</v>

1373
01:12:41.131 --> 01:12:46.131
<v Speaker 1>and seen it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular science was on the cover of </v>

1374
01:12:46.131 --> 01:12:46.410
<v Speaker 1>popular science and we put that out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we said,</v>

1375
01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:50.790
<v Speaker 1>here's our study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how we grapple,</v>

1376
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:55.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd talk with an asteroid and we get a </v>

1377
01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:55.810
<v Speaker 1>human crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera,</v>

1378
01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:58.941
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that kind of goes into a black hole </v>

1379
01:12:58.941 --> 01:12:58.941
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1380
01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:02.450
<v Speaker 1>nasa sort of got that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutional thing where they do a lot </v>

1381
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:05.841
<v Speaker 1>of studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we had done it in public and it </v>

1382
01:13:05.841 --> 01:13:07.971
<v Speaker 1>actually shaped it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed the space industry as I forgot </v>

1383
01:13:07.971 --> 01:13:08.250
<v Speaker 1>about is 2007.</v>

1384
01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1385
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's out there.</v>

1386
01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:13.830
<v Speaker 1>If you google humans on an asteroid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll come up.</v>

1387
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.860
<v Speaker 1>But turns out people were watching that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at that.</v>

1388
01:13:17.170 --> 01:13:20.490
<v Speaker 1>We just put it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a guy at,</v>

1389
01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I think it was jpl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw that baCk in the day and then he </v>

1390
01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.330
<v Speaker 1>designed the next mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sort of an outsider,</v>

1391
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.760
<v Speaker 1>the student at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1392
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.560
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really cool.</v>

1393
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:33.900
<v Speaker 1>We should be doing it as an agency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he came up with,</v>

1394
01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:38.070
<v Speaker 1>couldn't we bring an asteroid closer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth so the crew doesn't have to go</v>

1395
01:13:38.071 --> 01:13:43.071
<v Speaker 1>so far with what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>LiKe pull it closer to closer to it </v>

1396
01:13:43.071 --> 01:13:44.490
<v Speaker 1>sounds like a disaster waiting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1397
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Small one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small disaster or a small asteroid,</v>

1398
01:13:47.831 --> 01:13:49.830
<v Speaker 1>all asteroid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can land on it.</v>

1399
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:55.100
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could go and sample it like a </v>

1400
01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.351
<v Speaker 1>geologist with your hammers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how big you're talking about when you </v>

1401
01:13:57.351 --> 01:14:00.201
<v Speaker 1>say small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally pretty small between like 12 </v>

1402
01:14:00.201 --> 01:14:02.580
<v Speaker 1>feet and 30 feet long and you could land</v>
<v Speaker 1>on something 30 feet long.</v>

1403
01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:05.520
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't land on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do what we just saw,</v>

1404
01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:09.990
<v Speaker 1>but the human crew could park next to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>called proximity ops.</v>

1405
01:14:09.991 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Yet it could park way downstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turnoff.</v>

1406
01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.510
<v Speaker 1>It's hydrazine jets and send astronauts </v>
<v Speaker 1>over to to sample it.</v>

1407
01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:21.660
<v Speaker 1>But how do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you move something like that </v>

1408
01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:22.120
<v Speaker 1>saved to the orbit of the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be a safer place.</v>

1409
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Put a moon around the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So nasa had initiated that challenge </v>

1410
01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:30.640
<v Speaker 1>based on this work which bounced off </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1411
01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:33.940
<v Speaker 1>This guy who said we need to bring an </v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroid in the moon.</v>

1412
01:14:33.941 --> 01:14:35.950
<v Speaker 1>And they now they have that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

1413
01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:41.640
<v Speaker 1>So a colleague and a me designed a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>system to do that.</v>

1414
01:14:42.330 --> 01:14:45.210
<v Speaker 2>A system to put an asteroid in orbit</v>

1415
01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:48.690
<v Speaker 1>around the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the neat thing about it.</v>

1416
01:14:49.410 --> 01:14:50.430
<v Speaker 1>We figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

1417
01:14:50.431 --> 01:14:52.590
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to one of these asteroids,</v>

1418
01:14:52.591 --> 01:14:53.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a rubble pile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most.</v>

1419
01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Most of the ones that we're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in for science,</v>

1420
01:14:56.911 --> 01:14:59.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sampling there 5 billion years old,</v>

1421
01:14:59.651 --> 01:15:03.240
<v Speaker 1>there are 4 billion years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're collected rubble piles of pieces</v>

1422
01:15:03.241 --> 01:15:05.280
<v Speaker 1>of the early solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

1423
01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:07.710
<v Speaker 1>they're fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why do we know this?</v>

1424
01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:13.130
<v Speaker 1>The asteroid that came in over Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the asteroid that came in over africa </v>

1425
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:17.511
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broke up at a certain altitude so we </v>

1426
01:15:17.511 --> 01:15:20.631
<v Speaker 1>know what pressure took to break it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>so we know how much you got to push it </v>

1427
01:15:20.631 --> 01:15:24.320
<v Speaker 1>to break up the thing up because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere did that and then it comes in</v>

1428
01:15:24.321 --> 01:15:26.280
<v Speaker 1>and pieces and rains down.</v>

1429
01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.190
<v Speaker 2>But isn't the concern that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>predict what happens when you break them</v>

1430
01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:32.190
<v Speaker 2>up and then you might deal with a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 2>of giant rocks hurling towards earth.</v>

1431
01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that'S why it's really hard to do </v>

1432
01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:38.760
<v Speaker 2>asteroid deflection by some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive and you're ready to to that.</v>

1433
01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:42.170
<v Speaker 2>They want to just be able to push it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>put some kind of a webbing on a graph.</v>

1434
01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Changes the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you put a rag right,</v>

1435
01:15:44.671 --> 01:15:47.310
<v Speaker 2>if you put a webbing on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made us come apart.</v>

1436
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can use something called gravity </v>

1437
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.221
<v Speaker 2>tractoring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is developed by rusty schweickart </v>

1438
01:15:55.221 --> 01:15:58.071
<v Speaker 2>and ed loo at the un,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a separate separate work that we were </v>

1439
01:15:58.071 --> 01:16:02.121
<v Speaker 2>doing with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have this idea of flying a </v>

1440
01:16:02.121 --> 01:16:03.981
<v Speaker 2>spacecraft alongside something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gradually the gravity will change the </v>

1441
01:16:03.981 --> 01:16:08.140
<v Speaker 2>orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the purpose of going to an </v>

1442
01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:08.140
<v Speaker 2>asteroid though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or especially a human mission,</v>

1443
01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:12.801
<v Speaker 2>like what would be the benefit of having</v>
<v Speaker 2>people go as opposed to having some </v>

1444
01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:15.711
<v Speaker 2>remote vehicle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it seems like as we get better </v>

1445
01:16:15.711 --> 01:16:18.600
<v Speaker 2>and better with remote technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would be like a lot more efficient.</v>

1446
01:16:18.601 --> 01:16:20.310
<v Speaker 2>It would save lives and</v>

1447
01:16:20.730 --> 01:16:21.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

1448
01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.700
<v Speaker 1>here's the we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were asking that same question.</v>

1449
01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.000
<v Speaker 1>So initially nasa said we want to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

1450
01:16:27.001 --> 01:16:32.001
<v Speaker 1>We want to take samples off of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that says old as the earth are older </v>

1451
01:16:32.001 --> 01:16:33.600
<v Speaker 1>because then for origin of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>research,</v>

1452
01:16:33.601 --> 01:16:34.890
<v Speaker 1>which I'm involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

1453
01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I could get a few pounds of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>material out from under this space crust</v>

1454
01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:46.100
<v Speaker 1>that's on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has protected it for 5 billion </v>

1455
01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:48.390
<v Speaker 1>years or 4 billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is precious because it was what was</v>

1456
01:16:48.391 --> 01:16:52.140
<v Speaker 1>raininG down in the skies of The early </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth that was coming down to the little</v>

1457
01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:57.141
<v Speaker 1>ponds where life may have started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like spinning a refrigerator all </v>

1458
01:16:57.141 --> 01:17:01.161
<v Speaker 1>this time so it's really precious for </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and figuring out how the solar </v>

1459
01:17:01.161 --> 01:17:05.511
<v Speaker 1>system came together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our design was to go out to the,</v>

1460
01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:08.670
<v Speaker 1>to the asteroid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to a thousand tons.</v>

1461
01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.420
<v Speaker 1>They're all rotating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spend one time,</v>

1462
01:17:12.421 --> 01:17:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm in something like that and half a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotation a minute,</v>

1463
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:16.940
<v Speaker 1>put a balloon around it.</v>

1464
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Just extend this airbeam enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've ever done any helium balloon like</v>

1465
01:17:21.471 --> 01:17:24.210
<v Speaker 1>high altitude flight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>

1466
01:17:24.450 --> 01:17:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're incredible.</v>

1467
01:17:25.311 --> 01:17:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>julian not lives out in santa barbara is</v>

1468
01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:33.340
<v Speaker 1>perHaps the greatest designer of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of balloons and he's honored our </v>

1469
01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:34.430
<v Speaker 1>team for this proposal and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1470
01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:38.110
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you extend these air beams,</v>

1471
01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:38.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1472
01:17:38.781 --> 01:17:42.560
<v Speaker 1>the balloons you have at circus as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy just like blows up along balloon and</v>

1473
01:17:42.561 --> 01:17:46.340
<v Speaker 1>makes a dog out of it for your kid or </v>
<v Speaker 1>air beams.</v>

1474
01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:51.540
<v Speaker 1>They're the rigid parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you literally go out to the asteroid </v>

1475
01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:56.200
<v Speaker 1>using xenon gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fill these arab beams and they pull </v>

1476
01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:56.320
<v Speaker 1>your fabric out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1477
01:17:56.321 --> 01:17:58.740
<v Speaker 1>and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a folder of a bunch of images of</v>

1478
01:17:58.741 --> 01:18:03.741
<v Speaker 1>the assistant called shepherd I got and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it will capture the asteroid here.</v>

1479
01:18:04.371 --> 01:18:05.180
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of come out.</v>

1480
01:18:05.190 --> 01:18:07.460
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that it's hard to.</v>

1481
01:18:08.410 --> 01:18:10.190
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is a balloon.</v>

1482
01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:13.310
<v Speaker 1>This is literally a balloon captures the</v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroid.</v>

1483
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:18.190
<v Speaker 1>So the astra is now inside it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tumbling is rotating and there's the air</v>

1484
01:18:18.191 --> 01:18:23.191
<v Speaker 1>beams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those blue things is how the capture </v>

1485
01:18:23.191 --> 01:18:23.191
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the air flow.</v>

1486
01:18:23.191 --> 01:18:25.310
<v Speaker 1>We may leave it on that one and we'll we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can explain what we're doing.</v>

1487
01:18:25.730 --> 01:18:30.440
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that if you inject gas into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this balloon,</v>

1488
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:34.370
<v Speaker 1>you will gradually slow the tumbling the</v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroid to stop it.</v>

1489
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Now it's stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've solved.</v>

1490
01:18:36.981 --> 01:18:41.981
<v Speaker 1>One of the big problems of capturing </v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroids is to get rid of the spin and </v>

1491
01:18:41.981 --> 01:18:44.810
<v Speaker 1>tumbling because if you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all these powerful forces.</v>

1492
01:18:44.811 --> 01:18:48.290
<v Speaker 1>If you try to put a net around that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would just come apart or terrorists.</v>

1493
01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Spacecraft pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1494
01:18:49.821 --> 01:18:51.650
<v Speaker 1>so you put a bubble on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You capture an asteroid.</v>

1495
01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Now what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>

1496
01:18:52.521 --> 01:18:57.521
<v Speaker 1>What is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll notice in our little drawing </v>

1497
01:18:57.521 --> 01:18:57.521
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we start shooting waves,</v>

1498
01:18:57.521 --> 01:19:00.740
<v Speaker 1>the xenon gas at the Back end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which puts a force on it,</v>

1499
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:04.580
<v Speaker 1>not not a forced to break it up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough force to shove It,</v>

1500
01:19:05.210 --> 01:19:10.210
<v Speaker 1>and then we use the same xenon gas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>our motor to keep up with it as it moves</v>

1501
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:13.790
<v Speaker 1>and we can use like sale power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like a sailing ship.</v>

1502
01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:19.180
<v Speaker 1>We can use sale power moving gas to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change its orbit and to retrieve it and </v>

1503
01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:24.011
<v Speaker 1>bring it to move it into some other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the solar system is this </v>

1504
01:19:24.011 --> 01:19:28.210
<v Speaker 1>potential technology to avoid gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroidal impacts on earth or is it </v>

1505
01:19:28.210 --> 01:19:29.090
<v Speaker 1>just too small?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is too small,</v>

1506
01:19:29.091 --> 01:19:33.140
<v Speaker 1>so this is only for examining old rocks </v>
<v Speaker 1>for an examining on rocks blood.</v>

1507
01:19:33.141 --> 01:19:35.900
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigating this further,</v>

1508
01:19:35.901 --> 01:19:36.890
<v Speaker 1>we thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1509
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:39.440
<v Speaker 1>what if we had a piece of a comment?</v>

1510
01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:44.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments are coming in the pleiades </v>

1511
01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:44.960
<v Speaker 1>meteor shower and the land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that come in and they give you this</v>

1512
01:19:44.961 --> 01:19:49.760
<v Speaker 1>nice light show in the summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all valid voluble volatiles.</v>

1513
01:19:50.150 --> 01:19:51.530
<v Speaker 1>That's water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's methane.</v>

1514
01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:56.620
<v Speaker 1>All this wonderful stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you had a chunk of a comment </v>

1515
01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:57.560
<v Speaker 1>that had all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these gases coming off,</v>

1516
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:59.900
<v Speaker 1>you know the rosetta mission the </v>
<v Speaker 1>europeans are doing right now,</v>

1517
01:19:59.901 --> 01:20:04.901
<v Speaker 1>they're orbiting one of these gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments that has these geysers coming </v>

1518
01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:07.590
<v Speaker 1>out that's thrust doesn't like a rocket </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrust.</v>

1519
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:11.550
<v Speaker 1>What if you could capture a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>comment from further out,</v>

1520
01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:14.100
<v Speaker 1>put your balloon around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capture,</v>

1521
01:20:14.290 --> 01:20:18.720
<v Speaker 1>stop at rotating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capture all the stuff coming off and use</v>

1522
01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:23.721
<v Speaker 1>it for your engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could then create a moving chunk of </v>

1523
01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:27.210
<v Speaker 1>the early solar system who came outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1524
01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.570
<v Speaker 1>what if we did this and what if we did </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you know,</v>

1525
01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.490
<v Speaker 1>being able to do it would be cool and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything like that.</v>

1526
01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:36.660
<v Speaker 1>Will it be the benefit of getting some 5</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion year old rock at a space?</v>

1527
01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's.</v>

1528
01:20:37.201 --> 01:20:40.290
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to do it with people?</v>

1529
01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you want to do it remotely </v>
<v Speaker 1>with machines?</v>

1530
01:20:42.930 --> 01:20:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's where the people come in.</v>

1531
01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:48.270
<v Speaker 1>So if you can move a basically a wet </v>
<v Speaker 1>space rock,</v>

1532
01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:52.830
<v Speaker 1>capture all the gases coming out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Concentrate the gases in your tanks.</v>

1533
01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:57.150
<v Speaker 1>A human crew can dock with it saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move it to mars,</v>

1534
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:59.580
<v Speaker 1>to mars orbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move it to the Lunar orbit.</v>

1535
01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got a gas station in orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a gas station somewhere in </v>

1536
01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:06.930
<v Speaker 1>the solar system full of exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

1537
01:21:06.931 --> 01:21:10.680
<v Speaker 1>You need to get a human crew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They dock with it.</v>

1538
01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.630
<v Speaker 1>When they get there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they refill their tanks.</v>

1539
01:21:12.631 --> 01:21:17.631
<v Speaker 1>They now have their return fuel to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to earth and then they fuel their </v>

1540
01:21:17.631 --> 01:21:20.520
<v Speaker 1>lander and they go down with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to carry that stuff.</v>

1541
01:21:20.521 --> 01:21:25.521
<v Speaker 1>You have gas stations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a sustainable space flight </v>

1542
01:21:25.521 --> 01:21:26.760
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds beautiful,</v>

1543
01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.670
<v Speaker 1>but if you</v>

1544
01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:30.870
<v Speaker 3>don't send people out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need that.</v>

1545
01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:36.170
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying we would do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>because when the people were out there </v>

1546
01:21:36.170 --> 01:21:40.740
<v Speaker 3>that way we didn't have power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't need people out there,</v>

1547
01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:46.010
<v Speaker 3>you don't need this power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what would be the benefit of having </v>

1548
01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.410
<v Speaker 3>these people out there other than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that</v>

1549
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:51.550
<v Speaker 1>do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because we're exploring species </v>

1550
01:21:51.691 --> 01:21:53.240
<v Speaker 1>that are eventually going to want to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1551
01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:58.640
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what are we exploring remotely with </v>

1552
01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:00.861
<v Speaker 3>the rover?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aren't we exploring remotely with </v>

1553
01:22:00.861 --> 01:22:00.861
<v Speaker 3>voyager?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're still exploring.</v>

1554
01:22:00.861 --> 01:22:05.280
<v Speaker 3>We're exploring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>the proposition of going to mars is so </v>

1555
01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:09.150
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably unattractive to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I hear that 100,000</v>

1556
01:22:09.151 --> 01:22:11.820
<v Speaker 3>people signed up for mars and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's 100,000</v>

1557
01:22:11.821 --> 01:22:14.730
<v Speaker 3>people that would just drink draino.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are 100,000</v>

1558
01:22:14.731 --> 01:22:17.430
<v Speaker 3>people that would dive into a volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can put a camera on them,</v>

1559
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:19.920
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do they want to go to mars?</v>

1560
01:22:19.921 --> 01:22:22.530
<v Speaker 3>It's the shittiest neighborhood ever on </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

1561
01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:25.040
<v Speaker 3>Imagine going to some unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 3>unhappy,</v>

1562
01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:29.520
<v Speaker 3>an unpopulated inhospitable environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>on earth.</v>

1563
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:34.550
<v Speaker 3>Would you go there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you go to someplace where you're </v>

1564
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:36.450
<v Speaker 3>like sleeping on the edge of a volcano,</v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing cosmic gases through a fucking</v>

1565
01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:39.420
<v Speaker 3>giant mask because you can't breathe the</v>
<v Speaker 3>air.</v>

1566
01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:42.660
<v Speaker 3>You have to have this some air tanks and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have all this gear.</v>

1567
01:22:42.661 --> 01:22:43.770
<v Speaker 3>Just keep you alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>

1568
01:22:43.771 --> 01:22:46.320
<v Speaker 3>fuck no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would I do that when I could live in</v>

1569
01:22:46.321 --> 01:22:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would I do that when I can be in san</v>

1570
01:22:48.931 --> 01:22:49.890
<v Speaker 3>diEgo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't.</v>

1571
01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.650
<v Speaker 3>Why would you go to fucking mars?</v>

1572
01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Except that there are some people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some crazy.</v>

1573
01:22:57.831 --> 01:23:02.600
<v Speaker 1>People really want to see this new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that pay the $20,000,000</v>

1574
01:23:02.620 --> 01:23:07.620
<v Speaker 1>to build the space station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna to be hitting 50 million </v>

1575
01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:11.341
<v Speaker 1>at some point to go around the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you talk to the people who </v>

1576
01:23:11.341 --> 01:23:12.210
<v Speaker 1>went to the cost per person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 million.</v>

1577
01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:17.360
<v Speaker 1>I heard it thrown around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only rich assholes are Going to Be </v>

1578
01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:17.520
<v Speaker 1>able to afford going around the moon </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

1579
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like in the days of great </v>

1580
01:23:23.010 --> 01:23:23.010
<v Speaker 1>exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean rich assholes funded darwin's.</v>

1581
01:23:23.010 --> 01:23:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to be like cell phones where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts off with rich assholes like </v>

1582
01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Michael Douglas in wall street with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>big brick.</v>

1583
01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Huge on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually on the miracle mile show.</v>

1584
01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to third world countries and </v>

1585
01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:36.780
<v Speaker 1>everybody has a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like that.</v>

1586
01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Is that true though?</v>

1587
01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Because it's very disturbing to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people aren't more up in arms about the </v>

1588
01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:42.940
<v Speaker 1>loss of the space shuttle and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the loss,</v>

1589
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:45.800
<v Speaker 1>lack of funding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>

1590
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:50.830
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so confusing because every </v>

1591
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:51.250
<v Speaker 1>movie from when I was a kid or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>television shows.</v>

1592
01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:54.880
<v Speaker 1>You remember space 1999,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1999.</v>

1593
01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.750
<v Speaker 1>We were living in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 99.</v>

1594
01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:01.740
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

1595
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 14 and we don't have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an active space program.</v>

1596
01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:08.140
<v Speaker 1>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because there's fundamental problems</v>

1597
01:24:08.141 --> 01:24:10.580
<v Speaker 1>with the economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even space x,</v>

1598
01:24:10.581 --> 01:24:12.130
<v Speaker 1>so space x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they dId.</v>

1599
01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:15.400
<v Speaker 1>What elon did down in el segundo here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1600
01:24:15.401 --> 01:24:20.401
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we're going to do is make a low </v>

1601
01:24:20.401 --> 01:24:22.641
<v Speaker 1>cost launcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna up tHe same engines on the second </v>

1602
01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:25.171
<v Speaker 1>stage as we have in the first eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to fricking types of engines with </v>

1603
01:24:25.171 --> 01:24:27.100
<v Speaker 1>lockheed martin and boeing launchers </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're so complicated.</v>

1604
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're government contractors.</v>

1605
01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:30.520
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to bill a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1606
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.160
<v Speaker 1>They're going to overbuild the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government for being.</v>

1607
01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:34.660
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1608
01:24:34.661 --> 01:24:36.420
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it stifled innovation.</v>

1609
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:37.990
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we're getting money from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government.</v>

1610
01:24:38.010 --> 01:24:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's government contractors.</v>

1611
01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:44.320
<v Speaker 1>So what the government did in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties when aviation was just starting</v>

1612
01:24:44.321 --> 01:24:49.321
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave these contracts with these </v>

1613
01:24:49.321 --> 01:24:50.950
<v Speaker 1>little fabric error companies to run </v>
<v Speaker 1>postal mail.</v>

1614
01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:52.600
<v Speaker 1>They invented air mail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they said,</v>

1615
01:24:52.601 --> 01:24:57.601
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll create a new kind of male called </v>

1616
01:24:57.601 --> 01:25:00.331
<v Speaker 1>air mail for the post office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't go by horse and buggy or </v>

1617
01:25:00.331 --> 01:25:03.780
<v Speaker 1>train or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these little companies got enough </v>

1618
01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:07.500
<v Speaker 1>finance from that that they started </v>
<v Speaker 1>running air mail around and they became </v>

1619
01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:11.461
<v Speaker 1>continental airlines and united airlines</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of them came out of that thing </v>

1620
01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:16.150
<v Speaker 1>by moving it to private enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it nasa did and it's great wisdom.</v>

1621
01:25:16.150 --> 01:25:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it has great wisdom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>created a program in the two thousands </v>

1622
01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:23.530
<v Speaker 1>and the arts to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got space x now and you've got</v>

1623
01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:26.380
<v Speaker 1>orbital sciences at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>

1624
01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.840
<v Speaker 1>They're not inventing much in the way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>new tech.</v>

1625
01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:34.200
<v Speaker 1>They're inventing a reliable low cost </v>
<v Speaker 1>launch or just like the soviets head in </v>

1626
01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:36.130
<v Speaker 1>the sixties and still have proton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1627
01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:41.580
<v Speaker 1>low cost made an assembly line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at the air and erica mush </v>

1628
01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:44.680
<v Speaker 1>factory in Russia that makes the soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>boosters and,</v>

1629
01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:47.280
<v Speaker 1>and how they make this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soyuz craft.</v>

1630
01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:49.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like henry ford's assembly line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low cost,</v>

1631
01:25:49.871 --> 01:25:51.580
<v Speaker 1>high reliability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1632
01:25:51.581 --> 01:25:55.960
<v Speaker 1>So we had lost that culture and now it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming back with space x.</v>

1633
01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:57.820
<v Speaker 1>But the economics are still really </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotten.</v>

1634
01:25:58.150 --> 01:26:01.450
<v Speaker 1>So it's coming back because of private </v>
<v Speaker 1>funding and the private sector,</v>

1635
01:26:01.451 --> 01:26:06.451
<v Speaker 1>private sector because of competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of competition and innovation </v>

1636
01:26:06.451 --> 01:26:10.331
<v Speaker 1>coming from silicon valley and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>brains than people who work for large </v>

1637
01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:10.331
<v Speaker 1>aerospace.</v>

1638
01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:15.230
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of another example of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bureaucracy and government sort of </v>

1639
01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:15.230
<v Speaker 3>getting in thE way</v>

1640
01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:15.960
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1641
01:26:15.961 --> 01:26:18.930
<v Speaker 1>in this case they got out of the way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress and they said,</v>

1642
01:26:18.931 --> 01:26:20.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're losing the shuttle anyway.</v>

1643
01:26:20.850 --> 01:26:25.850
<v Speaker 1>We'll create this small program </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively small where we'll fund the </v>

1644
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:27.390
<v Speaker 1>winners of the competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somebody.</v>

1645
01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.460
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of like the x prize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1646
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:34.910
<v Speaker 1>This idea of challenges and prizes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the darpa prize and that's created a </v>

1647
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:37.180
<v Speaker 1>huge amount of innovation that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked.</v>

1648
01:26:37.181 --> 01:26:39.870
<v Speaker 1>That's been a government thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked because they said,</v>

1649
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:44.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cure to new astronaut glove or self </v>

1650
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:45.180
<v Speaker 1>driving robot that can track the.</v>

1651
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:50.290
<v Speaker 3>So the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so much military technology came out</v>

1652
01:26:50.901 --> 01:26:55.901
<v Speaker 3>of the apollo missions means so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much of from the space race between </v>

1653
01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:59.360
<v Speaker 3>us versus the soviets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much innovation came out of it and so</v>

1654
01:26:59.361 --> 01:27:03.250
<v Speaker 3>much of it was was very valuable as far </v>
<v Speaker 3>as military.</v>

1655
01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:06.500
<v Speaker 3>why don't I just don't understand why </v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't continue.</v>

1656
01:27:06.501 --> 01:27:08.390
<v Speaker 3>It seems like that would be a no </v>
<v Speaker 3>brainer,</v>

1657
01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:13.391
<v Speaker 3>like there will be a very important part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what the military would want and who </v>

1658
01:27:13.391 --> 01:27:15.610
<v Speaker 3>gets more money than the military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The military against an ungodly sums</v>

1659
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:17.780
<v Speaker 1>cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really,</v>

1660
01:27:17.781 --> 01:27:19.850
<v Speaker 1>really inefficient at delivering </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs.</v>

1661
01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.240
<v Speaker 1>they have a high cancel rate and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they cancel a program,</v>

1662
01:27:23.241 --> 01:27:25.040
<v Speaker 1>it's $100,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>of loss,</v>

1663
01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:30.100
<v Speaker 1>but they seem like they've just stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what the military has done with the </v>

1664
01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:34.391
<v Speaker 1>dod has done the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nasa is doing the public sector chip </v>

1665
01:27:34.391 --> 01:27:39.161
<v Speaker 1>manufacturers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything from laptops to whatever are </v>

1666
01:27:39.161 --> 01:27:41.960
<v Speaker 1>so much more advanced than what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pentagon or nasa can make that they just</v>

1667
01:27:41.961 --> 01:27:46.961
<v Speaker 1>use off the shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called cots commercial off the </v>

1668
01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:49.460
<v Speaker 1>shelf and so they're not innovating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just using laptops,</v>

1669
01:27:49.461 --> 01:27:51.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're using standard stuff they're</v>

1670
01:27:51.801 --> 01:27:54.140
<v Speaker 1>getting from industry because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry is so far ahead.</v>

1671
01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Back in the fifties they were ahead in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sixties.</v>

1672
01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Now industries are so freaking far ahead</v>
<v Speaker 1>like tesla's batteries.</v>

1673
01:28:00.321 --> 01:28:00.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can.</v>

1674
01:28:01.570 --> 01:28:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's going to create something is </v>
<v Speaker 1>superior.</v>

1675
01:28:03.861 --> 01:28:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or not?</v>

1676
01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Anytime in the near future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1677
01:28:07.630 --> 01:28:09.460
<v Speaker 1>there everyone's goes by those </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards.</v>

1678
01:28:10.170 --> 01:28:15.090
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that there is a way that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can kind of get back on track because of</v>

1679
01:28:15.091 --> 01:28:20.091
<v Speaker 3>the private sector being involved in </v>
<v Speaker 3>space travel and we can really start </v>

1680
01:28:20.091 --> 01:28:22.791
<v Speaker 3>saying man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>space travel to like we really can make </v>

1681
01:28:22.791 --> 01:28:27.721
<v Speaker 3>up for that hiccup where we thought we </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be with the shuttle down to the </v>

1682
01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:31.350
<v Speaker 3>and then with only cost 50 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>original movie alien.</v>

1683
01:28:31.351 --> 01:28:33.760
<v Speaker 3>What year was that Based in [inaudible]?</v>
<v Speaker 3>80 two.</v>

1684
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:34.880
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>79.</v>

1685
01:28:34.890 --> 01:28:35.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was 79.</v>

1686
01:28:35.730 --> 01:28:40.730
<v Speaker 3>80 nine based on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was based on not that far in the </v>

1687
01:28:40.730 --> 01:28:42.870
<v Speaker 3>future based on 2020 or something goofy </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1688
01:28:42.871 --> 01:28:43.700
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't a fee.</v>

1689
01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:45.740
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blade runner,</v>

1690
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:51.490
<v Speaker 1>2019.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los angeles raining and sidebars and </v>

1691
01:28:51.490 --> 01:28:51.930
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1692
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1693
01:28:52.401 --> 01:28:52.560
<v Speaker 1>we're.</v>

1694
01:28:52.890 --> 01:28:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Well isn't that still possible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what we were talking about </v>

1695
01:28:57.890 --> 01:29:00.291
<v Speaker 3>before about the creation of artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and the exponential growth of </v>

1696
01:29:00.291 --> 01:29:00.420
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you factor in those little things,</v>

1697
01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:02.910
<v Speaker 3>it might not 2019,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might be 2000,</v>

1698
01:29:02.911 --> 01:29:04.050
<v Speaker 3>29.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1699
01:29:04.051 --> 01:29:09.051
<v Speaker 3>they very well may have artificial life </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's indistinguishable from you are on</v>

1700
01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:13.230
<v Speaker 3>in another two or three decades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's very possible,</v>

1701
01:29:13.231 --> 01:29:13.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1702
01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:14.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1703
01:29:14.810 --> 01:29:16.160
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really not.</v>

1704
01:29:16.190 --> 01:29:21.190
<v Speaker 1>I've spent at least 10 years trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out why technology and biology </v>

1705
01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:29.260
<v Speaker 1>are counter pose systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why one doesn't do the other very well.</v>

1706
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:32.490
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1707
01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I do a talk now and then at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>singularity university,</v>

1708
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been there for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1709
01:29:38.541 --> 01:29:43.541
<v Speaker 1>but my talk is why the idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>singularity is really not possible and I</v>

1710
01:29:44.361 --> 01:29:48.170
<v Speaker 1>can show up possible not possible with </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology we have now.</v>

1711
01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:49.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what does that mean?</v>

1712
01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:51.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say not possible,</v>

1713
01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:55.880
<v Speaker 3>if things continue to go along the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>exponential rate of progress,</v>

1714
01:29:55.881 --> 01:29:57.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it continues to go,</v>

1715
01:29:58.210 --> 01:30:03.210
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean has to reach some sort of an end </v>

1716
01:30:03.210 --> 01:30:03.210
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1717
01:30:03.210 --> 01:30:06.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean it has to continue to innovate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>continue to grow as long as we have the </v>

1718
01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:06.340
<v Speaker 3>physical materials.</v>

1719
01:30:06.530 --> 01:30:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Parents thought that parents read a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of science articles and popular science </v>

1720
01:30:11.530 --> 01:30:14.840
<v Speaker 1>journals and I remember sitting with him</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his house in Hawaii,</v>

1721
01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:20.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up half the night trying to to explain </v>

1722
01:30:20.170 --> 01:30:21.830
<v Speaker 1>to parents why this idea was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>feasible.</v>

1723
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well terrence,</v>

1724
01:30:24.010 --> 01:30:29.010
<v Speaker 1>yoU know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see we just done a whole virtual </v>

1725
01:30:29.010 --> 01:30:29.010
<v Speaker 1>world thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1726
01:30:29.010 --> 01:30:30.140
<v Speaker 1>terrence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the virtual world that we just were in,</v>

1727
01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.520
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

1728
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:35.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a a cardboard cutout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing in it.</v>

1729
01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:40.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just polygons rendered in a scene </v>
<v Speaker 1>by a serial processor that's getting </v>

1730
01:30:41.001 --> 01:30:44.300
<v Speaker 1>bits from a server and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely fragile.</v>

1731
01:30:44.301 --> 01:30:48.830
<v Speaker 1>It looks realistic to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a complete cardboard cutout and</v>

1732
01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:54.010
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's if you look down from terrence's </v>

1733
01:30:54.010 --> 01:30:56.801
<v Speaker 1>house down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a captain cook and you looked at the </v>

1734
01:30:56.801 --> 01:30:56.801
<v Speaker 1>pacific ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1735
01:30:56.801 --> 01:31:00.610
<v Speaker 1>you take a glass full of water from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean of what heck is going on in that </v>

1736
01:31:01.971 --> 01:31:05.030
<v Speaker 1>class full of water and computational </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms is just mind blowing.</v>

1737
01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:10.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a computational superpower and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that glass of water could not be </v>

1738
01:31:11.210 --> 01:31:16.210
<v Speaker 1>simulated accurately by all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers we've ever built all running </v>

1739
01:31:16.210 --> 01:31:16.370
<v Speaker 1>at once.</v>

1740
01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Not today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but couldn't it be a thousand years now.</v>

1741
01:31:18.871 --> 01:31:23.871
<v Speaker 3>It's not possible to continue to stay </v>
<v Speaker 3>alive and innovation continues to push </v>

1742
01:31:23.871 --> 01:31:26.740
<v Speaker 3>the boundaries of whAt's possible as far</v>
<v Speaker 3>as computing mean.</v>

1743
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:30.510
<v Speaker 3>you can only imagine what's capable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're capable of 100 years from now,</v>

1744
01:31:30.850 --> 01:31:33.190
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is we're building what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're building.</v>

1745
01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:35.260
<v Speaker 1>say for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the steam engine,</v>

1746
01:31:35.261 --> 01:31:39.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The steam engine was large bore diameter</v>

1747
01:31:39.490 --> 01:31:40.300
<v Speaker 1>pistons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1748
01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Starting to 18 twenties and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got smaller and smaller and better </v>

1749
01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:45.970
<v Speaker 1>and better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got motors,</v>

1750
01:31:45.971 --> 01:31:48.550
<v Speaker 1>we've got low commoditY and we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>gasoline.</v>

1751
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the the piston and camshaft model is</v>

1752
01:31:53.171 --> 01:31:55.360
<v Speaker 1>still what drives your tesla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1753
01:31:55.390 --> 01:31:56.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe not because it doesn't that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pistons,</v>

1754
01:31:56.951 --> 01:31:59.370
<v Speaker 1>and I know that's an electric motor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it for thing,</v>

1755
01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:00.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1756
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:02.320
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It got miniaturize,</v>

1757
01:32:02.321 --> 01:32:06.430
<v Speaker 1>it got better and better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was stuck in a rigid framework of</v>

1758
01:32:06.431 --> 01:32:11.431
<v Speaker 1>what Its limitations work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Computers are also stuck in that </v>

1759
01:32:11.431 --> 01:32:11.590
<v Speaker 1>framework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1760
01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:15.160
<v Speaker 1>john von neumann,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he designed the von neumann machine</v>

1761
01:32:15.161 --> 01:32:18.400
<v Speaker 1>and at in princeton in 1948,</v>
<v Speaker 1>49,</v>

1762
01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:21.940
<v Speaker 1>and they built this first really </v>
<v Speaker 1>reliable,</v>

1763
01:32:21.941 --> 01:32:26.941
<v Speaker 1>no patch cord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of registers and memory and vacuum </v>

1764
01:32:26.981 --> 01:32:31.981
<v Speaker 1>tubes and drums and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got all working by 1952 and then </v>

1765
01:32:31.981 --> 01:32:32.950
<v Speaker 1>they gave the plans away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1766
01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.860
<v Speaker 1>von neumann,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creator of this wrote,</v>

1767
01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:41.280
<v Speaker 1>this is a contingency architecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just to get something to </v>

1768
01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.290
<v Speaker 1>actually work and not break down in 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and do something,</v>

1769
01:32:44.291 --> 01:32:49.291
<v Speaker 1>but it is no way a strong architecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to dealing with</v>

1770
01:32:49.511 --> 01:32:50.740
<v Speaker 1>natural systems.</v>

1771
01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:56.280
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how haven't they overcome a lot of </v>

1772
01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:58.641
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in theory with quantum </v>

1773
01:32:58.641 --> 01:32:58.641
<v Speaker 3>computing.</v>

1774
01:32:58.641 --> 01:32:58.641
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all I'm.</v>

1775
01:32:58.641 --> 01:33:03.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sold on that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that those are extremely </v>

1776
01:33:03.090 --> 01:33:03.900
<v Speaker 1>specialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1777
01:33:03.901 --> 01:33:07.410
<v Speaker 1>very small processes that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really even understand what's going on.</v>

1778
01:33:07.570 --> 01:33:12.570
<v Speaker 3>But doesn't It open up the potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you go back to the invention of </v>

1779
01:33:12.570 --> 01:33:13.120
<v Speaker 3>the steam engine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you compare it with a tesla and you look</v>

1780
01:33:13.121 --> 01:33:18.121
<v Speaker 3>at the x amount of hundreds of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a plus of innovation that led to </v>

1781
01:33:18.121 --> 01:33:22.951
<v Speaker 3>this incredible leap in technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you just extrapolate and say like </v>

1782
01:33:22.951 --> 01:33:27.121
<v Speaker 3>what we have today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't possibly say that like flash </v>

1783
01:33:27.121 --> 01:33:28.270
<v Speaker 3>drives and three gigabyte processes as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the end all be all.</v>

1784
01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:30.130
<v Speaker 3>If we can't do it it with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're never going to be.</v>

1785
01:33:31.090 --> 01:33:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it true that perhaps in the year </v>
<v Speaker 1>2050 there will be a computer with a </v>

1786
01:33:37.001 --> 01:33:40.750
<v Speaker 1>serial processor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe lots of like might have a thousand</v>

1787
01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:43.780
<v Speaker 1>cpas or more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still doing the same thing.</v>

1788
01:33:43.781 --> 01:33:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because</v>

1789
01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:46.750
<v Speaker 3>tied to legacy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have to be.</v>

1790
01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:51.960
<v Speaker 3>It has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why does it have to be doing the </v>

1791
01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:54.411
<v Speaker 3>same thing that it's doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If quantum computing really does turn </v>

1792
01:33:54.411 --> 01:33:55.770
<v Speaker 3>out to pan out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a has to run microsoft word.</v>

1793
01:33:55.850 --> 01:34:00.850
<v Speaker 3>Why does it have to run microsoft word?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because as the forces that are driving </v>

1794
01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:00.850
<v Speaker 3>the evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of.</v>

1795
01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:05.480
<v Speaker 3>But I mean like microsoft word today has</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost no relation to microsoft word of </v>

1796
01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:06.690
<v Speaker 3>windows 95.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1797
01:34:06.691 --> 01:34:09.890
<v Speaker 3>it's barely connectable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually slower.</v>

1798
01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:12.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does a lot more though,</v>

1799
01:34:12.571 --> 01:34:13.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does more.</v>

1800
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:15.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where</v>

1801
01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:19.150
<v Speaker 1>bloatware in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a 19,</v>

1802
01:34:19.151 --> 01:34:23.560
<v Speaker 1>91st three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>86 computer running windows.</v>

1803
01:34:23.561 --> 01:34:24.240
<v Speaker 1>three point one.</v>

1804
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000
<v Speaker 3>Mcguire had one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He kept that shit deep into the </v>

1805
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:30.980
<v Speaker 3>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man that I had it in like 97,</v>

1806
01:34:30.981 --> 01:34:32.120
<v Speaker 3>98.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He kept at.</v>

1807
01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.860
<v Speaker 3>oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Windows three point one.</v>

1808
01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:36.020
<v Speaker 3>I booted this up the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes up.</v>

1809
01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so fast.</v>

1810
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:38.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm running</v>

1811
01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:39.030
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm running.</v>

1812
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing email in aol like so quick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I go.</v>

1813
01:34:43.710 --> 01:34:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Then I go to my modern machines is </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

1814
01:34:46.171 --> 01:34:46.500
<v Speaker 1>times</v>

1815
01:34:46.690 --> 01:34:47.440
<v Speaker 3>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1816
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:51.310
<v Speaker 3>oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another processor glitch has happened in</v>

1817
01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:56.311
<v Speaker 3>the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have of laconic processes happening in </v>

1818
01:34:56.311 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 3>windows or painting slowly because this </v>
<v Speaker 3>bloke layer</v>

1819
01:34:58.190 --> 01:35:01.180
<v Speaker 2>upon layer upon layer of crabs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really have that much of a heart.</v>

1820
01:35:01.181 --> 01:35:02.180
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you run?</v>

1821
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Windows or unix or what are you run </v>
<v Speaker 2>through?</v>

1822
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1823
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:08.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm running vms,</v>

1824
01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:13.660
<v Speaker 2>like I run machines run like windows on </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of a mack plan for him and I have </v>

1825
01:35:15.201 --> 01:35:18.680
<v Speaker 2>tweaked and I go into all these forums </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

1826
01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:20.030
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1827
01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:25.060
<v Speaker 2>windows seven not on a vm has all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible problems with a search </v>

1828
01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:29.600
<v Speaker 2>indexer with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to stop this because it'll </v>

1829
01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:29.720
<v Speaker 2>totally choked the operating system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to stop that.</v>

1830
01:35:29.721 --> 01:35:31.190
<v Speaker 2>You got to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have to.</v>

1831
01:35:31.191 --> 01:35:36.191
<v Speaker 2>It's like an automobile in 1910.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get to be a mechanic to keep it </v>

1832
01:35:36.191 --> 01:35:38.480
<v Speaker 2>working efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stuff is so bad,</v>

1833
01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.760
<v Speaker 2>but you're running some really </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated stuff though.</v>

1834
01:35:40.761 --> 01:35:43.400
<v Speaker 2>If you're running virtual machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm running.</v>

1835
01:35:43.670 --> 01:35:45.320
<v Speaker 2>You're essentially running a heart.</v>

1836
01:35:45.330 --> 01:35:46.970
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're running an operating system,</v>

1837
01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:52.120
<v Speaker 2>then you're running another operating </v>
<v Speaker 2>system on your operating system that's </v>

1838
01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:54.650
<v Speaker 2>operating simultaneously and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of rich source,</v>

1839
01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:59.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's using the same hardware.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what it exposes is the incredibly </v>

1840
01:36:00.130 --> 01:36:04.070
<v Speaker 2>how incredibly poor we are as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That writing software that's good and it</v>

1841
01:36:04.071 --> 01:36:08.210
<v Speaker 2>stays stable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is just super duper complex.</v>

1842
01:36:08.211 --> 01:36:13.211
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem with things </v>

1843
01:36:13.211 --> 01:36:13.211
<v Speaker 2>crashing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1844
01:36:13.211 --> 01:36:13.280
<v Speaker 2>if you compare it to like with windows </v>
<v Speaker 2>95,</v>

1845
01:36:13.281 --> 01:36:16.820
<v Speaker 2>used to be like windows 95,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the blue screen of death all the</v>

1846
01:36:16.821 --> 01:36:21.821
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My favorite story is if we're halfway </v>

1847
01:36:21.821 --> 01:36:25.211
<v Speaker 2>between earth and the stars unite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're halfway to alpha centauri and the </v>

1848
01:36:25.211 --> 01:36:28.490
<v Speaker 2>3000 crew are and their deep sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly they're all woken up.</v>

1849
01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:31.310
<v Speaker 2>They're getting out of their vessels and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go and they,</v>

1850
01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:36.410
<v Speaker 2>they look at the screens on the bridge </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're all blue and it says press </v>

1851
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:37.550
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alt delete.</v>

1852
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:42.550
<v Speaker 2>You will lose all data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we realized we were running dos </v>

1853
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:45.170
<v Speaker 2>underneath all of this technology layer </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon layer,</v>

1854
01:36:45.171 --> 01:36:46.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll be doomed.</v>

1855
01:36:46.401 --> 01:36:48.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really confused about your,</v>

1856
01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:50.120
<v Speaker 2>your idea because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1857
01:36:50.121 --> 01:36:55.121
<v Speaker 2>you seem to think the things we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>better off when they were lIke really </v>

1858
01:36:55.121 --> 01:36:58.061
<v Speaker 2>clunky and they couldn't run as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>software and the software wasn't as </v>

1859
01:36:58.061 --> 01:36:58.580
<v Speaker 2>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

1860
01:36:58.581 --> 01:37:03.581
<v Speaker 2>windows xp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when they discontinued support of </v>

1861
01:37:03.581 --> 01:37:04.010
<v Speaker 2>xp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

1862
01:37:04.050 --> 01:37:09.050
<v Speaker 2>You found out there were millions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions and accompanies that were just </v>

1863
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:10.340
<v Speaker 2>totally depend on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saying this is so robust.</v>

1864
01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:14.700
<v Speaker 2>This is so such good software and since </v>
<v Speaker 2>xp,</v>

1865
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:19.750
<v Speaker 2>that course they went to vista,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a disaster and the windows </v>

1866
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:21.590
<v Speaker 2>seven was sort of recovery and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>windows eight was sort of a disaster and</v>

1867
01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:25.850
<v Speaker 2>now of course the evolution of mac ios </v>
<v Speaker 2>is maybe a little different.</v>

1868
01:37:25.870 --> 01:37:27.500
<v Speaker 2>It's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fantastic.</v>

1869
01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:30.320
<v Speaker 2>The macro s is so much better than it </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever was.</v>

1870
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The days,</v>

1871
01:37:32.961 --> 01:37:37.961
<v Speaker 2>the pre intel days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the before rhapsody and before mark and </v>

1872
01:37:37.961 --> 01:37:37.961
<v Speaker 2>unix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1873
01:37:37.961 --> 01:37:39.800
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a kluge.</v>

1874
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:42.680
<v Speaker 2>The macro s didn't have preemptive </v>
<v Speaker 2>multitasking,</v>

1875
01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:44.690
<v Speaker 2>no memory protection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no memory protection,</v>

1876
01:37:44.691 --> 01:37:49.691
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stayed away from max until the unix </v>

1877
01:37:49.691 --> 01:37:51.860
<v Speaker 2>got onto the 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One 10 came along with him a lot.</v>

1878
01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at how can we be so bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're</v>

1879
01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:00.640
<v Speaker 1>spending the maximum amount of cash and </v>
<v Speaker 1>only one or two companies and one or two</v>

1880
01:38:00.890 --> 01:38:05.890
<v Speaker 1>ever efforts make something that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not really good at software </v>

1881
01:38:05.890 --> 01:38:05.940
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

1882
01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.250
<v Speaker 3>You're talking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is your.</v>

1883
01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:12.240
<v Speaker 3>You're like extreme pessimistic attitude</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards innovation.</v>

1884
01:38:12.241 --> 01:38:12.330
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1885
01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Growing up in the software business and </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1886
01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:20.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing how things actually get done and </v>

1887
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:23.871
<v Speaker 1>then you meet a futurist or popularizer </v>
<v Speaker 1>who comes up with this wild thing and </v>

1888
01:38:23.871 --> 01:38:26.790
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's working on the project for one.</v>

1889
01:38:27.150 --> 01:38:32.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no investment going into say </v>

1890
01:38:32.150 --> 01:38:32.150
<v Speaker 1>putting consciousness and computers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>

1891
01:38:32.150 --> 01:38:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I always ask the question,</v>

1892
01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:39.100
<v Speaker 3>putting consciousness into computers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about a completely </v>

1893
01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:39.140
<v Speaker 3>different thing now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talking about software develoPment first</v>

1894
01:38:39.141 --> 01:38:41.690
<v Speaker 3>and you cited will soft software </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing,</v>

1895
01:38:41.691 --> 01:38:46.691
<v Speaker 3>creating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cited one excellent operating </v>

1896
01:38:46.691 --> 01:38:46.691
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mac ios,</v>

1897
01:38:46.691 --> 01:38:47.700
<v Speaker 3>which exists right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we are.</v>

1898
01:38:47.701 --> 01:38:49.610
<v Speaker 3>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to say no one is writing it,</v>

1899
01:38:49.611 --> 01:38:51.680
<v Speaker 3>but it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on it right now.</v>

1900
01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:52.580
<v Speaker 3>It's fantastic,</v>

1901
01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:57.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's doing stuff that has been done </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 35 years in different operating </v>

1902
01:38:58.381 --> 01:38:58.620
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

1903
01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:03.660
<v Speaker 3>different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's one of the big things that </v>

1904
01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:04.030
<v Speaker 3>happened when the transfer to osx came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there was this big.</v>

1905
01:39:04.090 --> 01:39:08.530
<v Speaker 3>You had to get rid of all the old </v>
<v Speaker 3>software because all the legacy software</v>

1906
01:39:08.531 --> 01:39:13.531
<v Speaker 3>was no longer useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't use it because it was </v>

1907
01:39:13.531 --> 01:39:13.531
<v Speaker 3>running on a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 3>platform.</v>

1908
01:39:13.531 --> 01:39:14.800
<v Speaker 3>So that right there sort of contradicts </v>
<v Speaker 3>your idea,</v>

1909
01:39:14.801 --> 01:39:15.130
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it?</v>

1910
01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:19.550
<v Speaker 1>The thing is if you talk to somebody say</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1990,</v>

1911
01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:21.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1912
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:22.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1913
01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:27.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where will software evolution be in </v>

1914
01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:29.681
<v Speaker 1>2015?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They Probably would just like your </v>

1915
01:39:29.681 --> 01:39:29.720
<v Speaker 1>disappoint with the space program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1916
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:35.290
<v Speaker 1>It's disappointing in the software </v>
<v Speaker 1>business is the software business is </v>

1917
01:39:35.290 --> 01:39:37.610
<v Speaker 1>grinding away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what jaron lanier talks about.</v>

1918
01:39:37.611 --> 01:39:42.611
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote this thing caLled half a </v>

1919
01:39:42.611 --> 01:39:44.031
<v Speaker 1>manifesto about 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like we are so burdened by </v>

1920
01:39:44.031 --> 01:39:46.940
<v Speaker 1>legacy and for poor practices that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>just add.</v>

1921
01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:51.290
<v Speaker 1>We're building like a tower of babel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes works well sometimes doesn't,</v>

1922
01:39:51.291 --> 01:39:53.780
<v Speaker 1>but we add layer upon layer upon layer </v>
<v Speaker 1>without thinking.</v>

1923
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:58.180
<v Speaker 1>So we're not building great pyramids at </v>
<v Speaker 1>giza were building some kind of tower of</v>

1924
01:39:58.181 --> 01:40:01.130
<v Speaker 1>babel of technology that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>patchwork together.</v>

1925
01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:06.320
<v Speaker 3>maybe you just know more about it than I</v>
<v Speaker 3>do because when I look at it objective </v>

1926
01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:06.480
<v Speaker 3>as someone who's not involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry,</v>

1927
01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:10.980
<v Speaker 3>all I'm seeing is continual innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I'm seeing is things getting better,</v>

1928
01:40:10.981 --> 01:40:15.330
<v Speaker 3>crisper move better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boot up faster when he went last.</v>

1929
01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:15.790
<v Speaker 3>I agree</v>

1930
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:20.790
<v Speaker 1>witH you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we went to say the ipad and mobile </v>

1931
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:21.140
<v Speaker 1>devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could throw away all that legacy to</v>

1932
01:40:21.141 --> 01:40:25.480
<v Speaker 1>say throw it no more compact discs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw it in the trash,</v>

1933
01:40:25.481 --> 01:40:30.481
<v Speaker 1>no more file systems and layer and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will build a brand new operating system </v>

1934
01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:35.620
<v Speaker 1>running on flash memory and get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crap and we'll even have new ways to</v>

1935
01:40:35.621 --> 01:40:37.090
<v Speaker 1>do applications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when that happened,</v>

1936
01:40:37.091 --> 01:40:39.130
<v Speaker 1>it was like a hUge breath of fresh air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1937
01:40:39.730 --> 01:40:42.070
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't 500,000</v>

1938
01:40:42.071 --> 01:40:45.550
<v Speaker 1>features to my mail program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just does mail.</v>

1939
01:40:45.551 --> 01:40:50.020
<v Speaker 1>And we dumbed it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We made it super simple to get away from</v>

1940
01:40:50.021 --> 01:40:53.890
<v Speaker 1>our natural tendency to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the space station are going example,</v>

1941
01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:56.320
<v Speaker 1>like space stations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So complicated,</v>

1942
01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:59.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has its 15 nations are 13 nations.</v>

1943
01:40:59.291 --> 01:41:01.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a hundred and 50 kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>connectors on it,</v>

1944
01:41:02.530 --> 01:41:07.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is designed to be remotely run </v>

1945
01:41:07.530 --> 01:41:07.530
<v Speaker 1>without any crew.</v>

1946
01:41:07.530 --> 01:41:11.730
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the initial design </v>
<v Speaker 1>criteria that we should be able to </v>

1947
01:41:11.730 --> 01:41:11.830
<v Speaker 1>completely remotely run in the space </v>
<v Speaker 1>station.</v>

1948
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:17.070
<v Speaker 1>So it has laptops and ancient computers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and huge millions of lines of code to </v>

1949
01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:22.390
<v Speaker 1>run the space station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a huge cost,</v>

1950
01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:24.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge burden to keep that thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

1951
01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Go back to skylab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1952
01:41:26.471 --> 01:41:30.010
<v Speaker 1>you're old enough to probably remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>skylab was a tin can,</v>

1953
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:35.350
<v Speaker 1>does an upper stage of the saturn five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful saturn five most reliable </v>

1954
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:37.600
<v Speaker 1>booster in history thrown away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the last ones,</v>

1955
01:41:37.601 --> 01:41:40.290
<v Speaker 1>they launched the upper stage as a tin </v>
<v Speaker 1>cans,</v>

1956
01:41:40.291 --> 01:41:44.200
<v Speaker 1>space station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solar panels up super simple,</v>

1957
01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:47.290
<v Speaker 1>huge interior space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys could run around it,</v>

1958
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:50.140
<v Speaker 1>remember how they could run and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1959
01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:55.380
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful model of a space station </v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't require more than a 30 </v>

1960
01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:59.101
<v Speaker 1>percent of crew time to sort of keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintenance going on the international </v>

1961
01:41:59.101 --> 01:42:02.821
<v Speaker 1>space station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crew or are overwhelmed with </v>

1962
01:42:02.821 --> 01:42:03.070
<v Speaker 1>maintenance chores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so complicated.</v>

1963
01:42:03.071 --> 01:42:05.830
<v Speaker 1>So we built something and I asked a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend at nasa,</v>

1964
01:42:05.831 --> 01:42:10.831
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you put boosters on the space </v>

1965
01:42:10.831 --> 01:42:12.841
<v Speaker 1>station and senate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to send it to mars to carry a </v>

1966
01:42:12.841 --> 01:42:15.841
<v Speaker 1>crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said they'd be dead in a month because </v>

1967
01:42:15.841 --> 01:42:20.650
<v Speaker 1>we're constantly having to send up parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and repair shit that's breaking is not a</v>

1968
01:42:20.651 --> 01:42:25.651
<v Speaker 1>sustainable platform currently without a</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge amount of maintenance and resupply </v>

1969
01:42:25.781 --> 01:42:27.010
<v Speaker 1>and constant management.</v>

1970
01:42:27.330 --> 01:42:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm like an operating system.</v>

1971
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:31.200
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your pessimism though,</v>

1972
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:35.280
<v Speaker 3>because it seems to me that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really want to like nitpick and focus on</v>

1973
01:42:35.281 --> 01:42:40.281
<v Speaker 3>this blip in time is one blip in time </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they may be peaks and valleys in </v>

1974
01:42:40.281 --> 01:42:44.811
<v Speaker 3>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately it seems to be sort of </v>

1975
01:42:44.811 --> 01:42:48.990
<v Speaker 3>inexorably moving towards progress or </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving towards complexity.</v>

1976
01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:50.190
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did you agree with that?</v>

1977
01:42:50.290 --> 01:42:55.290
<v Speaker 1>But the progress say toward having </v>
<v Speaker 1>something as good as biology.</v>

1978
01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.760
<v Speaker 1>How biology operates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Operating and technology is a big </v>

1979
01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.150
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technology is this,</v>

1980
01:43:04.330 --> 01:43:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean the biology of the cell and how a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell metabolizes products,</v>

1981
01:43:08.891 --> 01:43:11.560
<v Speaker 1>how it manages its energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has its feedback.</v>

1982
01:43:11.561 --> 01:43:14.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cell is like a huge cityscape working.</v>

1983
01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:16.830
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 nine point nine,</v>

1984
01:43:16.831 --> 01:43:17.980
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine percent of the time,</v>

1985
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:20.440
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you'd be just mush flowing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground,</v>

1986
01:43:20.610 --> 01:43:21.100
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't,</v>

1987
01:43:21.250 --> 01:43:26.250
<v Speaker 3>are we talking about biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>processes like processing proteins and </v>

1988
01:43:26.250 --> 01:43:26.650
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1989
01:43:26.651 --> 01:43:31.651
<v Speaker 3>That won't necessarily be necessary if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have something artificial silicon </v>

1990
01:43:31.651 --> 01:43:35.971
<v Speaker 3>based,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's running on electricity </v>

1991
01:43:35.971 --> 01:43:35.971
<v Speaker 3>and technology and lithium ion batteries</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1992
01:43:35.971 --> 01:43:36.340
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1993
01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:39.580
<v Speaker 1>it's based on two week of a model of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics.</v>

1994
01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:42.200
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

1995
01:43:42.210 --> 01:43:47.210
<v Speaker 1>here's the metaphor that I use and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is why computer people hate this idea </v>

1996
01:43:48.010 --> 01:43:49.360
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What idea?</v>

1997
01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:53.450
<v Speaker 1>The idea that life based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>probabilistic events.</v>

1998
01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:56.480
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how you digest sugar.</v>

1999
01:43:56.481 --> 01:44:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Say you take a nice big bolus of sugar </v>
<v Speaker 1>into your body.</v>

2000
01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2001
01:44:02.061 --> 01:44:07.061
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sugar molecule will come into </v>

2002
01:44:07.061 --> 01:44:09.131
<v Speaker 1>yourself at some point somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will hit this molecular storm of shit</v>

2003
01:44:10.371 --> 01:44:12.200
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly water molecule.</v>

2004
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:17.470
<v Speaker 1>It will ricochet around the cell hitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>just about every other molecule that it </v>

2005
01:44:18.141 --> 01:44:20.440
<v Speaker 1>can in the cell for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

2006
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:25.450
<v Speaker 1>half to seconds until it hits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hits exactly the right place on a </v>

2007
01:44:25.450 --> 01:44:28.610
<v Speaker 1>molecule that has a pocket of the sugar </v>
<v Speaker 1>fits in perfectly.</v>

2008
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:32.270
<v Speaker 1>And that thing will cause it to band and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go click,</v>

2009
01:44:32.271 --> 01:44:36.470
<v Speaker 1>click and make it into a polysaccharide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an important valuable thing,</v>

2010
01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:42.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's all done through this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is going on as a probabilistic </v>

2011
01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:43.070
<v Speaker 1>stochastic process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely nuts,</v>

2012
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:48.490
<v Speaker 1>but that's how nature is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you compare that process to </v>

2013
01:44:48.681 --> 01:44:51.320
<v Speaker 1>the way a computer would work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a computer designer would say,</v>

2014
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:56.350
<v Speaker 1>well that's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole lot of wasted steps and </v>

2015
01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:58.640
<v Speaker 1>computation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just build a assembly line.</v>

2016
01:44:58.641 --> 01:45:01.790
<v Speaker 1>we'll take that sugar in and along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar line and we'll hit my thing out.</v>

2017
01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Digested immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2018
01:45:03.291 --> 01:45:08.291
<v Speaker 1>it turns out if you do things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so rigid that they break almost </v>

2019
01:45:08.291 --> 01:45:10.760
<v Speaker 1>immediately and in real world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

2020
01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:15.530
<v Speaker 3>But this isn't this if you're imitating </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological synthesis or biological life.</v>

2021
01:45:15.531 --> 01:45:17.990
<v Speaker 3>And why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're creating something artificial,</v>

2022
01:45:18.230 --> 01:45:23.230
<v Speaker 3>all you need to do to create an </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial person as have it behave.</v>

2023
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Think compute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>react like a person.</v>

2024
01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:30.530
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't need to process proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these are all.</v>

2025
01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:33.710
<v Speaker 3>that's legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that like being tied to legacy?</v>

2026
01:45:33.711 --> 01:45:36.260
<v Speaker 3>What do you throw away from what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person is?</v>

2027
01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:41.320
<v Speaker 3>How do you define,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say consciousness or I don't think you </v>

2028
01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:41.900
<v Speaker 3>would call it a person at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you call it a person?</v>

2029
01:45:42.130 --> 01:45:44.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not throwing it away.</v>

2030
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:48.990
<v Speaker 3>What I'm talking about is creating </v>
<v Speaker 3>something completely unique and wouldn't</v>

2031
01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:53.210
<v Speaker 3>have to be a duplicate of a person I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have to do is look like one.</v>

2032
01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then we're building cardboard </v>

2033
01:45:58.540 --> 01:45:58.540
<v Speaker 1>simulacra again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really aren't the real thing.</v>

2034
01:45:58.730 --> 01:46:01.250
<v Speaker 1>If you sent that person or the New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>subway system,</v>

2035
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:06.310
<v Speaker 1>that robot robotic entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be soon overwhelmed with </v>

2036
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:07.010
<v Speaker 1>stimulus and programs</v>

2037
01:46:07.290 --> 01:46:09.690
<v Speaker 3>unless she conditions before it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you,</v>

2038
01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:12.990
<v Speaker 3>unless you built human being one point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2039
01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:18.200
<v Speaker 3>and you found the flaws and then built </v>
<v Speaker 3>two point zero and found the flaws and </v>

2040
01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:21.621
<v Speaker 3>keep going the same way we've described </v>
<v Speaker 3>already with operating systems from </v>

2041
01:46:21.621 --> 01:46:24.591
<v Speaker 3>1995.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A mere blip in time to 2014 and the </v>

2042
01:46:24.591 --> 01:46:25.950
<v Speaker 3>massive amount of progress has been made</v>
<v Speaker 3>since then.</v>

2043
01:46:26.130 --> 01:46:28.960
<v Speaker 3>If you did that with computer generated </v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

2044
01:46:29.010 --> 01:46:29.380
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

2045
01:46:29.381 --> 01:46:30.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>electronically generated,</v>

2046
01:46:30.631 --> 01:46:33.060
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to call artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>life forms that we've created.</v>

2047
01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:38.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just stands to reason given enough </v>

2048
01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:38.360
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No asteroids,</v>

2049
01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:38.930
<v Speaker 3>supervolcanoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no ebola,</v>

2050
01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:40.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humans are going to get there.</v>

2051
01:46:41.710 --> 01:46:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a harder problem than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can suppose.</v>

2052
01:46:44.710 --> 01:46:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Like nancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard because we don't </v>

2053
01:46:49.710 --> 01:46:51.960
<v Speaker 1>understand how basic really functions </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we don't understand,</v>

2054
01:46:51.961 --> 01:46:53.060
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2055
01:46:53.070 --> 01:46:55.710
<v Speaker 1>here's another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neuron,</v>

2056
01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:57.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with 10,000</v>

2057
01:46:57.091 --> 01:47:02.091
<v Speaker 1>connections and the body and the sodium </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel and there's all these things </v>

2058
01:47:02.091 --> 01:47:06.090
<v Speaker 1>that come out and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neurotransmitters are generated into</v>

2059
01:47:06.091 --> 01:47:08.190
<v Speaker 1>this pole and they carry the signal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2060
01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:13.640
<v Speaker 1>The neuron Is so frickin big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do something called molecular dynamics</v>

2061
01:47:14.311 --> 01:47:19.311
<v Speaker 1>simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our team has done that where you just </v>

2062
01:47:19.311 --> 01:47:19.740
<v Speaker 1>simulating a molecules wiggling </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

2063
01:47:20.250 --> 01:47:25.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're doing this now for protein </v>

2064
01:47:25.250 --> 01:47:28.110
<v Speaker 1>folding where they get 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>atoms all arranged in the right place in</v>

2065
01:47:28.111 --> 01:47:31.620
<v Speaker 1>the simulation and the computer so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it behaves like a real protein would do,</v>

2066
01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:34.470
<v Speaker 1>which is fold and do all this weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>geometry.</v>

2067
01:47:34.530 --> 01:47:37.920
<v Speaker 1>So they have to simulate the protein </v>
<v Speaker 1>being slammed by water all the time.</v>

2068
01:47:37.921 --> 01:47:42.921
<v Speaker 1>It's this crazy process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might take those guys a month of </v>

2069
01:47:42.921 --> 01:47:44.640
<v Speaker 1>computation on a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A 10,000</v>

2070
01:47:44.641 --> 01:47:49.641
<v Speaker 1>processors to simulate a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nanoseconds of that action because </v>

2071
01:47:49.890 --> 01:47:54.890
<v Speaker 1>otherwise the simulated protein just </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't behave like it really does in </v>

2072
01:47:54.890 --> 01:47:56.040
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that hard.</v>

2073
01:47:56.150 --> 01:48:01.150
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think we're in agreement that </v>

2074
01:48:01.150 --> 01:48:03.790
<v Speaker 3>replicating absolute biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>processes would be insanely difficult.</v>

2075
01:48:03.851 --> 01:48:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Saying may take forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my question is why is that necessary</v>

2076
01:48:07.851 --> 01:48:10.340
<v Speaker 3>to create something new that can think </v>
<v Speaker 3>for itself?</v>

2077
01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Because here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you created something very small,</v>

2078
01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:19.420
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a human walking around the New York </v>

2079
01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:19.420
<v Speaker 1>subway system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something we're.</v>

2080
01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:20.840
<v Speaker 1>What world does it live in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2081
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:23.270
<v Speaker 1>he lives in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a robot,</v>

2082
01:48:23.271 --> 01:48:27.200
<v Speaker 1>say it's a little insectoid robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What world does it have to live in?</v>

2083
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Just living in this world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

2084
01:48:30.230 --> 01:48:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it lives,</v>

2085
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:33.530
<v Speaker 1>say on a factory floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good example,</v>

2086
01:48:33.710 --> 01:48:36.020
<v Speaker 1>factory floor robots are really getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2087
01:48:36.290 --> 01:48:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Like they can carry shit around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can track spots on the floor and </v>

2088
01:48:41.290 --> 01:48:44.330
<v Speaker 1>they can do all kinds of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they ever go out in the parking,</v>

2089
01:48:44.331 --> 01:48:47.510
<v Speaker 1>if you put them out in the parking lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where they're out of.</v>

2090
01:48:47.511 --> 01:48:52.511
<v Speaker 1>They're very controlled theory in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtual world when they're in a factor </v>

2091
01:48:52.511 --> 01:48:55.301
<v Speaker 1>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see tape and marks and fire codes </v>

2092
01:48:55.301 --> 01:48:58.130
<v Speaker 1>and all kinds of things that create the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental model inside the robot,</v>

2093
01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:03.640
<v Speaker 1>but if it goes into nature and the chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the natural world and vehicles moving</v>

2094
01:49:04.221 --> 01:49:06.310
<v Speaker 1>around and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2095
01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:11.380
<v Speaker 1>the darpa grand challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has all these great teams making </v>

2096
01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:11.380
<v Speaker 1>robots are self driving.</v>

2097
01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:13.870
<v Speaker 1>They found out reAl fast that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2098
01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:16.040
<v Speaker 1>this is hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super hard</v>

2099
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:17.150
<v Speaker 3>currently hard but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2100
01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:22.180
<v Speaker 3>but isn't the new tesla d you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone home with this thing and it will </v>

2101
01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:22.550
<v Speaker 3>literally drive to you.</v>

2102
01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:25.840
<v Speaker 1>And I heard a rumor by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is maybe a,</v>

2103
01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:30.960
<v Speaker 1>a google car in a self driving google </v>
<v Speaker 1>car that on the eight 80 there was a,</v>

2104
01:49:33.730 --> 01:49:38.730
<v Speaker 1>a google self driving car scene that had</v>
<v Speaker 1>an irish setter sitting.</v>

2105
01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:41.130
<v Speaker 1>You're done and we'll hear a dog on her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2106
01:49:41.770 --> 01:49:44.380
<v Speaker 1>It was sitting in the passenger seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no one else in it.</v>

2107
01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:48.890
<v Speaker 1>And the cops were told about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are calling this,</v>

2108
01:49:48.891 --> 01:49:49.750
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this car.</v>

2109
01:49:49.751 --> 01:49:54.751
<v Speaker 1>There's this irish setter is driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>this car and the cops come up and </v>

2110
01:49:54.751 --> 01:49:58.861
<v Speaker 1>there's an irish setter sitting in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seat and there's no one else and they </v>

2111
01:49:58.861 --> 01:50:02.170
<v Speaker 1>follow it and it goes to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>veterinarian's office and the door opens</v>

2112
01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:07.200
<v Speaker 1>and the dog laid it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes into the veterinarian office and </v>

2113
01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:09.910
<v Speaker 1>this is the rumor that I heard was </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody just didn't have time.</v>

2114
01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:15.240
<v Speaker 1>They put the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dog in the car and they send it to </v>

2115
01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:15.240
<v Speaker 1>the vet's office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you Know,</v>

2116
01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:17.500
<v Speaker 1>which is totally in violation of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>

2117
01:50:20.230 --> 01:50:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that story Itself disprove this </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion that it's too difficult to do </v>

2118
01:50:25.230 --> 01:50:29.581
<v Speaker 1>something like this when you're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the real world and all the </v>

2119
01:50:29.581 --> 01:50:32.611
<v Speaker 1>variables and all the moving parts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just talked about a driving the </v>

2120
01:50:32.611 --> 01:50:32.920
<v Speaker 1>fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I meAn that's kind of It right now.</v>

2121
01:50:32.921 --> 01:50:36.370
<v Speaker 1>And this is only 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2122
01:50:36.730 --> 01:50:41.730
<v Speaker 1>in footprint tall in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 19th century they were doing a </v>

2123
01:50:41.890 --> 01:50:46.890
<v Speaker 1>remote control trains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were doing trains that would go </v>

2124
01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:49.570
<v Speaker 1>onto the track track to an electrical </v>
<v Speaker 1>signal.</v>

2125
01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick people up.</v>

2126
01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:55.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean this stuff is actually pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

2127
01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:57.040
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And but that's not,</v>

2128
01:50:57.070 --> 01:50:59.200
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a road though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a track,</v>

2129
01:50:59.201 --> 01:51:04.201
<v Speaker 1>but there the difference between that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a living system is those are fixed </v>

2130
01:51:04.241 --> 01:51:09.241
<v Speaker 1>function algorithms that are doing edge </v>
<v Speaker 1>tracing on the edge of a highway saying </v>

2131
01:51:09.241 --> 01:51:11.020
<v Speaker 1>where's the right line and where's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>yellow line?</v>

2132
01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And they're getting a gps signal and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the code,</v>

2133
01:51:14.261 --> 01:51:15.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not very big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2134
01:51:15.841 --> 01:51:18.310
<v Speaker 1>if it was a very big and complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably wouldn't work.</v>

2135
01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:23.610
<v Speaker 1>So these google engineers have made </v>
<v Speaker 1>something pretty elegant that has fuzzy </v>

2136
01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:24.520
<v Speaker 1>logic and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got it to work.</v>

2137
01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:29.880
<v Speaker 1>This has been tried since the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties with the radio control cars </v>

2138
01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:33.630
<v Speaker 1>that had radios on the front and back </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of distance and they've got it </v>

2139
01:51:34.091 --> 01:51:39.091
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is this anything close to what life </v>

2140
01:51:39.091 --> 01:51:40.360
<v Speaker 1>can do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The adaptability,</v>

2141
01:51:40.361 --> 01:51:40.920
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2142
01:51:41.050 --> 01:51:46.050
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but neither was the initial combustion </v>

2143
01:51:46.050 --> 01:51:49.741
<v Speaker 1>engine even close to what the saturn </v>
<v Speaker 1>five rocket was like neither was the </v>

2144
01:51:49.741 --> 01:51:52.600
<v Speaker 1>original model t in comparison to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tesla.</v>

2145
01:51:52.601 --> 01:51:55.840
<v Speaker 1>And I mean doesn't that just stands to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason that constant innovation?</v>

2146
01:51:55.870 --> 01:52:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you except that when I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>really saifai things come in that are </v>

2147
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:05.701
<v Speaker 1>just because I'm an engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally when I see stuff that's </v>

2148
01:52:05.701 --> 01:52:05.701
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2149
01:52:05.701 --> 01:52:10.171
<v Speaker 1>I can't even imagine how to get there </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not even defining were </v>

2150
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:11.890
<v Speaker 1>what their term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2151
01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:15.220
<v Speaker 1>They're not defining their terms and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one's working on the project.</v>

2152
01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:19.090
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give you one example of how hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff is.</v>

2153
01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:24.420
<v Speaker 1>So terrence and I would have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations about what he called </v>

2154
01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:27.750
<v Speaker 1>novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember he used to say can </v>

2155
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:29.260
<v Speaker 1>crescents into novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2156
01:52:29.290 --> 01:52:33.250
<v Speaker 1>terence left us in the year 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the millennium.</v>

2157
01:52:33.310 --> 01:52:38.310
<v Speaker 1>If you define it as the year 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people say it really started in </v>

2158
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.840
<v Speaker 1>2001.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm.</v>

2159
01:52:39.490 --> 01:52:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Terrence was talking about all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and I would say that's pretty </v>

2160
01:52:44.490 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 1>obvious to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If things get novel,</v>

2161
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:50.510
<v Speaker 1>how do they get novel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for years and years I worked on this</v>

2162
01:52:50.511 --> 01:52:55.511
<v Speaker 1>project called the evolution grid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we did was try to say let's </v>

2163
01:52:55.511 --> 01:52:59.291
<v Speaker 1>simulate actual chemistry inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer and see if we can see novelty </v>

2164
01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:03.590
<v Speaker 1>accreting and how does it do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in 2011,</v>

2165
01:53:03.591 --> 01:53:08.591
<v Speaker 1>after running a year of simulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly at uc san diego and up in my </v>

2166
01:53:08.591 --> 01:53:11.510
<v Speaker 1>barn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we believe that the whole surf all wired</v>

2167
01:53:11.511 --> 01:53:16.511
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found this staircasing formula that </v>

2168
01:53:16.511 --> 01:53:21.071
<v Speaker 1>was a way that nature form structures in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this case bonds form between these </v>

2169
01:53:21.801 --> 01:53:24.080
<v Speaker 1>virtual molecules and doesn't break </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2170
01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:28.940
<v Speaker 1>They don't just all go back to mush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was this staircasing thing.</v>

2171
01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:30.290
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

2172
01:53:30.291 --> 01:53:32.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this took eight months of computation of</v>

2173
01:53:32.301 --> 01:53:37.301
<v Speaker 1>find this method by which perhaps the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe accretes novelty and holds onto</v>

2174
01:53:38.241 --> 01:53:40.670
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sort of did a virtual call,</v>

2175
01:53:40.671 --> 01:53:42.890
<v Speaker 1>the parents and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found the formula,</v>

2176
01:53:42.891 --> 01:53:47.891
<v Speaker 1>I call it the cosmic wiggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he calls this stuff like the cosmic </v>

2177
01:53:47.891 --> 01:53:49.750
<v Speaker 1>giggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you remember from some talks,</v>

2178
01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found the cosmic wiggle.</v>

2179
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:56.630
<v Speaker 1>But in the process of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I learned was holy shit,</v>

2180
01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.840
<v Speaker 1>the basis for life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this massive,</v>

2181
01:54:00.110 --> 01:54:05.110
<v Speaker 1>huge engine of stochastic probabilistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>storm that's going on that literally </v>

2182
01:54:06.890 --> 01:54:11.890
<v Speaker 1>ratchets and rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything from jujitsu matches to the </v>

2183
01:54:11.890 --> 01:54:11.890
<v Speaker 1>jet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Air.</v>

2184
01:54:11.890 --> 01:54:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Airplane is a powerful system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not at the basis of computing </v>

2185
01:54:16.650 --> 01:54:21.650
<v Speaker 1>computing is this delicate little thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>will take a number and we'll do a thing </v>

2186
01:54:21.650 --> 01:54:25.550
<v Speaker 1>with it and we'll spread it out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nature's this massive machine.</v>

2187
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.540
<v Speaker 1>So perhaps the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where we would come together</v>

2188
01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:32.960
<v Speaker 1>is a merger between computing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural systems.</v>

2189
01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:38.200
<v Speaker 1>So this is a project that I'm calling </v>
<v Speaker 1>the genesis engine project and it's </v>

2190
01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:43.840
<v Speaker 1>having a computer control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trillions of chemical experiments all </v>

2191
01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:46.550
<v Speaker 1>going at once and looking at them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>selecting them and saying these are more</v>

2192
01:54:46.551 --> 01:54:50.300
<v Speaker 1>powerful experiments and it can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>search through molecular space.</v>

2193
01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:53.270
<v Speaker 1>I just talked to a guy from google about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and he was like,</v>

2194
01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:55.040
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecular search.</v>

2195
01:54:55.041 --> 01:55:00.041
<v Speaker 1>We're interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not just limited our searches to </v>

2196
01:55:00.041 --> 01:55:02.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best bread recipes.</v>

2197
01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:07.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would like to search and molecule </v>

2198
01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:10.091
<v Speaker 1>space and I talked to our neighbor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a place in New Jersey and he's </v>

2199
01:55:10.091 --> 01:55:14.771
<v Speaker 1>like a head researcher at glaxo and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said this is incredibly valuable if you </v>

2200
01:55:14.771 --> 01:55:19.481
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can actually use molecules to do </v>

2201
01:55:19.481 --> 01:55:22.781
<v Speaker 1>the walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>run a trillion experiments at once and </v>

2202
01:55:22.781 --> 01:55:25.841
<v Speaker 1>pick the best ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then run the trillion more </v>

2203
01:55:25.841 --> 01:55:25.841
<v Speaker 1>experiments and walked through chemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

2204
01:55:25.841 --> 01:55:30.430
<v Speaker 1>We can figure out how to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical in the least amount of </v>

2205
01:55:30.430 --> 01:55:34.541
<v Speaker 1>steps you can simulate you create new </v>
<v Speaker 1>materials and we'll have a hybrid </v>

2206
01:55:36.230 --> 01:55:40.760
<v Speaker 1>digital and natural analog computer for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time in this 21st century.</v>

2207
01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:43.010
<v Speaker 1>But now you're really confusing me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because now you've,</v>

2208
01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you seem to think</v>

2209
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:48.060
<v Speaker 2>that innovation is going to reach some </v>
<v Speaker 2>new plateau if we do that.</v>

2210
01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:53.300
<v Speaker 2>If we're able to hybridize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to make the leaps </v>

2211
01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:53.670
<v Speaker 2>that you are talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2212
01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:57.450
<v Speaker 2>if we can do this hybrid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we can harness pessimism line,</v>

2213
01:55:57.480 --> 01:55:58.320
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

2214
01:55:58.321 --> 01:56:03.321
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an engineer so I know what it takes </v>

2215
01:56:03.321 --> 01:56:06.111
<v Speaker 2>to build these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't want to really oversell </v>

2216
01:56:06.111 --> 01:56:10.940
<v Speaker 2>that by a certain date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have a singularity of </v>

2217
01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:11.910
<v Speaker 2>some sort that certain dates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stuff is always a goof it.</v>

2218
01:56:12.150 --> 01:56:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Ray kurzweil wants to do it now with 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 and the 20 slash 25 slash 45.</v>

2219
01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:20.280
<v Speaker 2>They're being silly by doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's,</v>

2220
01:56:20.290 --> 01:56:20.620
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2221
01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:25.940
<v Speaker 2>it does the whole idea of an exponential</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase in technology.</v>

2222
01:56:26.061 --> 01:56:30.000
<v Speaker 2>It does that whole idea disservice by </v>
<v Speaker 2>like pretending than anybody.</v>

2223
01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:35.140
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's ever fucking predicted </v>

2224
01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:35.140
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2225
01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:35.140
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2226
01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:35.140
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's ever nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2227
01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:38.790
<v Speaker 2>there's been some fascinating hg wells </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictions that sorta came true,</v>

2228
01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:42.570
<v Speaker 2>but no one said like on November 19th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1972,</v>

2229
01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:44.670
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a telephone that </v>
<v Speaker 2>does this.</v>

2230
01:56:44.930 --> 01:56:49.930
<v Speaker 2>And instead what happened like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>December 21st 2012 drove me fucking </v>

2231
01:56:50.101 --> 01:56:55.101
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It drove me fucking crazy because first </v>

2232
01:56:55.101 --> 01:56:57.711
<v Speaker 2>of all it was intoxicating and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was maddening and then it became </v>

2233
01:56:57.711 --> 01:56:58.780
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as the day rolled around it,</v>

2234
01:56:58.900 --> 01:57:01.500
<v Speaker 2>I did an end of the world show you </v>
<v Speaker 2>december 20,</v>

2235
01:57:01.501 --> 01:57:06.501
<v Speaker 2>first 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But doug stan hope and joey diaz and my </v>

2236
01:57:06.501 --> 01:57:06.501
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honey,</v>

2237
01:57:06.501 --> 01:57:06.630
<v Speaker 2>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this band.</v>

2238
01:57:06.631 --> 01:57:08.850
<v Speaker 2>And we did the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did it live at the wiltern.</v>

2239
01:57:08.851 --> 01:57:11.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't exist anywhere.</v>

2240
01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:14.340
<v Speaker 2>It was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a live show comedy show.</v>

2241
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just thought the asteroid was going </v>

2242
01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:21.091
<v Speaker 2>to hit her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mayans were to come back or the </v>

2243
01:57:21.091 --> 01:57:21.091
<v Speaker 2>aliens are going to land or whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck was going to happen.</v>

2244
01:57:21.091 --> 01:57:21.091
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

2245
01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:27.500
<v Speaker 2>down underneath grand central station in</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York city with a friend of mine </v>

2246
01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:30.711
<v Speaker 2>who's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a kind of a psychedelic comic and </v>

2247
01:57:30.711 --> 01:57:30.711
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his name?</v>

2248
01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:36.200
<v Speaker 2>What's his name again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of a friend is this brain is </v>

2249
01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:37.110
<v Speaker 2>fried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a wonderful guy,</v>

2250
01:57:37.890 --> 01:57:42.890
<v Speaker 2>but we just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We laughed and then no one's gonna find </v>

2251
01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:42.890
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>7 billion people in the building.</v>

2252
01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:47.400
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we laughed our way through the day like </v>

2253
01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:50.841
<v Speaker 2>you guys are doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wheelchair and tell jokes and we </v>

2254
01:57:50.841 --> 01:57:53.280
<v Speaker 2>said we gotta get less serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This idea of picking a day so goofy.</v>

2255
01:57:53.281 --> 01:57:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Like I had daniel pinchbeck on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast once and he was saying that it's</v>

2256
01:57:56.611 --> 01:57:59.080
<v Speaker 2>definitely going to change the world to </v>
<v Speaker 2>san diego.</v>

2257
01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>December 20,</v>

2258
01:58:00.661 --> 01:58:02.830
<v Speaker 2>first 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something's definitely not easy.</v>

2259
01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:07.860
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely gonna change where I was </v>

2260
01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:07.860
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about now?</v>

2261
01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:08.640
<v Speaker 2>What are you fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you say that?</v>

2262
01:58:08.641 --> 01:58:11.040
<v Speaker 2>You can't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can never say that.</v>

2263
01:58:11.041 --> 01:58:13.310
<v Speaker 2>You can never say that date,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the show.</v>

2264
01:58:13.311 --> 01:58:18.311
<v Speaker 2>Here's a real cool and for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have some of the last terence mckenna </v>

2265
01:58:18.311 --> 01:58:18.440
<v Speaker 2>papers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2266
01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:22.440
<v Speaker 2>is archivist fire in 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened there?</v>

2267
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:27.470
<v Speaker 2>That was his lips in a rain forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did a fire destroyed after </v>

2268
01:58:28.411 --> 01:58:30.840
<v Speaker 2>he died?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The papers went to excellent.</v>

2269
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:35.870

<v Speaker 2>berlin and a quiznos shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sub shop.</v>

2271
01:58:38.761 --> 01:58:41.590
<v Speaker 2>I kid you not at some kind of electrical</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

2272
01:58:41.890 --> 01:58:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Burned</v>

2273
01:58:42.270 --> 01:58:46.110
<v Speaker 1>a whole city block down and the eslan </v>
<v Speaker 1>office and terrence papers</v>

2274
01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:47.860
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but didn't,</v>

2275
01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:50.140
<v Speaker 3>didn't his place in Hawaii burn too?</v>

2276
01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:50.650
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2277
01:58:50.651 --> 01:58:51.630
<v Speaker 1>It's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2278
01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:54.040
<v Speaker 1>who owns that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2279
01:58:54.041 --> 01:58:55.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was sold recently.</v>

2280
01:58:55.841 --> 01:58:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ who bought that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2281
01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:59.500
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to have that place.</v>

2282
01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:02.070
<v Speaker 1>But in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are kinds of her lost.</v>

2283
01:59:02.071 --> 01:59:07.071
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard somebody called me and I called </v>

2284
01:59:07.071 --> 01:59:08.140
<v Speaker 1>lorenzo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lorenzo haggerty or dear friend.</v>

2285
01:59:08.650 --> 01:59:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I love that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

2286
01:59:10.391 --> 01:59:15.391
<v Speaker 1>lorenzo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ells have removed the incriminating </v>

2287
01:59:15.391 --> 01:59:17.800
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>

2288
01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:22.920
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to rebuild terence mckenna from </v>

2289
01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:24.740
<v Speaker 1>extent materials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a grateful dead show thing.</v>

2290
01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Send in your cassette.</v>

2291
01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

2292
01:59:27.190 --> 01:59:32.190
<v Speaker 3>one of his most problematic theories was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that novelty theory that the idea that </v>

2293
01:59:32.190 --> 01:59:36.870
<v Speaker 3>december 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first 2012 there was going to be some </v>

2294
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:39.270
<v Speaker 3>point of infant novelty and he thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was going to be a time machine </v>

2295
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.270
<v Speaker 3>perhaps</v>

2296
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:43.380
<v Speaker 1>based on the each and so I got a packet </v>
<v Speaker 1>of papers in the mail that I came </v>

2297
01:59:43.901 --> 01:59:48.901
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another archivist because I'm also </v>

2298
01:59:48.901 --> 01:59:50.461
<v Speaker 1>handling timothy leary's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the remnants of timothy leary's library </v>

2299
01:59:50.461 --> 01:59:51.230
<v Speaker 1>right now that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2300
01:59:51.250 --> 01:59:53.410
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to scan the news archive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whatever,</v>

2301
01:59:53.411 --> 01:59:58.411
<v Speaker 1>but this packet of material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years of letters and there was a </v>

2302
01:59:58.411 --> 02:00:00.570
<v Speaker 1>timewave zero edition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2303
02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:03.640
<v Speaker 1>in a little binder or whatever with </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrence has a little writing on it.</v>

2304
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:07.420
<v Speaker 1>And there was a post it note that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrence's scribbled something.</v>

2305
02:00:07.421 --> 02:00:09.700
<v Speaker 1>And then at the bottom he says December </v>
<v Speaker 1>21st.</v>

2306
02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2307
02:00:11.021 --> 02:00:14.260
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the bottom of this post it note 1989.</v>

2308
02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:19.240
<v Speaker 1>And so I scan that sucker in and put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>online in december of $20.</v>

2309
02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:24.280
<v Speaker 1>here is the nefarious posted note where </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrance finally settled on this date,</v>

2310
02:00:24.281 --> 02:00:25.380
<v Speaker 1>at least for terrence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2311
02:00:25.381 --> 02:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>are they a wireless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2312
02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:31.570
<v Speaker 1>associate eric had been involved in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>too in the course.</v>

2313
02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>But it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes down to this posted note in.</v>

2314
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to put that up to sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the absurdity of this is a guy that </v>

2315
02:00:41.310 --> 02:00:44.980
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really know terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a technologist and you know,</v>

2316
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:47.380
<v Speaker 1>he was a visionary thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love him.</v>

2317
02:00:47.381 --> 02:00:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was an amazing dude.</v>

2318
02:00:48.581 --> 02:00:50.980
<v Speaker 1>We love to listen to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're right.</v>

2319
02:00:50.981 --> 02:00:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I think he was off the rails on friday</v>

2320
02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:56.440
<v Speaker 3>too much into that one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not only that,</v>

2321
02:00:56.450 --> 02:00:58.640
<v Speaker 3>didn't he move the goalposts like at one</v>
<v Speaker 3>point in time,</v>

2322
02:00:58.641 --> 02:01:03.641
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't december 20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First it was like november or something </v>

2323
02:01:03.641 --> 02:01:03.641
<v Speaker 3>and they changed it.</v>

2324
02:01:03.641 --> 02:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>He changed it and he was trying to fit </v>
<v Speaker 1>the data to the curve,</v>

2325
02:01:06.210 --> 02:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't really an expert in trends</v>
<v Speaker 1>and history.</v>

2326
02:01:09.421 --> 02:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>And how can you match trends in history </v>
<v Speaker 1>to anything.</v>

2327
02:01:11.521 --> 02:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2328
02:01:11.950 --> 02:01:15.010
<v Speaker 3>I would listen to him talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the one thing that I had to shut</v>

2329
02:01:15.011 --> 02:01:20.011
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've listened to pretty much everything </v>

2330
02:01:20.011 --> 02:01:20.710
<v Speaker 3>that he's ever done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the lorenzo archives,</v>

2331
02:01:20.711 --> 02:01:24.310
<v Speaker 3>all the stuff that yana and put up way </v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the day to</v>

2332
02:01:24.330 --> 02:01:29.330
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three 16 in the salon because that one </v>

2333
02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:33.470
<v Speaker 1>we kind of take this thing apart and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met with ralph abraham.</v>

2334
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:38.750
<v Speaker 1>We meet once A year kind of thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then 2011 I was setting up to do a </v>

2335
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:41.600
<v Speaker 1>program called terrence 2012 about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>life of terence mckenna.</v>

2336
02:01:42.170 --> 02:01:44.360
<v Speaker 1>And I met with ralph and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me ralph,</v>

2337
02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>what was going on in the late nineties </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

2338
02:01:46.710 --> 02:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>they're the trial or ralph rupert who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on your show,</v>

2339
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>ralph abraham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2340
02:01:51.530 --> 02:01:56.530
<v Speaker 1>and ralph said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kind of were getting fed up because </v>

2341
02:01:56.530 --> 02:01:59.200
<v Speaker 1>terrence was just spinning these stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we didn't think they had any,</v>

2342
02:01:59.230 --> 02:02:03.780
<v Speaker 1>any basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so at the 1998 trial logs,</v>

2343
02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:04.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trials were,</v>

2344
02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:07.040
<v Speaker 1>were they all met?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they talked to you there at uc santa</v>

2345
02:02:07.041 --> 02:02:07.580
<v Speaker 1>cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2346
02:02:07.581 --> 02:02:10.090
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to that rupert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice,</v>

2347
02:02:10.130 --> 02:02:11.600
<v Speaker 1>set a trap for terrence.</v>

2348
02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:16.600
<v Speaker 1>We trapped him over and over again and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we basically for an hour he was </v>

2349
02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:18.590
<v Speaker 1>squirming and he was pretty up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty uncomfortable slide.</v>

2350
02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Pull out our cassette tape of that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have digitized it and sure and </v>

2351
02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:26.660
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll hear this within podcast 3:16</v>

2352
02:02:26.661 --> 02:02:30.290
<v Speaker 1>and what rupert says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrence is talking about,</v>

2353
02:02:30.890 --> 02:02:35.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet will come to consciousness </v>

2354
02:02:35.890 --> 02:02:35.890
<v Speaker 1>in 20 minutes or less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2355
02:02:35.890 --> 02:02:38.420
<v Speaker 1>it will be an ai that will no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>need us.</v>

2356
02:02:38.421 --> 02:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>And so rupert was ready for that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2357
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>terrence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2358
02:02:42.531 --> 02:02:47.531
<v Speaker 1>I've heard reports of voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had him here and I've heard 10 </v>

2359
02:02:47.531 --> 02:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>versions of this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the last version,</v>

2360
02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:52.100
<v Speaker 1>it was an ai coming out of a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>portal.</v>

2361
02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:57.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not going to let them </v>

2362
02:02:57.520 --> 02:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>get away with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And terrence is such a good irish.</v>

2363
02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's such Good on,</v>

2364
02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:01.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>storytelling,</v>

2365
02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:02.420
<v Speaker 1>storytelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's good with.</v>

2366
02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:06.510
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that to 10.</v>

2367
02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:09.860
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

2368
02:03:09.861 --> 02:03:14.861
<v Speaker 1>very heartfelt and kind of terrence </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizes his friends have kind of drawn </v>

2369
02:03:14.861 --> 02:03:16.700
<v Speaker 1>a line in the sand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last thing he says in that trial</v>

2370
02:03:16.710 --> 02:03:21.710
<v Speaker 1>august,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we want profits but we don't want </v>

2371
02:03:21.710 --> 02:03:23.210
<v Speaker 1>false prophets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2372
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the story was the thing at that </v>

2373
02:03:28.270 --> 02:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2374
02:03:28.270 --> 02:03:28.590
<v Speaker 3>So do you think that he just got carried</v>
<v Speaker 3>away with it?</v>

2375
02:03:28.650 --> 02:03:33.650
<v Speaker 3>Like is it mean obviously he liked you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I like everyone we know is flawed as</v>

2376
02:03:34.411 --> 02:03:39.411
<v Speaker 3>a person and he also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the reason why he was as </v>

2377
02:03:39.991 --> 02:03:42.510
<v Speaker 3>visionary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of out of the box thinker,</v>

2378
02:03:42.511 --> 02:03:47.511
<v Speaker 3>this guy who had this really incredible </v>
<v Speaker 3>way of describing potential </v>

2379
02:03:47.941 --> 02:03:52.941
<v Speaker 3>possibilities was that his mind was </v>
<v Speaker 3>prone to going on these little weird </v>

2380
02:03:52.941 --> 02:03:57.441
<v Speaker 3>journeys and took a lot of chances and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe might have been married to a few </v>

2381
02:03:57.441 --> 02:03:59.040
<v Speaker 3>of these chances that maybe shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have</v>

2382
02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>you have dennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis was in The introduction,</v>

2383
02:04:02.351 --> 02:04:07.351
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the second version of invisible </v>

2384
02:04:07.351 --> 02:04:07.351
<v Speaker 1>landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>dennis is writing,</v>

2385
02:04:07.351 --> 02:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we went through and we were</v>

2386
02:04:07.901 --> 02:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>in our twenties and we've learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>something since then.</v>

2387
02:04:10.751 --> 02:04:13.190
<v Speaker 1>We don't really know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe this anymore,</v>

2388
02:04:13.191 --> 02:04:14.420
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2389
02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it's almost like in this could </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to any of us.</v>

2390
02:04:18.610 --> 02:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>We get attached to a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our shtick.</v>

2391
02:04:21.011 --> 02:04:23.080
<v Speaker 1>It's our comedy act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's our thing.</v>

2392
02:04:23.081 --> 02:04:28.081
<v Speaker 1>We do our conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that brings people into </v>

2393
02:04:28.081 --> 02:04:30.040
<v Speaker 1>the seats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fills the theaters,</v>

2394
02:04:30.370 --> 02:04:33.900
<v Speaker 1>and if it's paying your bills and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you self worth and whatnot,</v>

2395
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>you can get really attached to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

2396
02:04:35.831 --> 02:04:37.560
<v Speaker 1>it's very unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2397
02:04:37.561 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

2398
02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:41.490
<v Speaker 3>the rest of terrence's ideas were so </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating.</v>

2399
02:04:41.491 --> 02:04:46.491
<v Speaker 3>Compelling and listen to them talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the positive benefits of psychedelics,</v>

2400
02:04:47.590 --> 02:04:52.590
<v Speaker 3>what he thinks the potential of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics hold and what he thinks </v>

2401
02:04:52.590 --> 02:04:54.450
<v Speaker 3>about psychedelic culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's so much fascinating.</v>

2402
02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:55.290
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely fast.</v>

2403
02:04:55.390 --> 02:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I love the amount of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was terrence for me.</v>

2404
02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I only knew him the last couple of </v>

2405
02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:04.500
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know he was on his way out.</v>

2406
02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2407
02:05:04.811 --> 02:05:07.960
<v Speaker 1>we did this whole fantastic thing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We brought virtual worlds,</v>

2408
02:05:07.961 --> 02:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>sos house in Hawaii office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>satellite dish,</v>

2409
02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>and he was placed into a world and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>became his own ghost.</v>

2410
02:05:14.051 --> 02:05:19.051
<v Speaker 1>The avatar was fantastic and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking forward to a long association </v>

2411
02:05:19.051 --> 02:05:23.161
<v Speaker 1>with him and we were planning to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent workshop where he and I could </v>

2412
02:05:23.161 --> 02:05:26.821
<v Speaker 1>do pieces of the same puzzle like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do like the deep tech and weird </v>

2413
02:05:27.071 --> 02:05:30.010
<v Speaker 1>ideas and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was based on science and tech and</v>

2414
02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>some visionary thing and he would come </v>
<v Speaker 1>in from his history side and elusive and</v>

2415
02:05:34.151 --> 02:05:39.151
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff and we were going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the road and then he had a grand mal </v>

2416
02:05:39.151 --> 02:05:43.201
<v Speaker 1>seizure two months later and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific and we saw him last in </v>

2417
02:05:43.201 --> 02:05:46.981
<v Speaker 1>september,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 99 and it was like a good </v>

2418
02:05:46.981 --> 02:05:46.981
<v Speaker 1>event that was held.</v>

2419
02:05:46.981 --> 02:05:50.500
<v Speaker 3>If he was around today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there sufficient medical advances </v>

2420
02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:50.960
<v Speaker 3>that would have helped him?</v>

2421
02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:54.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a glioblastoma multiforme is,</v>

2422
02:05:54.140 --> 02:05:57.860
<v Speaker 1>they're so rare and they have a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad prognosis.</v>

2423
02:05:58.100 --> 02:06:01.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had gamma knife surgery and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it was november.</v>

2424
02:06:01.730 --> 02:06:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean Eric Davis has last interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The interview.</v>

2425
02:06:04.881 --> 02:06:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Eric davis is wonderful from Hawaii </v>
<v Speaker 1>right from,</v>

2426
02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:13.120
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually it might've been on the </v>

2427
02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:15.070
<v Speaker 1>mainland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear a lot of dishes in the </v>

2428
02:06:15.070 --> 02:06:15.070
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't be the model for.</v>

2429
02:06:15.070 --> 02:06:16.610
<v Speaker 1>He might've been an occidental during </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>

2430
02:06:16.611 --> 02:06:21.611
<v Speaker 1>after the surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's so beautifully cogent and </v>

2431
02:06:21.611 --> 02:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>coherent that mean he says he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>master.</v>

2432
02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:24.830
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so in his heart.</v>

2433
02:06:24.831 --> 02:06:29.831
<v Speaker 1>He's so brilliant and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on all these antiseizure drugs and </v>

2434
02:06:29.831 --> 02:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things he does say,</v>

2435
02:06:31.491 --> 02:06:32.960
<v Speaker 1>which was this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2436
02:06:33.260 --> 02:06:38.260
<v Speaker 1>you need to rethink this thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an altered spaces because I'm on </v>

2437
02:06:39.381 --> 02:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>massive medications because I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain disease because,</v>

2438
02:06:44.110 --> 02:06:48.920
<v Speaker 1>and there are people walking around that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are certifiably in altered states and we</v>

2439
02:06:48.921 --> 02:06:53.921
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't just privilege psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are so many avenues into alternate</v>

2440
02:06:55.671 --> 02:07:00.671
<v Speaker 1>realities is allowed us to see the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just experienced them and that's</v>

2441
02:07:00.801 --> 02:07:05.801
<v Speaker 1>part of what my mission in the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say don't privilege these substances </v>

2442
02:07:06.170 --> 02:07:08.060
<v Speaker 1>because then they become crutches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

2443
02:07:08.450 --> 02:07:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Terrence used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do this on the couch,</v>

2444
02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:16.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've since met a lot of people that </v>

2445
02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>are going to profound spaces through </v>
<v Speaker 1>other means.</v>

2446
02:07:18.110 --> 02:07:19.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was a bit.</v>

2447
02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:25.960
<v Speaker 3>I think he was a little hasty in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his proclamation that this isn't </v>

2448
02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:30.220
<v Speaker 3>capable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is impossible under natural </v>

2449
02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:32.450
<v Speaker 3>conditions because I have a friend who </v>
<v Speaker 3>has had psychedelic experiences.</v>

2450
02:07:32.451 --> 02:07:34.970
<v Speaker 3>He's not averse to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a regular marijuana user.</v>

2451
02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:35.710
<v Speaker 3>He's also</v>

2452
02:07:36.490 --> 02:07:40.900
<v Speaker 2>a kundalini expert and he's become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kundalini expert since I've known him.</v>

2453
02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:44.080
<v Speaker 2>So over the lAst 10 years has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>practicing.</v>

2454
02:07:44.081 --> 02:07:47.890
<v Speaker 2>I've known him for about 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been practicing clue a very,</v>

2455
02:07:47.891 --> 02:07:52.300
<v Speaker 2>very intensely over the past four or </v>
<v Speaker 2>five and since then he says,</v>

2456
02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:57.360
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have deep dmt experiences doing </v>

2457
02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.780
<v Speaker 2>kundalini and I have no reason to doubt </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2458
02:07:59.110 --> 02:08:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I have another friend who does a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different type of medication,</v>

2459
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:03.640
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a.</v>

2460
02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:08.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not kundalini,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some sort of meditation and he also </v>

2461
02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:09.430
<v Speaker 2>says that he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have legit,</v>

2462
02:08:09.570 --> 02:08:12.980
<v Speaker 2>full blown psychedelic experiences and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think I'm,</v>

2463
02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:18.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to research this and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually going to be working on a book </v>

2464
02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:20.680
<v Speaker 2>on this thing because I keep running </v>
<v Speaker 2>into these people and I call it.</v>

2465
02:08:20.681 --> 02:08:22.720
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we taught indogenous,</v>

2466
02:08:22.990 --> 02:08:27.990
<v Speaker 2>so I'm using the term endo endo beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>or endo voyaging or whatever.</v>

2467
02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Using your own endogenous ability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I do it,</v>

2468
02:08:32.260 --> 02:08:37.260
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just unbelievably difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do and I think some people are just </v>

2469
02:08:37.260 --> 02:08:38.530
<v Speaker 2>lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really a part of it.</v>

2470
02:08:38.531 --> 02:08:43.531
<v Speaker 2>It's also physical effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that are </v>

2471
02:08:43.531 --> 02:08:45.430
<v Speaker 2>investing a tremendous amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and thinking calculation postulating,</v>

2472
02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:49.930
<v Speaker 2>but the physical effort of meditation is</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond them and that's one of the things</v>

2473
02:08:49.931 --> 02:08:54.931
<v Speaker 2>that mckenna talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrance talked about all the time how </v>

2474
02:08:54.931 --> 02:08:55.590
<v Speaker 2>boring meditation was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so incredibly.</v>

2475
02:08:55.640 --> 02:09:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Blood had a flash insight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe were to come back to the original </v>

2476
02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:05.251
<v Speaker 2>theme that we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did the ancients could do this </v>

2477
02:09:05.251 --> 02:09:07.250
<v Speaker 2>amazing stuff that we're now </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovering?</v>

2478
02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:11.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like currently high tech because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't distracted.</v>

2479
02:09:11.650 --> 02:09:13.330
<v Speaker 2>What could they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

2480
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:14.500
<v Speaker 2>No internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no twitter.</v>

2481
02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:16.330
<v Speaker 2>You can check their faceBook every 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutEs.</v>

2482
02:09:17.010 --> 02:09:22.010
<v Speaker 2>They could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy could look at a pile of rocks and </v>

2483
02:09:22.010 --> 02:09:25.351
<v Speaker 2>see the full structure of the pyramid </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's in his head or her head with </v>

2484
02:09:25.351 --> 02:09:29.401
<v Speaker 2>water flowers and they perhaps because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not so distracted in a stimulus </v>

2485
02:09:29.561 --> 02:09:34.561
<v Speaker 2>response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cortisol being shot in and interrupts </v>

2486
02:09:34.561 --> 02:09:36.520
<v Speaker 2>and to do lists and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just massively distracted.</v>

2487
02:09:36.850 --> 02:09:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Those guys were using full power of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>endogenous power and maybe a loose.</v>

2488
02:09:41.541 --> 02:09:45.340
<v Speaker 2>this was unlocking net.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also possible that they didn't have</v>

2489
02:09:45.370 --> 02:09:50.370
<v Speaker 2>the predetermined limitations that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have when we consider like what normal </v>

2490
02:09:50.370 --> 02:09:54.451
<v Speaker 2>states of consciousness exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this idea of list exists and </v>

2491
02:09:54.451 --> 02:09:54.930
<v Speaker 2>then if you want more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to take acid.</v>

2492
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:57.220
<v Speaker 2>If you want more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get on prozac.</v>

2493
02:09:57.221 --> 02:09:59.410
<v Speaker 2>If you bought more than this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you have to be drunk.</v>

2494
02:09:59.411 --> 02:10:00.610
<v Speaker 2>You have to be this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be that.</v>

2495
02:10:00.730 --> 02:10:03.910
<v Speaker 2>So we have these preconceived notions </v>
<v Speaker 2>about altered states of consciousness,</v>

2496
02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:06.550
<v Speaker 2>brilliant insight and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2497
02:10:06.680 --> 02:10:11.680
<v Speaker 2>and we're so channeled and managed in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologically are driving like driving</v>

2498
02:10:13.601 --> 02:10:14.980
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2499
02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:18.200
<v Speaker 2>we drove down the back of California </v>
<v Speaker 2>from santa cruz ceremony,</v>

2500
02:10:18.370 --> 02:10:20.650
<v Speaker 2>some of those beautiful landscaping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

2501
02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Kayla and I are looking at this glowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>light coming off the ocean,</v>

2502
02:10:23.591 --> 02:10:26.440
<v Speaker 2>like what you saw at big sur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those dudes,</v>

2503
02:10:26.441 --> 02:10:29.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean we get a little snatch of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have the full experience.</v>

2504
02:10:29.831 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 2>We're not standing on the shore smelling</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plants in a full body</v>

2505
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:37.190
<v Speaker 1>of health being impacted by those </v>
<v Speaker 1>photons coming,</v>

2506
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:42.170
<v Speaker 1>giving us an enlightened states because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're driving past it and we're watching</v>

2507
02:10:42.171 --> 02:10:47.171
<v Speaker 1>our time and our gas levels and whatnot </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're out of tune.</v>

2508
02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:48.290
<v Speaker 1>We're not present.</v>

2509
02:10:48.370 --> 02:10:50.350
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about this many times on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

2510
02:10:50.351 --> 02:10:55.351
<v Speaker 3>I had a really life changing experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had nothing to do with drugs and it </v>

2511
02:10:55.351 --> 02:10:56.890
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to the big island.</v>

2512
02:10:56.891 --> 02:10:58.550
<v Speaker 3>I went to the keck observatory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2513
02:10:59.150 --> 02:11:03.850
<v Speaker 3>It just went because I was on vacation </v>
<v Speaker 3>with my family there and we went to the.</v>

2514
02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:07.310
<v Speaker 3>There's two levels to the observatories </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the main observatory and then there's</v>

2515
02:11:07.311 --> 02:11:11.140
<v Speaker 3>the visitors area and the visitors are </v>
<v Speaker 3>just have a bunch of telescopes set out.</v>

2516
02:11:11.141 --> 02:11:16.141
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's so high that it's above the </v>

2517
02:11:16.141 --> 02:11:16.300
<v Speaker 3>clouds clouded area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it clear?</v>

2518
02:11:16.330 --> 02:11:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Was it totaLly close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cloudy below us or was just fascinating.</v>

2519
02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:21.730
<v Speaker 3>We were bummed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>

2520
02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:23.320
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to hit clouds.</v>

2521
02:11:23.321 --> 02:11:26.170
<v Speaker 3>we're not gonna see anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we actually drove through the clouds</v>

2522
02:11:26.410 --> 02:11:31.410
<v Speaker 3>and because they have the diffused </v>
<v Speaker 3>lighting all over the big island to </v>

2523
02:11:31.410 --> 02:11:31.870
<v Speaker 3>protect the observatory from light </v>
<v Speaker 3>pollution.</v>

2524
02:11:32.350 --> 02:11:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the view was stunning.</v>

2525
02:11:36.260 --> 02:11:41.260
<v Speaker 3>The milky way was so bright and clear </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's so many stars in the sky and</v>

2526
02:11:42.011 --> 02:11:47.011
<v Speaker 3>it was a perfect night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back recently and I made a </v>

2527
02:11:47.011 --> 02:11:47.800
<v Speaker 3>mistake and went back when it was a full</v>
<v Speaker 3>moon and it was.</v>

2528
02:11:47.850 --> 02:11:49.660
<v Speaker 3>It was actually a super moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was awful.</v>

2529
02:11:49.710 --> 02:11:52.710
<v Speaker 3>I think august,</v>
<v Speaker 3>august was the moon.</v>

2530
02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:55.060
<v Speaker 3>It was still beautiful and amazing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>still like,</v>

2531
02:11:55.061 --> 02:11:57.010
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a planet floating above us,</v>

2532
02:11:57.340 --> 02:12:00.460
<v Speaker 3>but nothing like the first trip and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>trip,</v>

2533
02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:05.700
<v Speaker 3>being there and seeing those stars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to think that is what early </v>

2534
02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:09.520
<v Speaker 3>man saw every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were just awash in the mystery.</v>

2535
02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:12.180
<v Speaker 3>That is the sky and they paid attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>so much.</v>

2536
02:12:12.230 --> 02:12:14.260
<v Speaker 3>They knew its shape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>changes,</v>

2537
02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:19.760
<v Speaker 3>wobble of the eaRth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They knew about the procession of the </v>

2538
02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:19.760
<v Speaker 3>equinoxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had it mapped out,</v>

2539
02:12:19.930 --> 02:12:24.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's so much that they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out that the equinox procession </v>

2540
02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:25.570
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look what,</v>

2541
02:12:25.571 --> 02:12:28.450
<v Speaker 3>26,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years somehow or another.</v>

2542
02:12:28.451 --> 02:12:33.130
<v Speaker 3>These people had figured a lot of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a long time ago</v>

2543
02:12:33.220 --> 02:12:38.220
<v Speaker 1>and it may have been just total presence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they built the model in their </v>

2544
02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:41.951
<v Speaker 1>head with their own dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'd call it that are endogenously </v>

2545
02:12:41.951 --> 02:12:43.430
<v Speaker 1>or who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they took drugs to.</v>

2546
02:12:43.460 --> 02:12:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Here's a show that was a part of it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was that as well.</v>

2547
02:12:46.370 --> 02:12:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Here's another good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her friend andrew was commissioned.</v>

2548
02:12:50.751 --> 02:12:55.751
<v Speaker 1>He's an incredible painter and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>commissioned to paint the caves of last </v>

2549
02:12:55.751 --> 02:12:55.751
<v Speaker 1>scope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a co.</v>

2550
02:12:55.751 --> 02:13:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Andrew johnstone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complete reconstruction of an on like </v>

2551
02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:01.430
<v Speaker 1>a surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the same rock face,</v>

2552
02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:03.350
<v Speaker 1>but it was for like a restaurant or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2553
02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he got all these,</v>

2554
02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:06.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

2555
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:12.010
<v Speaker 1>You can't go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's people's breath will </v>

2556
02:13:12.010 --> 02:13:12.380
<v Speaker 1>destroy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he started to paint this,</v>

2557
02:13:12.390 --> 02:13:14.090
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to really tune into this.</v>

2558
02:13:14.450 --> 02:13:18.650
<v Speaker 1>He stArted to paint this inside this </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant with the rock face and he was</v>

2559
02:13:18.651 --> 02:13:23.651
<v Speaker 1>painting the copy of it and he would go </v>
<v Speaker 1>out at night because he had to paint at </v>

2560
02:13:23.651 --> 02:13:27.371
<v Speaker 1>night because the restaurant was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>business and he would just know his </v>

2561
02:13:27.371 --> 02:13:29.540
<v Speaker 1>break and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he started to study the sky and then</v>

2562
02:13:29.541 --> 02:13:31.830
<v Speaker 1>we'd go back and paint more of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowls,</v>

2563
02:13:31.831 --> 02:13:33.870
<v Speaker 1>horns and the running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing that,</v>

2564
02:13:33.871 --> 02:13:36.810
<v Speaker 1>and he would go back and after all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>time he started,</v>

2565
02:13:36.811 --> 02:13:41.010
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing lusko in the sky,</v>

2566
02:13:41.011 --> 02:13:42.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little different.</v>

2567
02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:47.440
<v Speaker 1>And he would go back and look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was reconstructIng also go from the </v>

2568
02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:49.290
<v Speaker 1>lowest detail and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a fricking star map.</v>

2569
02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:54.980
<v Speaker 1>This is a star map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he actually submitted a publication </v>

2570
02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:57.650
<v Speaker 1>to an archeological journal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2571
02:13:57.700 --> 02:13:58.900
<v Speaker 1>was reviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2572
02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:00.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>

2573
02:14:00.631 --> 02:14:05.631
<v Speaker 1>I think he wasn't reviewed well because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that it's in the </v>

2574
02:14:05.631 --> 02:14:06.510
<v Speaker 1>literature and I'm not seeing it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chris,</v>

2575
02:14:06.511 --> 02:14:08.490
<v Speaker 1>the stars are in a slightly different </v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

2576
02:14:08.491 --> 02:14:09.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's constellations work,</v>

2577
02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:12.330
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

2578
02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:14.310
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking powerful,</v>

2579
02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:17.870
<v Speaker 3>but isn't it one of those things we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of see patterns if you want to like</v>

2580
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:18.310
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2581
02:14:18.311 --> 02:14:20.280
<v Speaker 3>I see a bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we have,</v>

2582
02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:21.990
<v Speaker 3>there's some patterns like the big </v>
<v Speaker 3>dipper,</v>

2583
02:14:21.991 --> 02:14:22.290
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2584
02:14:22.291 --> 02:14:23.400
<v Speaker 3>it's big dipper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2585
02:14:23.490 --> 02:14:25.600
<v Speaker 3>But when you see all the stars behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>the changes,</v>

2586
02:14:25.650 --> 02:14:27.390
<v Speaker 3>make up your own fucking patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2587
02:14:27.730 --> 02:14:32.730
<v Speaker 3>the big dipper represents to me is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>an established pattern that you know </v>

2588
02:14:32.730 --> 02:14:36.201
<v Speaker 3>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can call it the big dipper and </v>

2589
02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:36.201
<v Speaker 3>say it's a dipper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what it,</v>

2590
02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:36.350
<v Speaker 3>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just,</v>

2591
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:37.360
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that,</v>

2592
02:14:37.540 --> 02:14:40.870
<v Speaker 3>that there they are there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know.</v>

2593
02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:41.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see a bull.</v>

2594
02:14:41.971 --> 02:14:43.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're already fucking painting a bowl,</v>

2595
02:14:43.231 --> 02:14:43.870
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2596
02:14:43.910 --> 02:14:45.150
<v Speaker 3>of course you're seeing a bowl in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sky,</v>

2597
02:14:45.590 --> 02:14:46.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could be good.</v>

2598
02:14:46.710 --> 02:14:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Plus you fucking stiff and pain all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're out of your head going outside,</v>

2599
02:14:50.461 --> 02:14:53.460
<v Speaker 3>you're delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're tired right now.</v>

2600
02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Be a lot of things going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't reviewed very well.</v>

2601
02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:02.130
<v Speaker 3>maybe not a blue wig and started writing</v>
<v Speaker 3>a paper on it and everybody's okay.</v>

2602
02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:04.710
<v Speaker 3>How much paint do you paint?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you using?</v>

2603
02:15:04.711 --> 02:15:06.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How close are you to this pain?</v>

2604
02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:09.720
<v Speaker 3>Then we get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We run into the mind of science.</v>

2605
02:15:09.790 --> 02:15:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

2606
02:15:11.250 --> 02:15:14.970
<v Speaker 3>It's and it's born to critique has to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2607
02:15:14.971 --> 02:15:17.400
<v Speaker 3>It has to so much fuckery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>

2608
02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Because it's one of the only human </v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise.</v>

2609
02:15:19.871 --> 02:15:21.160
<v Speaker 1>It is making progress.</v>

2610
02:15:21.190 --> 02:15:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about your friend that you were </v>

2611
02:15:26.190 --> 02:15:26.190
<v Speaker 3>talking about that was in a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>cult.</v>

2612
02:15:26.190 --> 02:15:28.120
<v Speaker 3>The thought that aliens made the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pyramids that led him to actual science.</v>

2613
02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:31.060
<v Speaker 3>The science actually set him free from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cult.</v>

2614
02:15:31.110 --> 02:15:32.230
<v Speaker 3>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It did.</v>

2615
02:15:32.231 --> 02:15:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't mean that's the whole reason why</v>

2616
02:15:34.811 --> 02:15:36.670
<v Speaker 3>it has to question everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to go.</v>

2617
02:15:36.671 --> 02:15:41.671
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you see up there in the sky </v>

2618
02:15:41.671 --> 02:15:41.671
<v Speaker 3>while you're sniffinG paint pal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2619
02:15:41.671 --> 02:15:43.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cults can waste a lot of minds and a</v>

2620
02:15:43.601 --> 02:15:47.290
<v Speaker 3>lot of lives then that's charismatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leaders are very dangerous,</v>

2621
02:15:47.710 --> 02:15:52.710
<v Speaker 3>especially when they want to lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also I think that the intoxicating </v>

2622
02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:56.020
<v Speaker 3>nature of being that leader.</v>

2623
02:15:56.140 --> 02:16:01.140
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the talk about sociopathy and </v>

2624
02:16:01.140 --> 02:16:03.781
<v Speaker 1>psychopathy and that that's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of the population is lacking </v>

2625
02:16:03.781 --> 02:16:05.200
<v Speaker 1>a brain region that just doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2626
02:16:05.201 --> 02:16:10.201
<v Speaker 1>when they put the system together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's there's no empathic part of the </v>

2627
02:16:10.751 --> 02:16:12.550
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think,</v>

2628
02:16:12.551 --> 02:16:17.551
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking you on on the air here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this sounds like a eugenics kind </v>

2629
02:16:17.551 --> 02:16:22.111
<v Speaker 1>of a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you think a future society or </v>

2630
02:16:22.111 --> 02:16:24.721
<v Speaker 1>future earth ought to screen people when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're young kids when they're young to</v>

2631
02:16:24.881 --> 02:16:29.881
<v Speaker 1>find out if their potential psychopaths </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sociopaths and give them different</v>

2632
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:34.990
<v Speaker 2>trainings and not allow them say to run </v>
<v Speaker 2>armies and countries and stuff like that</v>

2633
02:16:34.991 --> 02:16:37.510
<v Speaker 2>because they're just not going to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the empathic response.</v>

2634
02:16:37.511 --> 02:16:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Like if you had poor vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't pilot an airliner,</v>

2635
02:16:41.351 --> 02:16:46.351
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a physiological thing that makes </v>

2636
02:16:46.351 --> 02:16:47.680
<v Speaker 2>you kind of not suited for certain kinds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of jobs.</v>

2637
02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Can be proven that this is like there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>an undeniable correlation between this </v>

2638
02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:58.411
<v Speaker 2>particular area of the brain and lacking</v>
<v Speaker 2>empathy in that you cannot be a good </v>

2639
02:16:58.411 --> 02:16:58.690
<v Speaker 2>leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot be a good.</v>

2640
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:03.670
<v Speaker 2>There's so many factors like saying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone can't be,</v>

2641
02:17:03.730 --> 02:17:06.310
<v Speaker 2>if they lack empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't be a good leader,</v>

2642
02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:11.400
<v Speaker 2>but what if those same factors that led </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to lack empathy also lead them to </v>

2643
02:17:13.571 --> 02:17:18.571
<v Speaker 2>lack a certain amount of ego that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of fuck up being a leadeR or law </v>

2644
02:17:19.930 --> 02:17:24.930
<v Speaker 2>they laid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lacked a certain amount of need to be </v>

2645
02:17:24.930 --> 02:17:28.891
<v Speaker 2>charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right desire to have all these people </v>

2646
02:17:28.891 --> 02:17:31.891
<v Speaker 2>follow you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like certain high functioning autistic </v>

2647
02:17:31.891 --> 02:17:34.741
<v Speaker 2>folks have incredible skills in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>areas that maybe people that have </v>

2648
02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:40.080
<v Speaker 2>extreme connections to emotions or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>social interaction might not develop.</v>

2649
02:17:40.570 --> 02:17:43.360
<v Speaker 2>So I don't necessArily know that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

2650
02:17:43.370 --> 02:17:48.370
<v Speaker 2>You just don't know all the potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities when it comes to human </v>

2651
02:17:48.370 --> 02:17:49.350
<v Speaker 2>interaction and messing with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just a,</v>

2652
02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:52.870
<v Speaker 2>there's this weird range of what is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

2653
02:17:52.900 --> 02:17:54.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to say that,</v>

2654
02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.750
<v Speaker 2>but there's also people that have taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>those psychopath tests and you know,</v>

2655
02:17:58.751 --> 02:18:00.760
<v Speaker 2>they will technically I'm supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a psychopath.</v>

2656
02:18:00.761 --> 02:18:03.640
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a functioning rational,</v>

2657
02:18:03.641 --> 02:18:07.810
<v Speaker 2>normal member of my community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a loving father and husband and,</v>

2658
02:18:07.811 --> 02:18:09.160
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's great.</v>

2659
02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:14.220
<v Speaker 2>So what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why does this test say I'm a </v>

2660
02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:14.220
<v Speaker 2>psycho,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2661
02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:15.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we haven't nailed yet.</v>

2662
02:18:15.740 --> 02:18:20.740
<v Speaker 2>The problem comes when we get </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopaths doing really terrible shit </v>

2663
02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:23.310
<v Speaker 2>like dictators and stuff like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't get rid of them.</v>

2664
02:18:24.050 --> 02:18:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Then the damage isn't being done and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't do any.</v>

2665
02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:29.260
<v Speaker 2>And what makes them a psychopath in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>

2666
02:18:29.260 --> 02:18:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Like a perfect example is saddam </v>
<v Speaker 2>hussein's children who were notoriously </v>

2667
02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:37.120
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uday and qusay,</v>

2668
02:18:37.130 --> 02:18:42.130
<v Speaker 2>where names were two of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrific human beings that we've ever </v>

2669
02:18:42.130 --> 02:18:43.340
<v Speaker 2>seen come out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2670
02:18:43.380 --> 02:18:44.220
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2671
02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:47.070
<v Speaker 2>the brute of a diCtator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

2672
02:18:47.071 --> 02:18:49.680
<v Speaker 2>he developed some unbelievably evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

2673
02:18:50.050 --> 02:18:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it that they were evil?</v>

2674
02:18:51.851 --> 02:18:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Is it the environment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is a nurture?</v>

2675
02:18:53.561 --> 02:18:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Is it nature?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it genetics?</v>

2676
02:18:55.481 --> 02:18:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Is it epigenetics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it that.</v>

2677
02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Is it just being unbelievably spoiled?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you have ultimate power from the</v>

2678
02:19:02.771 --> 02:19:04.990
<v Speaker 2>time you were a child and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially royalty.</v>

2679
02:19:05.230 --> 02:19:06.670
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What causes that?</v>

2680
02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:12.120
<v Speaker 2>It's possible that our survival as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>species is going to come down to how </v>

2681
02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:16.930
<v Speaker 2>well we unhealthily we manager our </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

2682
02:19:16.931 --> 02:19:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean ultimately if we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're not doing that,</v>

2683
02:19:20.430 --> 02:19:23.910
<v Speaker 2>then like if for instance you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>building a mars colony,</v>

2684
02:19:23.930 --> 02:19:28.930
<v Speaker 2>was going to have 250 people in it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have children or </v>

2685
02:19:28.930 --> 02:19:28.930
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

2686
02:19:28.930 --> 02:19:32.900
<v Speaker 1>would know that if you get one kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy revolutionary leader that does the</v>

2687
02:19:32.901 --> 02:19:37.901
<v Speaker 1>whole charismatic thing and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a shooting thing is </v>

2688
02:19:37.901 --> 02:19:39.290
<v Speaker 1>going to shoot a hole so the dome and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's going to die.</v>

2689
02:19:39.291 --> 02:19:44.291
<v Speaker 1>So you can't ever afford that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have this careful management of </v>

2690
02:19:44.291 --> 02:19:48.371
<v Speaker 1>human psychology within that call on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure it's healthy and watch </v>

2691
02:19:48.371 --> 02:19:52.951
<v Speaker 1>those processes and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To some extent the scandinavians did </v>

2692
02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:55.760
<v Speaker 1>this a thousand years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scandinavians have the vikings.</v>

2693
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:59.300
<v Speaker 1>when they had their war parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader of the war party,</v>

2694
02:19:59.301 --> 02:20:02.930
<v Speaker 1>they would go and invade east anglia or </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way to greenland,</v>

2695
02:20:02.931 --> 02:20:06.650
<v Speaker 1>labrador and what they called these guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>the preserve or kinks,</v>

2696
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:11.950
<v Speaker 1>and these guys were put in charge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they would go and they will do </v>

2697
02:20:11.950 --> 02:20:14.231
<v Speaker 1>terrible shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they would terrorize and murder </v>

2698
02:20:14.231 --> 02:20:15.320
<v Speaker 1>and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they settled east anglia,</v>

2699
02:20:15.350 --> 02:20:17.690
<v Speaker 1>when they built york,</v>
<v Speaker 1>york,</v>

2700
02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:19.610
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they excavated it.</v>

2701
02:20:20.060 --> 02:20:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vikings are now settled,</v>

2702
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:24.470
<v Speaker 1>so they took the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worker king.</v>

2703
02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've done your job.</v>

2704
02:20:27.050 --> 02:20:31.940
<v Speaker 1>You get the nice little grass hut at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>edge of town and you're off duty because</v>

2705
02:20:31.941 --> 02:20:34.760
<v Speaker 1>we can't afford that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we have to build a community.</v>

2706
02:20:35.050 --> 02:20:37.720
<v Speaker 3>So what will they do with him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did retire them off.</v>

2707
02:20:37.930 --> 02:20:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Retired to mob and how you keep them </v>
<v Speaker 3>from killing people.</v>

2708
02:20:39.911 --> 02:20:40.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm going nutty.</v>

2709
02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:42.620
<v Speaker 1>He just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody would follow him as the rules.</v>

2710
02:20:42.621 --> 02:20:44.360
<v Speaker 1>It was the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the way that they did it.</v>

2711
02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:47.600
<v Speaker 1>So when you look at how sane scandinavia</v>
<v Speaker 1>is today,</v>

2712
02:20:47.601 --> 02:20:48.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe they got all that out.</v>

2713
02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:52.830
<v Speaker 3>That's a funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very funny thought.</v>

2714
02:20:53.700 --> 02:20:55.360
<v Speaker 3>That who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>

2715
02:20:55.390 --> 02:21:00.390
<v Speaker 3>who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's also there is a potential </v>

2716
02:21:00.390 --> 02:21:01.290
<v Speaker 3>for technology to play a part in all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2717
02:21:01.710 --> 02:21:06.710
<v Speaker 3>I think that one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out with technology is access to </v>

2718
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:09.120
<v Speaker 3>information and access to information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not just current information,</v>

2719
02:21:09.121 --> 02:21:14.121
<v Speaker 3>but I'll maybe even future like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to read minds,</v>

2720
02:21:14.371 --> 02:21:16.260
<v Speaker 3>to read thoughts to read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2721
02:21:16.330 --> 02:21:17.610
<v Speaker 3>fff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mri,</v>

2722
02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:20.370
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it's been widely criticized,</v>

2723
02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:24.000
<v Speaker 3>has been used to convict people of </v>
<v Speaker 3>crimes in India.</v>

2724
02:21:24.030 --> 02:21:29.030
<v Speaker 3>There's a woman who was convicted of </v>
<v Speaker 3>murder because she had what they </v>

2725
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:33.500
<v Speaker 3>describe as functional knowledge of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crime scene and this has been widely </v>

2726
02:21:33.631 --> 02:21:37.560
<v Speaker 3>discredited and it's very controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2727
02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:42.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was for a television show that I </v>

2728
02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:44.751
<v Speaker 3>was doing for saifai.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We interviewed a neurologist or a </v>

2729
02:21:45.121 --> 02:21:50.121
<v Speaker 3>neuroscientist and she was describing </v>
<v Speaker 3>how this in in our country will never </v>

2730
02:21:51.481 --> 02:21:56.481
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in these other countries where the </v>

2731
02:21:56.481 --> 02:22:00.171
<v Speaker 3>maybe they don't have as much of as much</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an understanding or they were able to</v>

2732
02:22:00.511 --> 02:22:05.511
<v Speaker 3>manipulate their courts into thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this was far more definitive and </v>

2733
02:22:05.611 --> 02:22:06.660
<v Speaker 3>conclusive than it really is.</v>

2734
02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:11.070
<v Speaker 3>But the point being that this is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tip of the iceberg,</v>

2735
02:22:11.071 --> 02:22:16.071
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they continue to get better at </v>

2736
02:22:16.071 --> 02:22:18.620
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if this human technological </v>

2737
02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:23.301
<v Speaker 3>symbiotic relationship takes place to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the point where we essentially are our </v>

2738
02:22:24.140 --> 02:22:26.430
<v Speaker 3>memories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially there pretty piss poor,</v>

2739
02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:31.820
<v Speaker 3>but if we can turn our memories into </v>
<v Speaker 3>some digital archive that you can </v>

2740
02:22:31.820 --> 02:22:31.820
<v Speaker 3>access,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will.</v>

2741
02:22:31.820 --> 02:22:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Then we're going to know I've got an I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to look into your head and I'm </v>

2742
02:22:36.530 --> 02:22:38.340
<v Speaker 3>going to know what's going on and to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to tap into it and we will.</v>

2743
02:22:38.410 --> 02:22:43.410
<v Speaker 3>We'll be connected the same way we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected with wifi the same way our </v>

2744
02:22:43.410 --> 02:22:44.430
<v Speaker 3>cell phones are connected through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cellular network.</v>

2745
02:22:44.610 --> 02:22:48.240
<v Speaker 3>They'll be some sort of a network of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information exchange between all people.</v>

2746
02:22:48.241 --> 02:22:51.450
<v Speaker 3>And if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deception will be almost impossible.</v>

2747
02:22:51.780 --> 02:22:55.500
<v Speaker 3>Motivations would be crystal clear and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to know who's full of shit.</v>

2748
02:22:55.700 --> 02:23:00.700
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be a fucking bad day for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of idiots out there because a lot </v>

2749
02:23:00.700 --> 02:23:03.650
<v Speaker 3>of assholes out there that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>leading along idiots and the they,</v>

2750
02:23:03.660 --> 02:23:05.340
<v Speaker 3>they believe in these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2751
02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:07.230
<v Speaker 3>whether these cult members or whatever</v>

2752
02:23:07.270 --> 02:23:12.270
<v Speaker 1>you remember in kubrick's film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2001 in the beginning when there's the </v>

2753
02:23:13.050 --> 02:23:14.460
<v Speaker 1>pre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monkeys,</v>

2754
02:23:14.461 --> 02:23:19.170
<v Speaker 1>the monkeys model and they're sitting at</v>
<v Speaker 1>dawn and they're sitting in this kind of</v>

2755
02:23:19.171 --> 02:23:21.900
<v Speaker 1>cliff area and they're looking at each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

2756
02:23:21.901 --> 02:23:23.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at each other.</v>

2757
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:28.910
<v Speaker 1>I never forgot that scene because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scene before they get attacked by </v>

2758
02:23:28.910 --> 02:23:32.571
<v Speaker 1>that other group that comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're looking at each other and </v>

2759
02:23:32.571 --> 02:23:32.571
<v Speaker 1>their nonverbal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>RighT.</v>

2760
02:23:32.571 --> 02:23:36.891
<v Speaker 1>They're not communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to do lists and emails </v>

2761
02:23:36.891 --> 02:23:37.150
<v Speaker 1>and shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just there.</v>

2762
02:23:37.750 --> 02:23:42.750
<v Speaker 1>And to me like kubrick was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>show that they are in a group </v>

2763
02:23:42.750 --> 02:23:46.190
<v Speaker 1>intelligence that just by eye gaze they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could tell what the state is and then </v>

2764
02:23:47.191 --> 02:23:52.191
<v Speaker 1>the share that state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if somebody in such an intense </v>

2765
02:23:52.191 --> 02:23:54.390
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you have nefarious purposes or</v>

2766
02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:57.780
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to look away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have that whole thing.</v>

2767
02:23:58.020 --> 02:24:02.460
<v Speaker 1>so maybe that's the way we were before </v>
<v Speaker 1>we came into mind.</v>

2768
02:24:02.490 --> 02:24:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Before all this stuff came in </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization mind to do lists,</v>

2769
02:24:06.571 --> 02:24:08.250
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were.</v>

2770
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:12.270
<v Speaker 1>There was no way for us like we're way </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking now at each other.</v>

2771
02:24:12.271 --> 02:24:13.500
<v Speaker 1>We're really connected.</v>

2772
02:24:13.660 --> 02:24:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the valleys of perceptions may be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pre communicative apes where they </v>

2773
02:24:20.621 --> 02:24:23.680
<v Speaker 3>didn't have verbal communication or </v>
<v Speaker 3>language or anything.</v>

2774
02:24:23.890 --> 02:24:28.890
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they had this sort of intuitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of each other and then that was </v>

2775
02:24:28.890 --> 02:24:31.891
<v Speaker 3>all lost with email and twitter and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ended up coming back with some new </v>

2776
02:24:31.891 --> 02:24:34.180
<v Speaker 3>technology that takes it to a far deeper</v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

2777
02:24:34.190 --> 02:24:34.430
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

2778
02:24:34.460 --> 02:24:36.620
<v Speaker 1>what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is my theory,</v>

2779
02:24:36.621 --> 02:24:39.020
<v Speaker 1>is that a louis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2780
02:24:39.350 --> 02:24:41.040
<v Speaker 1>we were warning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2781
02:24:41.290 --> 02:24:46.290
<v Speaker 1>it looses by packing those thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>initiates and two that buried temple and</v>

2782
02:24:46.701 --> 02:24:49.460
<v Speaker 1>subjecting them to sound and music and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2783
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:52.700
<v Speaker 1>some kind of sounds like a rave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like intense,</v>

2784
02:24:52.910 --> 02:24:55.550
<v Speaker 1>but these people were fashioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were fat.</v>

2785
02:24:55.551 --> 02:24:59.930
<v Speaker 1>They were fashioned into new beings from</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that experience wasn't,</v>

2786
02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:02.900
<v Speaker 1>couldn't it have been a group mind fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and couldn't have been,</v>

2787
02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:05.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>returning that.</v>

2788
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:08.030
<v Speaker 1>And when we siT in medicine circles </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

2789
02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:13.330
<v Speaker 1>when we do jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we do a group yoga,</v>

2790
02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:18.370
<v Speaker 1>intense things are intense ordeal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things that people are seeking out now </v>

2791
02:25:18.370 --> 02:25:21.440
<v Speaker 1>for deep connection to remove isolation </v>
<v Speaker 1>from other people.</v>

2792
02:25:21.710 --> 02:25:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Meditation's all these practices are </v>
<v Speaker 1>this yearning to get back to where we </v>

2793
02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:28.030
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2794
02:25:28.460 --> 02:25:32.770
<v Speaker 1>you didn't feel isolated from others and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we had her in a group mind and that</v>

2795
02:25:32.940 --> 02:25:37.940
<v Speaker 1>that's the future of evolution of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities and we may need the shaman </v>

2796
02:25:37.940 --> 02:25:38.050
<v Speaker 1>to come around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2797
02:25:38.051 --> 02:25:40.040
<v Speaker 1>in the upper paleolithic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2798
02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:41.740
<v Speaker 1>those communities were pretty helpful.</v>

2799
02:25:41.770 --> 02:25:43.630
<v Speaker 1>That waS a pretty functional world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2800
02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:45.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming into,</v>

2801
02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:50.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the karnak and the stone hands and the </v>

2802
02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:53.071
<v Speaker 1>lay lines and be incredible world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>even celtic europe was incredibly </v>

2803
02:25:53.071 --> 02:25:57.661
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was killed at europe is like the </v>

2804
02:25:57.661 --> 02:26:00.031
<v Speaker 1>european union now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Celtic europe had medical practices and </v>

2805
02:26:00.031 --> 02:26:04.021
<v Speaker 1>common laws and the druids could come in</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was a battle about to occur </v>

2806
02:26:05.231 --> 02:26:10.231
<v Speaker 1>between celtic people's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The druids had the power to walk down </v>

2807
02:26:10.231 --> 02:26:14.101
<v Speaker 1>that line and decide whether the battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>should happen or not because there was </v>

2808
02:26:14.101 --> 02:26:14.101
<v Speaker 1>an authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was.</v>

2809
02:26:14.101 --> 02:26:18.930
<v Speaker 1>So this whole idea of the civilization </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the european union after 2000 years </v>

2810
02:26:19.871 --> 02:26:23.350
<v Speaker 1>of roman interest to seen war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barbarian warfare,</v>

2811
02:26:23.351 --> 02:26:27.340
<v Speaker 1>christian religious and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they've returned to the celtic model,</v>

2812
02:26:27.341 --> 02:26:32.341
<v Speaker 1>they've returned in sense the upper </v>
<v Speaker 1>paleolithic model of civilization of of </v>

2813
02:26:33.011 --> 02:26:38.011
<v Speaker 1>civil societies and not beating each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other in and in doing and of common </v>

2814
02:26:38.171 --> 02:26:39.310
<v Speaker 1>currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>common exchange,</v>

2815
02:26:39.311 --> 02:26:44.311
<v Speaker 1>common health comm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that is coming back that is </v>

2816
02:26:44.311 --> 02:26:47.080
<v Speaker 1>returning and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're shutting off the culture that came</v>

2817
02:26:47.081 --> 02:26:48.390
<v Speaker 1>and destroyed illusion looses.</v>

2818
02:26:48.590 --> 02:26:53.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's definitely a feeling </v>

2819
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.590
<v Speaker 3>amongst a lot of folks that the standard</v>
<v Speaker 3>model,</v>

2820
02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:58.510
<v Speaker 3>the cubicle life retirement at 65 is not</v>
<v Speaker 3>just unappealing,</v>

2821
02:26:58.780 --> 02:27:00.890
<v Speaker 3>not just unrewarding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's surf,</v>

2822
02:27:01.740 --> 02:27:06.740
<v Speaker 3>surf model slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a form of slavery that's voluntary </v>

2823
02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:06.740
<v Speaker 3>mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2824
02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:08.140
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're connecting to a machine.</v>

2825
02:27:08.290 --> 02:27:10.990
<v Speaker 3>You're giving your body literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're giving your health,</v>

2826
02:27:11.140 --> 02:27:13.320
<v Speaker 3>you're giving your spinal fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ears,</v>

2827
02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:16.630
<v Speaker 3>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your creative creativity are very.</v>

2828
02:27:17.260 --> 02:27:22.260
<v Speaker 3>Your body literally is like giving into </v>
<v Speaker 3>your chair and your back is being </v>

2829
02:27:22.260 --> 02:27:24.580
<v Speaker 3>compressed and your discs are bulging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your feet are going numb,</v>

2830
02:27:24.581 --> 02:27:29.581
<v Speaker 3>and I mean your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body is being sucked down into </v>

2831
02:27:29.581 --> 02:27:32.810
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your mind is turned into a stimulus </v>

2832
02:27:32.810 --> 02:27:35.410
<v Speaker 3>response pieces of jello and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what a lot of this yoga,</v>

2833
02:27:35.411 --> 02:27:40.411
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this renaissance of meditation that a </v>

2834
02:27:40.411 --> 02:27:41.020
<v Speaker 3>lot of people are experiencing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially yoga.</v>

2835
02:27:41.470 --> 02:27:44.040
<v Speaker 3>Yoga was never this popular when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2836
02:27:44.270 --> 02:27:49.270
<v Speaker 3>it's incredibly popular now and as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rise of technological connection,</v>

2837
02:27:50.020 --> 02:27:55.020
<v Speaker 3>electronic connections with each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>has also facilitated the rise of like </v>

2838
02:27:55.020 --> 02:27:59.970
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fit these people wanting to do things </v>

2839
02:27:59.970 --> 02:27:59.970
<v Speaker 3>that are physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical.</v>

2840
02:27:59.970 --> 02:28:03.590
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On friday I did a pretty long float and </v>

2841
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:06.890
<v Speaker 3>we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way they've offered you a free </v>

2842
02:28:06.890 --> 02:28:08.110
<v Speaker 3>float if you come up to the santa cruz </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains are friends.</v>

2843
02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:10.000
<v Speaker 3>that sounds like a long trip for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>float.</v>

2844
02:28:10.001 --> 02:28:14.330
<v Speaker 3>I got one in my basement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a beautiful flotation.</v>

2845
02:28:14.420 --> 02:28:17.170
<v Speaker 3>It's the name of the company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cloud nine.</v>

2846
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2847
02:28:17.591 --> 02:28:18.520
<v Speaker 3>I've heard of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2848
02:28:18.540 --> 02:28:22.240
<v Speaker 3>because jim shaunti and they was </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating</v>

2849
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:25.070
<v Speaker 1>property and I went there for a float </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I tell you,</v>

2850
02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:26.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2851
02:28:26.970 --> 02:28:30.290
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like doing,</v>

2852
02:28:30.540 --> 02:28:35.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychedelic in that or doing deep </v>

2853
02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:38.840
<v Speaker 1>meditation or doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the flotation tank is I think better</v>

2854
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:43.870
<v Speaker 1>because I process all my brain shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for the first hour or something in </v>

2855
02:28:44.661 --> 02:28:49.661
<v Speaker 1>this probably happens to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just grind through and it's like I'm </v>

2856
02:28:49.661 --> 02:28:53.380
<v Speaker 1>having these repeated thoughts of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind or my ego is grinding through and </v>

2857
02:28:53.380 --> 02:28:57.690
<v Speaker 1>through and finally it quiets fine when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quiet and I don't have stimulus on </v>

2858
02:28:57.690 --> 02:29:02.411
<v Speaker 1>my body because I'm in a flotation tank </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I maybe have my head held up or </v>

2859
02:29:02.411 --> 02:29:05.690
<v Speaker 1>whatever and I start not knowing my body</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it is and I'm free,</v>

2860
02:29:05.691 --> 02:29:10.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm liberated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the I can do the deep work at </v>

2861
02:29:10.691 --> 02:29:11.510
<v Speaker 1>my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the next day,</v>

2862
02:29:11.570 --> 02:29:16.570
<v Speaker 1>this is why I was able to finish this to</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific papers because I floated and </v>

2863
02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I lost all that 2000 years of refer me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was months and months of being in my </v>

2864
02:29:22.551 --> 02:29:23.840
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2865
02:29:23.841 --> 02:29:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

2866
02:29:24.141 --> 02:29:25.310
<v Speaker 1>It's such a powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful</v>

2867
02:29:25.350 --> 02:29:30.350
<v Speaker 3>tool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an amazing tool and it's really </v>

2868
02:29:30.350 --> 02:29:32.271
<v Speaker 3>bizarre to me that this was something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was kind of forgotten for a long </v>

2869
02:29:32.271 --> 02:29:35.301
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't understand when I first </v>

2870
02:29:35.301 --> 02:29:37.641
<v Speaker 3>discovered the tank when I first saw it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in altered states when I was in high </v>

2871
02:29:37.641 --> 02:29:37.700
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

2872
02:29:37.730 --> 02:29:42.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing movie with William Murray where </v>

2873
02:29:42.730 --> 02:29:45.000
<v Speaker 3>he turns into drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowasca became some freak animal.</v>

2874
02:29:46.350 --> 02:29:49.890
<v Speaker 3>Crazy movie really does not hold up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't watch it again.</v>

2875
02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:52.800
<v Speaker 3>We'll try to watch in 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a piece of shit.</v>

2876
02:29:52.830 --> 02:29:53.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so bad.</v>

2877
02:29:54.120 --> 02:29:55.500
<v Speaker 3>It's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people have watched.</v>

2878
02:29:55.501 --> 02:29:57.780
<v Speaker 3>It laughed at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking like this movie.</v>

2879
02:29:58.010 --> 02:30:00.180
<v Speaker 3>My brow is 14.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2880
02:30:00.390 --> 02:30:05.390
<v Speaker 3>So long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but point is I didn't experience it </v>

2881
02:30:05.390 --> 02:30:07.260
<v Speaker 3>until 2002.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I first did it,</v>

2882
02:30:08.130 --> 02:30:10.290
<v Speaker 3>others plays in burbank called soothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>solutions.</v>

2883
02:30:10.291 --> 02:30:11.100
<v Speaker 3>I was placed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where did it.</v>

2884
02:30:11.310 --> 02:30:16.310
<v Speaker 3>The first time I did I wanted to do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever and I found a place that had it </v>

2885
02:30:16.310 --> 02:30:18.720
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is this not popular?</v>

2886
02:30:18.990 --> 02:30:20.310
<v Speaker 3>And then when I started talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2887
02:30:20.311 --> 02:30:20.940
<v Speaker 3>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2888
02:30:20.941 --> 02:30:25.941
<v Speaker 3>you're always talking about this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're the guy who talks about the </v>

2889
02:30:25.941 --> 02:30:25.941
<v Speaker 3>tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2890
02:30:25.941 --> 02:30:26.970
<v Speaker 3>how are you hearing about this from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>goddamn comedian?</v>

2891
02:30:27.330 --> 02:30:28.390
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is this not the.</v>

2892
02:30:28.440 --> 02:30:33.440
<v Speaker 3>How's the president not on television </v>
<v Speaker 3>and saying we need to create a more </v>

2893
02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:35.820
<v Speaker 3>introspective commerce society and one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things we're going to do is we're</v>

2894
02:30:35.821 --> 02:30:38.370
<v Speaker 3>going to wheel out isolation tanks all </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the nation.</v>

2895
02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:42.480
<v Speaker 3>There will be a beautiful thing to bring</v>
<v Speaker 3>them up to some high schools,</v>

2896
02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:44.310
<v Speaker 3>community centers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>universities.</v>

2897
02:30:44.640 --> 02:30:49.640
<v Speaker 3>This will accelerate thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the best tools for personal </v>

2898
02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:53.961
<v Speaker 3>evolution I've ever experienced for </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually the exact same thing as you </v>

2899
02:30:53.961 --> 02:30:58.041
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me it's the first x amount of </v>

2900
02:30:58.041 --> 02:30:58.041
<v Speaker 3>minutes is all just going over my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit,</v>

2901
02:30:58.041 --> 02:31:02.750
<v Speaker 3>but slowly but surely because I do it so</v>
<v Speaker 3>often I've gotten quicker with that and </v>

2902
02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:06.150
<v Speaker 3>it's gotten down to like 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just I get in there and I go,</v>

2903
02:31:06.151 --> 02:31:11.151
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to go through all this stupid </v>

2904
02:31:11.151 --> 02:31:11.151
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clean all this out.</v>

2905
02:31:11.151 --> 02:31:12.770
<v Speaker 3>But perspective enhancing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2906
02:31:12.771 --> 02:31:17.771
<v Speaker 3>like no matter how hectic and weird my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life is when I get into that thing and </v>

2907
02:31:18.181 --> 02:31:18.990
<v Speaker 3>then I get out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2908
02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:19.930
<v Speaker 3>that's all right.</v>

2909
02:31:20.440 --> 02:31:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2910
02:31:22.270 --> 02:31:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm the best hippie of the 66.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

2911
02:31:26.060 --> 02:31:31.060
<v Speaker 3>It's so important for me because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>always juggling like five different </v>

2912
02:31:31.060 --> 02:31:31.060
<v Speaker 3>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2913
02:31:31.060 --> 02:31:32.400
<v Speaker 1>a million things to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2914
02:31:32.401 --> 02:31:37.401
<v Speaker 1>my back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put my fricking back out so I go into </v>

2915
02:31:37.401 --> 02:31:38.490
<v Speaker 1>float and it's like the first hour it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just so painful.</v>

2916
02:31:38.491 --> 02:31:43.491
<v Speaker 1>It's like slowly like separates and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I barely do this and then barely </v>

2917
02:31:45.931 --> 02:31:48.170
<v Speaker 1>put my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put my hands down and then then I say,</v>

2918
02:31:48.210 --> 02:31:53.210
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my body can take any position so I let </v>

2919
02:31:53.210 --> 02:31:57.021
<v Speaker 1>my body tickets own position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It moves itself around until I'm not in </v>

2920
02:31:57.021 --> 02:32:01.221
<v Speaker 1>pain anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time I got out the pain </v>

2921
02:32:02.101 --> 02:32:04.360
<v Speaker 1>was down like 80 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2922
02:32:04.370 --> 02:32:07.680
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is an unbelievable tool and it's just</v>

2923
02:32:07.681 --> 02:32:11.070
<v Speaker 1>weird to me how uncommon it is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrence's.</v>

2924
02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:13.660
<v Speaker 1>How do they keep the lid on this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>

2925
02:32:14.210 --> 02:32:15.800
<v Speaker 3>The other thing that terrence says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the man,</v>

2926
02:32:15.980 --> 02:32:18.320
<v Speaker 3>sometimes people do the man's work for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the man,</v>

2927
02:32:18.380 --> 02:32:21.650
<v Speaker 3>like no one's putting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping the lid on isolation tanks.</v>

2928
02:32:21.651 --> 02:32:24.650
<v Speaker 3>It's just no one tAlked about it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason.</v>

2929
02:32:24.651 --> 02:32:28.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just life is tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have mortgages,</v>

2930
02:32:28.930 --> 02:32:33.930
<v Speaker 3>they have student loans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of work that has to be </v>

2931
02:32:33.930 --> 02:32:34.530
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lawn has to be mowed.</v>

2932
02:32:35.140 --> 02:32:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Got to raise your kids a lot of shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

2933
02:32:37.281 --> 02:32:41.480
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to servitude jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking before the podcast about</v>

2934
02:32:41.481 --> 02:32:44.180
<v Speaker 3>chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird chair that I have this saddle</v>

2935
02:32:44.181 --> 02:32:47.300
<v Speaker 3>chair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you use an ergonomic chair when you,</v>

2936
02:32:47.301 --> 02:32:48.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you do your writing,</v>

2937
02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:49.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2938
02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:53.950
<v Speaker 1>my neighbor and I made this chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We took this body built chair from.</v>

2939
02:32:53.960 --> 02:32:57.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a plug for you from Texas that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>used by surgeons,</v>

2940
02:32:57.111 --> 02:32:59.240
<v Speaker 1>by brain surgeons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tilts forward.</v>

2941
02:32:59.241 --> 02:33:04.241
<v Speaker 1>It has incredible support and we made an</v>
<v Speaker 1>extension arm that holds the keyboard of</v>

2942
02:33:04.310 --> 02:33:09.310
<v Speaker 1>my lap and the mouse exactly in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right place just right where your arms </v>

2943
02:33:09.310 --> 02:33:10.040
<v Speaker 1>hang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang,</v>

2944
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:12.020
<v Speaker 1>and then I can roll back from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screens.</v>

2945
02:33:12.021 --> 02:33:17.021
<v Speaker 1>I'm much farther from the screen so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get that myopic kind of early </v>

2946
02:33:17.021 --> 02:33:17.930
<v Speaker 1>visit and vision loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's me.</v>

2947
02:33:18.020 --> 02:33:19.320
<v Speaker 1>I got that chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2948
02:33:19.770 --> 02:33:21.800
<v Speaker 1>So I've been using that chair for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

2949
02:33:21.980 --> 02:33:26.980
<v Speaker 1>but now what I'm finding unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just even reaching for the mouse as </v>

2950
02:33:26.980 --> 02:33:28.910
<v Speaker 1>creating repetitive strain injury for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2951
02:33:29.090 --> 02:33:33.560
<v Speaker 1>even going to get one of them helmets or</v>
<v Speaker 1>move around your eyes.</v>

2952
02:33:33.620 --> 02:33:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately I'm back on a laptop where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to do any motion until my </v>

2953
02:33:38.620 --> 02:33:38.750
<v Speaker 1>friend told me.</v>

2954
02:33:38.750 --> 02:33:39.890
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an idiot.</v>

2955
02:33:40.130 --> 02:33:41.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friends of the hassle.</v>

2956
02:33:41.790 --> 02:33:43.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right away you're an idiot.</v>

2957
02:33:43.540 --> 02:33:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an asshole.</v>

2958
02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:47.870
<v Speaker 1>But I have my own podcast called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>levity zone.</v>

2959
02:33:47.871 --> 02:33:49.430
<v Speaker 1>And I do lots of editing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2960
02:33:49.431 --> 02:33:50.990
<v Speaker 1>I know that you could just go straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

2961
02:33:50.991 --> 02:33:52.380
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like a craftsman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2962
02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:55.210
<v Speaker 1>we have different musicians in each </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode for the levity,</v>

2963
02:33:55.211 --> 02:33:57.030
<v Speaker 1>sound liberties on.org.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2964
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:59.780
<v Speaker 1>say that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Levity zone.org.</v>

2965
02:34:00.020 --> 02:34:02.960
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] dot org.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the world needs more.</v>

2966
02:34:03.050 --> 02:34:08.050
<v Speaker 1>We have plenty of novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need more at t l e v I t y zone.</v>

2967
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:13.630
<v Speaker 1>So you're in the zone when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to these shows at [inaudible] </v>

2968
02:34:13.630 --> 02:34:16.100
<v Speaker 1>dot org.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I do tons of editing and he said,</v>

2969
02:34:16.101 --> 02:34:21.101
<v Speaker 1>you fool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to get a kensington track ball </v>

2970
02:34:21.101 --> 02:34:21.730
<v Speaker 1>so you're just moving your thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not your arm.</v>

2971
02:34:22.300 --> 02:34:25.120
<v Speaker 1>All editors are using track balls for </v>
<v Speaker 1>buttons.</v>

2972
02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:27.680
<v Speaker 1>And I finally got religion and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally not using a mouse.</v>

2973
02:34:27.700 --> 02:34:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Mac has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2974
02:34:29.140 --> 02:34:31.930
<v Speaker 1>they have like a key,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this track pad.</v>

2975
02:34:32.020 --> 02:34:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a larger version of it.</v>

2976
02:34:33.461 --> 02:34:34.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what I use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2977
02:34:34.711 --> 02:34:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I used to move the tracks back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward and then I use the other hand on</v>

2978
02:34:39.671 --> 02:34:41.230
<v Speaker 1>the kensington to go cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paste,</v>

2979
02:34:41.231 --> 02:34:41.660
<v Speaker 1>cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paste.</v>

2980
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing great.</v>

2981
02:34:43.870 --> 02:34:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

2982
02:34:44.651 --> 02:34:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2983
02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Well you also have probably have </v>
<v Speaker 1>keystrokes preprogrammed on that thing </v>

2984
02:34:50.820 --> 02:34:50.820
<v Speaker 1>and the buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2985
02:34:50.820 --> 02:34:52.000
<v Speaker 1>That helps cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Copy paste.</v>

2986
02:34:52.010 --> 02:34:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Mark's like no collected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the track pad.</v>

2987
02:34:55.931 --> 02:34:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Once I switched to it on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2988
02:34:57.830 --> 02:35:02.830
<v Speaker 1>on a home computer or on an imac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never go back to the house </v>

2989
02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:04.660
<v Speaker 1>except for gaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can't it either way.</v>

2990
02:35:05.380 --> 02:35:09.970
<v Speaker 1>The digi barn museum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a new artifact.</v>

2991
02:35:10.450 --> 02:35:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Doug angle parts mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know doug engelbart,</v>

2992
02:35:13.950 --> 02:35:14.900
<v Speaker 1>he and building that.</v>

2993
02:35:14.900 --> 02:35:19.900
<v Speaker 1>She created the mouse and the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>online system in the mid sixties and </v>

2994
02:35:19.900 --> 02:35:23.641
<v Speaker 1>they dug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had something called the mother of all </v>

2995
02:35:23.641 --> 02:35:23.641
<v Speaker 1>demos which happened on December 9th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

2996
02:35:23.641 --> 02:35:27.160
<v Speaker 1>68 and it totally revolutionized what </v>
<v Speaker 1>computing was going to be.</v>

2997
02:35:27.161 --> 02:35:32.161
<v Speaker 1>He was like in this hall in san </v>
<v Speaker 1>francisco using a mouse and the cursor </v>

2998
02:35:32.161 --> 02:35:36.170
<v Speaker 1>was going on the screen is opening </v>
<v Speaker 1>windows and clicking the first graphic </v>

2999
02:35:36.170 --> 02:35:40.621
<v Speaker 1>user interface with 68 house and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that one,</v>

3000
02:35:40.991 --> 02:35:45.280
<v Speaker 1>but I've got a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look up mother of all demos,</v>

3001
02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:51.160
<v Speaker 1>you'll see the one that came into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog barn looks exactly like the one that</v>

3002
02:35:51.161 --> 02:35:56.161
<v Speaker 1>doug is using the demo now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were several of them made so we </v>

3003
02:35:56.161 --> 02:35:59.731
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this has the round buttons as a </v>

3004
02:35:59.731 --> 02:36:01.960
<v Speaker 1>great big case on it and a key set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the see he had.</v>

3005
02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:03.550
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have to go to the keyboard.</v>

3006
02:36:03.550 --> 02:36:05.440
<v Speaker 1>He had this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this court keyboard.</v>

3007
02:36:05.540 --> 02:36:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I'll that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3008
02:36:06.611 --> 02:36:07.180
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3009
02:36:07.181 --> 02:36:09.310
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are three buttons mean well,</v>

3010
02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:14.400
<v Speaker 1>apple had one button actually that deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the two thousands probably from my </v>

3011
02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:18.991
<v Speaker 1>collection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's an alto mouse from the </v>

3012
02:36:18.991 --> 02:36:20.470
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If look at sandy's,</v>

3013
02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:23.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do tug to mother of all demos and you'll</v>

3014
02:36:23.981 --> 02:36:25.270
<v Speaker 1>probably find the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3015
02:36:25.630 --> 02:36:30.630
<v Speaker 1>the video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it true that xerox created the user </v>

3016
02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:34.140
<v Speaker 1>interface in the apple copied xerox and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then ultimately microsoft copies apple?</v>

3017
02:36:34.180 --> 02:36:39.180
<v Speaker 1>It wAs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of passed from one to the </v>

3018
02:36:39.180 --> 02:36:39.180
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

3019
02:36:39.180 --> 02:36:43.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a say sri stanford research institute </v>

3020
02:36:43.430 --> 02:36:44.560
<v Speaker 1>did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doug engelbart nls,</v>

3021
02:36:44.590 --> 02:36:46.840
<v Speaker 1>fantastic demo and everybody watched it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

3022
02:36:46.841 --> 02:36:51.841
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this totally changed computing into a </v>

3023
02:36:51.841 --> 02:36:53.320
<v Speaker 1>human thing rather than data processing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and batch.</v>

3024
02:36:53.321 --> 02:36:55.180
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became no,</v>

3025
02:36:55.190 --> 02:36:57.070
<v Speaker 1>it's visual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're visual.</v>

3026
02:36:57.340 --> 02:37:00.480
<v Speaker 1>This is a tool for our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tool for this.</v>

3027
02:37:00.780 --> 02:37:02.450
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An hour and a half long though.</v>

3028
02:37:02.451 --> 02:37:05.530
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scroll around and you can see doug,</v>

3029
02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:07.740
<v Speaker 1>you can see doug other areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

3030
02:37:07.890 --> 02:37:11.080
<v Speaker 1>You see that thing on the right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that in 68,</v>

3031
02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:12.490
<v Speaker 1>68.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look at that.</v>

3032
02:37:12.910 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>That looks exactly like the mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's at the barn right now.</v>

3033
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:19.730
<v Speaker 2>That's remarkably similar to what a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people use.</v>

3034
02:37:19.850 --> 02:37:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Then look at the keyboard and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>steelcase or somebody did that thing and</v>

3035
02:37:24.011 --> 02:37:29.011
<v Speaker 1>the key set allows you to court key </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements like accelerated things and </v>

3036
02:37:30.151 --> 02:37:35.151
<v Speaker 1>then on screen he has clickable text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a video window that a guy </v>

3037
02:37:35.531 --> 02:37:40.330
<v Speaker 1>appears from sri transmitted live video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

3038
02:37:40.331 --> 02:37:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's him.</v>

3039
02:37:41.530 --> 02:37:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the engineers at sri.</v>

3040
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:46.430
<v Speaker 2>So he's got live video on a screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3041
02:37:48.050 --> 02:37:50.750
<v Speaker 2>this is 68 and 68.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is live video.</v>

3042
02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is beamed in a big auditorium </v>

3043
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:56.770
<v Speaker 1>in san francisco at a conference and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the audience is going,</v>

3044
02:37:57.130 --> 02:37:59.200
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is computing.</v>

3045
02:37:59.201 --> 02:38:04.201
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is interacting with people and so </v>

3046
02:38:04.201 --> 02:38:04.570
<v Speaker 1>he's clicking see the cursor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just sort of barely see it.</v>

3047
02:38:04.571 --> 02:38:06.940
<v Speaker 1>He's moving around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's clicking on things,</v>

3048
02:38:06.941 --> 02:38:11.941
<v Speaker 1>they're pulling up data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing searches and that's a </v>

3049
02:38:11.941 --> 02:38:12.700
<v Speaker 1>recipe lists and so everybody looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and said,</v>

3050
02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:18.360
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so xerox palo alto research center </v>

3051
02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:21.690
<v Speaker 1>kind of had a bunch of people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>doug's group and then they built the </v>

3052
02:38:21.690 --> 02:38:25.441
<v Speaker 1>first network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal computer or the ether net and </v>

3053
02:38:25.441 --> 02:38:25.441
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the seventies,</v>

3054
02:38:25.441 --> 02:38:25.580
<v Speaker 1>and you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3055
02:38:25.700 --> 02:38:29.530
<v Speaker 1>in walks steve jobs and in the croup and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of went,</v>

3056
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:31.450
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the future of computing,</v>

3057
02:38:31.451 --> 02:38:35.800
<v Speaker 1>and they created the lisa and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>macintosh and bill gates and the company</v>

3058
02:38:35.830 --> 02:38:40.830
<v Speaker 1>looked at the xerox star and altona and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gerald pneumonia who was at park,</v>

3059
02:38:41.260 --> 02:38:46.260
<v Speaker 1>came to microsoft and created microsoft </v>
<v Speaker 1>word based on him creating the first </v>

3060
02:38:46.260 --> 02:38:49.720
<v Speaker 1>word processor at park and then made a </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars.</v>

3061
02:38:49.721 --> 02:38:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everything.</v>

3062
02:38:50.411 --> 02:38:55.411
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean xerox really did invent the </v>

3063
02:38:55.411 --> 02:38:56.050
<v Speaker 1>future under bob taylor's leadership in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the seventies.</v>

3064
02:38:56.051 --> 02:38:57.570
<v Speaker 1>They just created the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3065
02:38:57.610 --> 02:39:00.100
<v Speaker 2>How did they drop the ball and go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>copy machines?</v>

3066
02:39:00.310 --> 02:39:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3067
02:39:00.891 --> 02:39:05.891
<v Speaker 2>it was such a company full of copier </v>
<v Speaker 2>heads and understand what they were </v>

3068
02:39:05.891 --> 02:39:09.511
<v Speaker 2>looking at it and walked out the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>But dolby came out of that and everybody</v>

3069
02:39:10.181 --> 02:39:12.310
<v Speaker 2>in ibm in the 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was,</v>

3070
02:39:12.311 --> 02:39:15.990
<v Speaker 2>when they said no one's gonna want a </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer in their house.</v>

3071
02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck up.</v>

3072
02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:21.820
<v Speaker 2>It was like the biggest bad call ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3073
02:39:21.821 --> 02:39:26.821
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were all these predictions that </v>

3074
02:39:26.821 --> 02:39:26.821
<v Speaker 2>completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>

3075
02:39:26.821 --> 02:39:27.690
<v Speaker 2>In retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in retrospect,</v>

3076
02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:28.480
<v Speaker 2>how could anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3077
02:39:28.481 --> 02:39:29.890
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that always the point?</v>

3078
02:39:30.130 --> 02:39:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about,</v>

3079
02:39:32.291 --> 02:39:35.020
<v Speaker 2>you can't predict a 2012 or 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45,</v>

3080
02:39:35.021 --> 02:39:37.360
<v Speaker 2>you're just not going to not going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's gonna see it.</v>

3081
02:39:37.900 --> 02:39:41.590
<v Speaker 2>I am going to have some ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ultimately the thing itself,</v>

3082
02:39:41.830 --> 02:39:46.830
<v Speaker 2>like no one ever thought the internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going to be facebook or message </v>

3083
02:39:49.001 --> 02:39:51.460
<v Speaker 2>boards or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>

3084
02:39:51.730 --> 02:39:55.180
<v Speaker 2>social media interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way we we experienced today.</v>

3085
02:39:55.450 --> 02:40:00.450
<v Speaker 2>It's so unbelievably bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>this connection that we have to each </v>

3086
02:40:00.450 --> 02:40:01.770
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so intense and,</v>

3087
02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:03.640
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one saw it coming.</v>

3088
02:40:03.660 --> 02:40:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Like for instance,</v>

3089
02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.430
<v Speaker 1>just yesterday morning I got up into </v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>

3090
02:40:07.980 --> 02:40:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be on joe rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to just at least post your </v>

3091
02:40:12.980 --> 02:40:16.120
<v Speaker 1>beautiful red face logo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my facebook page and put it on a bunch </v>

3092
02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:19.560
<v Speaker 1>of groups because available on a mug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just put this up.</v>

3093
02:40:20.190 --> 02:40:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I put this up just on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only got three or 4,000</v>

3094
02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:24.810
<v Speaker 1>followers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this thing just went bing,</v>

3095
02:40:24.811 --> 02:40:25.260
<v Speaker 1>bing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bing,</v>

3096
02:40:25.261 --> 02:40:25.710
<v Speaker 1>bing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bang.</v>

3097
02:40:25.711 --> 02:40:26.820
<v Speaker 1>And people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3098
02:40:26.910 --> 02:40:29.910
<v Speaker 1>there's probably a ton of listeners that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't have been just because of</v>

3099
02:40:29.911 --> 02:40:30.680
<v Speaker 1>one little thing.</v>

3100
02:40:31.570 --> 02:40:32.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

3101
02:40:33.150 --> 02:40:34.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3102
02:40:34.171 --> 02:40:39.171
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things too that I love</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that someone could listen to </v>

3103
02:40:40.111 --> 02:40:41.190
<v Speaker 3>this and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3104
02:40:41.191 --> 02:40:43.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bruce damer is on this podcast.</v>

3105
02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:46.290
<v Speaker 3>you got to check this out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a link.</v>

3106
02:40:46.470 --> 02:40:47.720
<v Speaker 3>And then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

3107
02:40:48.150 --> 02:40:50.910
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then someone retweets it and it gets</v>

3108
02:40:50.911 --> 02:40:55.911
<v Speaker 3>retweeted a thousand times and sent to </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook and someone sends in an email </v>

3109
02:40:55.911 --> 02:40:55.911
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

3110
02:40:56.820 --> 02:41:00.130
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're back.</v>

3111
02:41:00.430 --> 02:41:03.250
<v Speaker 1>We're back in that little group of 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one eight,</v>

3112
02:41:03.970 --> 02:41:05.800
<v Speaker 1>looking at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we're looking,</v>

3113
02:41:06.050 --> 02:41:10.370
<v Speaker 1>we're spending for sending the whole of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture and technology in each gaze.</v>

3114
02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:12.270
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3115
02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:17.520
<v Speaker 1>if you could be some kind of super being</v>
<v Speaker 1>unwatched the mind of humanity from </v>

3116
02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:22.220
<v Speaker 1>orbit and study it as a thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming alive and it's moving.</v>

3117
02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:24.380
<v Speaker 1>It's getting connected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3118
02:41:24.381 --> 02:41:27.610
<v Speaker 1>maynard to be better than any trip </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

3119
02:41:27.611 --> 02:41:29.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in truth,</v>

3120
02:41:29.261 --> 02:41:34.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look up at the night sky or doing the </v>

3121
02:41:34.261 --> 02:41:36.361
<v Speaker 1>work in origin of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at molecular streams and </v>

3122
02:41:36.361 --> 02:41:39.211
<v Speaker 1>looking through microscopes on liquid </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemistry and I was like this most </v>

3123
02:41:39.211 --> 02:41:42.390
<v Speaker 1>amazing universe of just lipids moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>around on a slide and then look at the </v>

3124
02:41:42.851 --> 02:41:46.330
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the greatest time in the history</v>

3125
02:41:46.331 --> 02:41:48.100
<v Speaker 1>of and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3126
02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:50.830
<v Speaker 1>the people talk about rare earths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3127
02:41:50.831 --> 02:41:53.380
<v Speaker 1>how rare is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we,</v>

3128
02:41:53.381 --> 02:41:54.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drake equation,</v>

3129
02:41:54.851 --> 02:41:58.750
<v Speaker 1>which shows solar systems that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>planets in the planet that have been the</v>

3130
02:41:58.751 --> 02:42:02.320
<v Speaker 1>right habitable zone and the develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent life.</v>

3131
02:42:02.321 --> 02:42:07.300
<v Speaker 1>And we had just the right end asteroid </v>
<v Speaker 1>impacts to come in and spin the disk and</v>

3132
02:42:07.301 --> 02:42:08.800
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start again.</v>

3133
02:42:08.830 --> 02:42:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3134
02:42:10.310 --> 02:42:12.550
<v Speaker 1>and we rose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3135
02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:16.330
<v Speaker 1>what's the chance of us snus being out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

3136
02:42:16.331 --> 02:42:17.680
<v Speaker 1>How many of them are there?</v>

3137
02:42:17.970 --> 02:42:22.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't the ultimate mind fuck the concept</v>

3138
02:42:22.051 --> 02:42:27.051
<v Speaker 3>of infinity?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the way I've heard it described </v>

3139
02:42:27.051 --> 02:42:27.090
<v Speaker 3>that if infinity exists and they believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does,</v>

3140
02:42:27.420 --> 02:42:31.110
<v Speaker 3>that means the universe is so huge that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that's ever happened on earth</v>

3141
02:42:31.111 --> 02:42:36.111
<v Speaker 3>in the exact same order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's happened in infant number of times </v>

3142
02:42:36.111 --> 02:42:36.111
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else.</v>

3143
02:42:36.111 --> 02:42:36.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

3144
02:42:36.111 --> 02:42:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I once had a kind of a conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe and I asked it,</v>

3145
02:42:40.801 --> 02:42:44.910
<v Speaker 1>so I went through a thought experiment </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I went through the origin of life,</v>

3146
02:42:45.390 --> 02:42:50.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just loaded my mind with everything I </v>

3147
02:42:50.390 --> 02:42:52.881
<v Speaker 1>could do and I went through and saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like super charged on all this </v>

3148
02:42:53.370 --> 02:42:57.930
<v Speaker 1>stuff of my meditation and my thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments and I came out screaming,</v>

3149
02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:03.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came into the division of the first </v>

3150
02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:05.091
<v Speaker 1>proto cell and while it was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked around and I saw all this crazy</v>

3151
02:43:05.131 --> 02:43:10.131
<v Speaker 1>molecular stuff going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gave me the vision to work </v>

3152
02:43:10.131 --> 02:43:12.430
<v Speaker 1>backwards to create the model that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just publishing now.</v>

3153
02:43:12.970 --> 02:43:15.940
<v Speaker 1>But I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is kind of heretical,</v>

3154
02:43:15.941 --> 02:43:20.941
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't see that it was all </v>

3155
02:43:20.941 --> 02:43:20.941
<v Speaker 1>mechanical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3156
02:43:20.941 --> 02:43:23.230
<v Speaker 1>it seemed like there was something doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3157
02:43:23.380 --> 02:43:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so complex.</v>

3158
02:43:25.510 --> 02:43:27.360
<v Speaker 1>So in this thought experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3159
02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I sat up straight and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to ask one more question if this,</v>

3160
02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:35.220
<v Speaker 1>if there's something before life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>

3161
02:43:35.290 --> 02:43:38.230
<v Speaker 1>if there was intelligence in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did this,</v>

3162
02:43:38.231 --> 02:43:39.600
<v Speaker 1>can I see it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3163
02:43:39.610 --> 02:43:44.610
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you asked the ineffable </v>

3164
02:43:44.610 --> 02:43:46.951
<v Speaker 1>these questions ineffable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get pissed off with questions </v>

3165
02:43:46.951 --> 02:43:50.170
<v Speaker 1>sometimes and the inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it did in my consciousness as I was</v>

3166
02:43:50.171 --> 02:43:55.171
<v Speaker 1>looking out into the night sky into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness and it resolved and to </v>

3167
02:43:56.120 --> 02:44:01.120
<v Speaker 1>starfield and they'll start fill the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rural salt into gas clouds and galaxies,</v>

3168
02:44:01.271 --> 02:44:02.830
<v Speaker 1>and then the whole thing came rushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

3169
02:44:03.190 --> 02:44:08.190
<v Speaker 1>slammed into my consciousness sensor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocked me down and what the answer was </v>

3170
02:44:08.190 --> 02:44:13.110
<v Speaker 1>you silly monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The universe is big enough to have </v>

3171
02:44:13.110 --> 02:44:15.340
<v Speaker 1>agency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It grew big enough from the big bang.</v>

3172
02:44:15.370 --> 02:44:19.480
<v Speaker 1>It grew along the probability streams so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this happened.</v>

3173
02:44:20.170 --> 02:44:23.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one concept that I.</v>

3174
02:44:25.100 --> 02:44:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I can kinda understand infinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can kind of understand a lot of the </v>

3175
02:44:30.761 --> 02:44:33.430
<v Speaker 1>concepts of the cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the big bang,</v>

3176
02:44:33.850 --> 02:44:38.850
<v Speaker 1>which is I hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes in one ear and it goes out the </v>

3177
02:44:38.850 --> 02:44:41.410
<v Speaker 1>other and it's just some words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just some shit that's typed out.</v>

3178
02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:45.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just an idea that someone has that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't conceptualize.</v>

3179
02:44:45.900 --> 02:44:48.310
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brain is too fucking dumb.</v>

3180
02:44:48.610 --> 02:44:50.640
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't process it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3181
02:44:50.790 --> 02:44:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I got a vision of it because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me to,</v>

3182
02:44:54.071 --> 02:44:59.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean the vision that I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting there in bed asking the </v>

3183
02:44:59.381 --> 02:45:04.381
<v Speaker 1>question of what can I see pack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I wanted to see back and what came in</v>

3184
02:45:06.521 --> 02:45:11.521
<v Speaker 1>my head were three buckets and inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the three buckets were three blobs and </v>

3185
02:45:13.330 --> 02:45:18.330
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the blobs is super low </v>

3186
02:45:18.330 --> 02:45:18.330
<v Speaker 1>probability of ever happening.</v>

3187
02:45:18.330 --> 02:45:20.810
<v Speaker 1>The probability buckets and the others </v>
<v Speaker 1>are kind of like ordinary rowboats.</v>

3188
02:45:20.890 --> 02:45:25.890
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a thIrd bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second bucket has a super low probably </v>

3189
02:45:25.890 --> 02:45:29.521
<v Speaker 1>blob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the third bucket has the low </v>

3190
02:45:29.521 --> 02:45:32.251
<v Speaker 1>probably blog and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intelligence that was communicating </v>

3191
02:45:32.251 --> 02:45:35.290
<v Speaker 1>to me to teach me said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch me bing,</v>

3192
02:45:35.410 --> 02:45:36.190
<v Speaker 1>bing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bing.</v>

3193
02:45:36.191 --> 02:45:38.680
<v Speaker 1>So when you say this though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to interrupt you.</v>

3194
02:45:38.830 --> 02:45:39.520
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3195
02:45:39.860 --> 02:45:44.860
<v Speaker 1>what the intelligence showed me because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was asking the question and getting a </v>

3196
02:45:44.860 --> 02:45:47.971
<v Speaker 1>thought experiment back was saying I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger the lowest probability of hanse </v>

3197
02:45:48.130 --> 02:45:50.710
<v Speaker 1>one after the other after the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

3198
02:45:50.740 --> 02:45:51.940
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3199
02:45:52.330 --> 02:45:53.440
<v Speaker 1>And said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch me.</v>

3200
02:45:53.441 --> 02:45:58.441
<v Speaker 1>I will rotate them towards you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the buckets are all lined up and you </v>

3201
02:45:58.441 --> 02:45:59.860
<v Speaker 1>say you see the path through the low </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability events.</v>

3202
02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes I do.</v>

3203
02:46:00.941 --> 02:46:05.941
<v Speaker 1>He says watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the path went all the way back to </v>

3204
02:46:05.941 --> 02:46:05.941
<v Speaker 1>cosmo.</v>

3205
02:46:05.941 --> 02:46:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Genesys and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

3206
02:46:07.961 --> 02:46:12.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this energy was pouring through super </v>

3207
02:46:12.961 --> 02:46:14.600
<v Speaker 1>low probability and then the entity said</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch this.</v>

3208
02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:20.020
<v Speaker 1>And I was pulled back and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>trillions of these tracers coming from,</v>

3209
02:46:20.510 --> 02:46:22.460
<v Speaker 1>from the singularity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the big bang.</v>

3210
02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:28.030
<v Speaker 1>And the answer was that is the power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power to trigger the lowest </v>

3211
02:46:28.030 --> 02:46:31.670
<v Speaker 1>probability events in all directions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is the power,</v>

3212
02:46:32.110 --> 02:46:35.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from mundane it please.</v>

3213
02:46:35.470 --> 02:46:40.470
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're communicating with an entity and </v>

3214
02:46:40.470 --> 02:46:40.470
<v Speaker 1>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3215
02:46:40.470 --> 02:46:40.670
<v Speaker 1>this thing that's communicating with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3216
02:46:40.671 --> 02:46:43.730
<v Speaker 1>this is more likely your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3217
02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Well sometimes it is imagination on </v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids sometimes to stuff comes in.</v>

3218
02:46:49.281 --> 02:46:51.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like your friend you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about stuff comes in.</v>

3219
02:46:51.681 --> 02:46:54.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know einstein for example,</v>

3220
02:46:54.780 --> 02:46:59.780
<v Speaker 1>used to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein will be having his coffee and </v>

3221
02:46:59.780 --> 02:47:03.380
<v Speaker 1>his swiss cafe pondering about can can </v>
<v Speaker 1>light go faster,</v>

3222
02:47:04.130 --> 02:47:09.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a constant and the speed of </v>

3223
02:47:09.130 --> 02:47:09.260
<v Speaker 1>light and one night he just sort of sat </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

3224
02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:14.560
<v Speaker 1>closed his eyes and suddenly he was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this endogenous world and you can read </v>

3225
02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:14.560
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

3226
02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:17.480
<v Speaker 1>He called it good duncan experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought experiments.</v>

3227
02:47:17.481 --> 02:47:19.820
<v Speaker 1>He would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to understand this,</v>

3228
02:47:20.150 --> 02:47:25.150
<v Speaker 1>but he would open himself to anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what came into einstein's mind was </v>

3229
02:47:25.150 --> 02:47:30.100
<v Speaker 1>he became like a train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like mounted onto a train and </v>

3230
02:47:30.100 --> 02:47:34.181
<v Speaker 1>there was another train coming down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>track and they each had so it was at </v>

3231
02:47:34.181 --> 02:47:35.870
<v Speaker 1>night and the light was streaming out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

3232
02:47:35.871 --> 02:47:39.410
<v Speaker 1>but how can I be the photon going toward</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

3233
02:47:39.411 --> 02:47:44.411
<v Speaker 1>Other photon in the photons are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>twice the speed of light relative to </v>

3234
02:47:44.411 --> 02:47:46.310
<v Speaker 1>each other and then he had this credible</v>
<v Speaker 1>insights about,</v>

3235
02:47:46.460 --> 02:47:51.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible if you have different </v>

3236
02:47:51.460 --> 02:47:51.460
<v Speaker 1>frames of reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>

3237
02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:56.120
<v Speaker 1>His face change in all the whole special</v>
<v Speaker 1>on general theory of relativity came out</v>

3238
02:47:56.121 --> 02:47:59.540
<v Speaker 1>from these thought experiments that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did that he didn't quite know where they</v>

3239
02:47:59.541 --> 02:48:02.000
<v Speaker 1>came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just sort of poured into him.</v>

3240
02:48:02.510 --> 02:48:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Then he had to interpret and into </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics and into testable theories.</v>

3241
02:48:06.580 --> 02:48:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're.</v>

3242
02:48:07.161 --> 02:48:09.030
<v Speaker 1>do any ideas come from though really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

3243
02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:09.630
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

3244
02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Why consider the possibility that coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>from entities?</v>

3245
02:48:12.291 --> 02:48:14.330
<v Speaker 1>why don't why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think this is your mind,</v>

3246
02:48:14.331 --> 02:48:18.360
<v Speaker 1>your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just contemplating possibilities and,</v>

3247
02:48:18.460 --> 02:48:20.950
<v Speaker 1>and here's where I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3248
02:48:21.030 --> 02:48:24.580
<v Speaker 1>this is a really big woo model because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this wound,</v>

3249
02:48:24.581 --> 02:48:26.720
<v Speaker 1>wu on the front of the stove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the t shirt here.</v>

3250
02:48:27.170 --> 02:48:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I think that somehow our minds when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're open and we're,</v>

3251
02:48:31.820 --> 02:48:36.820
<v Speaker 1>we're in a state of not distraction or </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries or dissolved and we're in a </v>

3252
02:48:38.091 --> 02:48:43.091
<v Speaker 1>clear state that our minds are big </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough computational engines to resonate</v>

3253
02:48:43.461 --> 02:48:46.970
<v Speaker 1>with a whole lot of shit non locally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

3254
02:48:46.971 --> 02:48:50.180
<v Speaker 1>you believe nonlocal intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that like perhaps there's some</v>

3255
02:48:50.181 --> 02:48:52.910
<v Speaker 1>sort of a universal intelligence out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that you can tune into.</v>

3256
02:48:53.170 --> 02:48:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>

3257
02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:01.460
<v Speaker 1>if you trace all of the neuronal </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathways down,</v>

3258
02:49:01.461 --> 02:49:03.710
<v Speaker 1>all the synapses and across all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>caps,</v>

3259
02:49:03.711 --> 02:49:06.860
<v Speaker 1>backwards and forwards in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can look this up online,</v>

3260
02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:12.150
<v Speaker 1>the number of those tracers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those unique strings is larger,</v>

3261
02:49:12.370 --> 02:49:17.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or an equivalent or larger than the </v>

3262
02:49:17.370 --> 02:49:17.370
<v Speaker 1>number of subatomic particles in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

3263
02:49:17.850 --> 02:49:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all accountable objects in the universe.</v>

3264
02:49:19.710 --> 02:49:24.710
<v Speaker 1>It's this huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The common materials are huge because </v>

3265
02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:26.460
<v Speaker 1>the brain says this network and as soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it ramps up,</v>

3266
02:49:26.880 --> 02:49:28.350
<v Speaker 1>so your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

3267
02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:31.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like an informational system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a coding system that,</v>

3268
02:49:31.820 --> 02:49:36.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could activate this pathway and </v>

3269
02:49:36.820 --> 02:49:36.820
<v Speaker 1>that little variation of that pathway </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that will,</v>

3270
02:49:36.820 --> 02:49:40.500
<v Speaker 1>is actually bigger than the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course it's in the universe to,</v>

3271
02:49:40.501 --> 02:49:45.501
<v Speaker 1>it's not bigger than itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you have the idea of non </v>

3272
02:49:45.611 --> 02:49:50.611
<v Speaker 1>locality where everything talks to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything non locally,</v>

3273
02:49:51.090 --> 02:49:56.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and instantly was this bell's theorem </v>

3274
02:49:56.090 --> 02:49:58.260
<v Speaker 1>and all this sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so could it be that there's some,</v>

3275
02:49:58.261 --> 02:50:03.261
<v Speaker 1>and this is a total who hand wavy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could it be that your mind really </v>

3276
02:50:03.261 --> 02:50:07.491
<v Speaker 1>fully activated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fully present through your </v>

3277
02:50:07.491 --> 02:50:07.491
<v Speaker 1>filters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through your training,</v>

3278
02:50:07.491 --> 02:50:10.440
<v Speaker 1>whether you're a roman catholic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a skeptical,</v>

3279
02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:15.750
<v Speaker 1>whatever you stuff can come in that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>resonating from some field,</v>

3280
02:50:16.140 --> 02:50:20.160
<v Speaker 1>another intelligence objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns,</v>

3281
02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:25.520
<v Speaker 1>stuff in time and history beyond what </v>
<v Speaker 1>our little reductionist kind of </v>

3282
02:50:26.250 --> 02:50:31.250
<v Speaker 1>mechanical thinking gives us that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>we be resonating with real shit that's </v>

3283
02:50:31.250 --> 02:50:34.290
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's beyond what our training is,</v>

3284
02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:36.120
<v Speaker 1>but it will be filtered throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

3285
02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:39.850
<v Speaker 3>You're sort of tapping into some </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible,</v>

3286
02:50:39.851 --> 02:50:43.570
<v Speaker 3>ultimate potential,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some potential for accessing information</v>

3287
02:50:43.571 --> 02:50:45.660
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and possibilities for,</v>

3288
02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:48.700
<v Speaker 3>for possibilities as far as connections </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities,</v>

3289
02:50:48.701 --> 02:50:53.701
<v Speaker 3>as far as like putting things together </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your head and proposing the various </v>

3290
02:50:54.431 --> 02:50:56.650
<v Speaker 3>scenarios that maybe wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>

3291
02:50:57.310 --> 02:50:59.890
<v Speaker 3>If you impose limitations on where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>came from,</v>

3292
02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:05.000
<v Speaker 1>you try to figure out with your training</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your to do list and your algorithms,</v>

3293
02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:10.300
<v Speaker 1>you'd never get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're literally have to blow your </v>

3294
02:51:10.300 --> 02:51:10.300
<v Speaker 1>mind completely open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3295
02:51:10.300 --> 02:51:10.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3296
02:51:10.770 --> 02:51:15.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>graham hancock gave a fantastic example </v>

3297
02:51:15.770 --> 02:51:17.690
<v Speaker 1>on your show within the last month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a telescope.</v>

3298
02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Remember that needs to shape change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape of the lands in order for you to </v>

3299
02:51:22.750 --> 02:51:25.640
<v Speaker 1>resolve and see stars and galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3300
02:51:25.641 --> 02:51:28.910
<v Speaker 1>So those people who never use telescopes</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3301
02:51:28.911 --> 02:51:33.911
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't have to perturb the mind </v>

3302
02:51:33.911 --> 02:51:33.911
<v Speaker 1>to see what's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3303
02:51:33.911 --> 02:51:35.180
<v Speaker 1>they've never looked through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>telescope,</v>

3304
02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:37.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we should,</v>

3305
02:51:37.371 --> 02:51:40.040
<v Speaker 1>as a species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we realize we need to perturb our.</v>

3306
02:51:40.190 --> 02:51:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Mine's always have a huge problem with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that say you shouldn't perturb </v>

3307
02:51:45.190 --> 02:51:49.051
<v Speaker 3>the mind because I don't see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative impact of perturbing the mind </v>

3308
02:51:49.051 --> 02:51:51.721
<v Speaker 3>and I see a massive amount of positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I see these people saying you </v>

3309
02:51:51.721 --> 02:51:54.391
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't perturb the mind and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't perturbed them on something </v>

3310
02:51:54.391 --> 02:51:54.391
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3311
02:51:54.391 --> 02:51:57.811
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like anyone who says that like </v>

3312
02:51:57.811 --> 02:51:59.990
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experiences are not valuable</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hasn't had psychedelic experiences.</v>

3313
02:51:59.991 --> 02:52:01.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3314
02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:03.760
<v Speaker 3>we're just going around in circles here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking crazy.</v>

3315
02:52:03.761 --> 02:52:06.310
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't know whether they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>valued and you're just totally.</v>

3316
02:52:06.510 --> 02:52:09.910
<v Speaker 2>They've never floated or they've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>done meditation.</v>

3317
02:52:09.970 --> 02:52:13.480
<v Speaker 2>But the what I think the beauty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experience,</v>

3318
02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:18.510
<v Speaker 2>the actual taking of a psychedelic is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's undeniable mushrooms work </v>

3319
02:52:18.910 --> 02:52:21.070
<v Speaker 2>on everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dmt works well.</v>

3320
02:52:21.071 --> 02:52:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some weird freak people apparently don't</v>

3321
02:52:25.060 --> 02:52:27.370
<v Speaker 2>have dmt experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3322
02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.370
<v Speaker 2>The problem is it's so illegal and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

3323
02:52:30.371 --> 02:52:35.371
<v Speaker 2>It's so difficult to to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think strassman had any people </v>

3324
02:52:35.371 --> 02:52:38.101
<v Speaker 2>that didn't find a an impact for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intravenous dmt studies that he did at </v>

3325
02:52:38.261 --> 02:52:43.261
<v Speaker 2>university of New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that people that say it's </v>

3326
02:52:43.261 --> 02:52:47.731
<v Speaker 2>not valuable and haven't experienced it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're discounting it just thousands,</v>

3327
02:52:47.891 --> 02:52:52.891
<v Speaker 2>millions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps people who have had incredibly </v>

3328
02:52:52.891 --> 02:52:54.190
<v Speaker 2>valuable experiences doing it and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying you don't need it.</v>

3329
02:52:54.270 --> 02:52:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're scared.</v>

3330
02:52:56.110 --> 02:53:01.110
<v Speaker 2>You're scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these tribal cultures and that </v>

3331
02:53:01.110 --> 02:53:02.970
<v Speaker 2>needed that use that to initiate people </v>
<v Speaker 2>into humanity,</v>

3332
02:53:02.971 --> 02:53:03.970
<v Speaker 2>to human being.</v>

3333
02:53:04.210 --> 02:53:09.210
<v Speaker 2>I think from then then your idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>endogenous access becomes becomes very </v>

3334
02:53:11.261 --> 02:53:15.070
<v Speaker 2>attractive and it also becomes more </v>
<v Speaker 2>plausible because people know that these</v>

3335
02:53:15.071 --> 02:53:18.700
<v Speaker 2>states are reachable because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>without knowing,</v>

3336
02:53:18.701 --> 02:53:21.670
<v Speaker 2>like I remember the first time I had any</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experience,</v>

3337
02:53:21.671 --> 02:53:24.720
<v Speaker 2>the first really big one was a five men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3338
02:53:24.760 --> 02:53:29.380
<v Speaker 2>I had a small mushroom experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the five meo dmt experience.</v>

3339
02:53:29.381 --> 02:53:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Like after that I can remember really </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly thinkinG,</v>

3340
02:53:33.970 --> 02:53:38.970
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I know that this is a </v>

3341
02:53:38.970 --> 02:53:38.970
<v Speaker 2>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to kind of rethink,</v>

3342
02:53:38.970 --> 02:53:40.330
<v Speaker 2>rethink my spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

3343
02:53:40.420 --> 02:53:45.420
<v Speaker 2>and so then one could see reaching these</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible states through some sort of </v>

3344
02:53:47.411 --> 02:53:52.411
<v Speaker 2>indogenous method that maybe perhaps he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have never even given it the </v>

3345
02:53:52.411 --> 02:53:56.311
<v Speaker 2>chance before and I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking african communities that </v>

3346
02:53:56.311 --> 02:54:00.541
<v Speaker 2>used ibogaine as an initiatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience on ordeal or initiate or </v>

3347
02:54:00.641 --> 02:54:05.641
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to take those uninformed </v>

3348
02:54:05.641 --> 02:54:06.970
<v Speaker 2>youths that think they know everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3349
02:54:07.380 --> 02:54:11.740
<v Speaker 2>and they're and they're exposing them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>something so massive that forces them to</v>

3350
02:54:11.741 --> 02:54:16.741
<v Speaker 2>challenge their own internal state and </v>
<v Speaker 2>and come to terms with fears or other </v>

3351
02:54:17.891 --> 02:54:20.410
<v Speaker 2>things and broaden themselves out there.</v>

3352
02:54:20.410 --> 02:54:24.160
<v Speaker 2>We even there weft as a human beIng.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they come out of that,</v>

3353
02:54:24.610 --> 02:54:29.610
<v Speaker 2>they're a member of the community and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trustable and they look each </v>

3354
02:54:29.610 --> 02:54:33.061
<v Speaker 2>other in the eye and they had the taps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not children name or not </v>

3355
02:54:33.061 --> 02:54:36.270
<v Speaker 2>juvenile anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is perhaps it was stolen from </v>

3356
02:54:36.270 --> 02:54:38.670
<v Speaker 2>us when we lost our initiatory rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>and was taken away by priests.</v>

3357
02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:42.970
<v Speaker 2>It was taken away by corporations or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it's just a blip.</v>

3358
02:54:43.300 --> 02:54:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe it's not taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's just in our context of our </v>

3359
02:54:48.300 --> 02:54:51.181
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd look at a thousand years being so </v>

3360
02:54:51.181 --> 02:54:51.350
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the universe said nothing.</v>

3361
02:54:51.930 --> 02:54:53.200
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if this state,</v>

3362
02:54:53.201 --> 02:54:56.860
<v Speaker 2>this the look to the life of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's enough and then nothing.</v>

3363
02:54:56.861 --> 02:54:58.390
<v Speaker 2>so we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been taken away from us.</v>

3364
02:54:58.450 --> 02:55:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Like now we're talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going anywhere.</v>

3365
02:55:02.250 --> 02:55:02.850
<v Speaker 2>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3366
02:55:02.890 --> 02:55:03.570
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

3367
02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:05.390
<v Speaker 2>we're celebrating its return.</v>

3368
02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're out of time,</v>

3369
02:55:06.951 --> 02:55:09.290
<v Speaker 2>but this is an amazing conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could have 100 of these.</v>

3370
02:55:09.291 --> 02:55:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I think we really could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could,</v>

3371
02:55:10.740 --> 02:55:15.740
<v Speaker 2>we could go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could take the what if train to the </v>

3372
02:55:15.740 --> 02:55:19.510
<v Speaker 2>end of mars and back and I would like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back and bring you a bunch of </v>
