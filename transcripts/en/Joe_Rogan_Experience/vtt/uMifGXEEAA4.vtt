<v Speaker 1>the biggest,</v>

15
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>diehard vegans were the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The angry ones just let them loose there</v>

16
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.050
<v Speaker 1>and go wander around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd go there,</v>

17
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>they'd go bonkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd run into walls and probably,</v>

18
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pee themselves.</v>

20
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>and the cool stuff and places you can go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to shoot your own food.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>

45
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.550
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with all that extra time </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you spend,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to spend that time now </v>
<v Speaker 1>working those fingers.</v>

49
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Very efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're filthy hunting skills.</v>

50
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>So you saw that and were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

51
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:15.654
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things I thought I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did not know I had the power to destroy </v>

52
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:19.434
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am more powerful than I than I ever </v>

53
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's impressive,</v>

54
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

55
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have filthy honeys.</v>

56
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was sort of like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compliment,</v>

57
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's hence the shirt.</v>

58
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.063
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's such a disconnect going on this </v>

59
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.893
<v Speaker 1>world right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about this today while </v>

60
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:35.604
<v Speaker 1>we're practicing.</v>

61
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture war.</v>

62
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.293
<v Speaker 1>There's a movement of people right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this whole eat what you kill </v>

63
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:44.004
<v Speaker 1>movement and a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejecting the idea of factory farming </v>

64
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 1>and rejecting the idea of a buying </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

65
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:53.604
<v Speaker 1>Food and buying cows that are locked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in pens and treated like a commodity </v>

66
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>rather than like a living animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

67
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.213
<v Speaker 1>And going out into the woods and hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and getting their own food and </v>

68
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.813
<v Speaker 1>connecting to this sort of primal </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence and self sufficient self </v>

69
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I like about it,</v>

70
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:13.504
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't rely on anybody to feed my </v>

71
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:16.384
<v Speaker 1>family and a lot of people love that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's this group of people </v>

72
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:20.944
<v Speaker 1>that are completely disconnected from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the wild works that are very </v>

73
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:25.384
<v Speaker 1>angry about all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's some bizarre </v>

74
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.683
<v Speaker 1>conversations I've been having with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well meaning very intelligent </v>

75
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:33.124
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

76
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.090
<v Speaker 1>They're very nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

77
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.943
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where there's a big </v>

78
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:37.924
<v Speaker 1>misconception here like I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got into it with a gang of people </v>

79
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>recently and I wish you even say I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it because I've kind of given up on</v>

80
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 1>insulting people online because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get anything out of it.</v>

81
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

82
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like me.</v>

83
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked me,</v>

84
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>I liked me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a nice guy.</v>

85
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.973
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you meet me and you communicate with </v>

86
00:03:58.631 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

87
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.153
<v Speaker 1>Even if we disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee we're going to have a </v>

88
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 1>pleasant conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a nice person,</v>

89
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when someone insults me or says nasty</v>

90
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>shit or it makes a nasty video about me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch it.</v>

91
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people want you to respond,</v>

92
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to.</v>

93
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Why would I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have enough time.</v>

94
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough time to spend with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people I love.</v>

95
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time to hang out with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to have 15 extra minutes</v>

96
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:25.414
<v Speaker 1>to watch a video and then make my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>video and I don't have time for this </v>

97
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This life is short.</v>

98
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get that people are upset,</v>

99
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.323
<v Speaker 1>but the core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the core message that everybody's </v>

100
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 1>getting out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one of two messages.</v>

101
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:39.694
<v Speaker 1>One message is you should never eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals at all and then we should live </v>

102
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:43.384
<v Speaker 1>this idyllic existence where everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives off nuts and twigs and shit and </v>

103
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:50.610
<v Speaker 1>vegetables and that's all you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pine cones.</v>

104
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

105
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 1>You can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the other that use port</v>

106
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.613
<v Speaker 1>and I support that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best way to live in this modern </v>

107
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:03.250
<v Speaker 1>world is to go out and get your own meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with that.</v>

108
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a real problem.</v>

109
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Everybody can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough wildlife,</v>

110
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough time and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think that we,</v>

111
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.290
<v Speaker 1>we think everybody should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

112
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.173
<v Speaker 1>that our point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think people like us is you don't </v>

113
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>have to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't condemn it.</v>

114
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't condemn it because we,</v>

115
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean as you said in my intro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservationist hunters are conservation</v>

116
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:27.414
<v Speaker 1>is we're the one that's paying the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>for habitat for all these biologists to </v>

117
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>tell us exactly how many animals are out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

118
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:34.384
<v Speaker 1>They got boots on the ground and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there with the animals doing the </v>

119
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:41.200
<v Speaker 1>number of surveys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm figuring out harvest harvest numbers</v>

120
00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:42.034
<v Speaker 1>to try to achieve carrying capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guys online who think that grizzly </v>

121
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:49.600
<v Speaker 1>bears are almost extinct and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you kill a bear?</v>

122
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:50.434
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to kill me because I killed a </v>

123
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:52.084
<v Speaker 1>bear in Alaska that they probably have </v>
<v Speaker 1>no clue how many bear running around </v>

124
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow</v>

125
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 2>they know that I shouldn't have killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

126
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.833
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how many are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what the bear with the </v>

127
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 2>bear population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I killed two brown bear,</v>

128
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 2>which are grizzly bear and a black bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know that those bears need to</v>

129
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:11.534
<v Speaker 2>be controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they decimate the Moose </v>

130
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.560
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

131
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 2>it's all about Moose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

132
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 2>And part of that balance is humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people always say,</v>

133
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals will take care of themselves.</v>

134
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've always,</v>

135
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 2>they've always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 2>it's worked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>predators kill Blah Blah,</v>

137
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just interfering.</v>

138
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.171
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

139
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 2>we're interfering also because of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>

140
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're taking habitat so we can't let the</v>

141
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 2>animals sorted out because we're the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones encroaching on habitat.</v>

142
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 2>So we are in that process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are at the top of the food chain.</v>

143
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.960
<v Speaker 2>We require habitat to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They require habitat.</v>

144
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 2>So there's a balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all part of the equation.</v>

145
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 2>It</v>

146
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this balance is,</v>

147
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.733
<v Speaker 3>there's some parts of it that are set in</v>
<v Speaker 3>place before you and I were born and </v>

148
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:54.914
<v Speaker 3>before a lot of these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguing everybody before everybody was </v>

149
00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:58.034
<v Speaker 3>arguing about this has been born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cities were already in place long </v>

150
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 3>time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

151
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 3>the food chain has already been in </v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

152
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:04.514
<v Speaker 3>the market chain has been in place as </v>
<v Speaker 3>far as like getting food to </v>

153
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:07.634
<v Speaker 3>supermarkets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the supermarkets that are in </v>

154
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 3>existence were there long before you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started shopping at them and that's,</v>

155
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 3>that's a part of this equation of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>

156
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.583
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another part of the equation of human </v>

157
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:19.400
<v Speaker 3>beings is what you're talking about with</v>
<v Speaker 3>predators.</v>

158
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.353
<v Speaker 3>And this is one of the things that I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>a discussion about what the guys who I </v>

159
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 3>really like and there's some </v>
<v Speaker 3>misconception I didn't like these guys,</v>

160
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.540
<v Speaker 3>the guys that made that movie cowspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh right.</v>

161
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 3>They're very good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very smart guys.</v>

162
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

163
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.163
<v Speaker 3>they're vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They became vegans while factory </v>

164
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 3>farming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

165
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:37.184
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot about factory farming and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of it is about the amount of waste </v>

166
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 3>methane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

167
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:45.350
<v Speaker 3>that gets into the atmosphere because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>factory farming.</v>

168
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

169
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.980
<v Speaker 3>the actual waste as far as their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their shit,</v>

170
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.220
<v Speaker 3>the cows shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what would the amount of devastation</v>

171
00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:53.054
<v Speaker 3>that does to our environment and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>much actual land these animals need to </v>

172
00:07:57.171 --> 00:08:02.171
<v Speaker 3>graze in order to feed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are really complicated numbers and</v>

173
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.343
<v Speaker 3>disputed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went with the extreme on one end </v>

174
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 3>and there's some other people I'm having</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow.</v>

175
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during my friend from Minnesota,</v>

176
00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin.</v>

177
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my buddy from,</v>

178
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's uh,</v>

179
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:22.450
<v Speaker 3>from the Steve Show mediator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has that a large a ranch out in,</v>

180
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:24.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

181
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.213
<v Speaker 3>what the name of this you hunted out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and I'm trying to figure the name </v>

182
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:28.510
<v Speaker 3>of the town is.</v>

183
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.800
<v Speaker 3>He's a very weird small town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

184
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.480
<v Speaker 3>he's in Wisconsin and this really cool </v>
<v Speaker 3>area where it's the,</v>

185
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

186
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:39.260
<v Speaker 3>they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called the driftless area where the</v>

187
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.123
<v Speaker 3>glaciers missed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's all hilly and gorgeous and </v>

188
00:08:42.531 --> 00:08:43.364
<v Speaker 3>beautiful and that's where he lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pays his cows out there and he's </v>

189
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:46.604
<v Speaker 3>going to come in and give his </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective on a lot of this stuff is </v>

190
00:08:48.251 --> 00:08:49.330
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

191
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.233
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had this really strange idea about </v>

192
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 3>wolves and the strength that I had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct them.</v>

193
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.020
<v Speaker 3>And this idea about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

194
00:08:58.021 --> 00:08:58.854
<v Speaker 3>that we've hunted the wolves to near </v>
<v Speaker 3>extinction and now the reintroduction p </v>

195
00:09:01.721 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 3>and won't haunt them again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you really have to stop that.</v>

196
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

197
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:06.683
<v Speaker 3>you gotta this is wolves are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool and this is one of the things that </v>

198
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 3>I said these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody wants to eliminate wolves,</v>

199
00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:16.650
<v Speaker 3>but throughout human history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long before we were around,</v>

200
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 3>people have had a problem with wolves </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a reason for that.</v>

201
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 3>All the big bad wolf stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the Little Red Riding Hood,</v>

202
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:24.894
<v Speaker 3>all that Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because wolves are fucking </v>

203
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:27.810
<v Speaker 3>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are very,</v>

204
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:28.644
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous and I brought up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole world war one incident with the </v>

205
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:32.034
<v Speaker 3>Germans and the Russians had a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>cease fire because so many of them were </v>

206
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 3>getting killed by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made an agreement.</v>

207
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.693
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

208
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.190
<v Speaker 3>obviously we got a real problem that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger than us,</v>

209
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:42.024
<v Speaker 3>like 10 people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's stop killing each other for a </v>

210
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:46.860
<v Speaker 3>little while and Kelly's fucking wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they killed the wolves and then went</v>

211
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:48.750
<v Speaker 3>back to killing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy story.</v>

212
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:49.584
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the other story from </v>

213
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:55.371
<v Speaker 3>the 14 hundreds in Paris were wolves </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed more than 40 people in Paris.</v>

214
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.670
<v Speaker 3>The city of Paris was overrun with </v>
<v Speaker 3>bulbs.</v>

215
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wolves are killing machines and you have</v>

216
00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 3>to keep their populations down and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

217
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.290
<v Speaker 3>you run into huge problems.</v>

218
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.693
<v Speaker 3>People bring up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this video that people bring up </v>

219
00:10:10.201 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How wolves changed rivers.</v>

220
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a fascinating video.</v>

221
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:15.504
<v Speaker 3>We played it on here before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that video is the guy </v>

222
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:22.350
<v Speaker 3>who made that video is fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

223
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.213
<v Speaker 3>And he is a romantic to the extreme and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of introducing keystone </v>

224
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:30.300
<v Speaker 3>predators into these areas where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't been before.</v>

225
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.583
<v Speaker 3>His idea was that wolves are making </v>
<v Speaker 3>things better for all these other </v>

226
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 3>animals by getting rid of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not.</v>

227
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:37.254
<v Speaker 3>They're decimating the elk population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was a thing written by </v>

228
00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 3>scientists disputing all of his claims </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were in that video.</v>

229
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 3>So then I want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's this guy's deal about?</v>

230
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.550
<v Speaker 3>So I listened to this NPR podcast on </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

231
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.600
<v Speaker 3>This mother fucker wants to bring lions </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to Europe.</v>

232
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:55.591
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

233
00:10:55.591 --> 00:10:56.424
<v Speaker 3>there's parts of the UK that are empty </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we could reintroduce lions and </v>

234
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:01.640
<v Speaker 3>hyenas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but pitcher,</v>

235
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.000
<v Speaker 3>Yada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yada,</v>

236
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.250
<v Speaker 3>Yada.</v>

237
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.910
<v Speaker 3>A good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm to bring you case not that big.</v>

238
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.113
<v Speaker 3>You're going to bring violence like </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual African lions and his ideas that </v>

239
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:10.854
<v Speaker 3>they found these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these fossils of these lions that </v>

240
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:16.020
<v Speaker 3>existed there thousands of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then it'd be back.</v>

241
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.650
<v Speaker 3>He wants to reintroduce them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

242
00:11:17.651 --> 00:11:18.900
<v Speaker 3>people have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

243
00:11:18.901 --> 00:11:19.734
<v Speaker 3>this guy was suicidal and depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to the extreme ready to kill </v>

244
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:28.080
<v Speaker 3>himself and then decided to what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>calls rewilding.</v>

245
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.183
<v Speaker 3>He reintroduced himself to the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started experiencing while and fell in </v>

246
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:35.730
<v Speaker 3>love with wildlife and nature and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>what pulled him up out of this.</v>

247
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:37.910
<v Speaker 3>And now it's his mission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

248
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm in love with wildlife and nature to </v>
<v Speaker 3>mystically,</v>

249
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.830
<v Speaker 3>but realistically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

250
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.350
<v Speaker 3>Well it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do want to say one thing because we've</v>

251
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:48.720
<v Speaker 3>talked about factory farming and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

252
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.470
<v Speaker 3>the downside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not lumping ranchers,</v>

253
00:11:52.471 --> 00:11:53.770
<v Speaker 3>regular ranchers that</v>

254
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:54.761
<v Speaker 2>raise cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

255
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 2>my family is a cattle ranching family in</v>
<v Speaker 2>eastern Oregon,</v>

256
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

257
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 2>cows that are out with enough pasture </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there and then,</v>

258
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.640
<v Speaker 2>and then being killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken mark and kill.</v>

259
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Animals that don't leave the cage,</v>

260
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:10.384
<v Speaker 2>that are standing in their own feces and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just never move and never have a life </v>

261
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 2>and then have a bullet shot through </v>
<v Speaker 2>their head in their debt.</v>

262
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking the,</v>

263
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Speaker 2>that extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not everybody.</v>

264
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:22.920
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of respect for farmers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ranchers and uh,</v>

265
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:23.783
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we don't want to lump everybody into </v>

266
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.260
<v Speaker 2>the ranches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are All factory farmers?</v>

267
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.290
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're certainly not.</v>

268
00:12:28.291 --> 00:12:29.124
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that I noticed </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in Montana when I first went </v>

269
00:12:32.521 --> 00:12:33.354
<v Speaker 3>hunting with Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went through the Missouri breaks and </v>

270
00:12:36.151 --> 00:12:38.550
<v Speaker 3>there was all these cows wandering </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and I was like,</v>

271
00:12:38.551 --> 00:12:39.750
<v Speaker 3>what is the deal with this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

272
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.470
<v Speaker 3>those cows literally wander free on </v>
<v Speaker 3>public land they have.</v>

273
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:47.880
<v Speaker 3>And this is what this Oregon nutty shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>is about.</v>

274
00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:48.714
<v Speaker 3>And within Nevada nutty shit was about </v>
<v Speaker 3>with all these crazy ranchers that want </v>

275
00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:53.700
<v Speaker 3>to fucking take over the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lincoln.</v>

276
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>

277
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they call it?</v>

278
00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.080
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my favorite by far.</v>

279
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.220
<v Speaker 3>We don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We never found out who came up with that</v>

280
00:13:02.221 --> 00:13:03.870
<v Speaker 3>description.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone was claiming that someone on the</v>

281
00:13:03.871 --> 00:13:08.340
<v Speaker 3>podcast came up with that description,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when we were in Montana,</v>

282
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.433
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when I first got introduced to </v>

283
00:13:10.171 --> 00:13:10.940
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

284
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:11.370
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

285
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.340
<v Speaker 3>These animals are literally roam free </v>
<v Speaker 3>and wild.</v>

286
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.650
<v Speaker 3>They sleep outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat outside,</v>

287
00:13:16.651 --> 00:13:17.484
<v Speaker 3>they wander through and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>corralled and when they're brought to </v>

288
00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:24.720
<v Speaker 3>slaughter then their corralled and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the majority of their life they live</v>

289
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.270
<v Speaker 3>off the land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost like an elk.</v>

290
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a wild animal essentially.</v>

291
00:13:28.991 --> 00:13:30.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Step there.</v>

292
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.950
<v Speaker 3>Someone's someone's property.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people have a hard time with that.</v>

293
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.480
<v Speaker 3>They have a hard time with the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>property,</v>

294
00:13:36.481 --> 00:13:38.670
<v Speaker 3>of an animal being property and I get </v>
<v Speaker 3>that too,</v>

295
00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:39.504
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another thing I've watched recently was </v>

296
00:13:40.621 --> 00:13:44.280
<v Speaker 3>this penn and teller from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever see that show bullshit?</v>

297
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great show.</v>

298
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 3>'Em that they used to do on showtime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of them they did was on pita and</v>

299
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.403
<v Speaker 3>the Animal Liberation Organization or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck are heard of that </v>

300
00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:01.210
<v Speaker 3>foundation for free except Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>violent arsonists burning down buildings</v>

301
00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:04.500
<v Speaker 3>was spray painting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegan power and these.</v>

302
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:05.363
<v Speaker 3>I mean just like the nutty as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't think that people should </v>

303
00:14:08.221 --> 00:14:10.350
<v Speaker 3>have pets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't think,</v>

304
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.820
<v Speaker 3>and here's one of the best parts about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

305
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.013
<v Speaker 3>One of the women that was in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>program who works for Peta was also a </v>

306
00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:17.844
<v Speaker 3>diabetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is where you got a buckle yourself </v>

307
00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:22.890
<v Speaker 3>in because there's only one way you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>that diabetes medicine.</v>

308
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.310
<v Speaker 3>It's from animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's an animal product,</v>

309
00:14:26.311 --> 00:14:27.144
<v Speaker 3>and so she was saying that she didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that she was a hypocrite because </v>

310
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.690
<v Speaker 3>that product saves her life so she could</v>
<v Speaker 3>save more animals.</v>

311
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:34.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>

312
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Fuck face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what hunting is.</v>

313
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.700
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sort of hunting is exactly.</v>

314
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:39.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go out,</v>

315
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.180
<v Speaker 3>you hunt a wolf and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not into hunting wolves,</v>

316
00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.380
<v Speaker 3>but if they have to control their </v>
<v Speaker 3>population like that,</v>

317
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:45.151
<v Speaker 3>not in a hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

318
00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:47.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't meet somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody is got to kill them.</v>

319
00:14:47.011 --> 00:14:50.240
<v Speaker 3>Somebody's got to do it and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it by the way there.</v>

320
00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 3>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's another thing about</v>

321
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.903
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California mountain lions are a giant </v>

322
00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:56.264
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an article that I posted up </v>

323
00:14:57.141 --> 00:14:58.400
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull it up,</v>

324
00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone.</v>

325
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.433
<v Speaker 1>Someone sent me yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did this like you cannot hunt </v>

326
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:07.410
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason for it is not here.</v>

327
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.263
<v Speaker 1>It's not logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all based on people who are animal </v>

328
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:14.090
<v Speaker 1>lovers who got into a position of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>or voted this in.</v>

329
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the study they're finding </v>

330
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:17.384
<v Speaker 1>because they killed these mountain lions</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they start moving into </v>

331
00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:21.780
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods and killing pets and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>super common.</v>

332
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.633
<v Speaker 1>They've killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the number of mountain lions </v>

333
00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:26.180
<v Speaker 1>they've killed this year because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

334
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:27.014
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here with a 170 107 mountain lions were </v>

335
00:15:29.781 --> 00:15:32.360
<v Speaker 1>killed last year legally by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

336
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.630
<v Speaker 1>so that's 107 mountain lions and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get tagged for,</v>

337
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.900
<v Speaker 1>which means that's money that didn't go </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the state coffers.</v>

338
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Then it didn't go to conservation.</v>

339
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

340
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.970
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opposite state is paying.</v>

341
00:15:43.971 --> 00:15:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.810
<v Speaker 1>State is paying for going into the hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going in the hole.</v>

343
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.793
<v Speaker 1>Instead of going into the profit margin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would they normally did in the </v>

344
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.300
<v Speaker 1>black and red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm colorblind matter.</v>

345
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 1>So they analyze these mountain lions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found it.</v>

346
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Mostly what they're eating is pets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're.</v>

347
00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 1>They're eating fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only five percent had eaten deer.</v>

348
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.681
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

349
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:08.330
<v Speaker 1>they're going to go with the easiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>

350
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that seems sane.</v>

351
00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Only five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Granted,</v>

352
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.300
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

353
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.170
<v Speaker 1>They're killing their already problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

354
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in what happens with lions are so </v>

355
00:16:17.691 --> 00:16:18.524
<v Speaker 1>territorial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the younger lions come up and the </v>

356
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.213
<v Speaker 1>more dominant lions have their area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the younger ones are forced to go </v>

357
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.370
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't really cross.</v>

358
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.383
<v Speaker 1>So they go somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's left is cities and neighborhoods </v>

359
00:16:32.061 --> 00:16:34.160
<v Speaker 1>and residential and that's where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pets are.</v>

360
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:34.993
<v Speaker 1>So I mean those are probably juvenile </v>
<v Speaker 1>lions mostly and down in there and it's </v>

361
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:43.580
<v Speaker 1>just a matter of time before a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid gets snatched or whatever and people</v>

362
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.830
<v Speaker 1>don't want to talk about that or think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

363
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.620
<v Speaker 1>But that's the reality of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just predators.</v>

364
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:49.454
<v Speaker 1>They're killers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going for the easiest target </v>

365
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.090
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a dogs and cats,</v>

366
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.480
<v Speaker 1>but they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't care.</v>

367
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.333
<v Speaker 1>They're not hugging each other and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crying like we've seen billboards of </v>

368
00:16:58.221 --> 00:16:59.054
<v Speaker 1>that either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get into that in a </v>

369
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:00.674
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think this is what I'm trying to </v>

370
00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:04.110
<v Speaker 1>get at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

371
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:08.960
<v Speaker 1>this is where I think there's a dispute </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a misconception in the misconception</v>

372
00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:09.794
<v Speaker 1>is that hunters are all these evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that want to hunt these animals </v>

373
00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:14.450
<v Speaker 1>to kill them so they can put them on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their wall.</v>

374
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.283
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of the money that goes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish and game fish and wildlife </v>

375
00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 1>management organizations that protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>wetlands,</v>

376
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.870
<v Speaker 1>that protect public lands for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for camping and for,</v>

377
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.733
<v Speaker 1>for people to use and people to enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go hike the money to support those </v>

378
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.850
<v Speaker 1>comes from hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

379
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.430
<v Speaker 1>People hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hate it.</v>

380
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.190
<v Speaker 1>But by far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by far,</v>

381
00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.113
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money that comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservation comes from hunting by far </v>

382
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.110
<v Speaker 1>for the amount of money goes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservation,</v>

383
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.680
<v Speaker 1>for the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the animals,</v>

384
00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:50.250
<v Speaker 1>for habitat</v>

385
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.460
<v Speaker 2>restoration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

386
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 2>that show we were just at in Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

387
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 2>they had a mule deer tag that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>auctioned off.</v>

388
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.860
<v Speaker 2>They give for an antelope island tagged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give two tags.</v>

389
00:17:58.861 --> 00:18:02.010
<v Speaker 2>One is in the drawing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have very small chance of getting</v>

390
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 2>it because there's huge bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas antelope island,</v>

391
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Utah,</v>

392
00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure exactly where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't an actual island.</v>

393
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:10.883
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's just a place they </v>

394
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:14.130
<v Speaker 2>call antelope island or if it's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual island.</v>

395
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Jamiel find out he is a state park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

396
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.090
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was a park,</v>

397
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:19.830
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know if it's an actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>island or not.</v>

398
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

399
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.450
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one is a drawing.</v>

400
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:25.560
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

401
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.080
<v Speaker 2>is that the Great Salt Lake there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

402
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:28.914
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that as set out into the great </v>

403
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:32.424
<v Speaker 2>salt lake and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a detached island or doesn't </v>

404
00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:36.240
<v Speaker 2>look like it was just a long peninsula.</v>

405
00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.093
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a peninsula they call antelope </v>

406
00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:39.294
<v Speaker 2>island and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's huge bucks and I think they're </v>

407
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:42.060
<v Speaker 2>sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're also.</v>

408
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:44.850
<v Speaker 2>But the bucks are what draw the draw the</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

409
00:18:44.851 --> 00:18:45.684
<v Speaker 2>So they auctioned one off and it went </v>
<v Speaker 2>for $410,000 for one deer tag and that </v>

410
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.633
<v Speaker 2>most of that money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 percent 10 percent goes to a to </v>

411
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 2>funding the auction and doing all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that's required there.</v>

412
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.143
<v Speaker 2>Ninety percent of that 400,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$10,000 goes right to habitat </v>

413
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:08.001
<v Speaker 2>restoration on the island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm building a water water sources,</v>

414
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.503
<v Speaker 2>enhancing those re relocating animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>off that peninsula there because the </v>

415
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:14.724
<v Speaker 2>genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our genetics are so good to and the </v>

416
00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:16.974
<v Speaker 2>bucks are big and the sheep are big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're really relocate those </v>

417
00:19:20.641 --> 00:19:21.474
<v Speaker 2>superior genetics throughout Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you might not draw that tag or </v>

418
00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:28.560
<v Speaker 2>you might not have $410,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those genetics are spread throughout</v>

419
00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're spread in areas where general</v>

420
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.560
<v Speaker 2>hunters have the access to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

421
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.100
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all positive.</v>

422
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.250
<v Speaker 2>It's all positive for the state park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

423
00:19:38.251 --> 00:19:40.080
<v Speaker 2>anti hunters will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

424
00:19:40.081 --> 00:19:42.360
<v Speaker 2>if you really cared about the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

425
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do the 400,</v>

426
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:46.080
<v Speaker 2>$10,000 and not go hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

427
00:19:46.081 --> 00:19:48.960
<v Speaker 2>it is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it an anti hunter do that?</v>

428
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>

429
00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.540
<v Speaker 3>here's a part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

430
00:19:52.541 --> 00:19:55.180
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of problems with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all these discussions.</v>

431
00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:00.240
<v Speaker 3>And a big part of it is that the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are arguing against the hunting,</v>

432
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.250
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

433
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:05.140
<v Speaker 3>they don't regularly go into the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into these habitats,</v>

434
00:20:05.141 --> 00:20:09.250
<v Speaker 3>in these environments and see how </v>
<v Speaker 3>brutally hard they are for these animals</v>

435
00:20:09.251 --> 00:20:10.084
<v Speaker 3>to survive anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like if you kill a buck that </v>

436
00:20:13.061 --> 00:20:13.894
<v Speaker 3>buck live to be five years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be taking a year off it's </v>

437
00:20:18.011 --> 00:20:18.920
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

438
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.093
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

439
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.740
<v Speaker 3>there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no 100 year old deer out there.</v>

440
00:20:23.741 --> 00:20:26.050
<v Speaker 3>That was the long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long great life.</v>

441
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.943
<v Speaker 3>And this is the idea of one of the parts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of hunting that actually aids in </v>

442
00:20:30.431 --> 00:20:34.930
<v Speaker 3>conservation is when you get a mature </v>
<v Speaker 3>buck and you harvest that mature buck,</v>

443
00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:36.123
<v Speaker 3>you are allowing the younger deer to </v>
<v Speaker 3>breed where they might not have gotten </v>

444
00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:41.560
<v Speaker 3>the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're also in a lot of cases,</v>

445
00:20:41.561 --> 00:20:45.820
<v Speaker 3>saving their lives because they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed and fights with older deer,</v>

446
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of die</v>

447
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.440
<v Speaker 1>from fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People find them all the time.</v>

448
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:51.483
<v Speaker 1>They literally stab each other to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have those antlers to look </v>

449
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:54.844
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

450
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.160
<v Speaker 1>they don't have those therapists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They slam into each other.</v>

451
00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:58.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same with elk.</v>

452
00:20:58.570 --> 00:20:59.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same with elk.</v>

453
00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you and I were in Colorado </v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of the coolest fucking things we</v>

454
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:03.904
<v Speaker 1>saw is when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when we went down in near that </v>

455
00:21:05.591 --> 00:21:06.424
<v Speaker 1>little creek area when there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like a huge herd of 20 elk </v>

456
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:12.580
<v Speaker 1>together and those elk were duking it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and slamming into each other.</v>

457
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds amazing.</v>

458
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.033
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another thing that I don't think </v>

459
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.700
<v Speaker 1>antennas realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

460
00:21:18.701 --> 00:21:22.840
<v Speaker 1>you go out for an extended period and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the killing,</v>

461
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.330
<v Speaker 1>the actual killing is such a small part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the hunt,</v>

462
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.460
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's those experiences.</v>

463
00:21:27.461 --> 00:21:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Like when we saw those bulls fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we saw,</v>

464
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:30.723
<v Speaker 1>I think there were seven bowls and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one nice bowl at 3:50 class </v>

465
00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:34.030
<v Speaker 1>bowl.</v>

466
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:34.863
<v Speaker 1>He was a herd bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their satellite bowls spread </v>

467
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:38.230
<v Speaker 1>throughout on the APP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

468
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.830
<v Speaker 1>he kept him pushed out and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>jostling around and we were there.</v>

469
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.960
<v Speaker 1>We didn't kill anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the experience of that night was one</v>

470
00:21:46.961 --> 00:21:47.794
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a bull sneak in behind us to 15 </v>

471
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:51.214
<v Speaker 1>yards and a nice bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bowl that would have been a great </v>

472
00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:55.990
<v Speaker 1>bullet for you to kill and it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

473
00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:58.960
<v Speaker 1>but it was just like the adrenaline of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that experience.</v>

474
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was right there behind the bush.</v>

475
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

476
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.340
<v Speaker 1>So close screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nothing died.</v>

477
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.260
<v Speaker 1>No it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we are predators.</v>

478
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.620
<v Speaker 1>We were predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were prey and that's,</v>

479
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.170
<v Speaker 1>that's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's life in the mountains,</v>

480
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works.</v>

481
00:22:15.641 --> 00:22:16.474
<v Speaker 1>Even if we didn't have a bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if we weren't there to kill </v>

482
00:22:18.611 --> 00:22:20.200
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we just had calls,</v>

483
00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:23.160
<v Speaker 1>so we were just calling them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been an amazing experience</v>

484
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:28.500
<v Speaker 1>because when you were there with </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially as wild and animal as you're</v>

485
00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:29.790
<v Speaker 1>ever going to get.</v>

486
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean North American elk is a 1000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pound,</v>

487
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:34.563
<v Speaker 1>gigantic wild animal with a tree growing</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of its head and it's living the way </v>

488
00:22:39.131 --> 00:22:41.860
<v Speaker 1>it's lived for thousands of years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:44.860
<v Speaker 1>you as a person who lives in Oregon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>me as a person who lives in California,</v>

490
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:48.970
<v Speaker 1>we travel into their land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We we hike in to where they're at and we</v>

491
00:22:48.971 --> 00:22:53.971
<v Speaker 1>experience this wild existence that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in and we don't want to stop that.</v>

492
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:57.220
<v Speaker 1>We're not trying to kill them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want more of them.</v>

493
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.520
<v Speaker 1>We the NS is the idea of killing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mature one.</v>

494
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:01.663
<v Speaker 1>Would you want to take out an animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>that does not have much time left and </v>

495
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.090
<v Speaker 1>you help the rest of the animals survive</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>

496
00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:10.993
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make it so that the younger bulls </v>

497
00:23:12.431 --> 00:23:15.900
<v Speaker 1>have a chance to thrive and breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they're pushing out.</v>

498
00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.090
<v Speaker 1>They're pushed out and they're not doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and,</v>

499
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.330
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will say one thing.</v>

500
00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:22.300
<v Speaker 1>So you said even if we wouldn't have had</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>

501
00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.870
<v Speaker 1>it was still had been been amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me it would have been different.</v>

502
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.913
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been different because if </v>

503
00:23:28.211 --> 00:23:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm just an observer internally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel a lot different.</v>

504
00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm a Predator when I have a</v>

505
00:23:35.621 --> 00:23:38.470
<v Speaker 1>weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know if I could,</v>

506
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.890
<v Speaker 1>if I would have worked as hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I would have cared as much if we were</v>

507
00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:44.770
<v Speaker 1>just observing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

508
00:23:44.771 --> 00:23:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Because if you remember that we snuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

509
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:49.640
<v Speaker 1>we're sneaking or I mean we're on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>butts,</v>

510
00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:53.570
<v Speaker 1>kind of scooting down in the two bowls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were jostling around right there,</v>

511
00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:54.404
<v Speaker 1>kind of sparring a little bit and we had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small window through the brush and I </v>

512
00:23:57.711 --> 00:23:59.000
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are right,</v>

513
00:23:59.001 --> 00:24:00.440
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As looking at Mike,</v>

514
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you see that window?</v>

515
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you see that window?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can get that Arrow through.</v>

516
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.030
<v Speaker 1>It was just that in the intensity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that moment.</v>

517
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:10.400
<v Speaker 1>So you're a predator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your pray.</v>

518
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.250
<v Speaker 1>How can you ethically kill it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's alert.</v>

519
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.010
<v Speaker 1>All the all it comes down to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why we're there.</v>

520
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.480
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's everything.</v>

521
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says that crunch time moment.</v>

522
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:20.563
<v Speaker 1>Well there's one of the most ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you see when I look at your </v>

523
00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:23.594
<v Speaker 1>instagram or even my instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I rarely post a picture of a data </v>

524
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:28.424
<v Speaker 1>animal just because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll post fish all day long and nobody </v>

525
00:24:30.591 --> 00:24:32.960
<v Speaker 1>gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gives a fuck about fish.</v>

526
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.970
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

527
00:24:34.971 --> 00:24:36.080
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy,</v>

528
00:24:36.081 --> 00:24:37.610
<v Speaker 1>we'll fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not alive.</v>

529
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here they are.</v>

530
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:40.700
<v Speaker 1>I believe they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

531
00:24:40.701 --> 00:24:41.534
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you post a picture of an elk or God </v>

532
00:24:43.161 --> 00:24:46.550
<v Speaker 1>forbid a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people lose their fucking minds.</v>

533
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that people love </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say is if it's an original thought,</v>

534
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.310
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things that did not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They usually say,</v>

535
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:53.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're such a big moon.</v>

536
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.080
<v Speaker 1>How about you do that without a weapon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that without what hunter has ever</v>

537
00:24:59.811 --> 00:25:04.160
<v Speaker 1>killed anything in the history of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what hunters are.</v>

538
00:25:04.161 --> 00:25:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me a hunter.</v>

539
00:25:05.961 --> 00:25:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Even a caveman that ever killed without </v>
<v Speaker 1>a weapon of some sort.</v>

540
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.220
<v Speaker 1>What are they talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not talking about anything.</v>

541
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 1>They're just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying to demean you.</v>

542
00:25:15.621 --> 00:25:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And I go to their fucking page and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>

543
00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy was feeding his animals meet.</v>

544
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.720
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit come from a meat tree.</v>

545
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.030
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy was shitting all over you.</v>

546
00:25:26.031 --> 00:25:28.100
<v Speaker 1>And then I go to his page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got dogs,</v>

547
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.000
<v Speaker 1>he's got dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's feeding them me.</v>

548
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

549
00:25:31.341 --> 00:25:34.070
<v Speaker 1>there's some fucking convenient thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on here.</v>

550
00:25:34.071 --> 00:25:34.904
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so strange how many people have </v>

551
00:25:36.531 --> 00:25:39.500
<v Speaker 1>these convenient patterns of thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're self righteous.</v>

552
00:25:39.501 --> 00:25:41.420
<v Speaker 1>They take the moral high ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not look,</v>

553
00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:42.254
<v Speaker 1>I the only person that has any say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only person that has a leg to stand </v>

554
00:25:45.951 --> 00:25:48.500
<v Speaker 1>on is a person who's a Vegan who doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat any,</v>

555
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.630
<v Speaker 1>any animal products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any animal products,</v>

556
00:25:50.631 --> 00:25:51.464
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a small percentage of the </v>

557
00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:52.994
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they want to criticize it there </v>

558
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.580
<v Speaker 1>and they have an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a very small leg to stand on.</v>

559
00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Holy ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have a conversation with them,</v>

560
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:03.110
<v Speaker 1>that's when that argument kind of falls </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

561
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.470
<v Speaker 1>It does because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

562
00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.990
<v Speaker 1>v,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're hardcore Vegan,</v>

563
00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:06.824
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are they growing their own </v>

564
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.330
<v Speaker 1>vegetables?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few because if they're not,</v>

565
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.760
<v Speaker 1>they still are responsible for animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>

566
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:14.893
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever driven by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever been into farmland and </v>

567
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:24.880
<v Speaker 1>say a field has been harvested once the </v>
<v Speaker 1>field is harvested,</v>

568
00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.770
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice buzzards flying around </v>
<v Speaker 1>that field.</v>

569
00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:28.603
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a bunch of dead animals </v>

570
00:26:30.081 --> 00:26:30.914
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's rabbits that were killed during </v>

571
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:33.440
<v Speaker 1>the harvest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's mice,</v>

572
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:38.460
<v Speaker 1>there's all so fonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it is a big problem with grouse,</v>

573
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.580
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those,</v>

574
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:41.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the combines or whatever they're using </v>

575
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 1>there is just tearing everything up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think animals are dying so you can,</v>

576
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:49.860
<v Speaker 1>unless you're growing your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

577
00:26:49.861 --> 00:26:54.090
<v Speaker 1>unless you're doing it yourself Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for animals dying.</v>

578
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.940
<v Speaker 1>If your house isn't made of wood because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's made of wood,</v>

579
00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:59.310
<v Speaker 1>there's timber harvest it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when that timber was harvested,</v>

580
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.020
<v Speaker 1>animals die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

581
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.800
<v Speaker 1>well they're also their habitats </v>
<v Speaker 1>displays.</v>

582
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:06.630
<v Speaker 1>So people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I think with their ideas,</v>

583
00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:08.780
<v Speaker 1>they want to do the least harm possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

584
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.810
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of them already came from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>background where they eat meat.</v>

585
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Like I had this one guy was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing with me wanting to argue with me</v>

586
00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.550
<v Speaker 1>and giving me all this grief.</v>

587
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.970
<v Speaker 1>And then he admits that he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediator just seven months ago.</v>

588
00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.470
<v Speaker 1>It's been a Vegan for seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking 40.</v>

589
00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.400
<v Speaker 1>So for 39 years and three months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker,</v>

590
00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.940
<v Speaker 1>five months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was is my math.</v>

591
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.870
<v Speaker 1>So this guy for all these were very </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick though.</v>

592
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Your math is very quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my point is Sarah dead hunter.</v>

593
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:41.041
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

594
00:27:41.041 --> 00:27:44.100
<v Speaker 1>You can't see that seven months ago you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were a fucking Vegan and you're shitting</v>

595
00:27:44.101 --> 00:27:44.934
<v Speaker 1>out are you were you were a mediator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're shitting all over these people </v>

596
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.100
<v Speaker 1>saying it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a moral high ground.</v>

597
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.980
<v Speaker 1>They elevate themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a bunch of the red.</v>

598
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.380
<v Speaker 1>They're above us because we're redneck </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters.</v>

599
00:27:55.381 --> 00:27:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

600
00:27:56.491 --> 00:27:57.324
<v Speaker 1>I had this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looked like he was maybe younger </v>

601
00:27:58.951 --> 00:28:00.390
<v Speaker 1>twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

602
00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:01.453
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a very passionate about his </v>
<v Speaker 1>stance on what's right and what's wrong </v>

603
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.620
<v Speaker 1>and so I went to his page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same as you.</v>

604
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I see a bunch of hot dogs on there and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

605
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.390
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy those hot dogs,</v>

606
00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:16.110
<v Speaker 1>but before you judge me or condemn me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you live a little,</v>

607
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.123
<v Speaker 1>you're 20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do you know about </v>

608
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:20.034
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden you know what's </v>

609
00:28:21.301 --> 00:28:22.860
<v Speaker 1>right and wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

610
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.993
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have an answer for this or </v>

611
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Karma or some crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

612
00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.660
<v Speaker 1>what do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't even lived yet?</v>

613
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.903
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

614
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:35.370
<v Speaker 1>hot dogs are probably the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is one of the worst.</v>

615
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is ground assholes and cow </v>
<v Speaker 1>digs.</v>

616
00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.213
<v Speaker 1>The probably one of the worst things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could fucking eat too filled with </v>

617
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:45.810
<v Speaker 1>nitrites and nitrates and whatever's bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

618
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.220
<v Speaker 1>I understand that they're trying to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out for themselves and working it out</v>

619
00:28:50.221 --> 00:28:51.054
<v Speaker 1>for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times people want to condemn </v>

620
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:54.480
<v Speaker 1>people that are living a lifestyle </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's outside of their.</v>

621
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.070
<v Speaker 1>They decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

622
00:28:56.071 --> 00:28:56.904
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to live this small carbon </v>
<v Speaker 1>footprint lifestyle where I'm going to </v>

623
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:02.730
<v Speaker 1>be humane and ethical and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be cruelty free,</v>

624
00:29:02.731 --> 00:29:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag cruelty free and I'm going to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

625
00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:05.863
<v Speaker 1>That's like Hashtag cruelty free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they want to tell you half of </v>

626
00:29:09.121 --> 00:29:12.390
<v Speaker 1>them have fucking Vegan and their names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious of Vegan.</v>

627
00:29:12.391 --> 00:29:13.680
<v Speaker 1>This Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that healthy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>everyone's.</v>

629
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.570
<v Speaker 1>But it's a part of their name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

630
00:29:20.571 --> 00:29:23.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a big part of their identity and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes,</v>

631
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.250
<v Speaker 1>it becomes like a cult and I don't mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>it like,</v>

632
00:29:26.251 --> 00:29:27.084
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to fucking initiation and pay </v>

633
00:29:27.971 --> 00:29:28.804
<v Speaker 1>dues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's like you're a part of a </v>

634
00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:32.460
<v Speaker 1>gang and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have a tendency to do that.</v>

635
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a tendency.</v>

636
00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Hunters have a tendency to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will fucking use windows,</v>

637
00:29:37.081 --> 00:29:39.380
<v Speaker 1>have a tendency to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like apple.</v>

638
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 1>One fucking windows and apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a piece of shit.</v>

639
00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:43.603
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But hunters don't have the hate that </v>

640
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:47.230
<v Speaker 1>these anti hunting vegans have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

641
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.041
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

642
00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:53.041
<v Speaker 1>hunters don't go to their pages and who </v>
<v Speaker 1>cares?</v>

643
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Live your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They think they're doing the right </v>

645
00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:02.170
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the right thing and there's a lot.</v>

646
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:03.183
<v Speaker 1>This is not another thing I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>point out and I went on this twitter </v>

647
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.110
<v Speaker 1>page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a discussion the other day.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't hate vegans have vegans that are</v>

649
00:30:11.411 --> 00:30:12.530

650
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not lumping everybody in.</v>

651
00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:16.123
<v Speaker 1>You know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a small percentage of people </v>

652
00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:22.441
<v Speaker 1>that are assholes that are arrogant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>outspoken and really aggressive and mean</v>

653
00:30:23.081 --> 00:30:25.180
<v Speaker 1>and shitting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where's the cruelty free.</v>

654
00:30:25.181 --> 00:30:26.014
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you being cruel to other people </v>

655
00:30:27.641 --> 00:30:29.830

<v Speaker 1>look around with tolerance.</v>

656
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Go outside and drive for 20 minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you you're going to pass 30,</v>

657
00:30:34.961 --> 00:30:36.910
<v Speaker 1>40 places that have dead animals in </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

658
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Every fucking supermarket you pass by </v>
<v Speaker 1>every fast food place,</v>

659
00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:43.810
<v Speaker 1>every restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every gas station that's slim.</v>

660
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Jim's at the fucking counter or all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is animal.</v>

661
00:30:46.701 --> 00:30:48.100
<v Speaker 1>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For you to find a hunter,</v>

662
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.083
<v Speaker 1>the one person that you could point to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that probably kills animals in the most </v>

663
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:57.840
<v Speaker 1>ethical and humane way possible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute and pastries to be,</v>

664
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.080
<v Speaker 1>to play part of the conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rolling.</v>

665
00:31:00.081 --> 00:31:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

666
00:31:00.941 --> 00:31:02.580
<v Speaker 1>and people hear these podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

667
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.600
<v Speaker 1>you fucking go to justify what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

668
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:06.550
<v Speaker 1>If you have to justify it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong.</v>

669
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the arguments or tiresome.</v>

670
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy that's coming on next </v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

671
00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:11.830
<v Speaker 1>his name is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Tovar.</v>

673
00:31:13.061 --> 00:31:15.480
<v Speaker 1>How do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So really to Varsa ruling there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that sounds so really,</v>

675
00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.680
<v Speaker 1>he's an author and a guy that used to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Vegan who's not a hunter.</v>

676
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And panties will be bunched.</v>

677
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.770
<v Speaker 1>They will get sandy and tweets will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted.</v>

678
00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna get crazy,</v>

679
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.253
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that podcast like this and </v>

680
00:31:32.051 --> 00:31:35.380
<v Speaker 1>conversations like this with a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

681
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:37.360
<v Speaker 1>like I think what you do is the best way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

682
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said this time and time again,</v>

683
00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.770
<v Speaker 1>what you do is the best way to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what you're doing,</v>

684
00:31:41.771 --> 00:31:43.660
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the most difficult way to do it and</v>

685
00:31:43.661 --> 00:31:46.590
<v Speaker 1>you prepare your body for it in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking grueling fashion.</v>

686
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:47.463
<v Speaker 1>We worked out before we got here and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out every day and one of the </v>

687
00:31:50.111 --> 00:31:52.870
<v Speaker 1>reasons why you work out every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking going through the mountains</v>

688
00:31:52.871 --> 00:31:53.950
<v Speaker 1>is hard as shit.</v>

689
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:55.150
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is hard,</v>

690
00:31:55.151 --> 00:31:55.984
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never knew until I went with Rinella </v>

691
00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:00.520
<v Speaker 1>the first time we went up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Missouri breaks.</v>

692
00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:02.230
<v Speaker 1>We're climbing the mountains for seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a day.</v>

693
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

694
00:32:03.431 --> 00:32:05.110
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking.</v>

695
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.230
<v Speaker 1>This is not going to the gym and getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the elliptical machine.</v>

696
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.680
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking constant and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and if you're packing shit,</v>

697
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:14.130
<v Speaker 1>you have to be strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be physically strong to do.</v>

698
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:14.973
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember in Colorado and we were </v>

699
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:17.363
<v Speaker 1>roughing it up that Ridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know we're at the bottom of the </v>

700
00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:19.504
<v Speaker 1>canyon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heard a bull bugling is the bull you </v>

701
00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:22.150
<v Speaker 1>killed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

702
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:23.950
<v Speaker 1>This dude takes off like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain goat.</v>

703
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm in pretty God damn good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like.</v>

704
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.450
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even breathe in as fuck.</v>

705
00:32:31.451 --> 00:32:32.284
<v Speaker 1>He gets to the top of the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you saw the bowl is at the </v>

706
00:32:34.301 --> 00:32:35.134
<v Speaker 1>top of the mountain that you spotted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but know that that the sun was going </v>

707
00:32:37.331 --> 00:32:38.740
<v Speaker 1>down and we had a lot of elements going.</v>

708
00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:39.573
<v Speaker 1>I can tell the bull wasn't as good bull </v>
<v Speaker 1>just by his bugle and we'd been huffing </v>

709
00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:45.620
<v Speaker 1>it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're done trying to get on a bowl.</v>

710
00:32:45.621 --> 00:32:47.480
<v Speaker 1>That was beautiful and we never could </v>
<v Speaker 1>get eyes on him.</v>

711
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:48.583
<v Speaker 1>But then I heard what sounded like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mature bull and the sun going down and </v>

712
00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:54.140
<v Speaker 1>that's why you train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

713
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.120
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exact situation.</v>

714
00:32:56.121 --> 00:32:58.010
<v Speaker 1>You're coming out of a hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're climbing,</v>

715
00:32:58.390 --> 00:32:59.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>9,000 feet.</v>

716
00:32:59.751 --> 00:33:03.080
<v Speaker 1>The air is thin there and it's a race </v>
<v Speaker 1>against time essentially.</v>

717
00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we made it work.</v>

718
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

719
00:33:05.511 --> 00:33:06.344
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are able to close the distance in a </v>

720
00:33:08.481 --> 00:33:10.820
<v Speaker 1>much more efficient way because of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your training.</v>

721
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.770
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a good example of.</v>

722
00:33:12.771 --> 00:33:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Another good example of it was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>packout.</v>

723
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're packing a lot of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

724
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

725
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 1>This asshole has to fucking elk quarters</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his backpack.</v>

726
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:25.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's like 180 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how much is that heavy?</v>

727
00:33:25.491 --> 00:33:26.740
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heavy Shit.</v>

728
00:33:26.741 --> 00:33:30.290
<v Speaker 1>And you basically have me on your back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're walking a mile with this,</v>

729
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's one,</v>

730
00:33:32.061 --> 00:33:33.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why have I,</v>

731
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.133
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I have some photos of us from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from this very trip that we're talking </v>

732
00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:38.810
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're packing these things out.</v>

733
00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:39.644
<v Speaker 1>But the point is what you're doing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquire when you have an elk steak and </v>

734
00:33:43.491 --> 00:33:44.324
<v Speaker 1>you sit down with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had this conversation with Remy </v>

735
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Warren about it where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a religious experience.</v>

736
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.510
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a precious piece of meat.</v>

737
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:51.643
<v Speaker 1>I've gone into the Wilderness vested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've harvested this animal and I have a </v>

738
00:33:54.861 --> 00:33:57.230
<v Speaker 1>precious piece of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes and I treat it almost like a</v>

739
00:33:57.231 --> 00:33:58.064
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I sees in this and I cook it </v>

740
00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:01.700
<v Speaker 1>perfectly and this is.</v>

741
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:06.170
<v Speaker 1>He has this intensely intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection and I do with the animal that</v>

742
00:34:06.171 --> 00:34:09.470
<v Speaker 1>we killed that animal that you and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed when I eat that thing.</v>

743
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:13.580
<v Speaker 1>I think of our time together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of how difficult the hunt is.</v>

744
00:34:13.581 --> 00:34:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I think of how crazy the environment is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how beautiful the experiences.</v>

745
00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:18.893
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so much more to it than going </v>

746
00:34:20.151 --> 00:34:22.460
<v Speaker 1>into a store and buying a squash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

747
00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.503
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what people need or </v>

748
00:34:24.871 --> 00:34:27.170
<v Speaker 1>understanding of state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even beyond what buying a steak shore,</v>

749
00:34:27.171 --> 00:34:30.970
<v Speaker 1>but buying even a Vegan or a vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your,</v>

750
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:31.873
<v Speaker 1>your vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're disconnected from these </v>

751
00:34:32.841 --> 00:34:34.970
<v Speaker 1>vegetables for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are.</v>

752
00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:35.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an intense connection with the </v>

753
00:34:38.121 --> 00:34:40.760
<v Speaker 1>food that you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you grow it yourself,</v>

754
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.510
<v Speaker 1>like my wife gardens and I do as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she does it more than I do,</v>

755
00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:47.570
<v Speaker 1>but we'll have salad from something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we grew in our garden.</v>

756
00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.490
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

757
00:34:49.491 --> 00:34:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Like we're chopping tomatoes that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>planted those seeds and we fertilize the</v>

758
00:34:53.511 --> 00:34:55.370
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We watered it and it came up.</v>

759
00:34:55.371 --> 00:34:56.204
<v Speaker 1>We pick the tomato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're slicing into it and it's a </v>

760
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.850
<v Speaker 1>process process and that's where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt,</v>

761
00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.713
<v Speaker 1>that's where the hunt where the training</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the preparation and the reverence </v>

762
00:35:05.661 --> 00:35:06.494
<v Speaker 1>for the animal and the harvest and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal and the care of the meet and get </v>

763
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.790
<v Speaker 1>to your house and you put it in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>freezer and then you thought and you put</v>

764
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:16.550
<v Speaker 1>that whole process is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll agree with remy.</v>

765
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:21.580
<v Speaker 1>There is reverence to and it means so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much and for a hunter for and I think,</v>

766
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.393
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as just being a provider and just being </v>

767
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:26.481
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

768
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:30.170
<v Speaker 1>we say self self sufficient and doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is hard.</v>

769
00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot easier to go to the store and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

770
00:35:32.691 --> 00:35:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some of my money.</v>

771
00:35:34.071 --> 00:35:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Could I have that meat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

772
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else did all,</v>

773
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff we</v>

774
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.110
<v Speaker 2>just talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody else did that with no reverence</v>

775
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.850
<v Speaker 2>and I'm eating it with no reverence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

776
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.960
<v Speaker 2>So to do it on your own is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

777
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:49.733
<v Speaker 2>it's why it's what I trained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what I prepare for every day and </v>

778
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:54.990
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just means so much.</v>

779
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:55.913
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

780
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.043
<v Speaker 1>enriching in a very strange way that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>never experienced in my life until I </v>

781
00:36:01.251 --> 00:36:02.084
<v Speaker 1>started hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never had this kind of connection </v>

782
00:36:04.371 --> 00:36:06.560
<v Speaker 1>with my food except for me be going </v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing,</v>

783
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:07.783
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

784
00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:08.690
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

785
00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.553
<v Speaker 1>last summer I took my kids to Hawaii and</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids love fishing with my little </v>

786
00:36:13.101 --> 00:36:13.701
<v Speaker 1>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

787
00:36:13.701 --> 00:36:14.534
<v Speaker 1>It's fun because you know they can put a</v>
<v Speaker 1>line in the water and when they catch </v>

788
00:36:17.031 --> 00:36:19.130
<v Speaker 1>something and then we're cooking it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating it later,</v>

789
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.233
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we caught this and they keep saying </v>

790
00:36:21.561 --> 00:36:22.131
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mommy,</v>

791
00:36:22.131 --> 00:36:27.131
<v Speaker 1>we caught this fish that you're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's like a primal connection to</v>

792
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.843
<v Speaker 1>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other than that I had never </v>

793
00:36:31.101 --> 00:36:31.934
<v Speaker 1>experienced this sort of primal </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection to your food and all that </v>

794
00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:42.290
<v Speaker 1>nonsense aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a difference between a fish</v>

795
00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.780
<v Speaker 1>and a mammal that just is totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a.</v>

796
00:36:44.781 --> 00:36:46.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She.</v>

797
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.710
<v Speaker 1>The reverence that you have for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

798
00:36:48.711 --> 00:36:50.750
<v Speaker 1>the most majestic of animals that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt,</v>

799
00:36:50.751 --> 00:36:53.090
<v Speaker 1>which is elk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the most majestic.</v>

800
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:54.280
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

801
00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.730
<v Speaker 1>they're mythical creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

802
00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Crazy</v>

803
00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:57.423
<v Speaker 2>elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sheep.</v>

804
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:58.503
<v Speaker 2>Sheep are up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know where they live and the </v>

805
00:37:00.641 --> 00:37:04.810
<v Speaker 2>regalness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but elk is a god just because they're so</v>

806
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:06.810
<v Speaker 2>iconic throughout the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

807
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.590
<v Speaker 2>a big bull elk is just what</v>

808
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:11.850
<v Speaker 1>you know when you envisioned the West </v>
<v Speaker 1>envision mounds.</v>

809
00:37:11.851 --> 00:37:14.010
<v Speaker 1>You think of a big bull elk and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

810
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hunt this with my bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's intense.</v>

811
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.790
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hard to do two and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>goddamn.</v>

812
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.260
<v Speaker 1>You forget me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Addicted to this shit.</v>

813
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:23.123
<v Speaker 1>It's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll text him every now and then like </v>

814
00:37:24.661 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the middle of doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

815
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God.</v>

816
00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.090
<v Speaker 1>This is boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather even just shooting.</v>

817
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.590
<v Speaker 1>We shot it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A rubber target today.</v>

818
00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.540
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a rubber elk.</v>

819
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:36.510
<v Speaker 1>It sets up my hill and we did a little a</v>
<v Speaker 1>facetime video.</v>

820
00:37:36.511 --> 00:37:38.520
<v Speaker 1>We were out there doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just shooting it.</v>

821
00:37:38.521 --> 00:37:40.360
<v Speaker 1>That rubber is cool now.</v>

822
00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was saying.</v>

823
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:42.583
<v Speaker 2>You can take anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can take the coolest person you </v>

824
00:37:44.701 --> 00:37:45.430
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just think,</v>

825
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:49.050
<v Speaker 2>just sit here and think who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's the coolest person I know?</v>

826
00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Or who is the coolest girl?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

827
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.103
<v Speaker 2>You take that person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put a bow in their hand and you get </v>

828
00:37:54.301 --> 00:37:55.860
<v Speaker 2>them shooting a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're cooler.</v>

829
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:58.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my.</v>

830
00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean shooting a bow makes you more of </v>

831
00:38:01.081 --> 00:38:02.290
<v Speaker 2>a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I prefer</v>

832
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.560
<v Speaker 1>girls that don't like to hunt that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to come with me now.</v>

833
00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.403
<v Speaker 1>I don't want him to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't complain while they're up </v>

834
00:38:07.781 --> 00:38:08.614
<v Speaker 1>there and they don't want them to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder if shoot a bow does screw </v>

835
00:38:11.111 --> 00:38:12.160
<v Speaker 1>up my high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

836
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like cism now in hunting.</v>

837
00:38:15.791 --> 00:38:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Does it exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does next on Oprah?</v>

838
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Dr drew.</v>

839
00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:21.243
<v Speaker 1>He would love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would get me on there and just </v>

840
00:38:22.511 --> 00:38:23.344
<v Speaker 1>crucifying would lie and he would get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of girls who don't know anything </v>

841
00:38:25.331 --> 00:38:27.250
<v Speaker 1>about hunting to yell at you but have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of.</v>

842
00:38:27.251 --> 00:38:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Did a lot of big opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

843
00:38:28.811 --> 00:38:29.644
<v Speaker 1>when we got back from Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was right when this whole cecil the </v>

844
00:38:32.831 --> 00:38:33.664
<v Speaker 1>lion shit was going down and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to have a hunter onto yell at </v>

845
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.823
<v Speaker 1>essentially and I was telling you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it and the first time you didn't do </v>

846
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:43.810
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got you to leave.</v>

847
00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I was in the green room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

848
00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.313
<v Speaker 1>I was in the green room and again her </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair and makeup and it just like wasn't </v>

849
00:38:52.421 --> 00:38:54.040
<v Speaker 1>feeling good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

850
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you talked to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad we have association.</v>

851
00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.660
<v Speaker 1>So I left but then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did go on.</v>

852
00:38:58.661 --> 00:38:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did go on later.</v>

853
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.693
<v Speaker 1>But it was after the smoke had settled a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit and you went on with a </v>

854
00:39:03.431 --> 00:39:08.431
<v Speaker 1>conversation about ethical acquisition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of meat and you know Dr. True eats meat.</v>

855
00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:09.843
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those people on that show eat </v>

856
00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:12.510
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

857
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:15.640
<v Speaker 1>It's just bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bizarre conversation.</v>

858
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.333
<v Speaker 1>I mean that show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they show is around because </v>

859
00:39:20.531 --> 00:39:21.364
<v Speaker 1>controversy so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the font can hilarious things in </v>

860
00:39:23.771 --> 00:39:24.604
<v Speaker 1>the show was the woman who was saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the reason why there's not so many </v>

861
00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:29.080
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies just because we've killed off </v>
<v Speaker 1>all their predators.</v>

862
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means dinosaurs by the way.</v>

863
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Saber Tooth Tigers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly,</v>

864
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen a grizzly lady?</v>

865
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eating them up.</v>

866
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Other grizzlies are pretty much the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the food chain and I think,</v>

867
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:44.883
<v Speaker 1>well we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not really on the same page </v>

868
00:39:47.921 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 1>that we think we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think they are.</v>

869
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:51.220
<v Speaker 1>So there's a little bit of a conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

870
00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:52.660
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

871
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:54.880
<v Speaker 1>essentially it's like two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>kingdoms.</v>

872
00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:55.743
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There on the top of the food chain and </v>

873
00:39:56.831 --> 00:40:00.940
<v Speaker 1>the wild kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can get them in their world,</v>

874
00:40:00.941 --> 00:40:02.440
<v Speaker 1>but we gotta get the fuck out as quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>as we can.</v>

875
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.320
<v Speaker 1>We can only exist in their world for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple weeks at the most.</v>

876
00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.221
<v Speaker 1>And then we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

877
00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:07.054
<v Speaker 1>we got to get back to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an actual bed and I need to take some </v>

878
00:40:09.881 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 1>vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now it's a,</v>

879
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:14.500
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's well,</v>

880
00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:16.290
<v Speaker 1>according to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

882
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:19.540

888
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:36.903

<v Speaker 1>So they chased after it and they were </v>

889
00:40:38.411 --> 00:40:42.610
<v Speaker 1>biting its legs and then chasing down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it happened like a fucking 100 yards</v>

<v Speaker 1>harshest climates on the planet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>getting together for hunt.</v>

934
00:42:23.101 --> 00:42:25.260
<v Speaker 2>So just all joking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do like,</v>

935
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I do just like people shooting bows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even.</v>

936
00:42:28.061 --> 00:42:30.630
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can envision this,</v>

937
00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:31.613
<v Speaker 2>if Obama shot a bow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably think he was cooler and </v>

938
00:42:34.381 --> 00:42:36.480
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is amazing.</v>

939
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.540
<v Speaker 2>That is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shocky you should say</v>

940
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:39.830
<v Speaker 3>eve is too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

941
00:42:39.831 --> 00:42:43.430
<v Speaker 3>She's the daughter of Jim shockey who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been on this show who's an amazing,</v>

942
00:42:43.431 --> 00:42:46.460
<v Speaker 3>fascinating guy who has a show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you don't like hunting,</v>

943
00:42:46.461 --> 00:42:49.430
<v Speaker 3>there's an amazing show called uncharted</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's.</v>

944
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.360
<v Speaker 3>It's barely about hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really about different cultures and</v>

945
00:42:53.361 --> 00:42:54.194
<v Speaker 3>this guy goes to all these discount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim shockey is as cool and interesting </v>

946
00:42:58.461 --> 00:43:00.440
<v Speaker 3>as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is just a fascinating,</v>

947
00:43:00.441 --> 00:43:01.274
<v Speaker 3>fascinating guy and he travels to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>remote places in the middle of a Russia </v>

948
00:43:05.541 --> 00:43:10.541
<v Speaker 3>and he went to Afghanistan and he's he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went to Africa to this remote village</v>

949
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:13.183
<v Speaker 3>that has a massive problem with </v>
<v Speaker 3>crocodiles and it was an incredible </v>

950
00:43:16.251 --> 00:43:17.990
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an hour long show.</v>

951
00:43:17.991 --> 00:43:20.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be on the discovery channel.</v>

952
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.360
<v Speaker 3>It could be on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on HBO,</v>

953
00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 3>could be on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just so happens.</v>

954
00:43:25.101 --> 00:43:26.980
<v Speaker 3>It's on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it on the outdoorsman?</v>

955
00:43:26.981 --> 00:43:27.814
<v Speaker 3>Is Channel outdoor channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>outdoor channel and this guy goes to </v>

956
00:43:31.791 --> 00:43:33.110
<v Speaker 3>this place and you're seeing these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

957
00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:35.270
<v Speaker 3>like half the people in the village had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been mauled.</v>

958
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are missing arms.</v>

959
00:43:37.041 --> 00:43:37.874
<v Speaker 3>They're missing legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their faces have been cut open because </v>

960
00:43:40.101 --> 00:43:41.900
<v Speaker 3>they're getting killed by crocodiles </v>
<v Speaker 3>left and right,</v>

961
00:43:41.901 --> 00:43:45.170
<v Speaker 3>and while he was there filming a woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>got taken by a crocodile.</v>

962
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:46.363
<v Speaker 3>They've set up these sort of rudimentary</v>
<v Speaker 3>fences that they put in place to keep </v>

963
00:43:51.141 --> 00:43:55.310
<v Speaker 3>the crocodiles out of these area where </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people gather water and you know,</v>

964
00:43:55.311 --> 00:43:56.144
<v Speaker 3>and he's there with these other hunters </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they're trying to take out once a </v>

965
00:44:00.531 --> 00:44:02.900
<v Speaker 3>crocodile apparently starts eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

966
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:05.180
<v Speaker 3>but you got to kill it because got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>taste for it.</v>

967
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got a taste for it and they realize</v>

968
00:44:06.381 --> 00:44:07.214
<v Speaker 3>how easy it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a wildebeest can fuck up a </v>

969
00:44:09.261 --> 00:44:10.580
<v Speaker 3>crocodile a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

970
00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:12.710
<v Speaker 3>you throw a kick at it and break his </v>
<v Speaker 3>jaw.</v>

971
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:16.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean the crocodile is incredibly tough</v>
<v Speaker 3>and durable animal,</v>

972
00:44:16.101 --> 00:44:19.930
<v Speaker 3>but a wildebeest is a tough scrap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big animal and you know,</v>

973
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:22.340
<v Speaker 3>like a water buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a scrap.</v>

974
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:25.850
<v Speaker 3>It's a big animal to work for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might not work out a person.</v>

975
00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:27.180
<v Speaker 3>God Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're made out of Jello,</v>

976
00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:28.430
<v Speaker 3>Jello and popsicle sticks.</v>

977
00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:29.391
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

978
00:44:29.391 --> 00:44:32.910
<v Speaker 2>and I hunted crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really they are.</v>

979
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 2>They're tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you hung crocodile in Africa?</v>

980
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.880
<v Speaker 2>In Tanzania.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to kill one.</v>

981
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:43.920
<v Speaker 2>And so to get within range of a you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to build a blind and they come up,</v>

982
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:44.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their eyes are just above the water and </v>

983
00:44:46.711 --> 00:44:47.544
<v Speaker 2>for a bow you have like two bumps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got a bump above the eye and one </v>

984
00:44:50.641 --> 00:44:53.310
<v Speaker 2>back here you have to be like right </v>
<v Speaker 2>below that are writing between.</v>

985
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:55.860
<v Speaker 2>You're shooting at about a fifty cent </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece size.</v>

986
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.740
<v Speaker 2>You have to break them because if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit them in the lungs,</v>

987
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:01.620
<v Speaker 2>they're in the water and then they sink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get them.</v>

988
00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:03.660
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going to hunter crocodile </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a bow,</v>

989
00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.000
<v Speaker 2>it has to be brain shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drop them.</v>

990
00:45:06.001 --> 00:45:08.370
<v Speaker 2>So to do that you have to get them up </v>
<v Speaker 2>off the shore,</v>

991
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.720
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

992
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:12.330
<v Speaker 2>could never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Built a blind,</v>

993
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:16.200
<v Speaker 2>had the Beta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like so hard to do that.</v>

994
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.393
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys I was with killed one </v>

995
00:45:18.581 --> 00:45:20.670
<v Speaker 2>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a rifle and we ate it.</v>

996
00:45:20.671 --> 00:45:22.170
<v Speaker 2>And the meat is amazing.</v>

997
00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.093
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be the highest protein </v>

998
00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:27.030
<v Speaker 1>meat you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like alligator and crocodile is supposed</v>

999
00:45:27.031 --> 00:45:31.320
<v Speaker 1>to be one ounce per ounce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the highest in protein content.</v>

1000
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:32.461
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1001
00:45:32.461 --> 00:45:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so good too.</v>

1002
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:35.550
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1003
00:45:35.551 --> 00:45:36.384
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

1004
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.610
<v Speaker 1>they're smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're tough.</v>

1005
00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're stupid as fuck.</v>

1006
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to kill him.</v>

1007
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I just think they know how to not get </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

1008
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Like they have a couple of calculations </v>
<v Speaker 1>they make in their brand.</v>

1009
00:45:47.401 --> 00:45:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Is that a person you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this dude.</v>

1010
00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brain is very small.</v>

1011
00:45:51.481 --> 00:45:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you that because it's a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>target,</v>

1012
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.890
<v Speaker 1>but if you're trying to hunt them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to think they're smart.</v>

1013
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.870
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to do a crossword puzzle</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>

1014
00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:01.410
<v Speaker 1>probably not that smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating though,</v>

1015
00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:02.253
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't want us.</v>

1016
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't give a shout out.</v>

1017
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Not only to Jim shockey because he is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate savage love gym,</v>

1018
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.160
<v Speaker 1>but in Love Eva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their son,</v>

1019
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.950
<v Speaker 1>brandon brandon is the mastermind behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shooting of that show,</v>

1020
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.600

<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1021
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:16.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as</v>

1022
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:17.203
<v Speaker 2>filming and the production value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you see on tv that's brand </v>

<v Speaker 2>And he is,</v>

1024
00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:24.283
<v Speaker 2>I think he could film like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Best Hollywood movie you've ever </v>

1025
00:46:29.691 --> 00:46:30.770
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could do that.</v>

1026
00:46:30.771 --> 00:46:33.620
<v Speaker 2>He has that talent and right now he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it on the outdoor channel.</v>

1027
00:46:33.621 --> 00:46:35.240

<v Speaker 1>combating against poaching in Africa and</v>

1033
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:49.703
<v Speaker 1>it's all about stopping poachers from </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing rhinos and elephants and all </v>

1034
00:46:53.141 --> 00:46:54.970
<v Speaker 1>these different animals that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing in Africa.</v>

1035
00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.073
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not really a hunting show as </v>

1036
00:46:58.031 --> 00:46:58.864
<v Speaker 1>much as it's just a pure conservation </v>
<v Speaker 1>show about a guy who's trying to stop </v>

1037
00:47:02.531 --> 00:47:03.880
<v Speaker 1>poaching in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

1038
00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:05.043
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing and gritty and incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>well documented and shot and just man </v>

1039
00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:11.890
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of Africa.</v>

1040
00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:12.813
<v Speaker 1>If you want to watch a documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've mentioned this before to </v>

1041
00:47:15.041 --> 00:47:16.780
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sorry if you heard it before,</v>

1042
00:47:16.781 --> 00:47:17.614
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our friend Louis Theroux who's been on </v>

1043
00:47:19.511 --> 00:47:21.700
<v Speaker 1>the show before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an amazing documentary,</v>

1044
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.823
<v Speaker 1>a documentary guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentarian from the UK did a show on </v>

1045
00:47:27.371 --> 00:47:28.204
<v Speaker 1>these hunting in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very different from what you </v>

1046
00:47:31.931 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Speaker 1>did in Africa.</v>

1047
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:35.110
<v Speaker 1>What you did in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went to the actual wild who Africa,</v>

1048
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:40.360
<v Speaker 1>not a high fence operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these hunting ranches that they have</v>

1049
00:47:40.361 --> 00:47:43.780
<v Speaker 1>set up in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a catch 22.</v>

1050
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:44.614
<v Speaker 1>It's such A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much contradiction going on </v>

1051
00:47:45.911 --> 00:47:49.030
<v Speaker 1>because on one hand these animals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped in this.</v>

1052
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:52.330
<v Speaker 1>It's usually enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like several thousand Acre area.</v>

1053
00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:53.253
<v Speaker 1>It can be where they're trapped in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas and they're hunted and the people </v>

1054
00:47:56.351 --> 00:47:59.410
<v Speaker 1>call it a can hunt and a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have a lot of hate for it,</v>

1055
00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:00.453
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals that they're hunting have </v>

1056
00:48:02.621 --> 00:48:03.454
<v Speaker 1>never been healthier and higher numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of them were on the verge of </v>

1057
00:48:05.801 --> 00:48:06.634
<v Speaker 1>extinction until they started </v>
<v Speaker 1>implementing these high fence </v>

1058
00:48:08.621 --> 00:48:09.454
<v Speaker 1>operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it goes back to the same thing we </v>

1059
00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:13.480
<v Speaker 1>were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money for conservation,</v>

1060
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:14.403
<v Speaker 1>the real money that these people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting in Africa is coming from </v>

1061
00:48:16.271 --> 00:48:17.060
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

1062
00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:17.893
<v Speaker 1>That's what's paying for these animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>to survive because so many people are </v>

1063
00:48:20.351 --> 00:48:22.620
<v Speaker 1>going over there to hunt and people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1064
00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.460
<v Speaker 1>animals have value exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key.</v>

1065
00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:27.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's so fucking weird concept for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1066
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:30.730
<v Speaker 1>If an animal doesn't have value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably going to be extinct.</v>

1067
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how.</v>

1068
00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:33.670
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

1069
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:34.773
<v Speaker 1>That's why hunter's care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why conservation is care because </v>

1070
00:48:37.001 --> 00:48:39.400
<v Speaker 1>the animal is valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's right,</v>

1071
00:48:39.401 --> 00:48:41.560
<v Speaker 1>wrong or indifferent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When there's value.</v>

1072
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:42.483
<v Speaker 1>People care and people have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding today that they didn't </v>

1073
00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:46.234
<v Speaker 1>have this several hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when people look at the gigantic </v>

1074
00:48:49.121 --> 00:48:52.210
<v Speaker 1>mounds of buffalo skulls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a perfect example.</v>

1075
00:48:52.211 --> 00:48:53.044
<v Speaker 1>Why you need conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just have people run out and </v>

1076
00:48:55.811 --> 00:48:56.644
<v Speaker 1>kill these animals that have value with </v>
<v Speaker 1>no consequence or with no monitoring of </v>

1077
00:49:00.911 --> 00:49:01.744
<v Speaker 1>the herd populations and health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you get these horrific mass </v>

1078
00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:06.723
<v Speaker 1>extinction events like what happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the buffalo and the buffalo were </v>

1079
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:11.950
<v Speaker 1>basically brought to the verge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinction.</v>

1080
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Now they're in healthy populations to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where you can actually,</v>

1081
00:49:15.101 --> 00:49:18.040
<v Speaker 1>in some places you can hunt wild ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing could be,</v>

1082
00:49:18.041 --> 00:49:19.120
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a set of elk.</v>

1083
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.133
<v Speaker 1>The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation has </v>
<v Speaker 1>done an amazing job of repopulating </v>

1084
00:49:23.771 --> 00:49:26.440
<v Speaker 1>areas with elk where they were at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time,</v>

1085
00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:27.940
<v Speaker 1>completely eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1086
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:31.360
<v Speaker 1>did you know that when you tuck elk deer</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey,</v>

1087
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:32.703
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about there's more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those species now than there's ever </v>

1088
00:49:35.681 --> 00:49:37.630
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true with elk?</v>

1089
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Because I know it is with white tail </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer.</v>

1090
00:49:39.521 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 1>There's more white tail deer today then </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Columbus landed,</v>

1091
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:43.203
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if that's the case with</v>
<v Speaker 1>elk because there's more places where </v>

1092
00:49:46.331 --> 00:49:49.720
<v Speaker 1>they don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like most of the area where like</v>

1093
00:49:49.721 --> 00:49:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Steven Rinella did a whole show on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

1094
00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:54.700
<v Speaker 1>but most of the area where elk used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1095
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.730
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the areas where they are,</v>

1096
00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.620
<v Speaker 1>they're in healthy populations.</v>

1097
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm on Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you look this up?</v>

1098
00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look this up.</v>

1099
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Look it up about that populations </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm almost positive.</v>

1100
00:50:06.341 --> 00:50:07.174
<v Speaker 1>There's more now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See Elk are and probably rinella would </v>

1101
00:50:10.601 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 1>dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you know,</v>

1102
00:50:11.651 --> 00:50:14.610
<v Speaker 1>if he's been on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but elk are there,</v>

1103
00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:18.370
<v Speaker 1>plains animals originally they're pushed</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the mountains because the planes,</v>

1104
00:50:18.371 --> 00:50:19.204
<v Speaker 1>that's where we live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live where there's water and in the </v>

1105
00:50:20.801 --> 00:50:21.634
<v Speaker 1>valleys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where humans setup their cities </v>

1106
00:50:23.021 --> 00:50:23.854
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1107
00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:28.460
<v Speaker 1>to get user rivers and we need water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have been pushed and now they're</v>

1108
00:50:28.461 --> 00:50:29.294
<v Speaker 1>mountain animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now there's elk where there hasn't </v>

1109
00:50:31.791 --> 00:50:35.930
<v Speaker 1>been out before Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky and places like that.</v>

1110
00:50:35.931 --> 00:50:36.764
<v Speaker 1>So maybe they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're more places than they've </v>

1111
00:50:40.101 --> 00:50:41.390
<v Speaker 1>ever been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm almost,</v>

1112
00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:43.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost certain there's even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>elk,</v>

1113
00:50:43.641 --> 00:50:46.850
<v Speaker 1>but whatever the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think there are more places</v>

1114
00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:47.630
<v Speaker 1>than they've ever been.</v>

1115
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:48.463
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the ones that are there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in healthier populations in the used to </v>

1116
00:50:52.041 --> 00:50:55.640
<v Speaker 1>be I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think elk are a lot like a buffalo</v>

1117
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.490
<v Speaker 1>in that there's one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hundreds of years ago,</v>

1118
00:50:58.491 --> 00:50:59.890
<v Speaker 1>they were just shooting the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1119
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.820
<v Speaker 1>They're almost eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>

1120
00:51:01.821 --> 00:51:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I know now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bounced back and they're healthy</v>

1121
00:51:04.821 --> 00:51:06.530
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where'd that money come from?</v>

1122
00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Cameron hanes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say hunter.</v>

1123
00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.113
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation that </v>

1124
00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:14.200
<v Speaker 1>they've done a fantastic job and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1125
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.073
<v Speaker 1>they've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been on the forefront of </v>

1126
00:51:16.161 --> 00:51:17.600
<v Speaker 1>protecting habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

1127
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I know they've been over 6 million acres</v>
<v Speaker 1>protected,</v>

1128
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe close to 7 million now or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even over.</v>

1129
00:51:22.881 --> 00:51:23.714
<v Speaker 1>I haven't kept track recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's 7 million acres that can </v>

1130
00:51:25.881 --> 00:51:29.060
<v Speaker 1>never be used for anything else other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than habitat for animals.</v>

1131
00:51:29.061 --> 00:51:29.894
<v Speaker 1>And that's not just elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's deer to elk numbers across six </v>

1132
00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.010
<v Speaker 1>dates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we look in there?</v>

1133
00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:35.870
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is across states,</v>

1134
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.190
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1135
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe we could keep looking.</v>

1136
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:39.023
<v Speaker 2>Can we see that in American elk </v>
<v Speaker 2>populations dwindled to less than </v>

1137
00:51:41.311 --> 00:51:45.360
<v Speaker 2>100,000 by the early 19 nineties now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's insane.</v>

1138
00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:49.800
<v Speaker 2>And now in 2009 grew to 1 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty $1,000.</v>

1139
00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:52.340
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the 19 nineties,</v>

1140
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.983
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was down to 100,000 in the 19 </v>

1141
00:51:56.061 --> 00:51:56.930
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1142
00:51:56.931 --> 00:51:58.990
<v Speaker 1>That's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

1143
00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.340
<v Speaker 1>that's the verge of extinction in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>

1144
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Not just in our lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in when we were both men.</v>

1145
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So during that time,</v>

1146
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:06.940
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1147
00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:08.260
<v Speaker 2>that can't be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

1148
00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:10.110
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The early 19,</v>

1149
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.983
<v Speaker 2>now that's got to be 18 nineties whereas</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hasn't it see the lessons of the </v>

1150
00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.000
<v Speaker 2>last word of the first paragraph</v>

1151
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:20.480
<v Speaker 1>by 1984 there was an estimated 715,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>elk in North America.</v>

1152
00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:23.760
<v Speaker 2>No Fred above there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last word of the first paragraph.</v>

1153
00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.773
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately a toto toto American that </v>
<v Speaker 1>less than $100,000 in a 100,000 in the </v>

1154
00:52:29.341 --> 00:52:30.660
<v Speaker 1>early 19 nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

1155
00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:33.000
<v Speaker 1>that can't be 19 nineties is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an incorrect.</v>

1156
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.490
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah it might be,</v>

1157
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:36.090
<v Speaker 1>it might be a miss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's</v>

1158
00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:41.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause cause cause it says in 1984</v>

1159
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:43.070
<v Speaker 1>84,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 750.</v>

1160
00:52:43.071 --> 00:52:45.430
<v Speaker 1>So went all the way back right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1161
00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must be a typo.</v>

1162
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:47.490
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1163
00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:52.100
<v Speaker 1>so that's what dom typo whose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose fucking go go.</v>

1164
00:52:52.101 --> 00:52:54.330
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go Hunt seat.</v>

1165
00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:59.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily trust a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting sites for things like that.</v>

1166
00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Like that's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trust him when they support the point.</v>

1167
00:53:02.061 --> 00:53:05.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant fuck ups.</v>

1168
00:53:05.351 --> 00:53:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I did email that site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who's listening,</v>

1169
00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:09.670
<v Speaker 1>please email that site and let us know </v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed.</v>

1170
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:12.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's supposed to be 18 nineties </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say,</v>

1171
00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:15.200
<v Speaker 1>and I would say less than 100,000 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's over a million.</v>

1172
00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I get that.</v>

1173
00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.233
<v Speaker 1>The point that I was making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think before people colonized the </v>

1174
00:53:23.121 --> 00:53:24.860
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they were everywhere.</v>

1175
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:25.913
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what,</v>

1176
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.490
<v Speaker 3>that's what Rinella was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

1177
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:28.343
<v Speaker 3>So I think what he was saying was that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not in 90 percent of the places </v>

1178
00:53:32.371 --> 00:53:34.420
<v Speaker 3>they used to be in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

1179
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:36.390
<v Speaker 3>the places they're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like thriving.</v>

1180
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:37.530
<v Speaker 3>They're thriving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1181
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:40.050
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a really important point when it</v>

1182
00:53:40.051 --> 00:53:40.884
<v Speaker 3>comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we were talking about grizzly </v>

1183
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:43.230
<v Speaker 3>bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people say,</v>

1184
00:53:43.231 --> 00:53:44.064
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the grizzly bears are almost extinct in </v>

1185
00:53:45.151 --> 00:53:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Santa Monica.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1186
00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.450
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're almost extinct in California.</v>

1187
00:53:48.451 --> 00:53:51.990
<v Speaker 3>They only live in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not a ton in California to Alaska.</v>

1188
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.910
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of um,</v>

1189
00:53:53.911 --> 00:53:57.060
<v Speaker 3>folks in Alaska which is twice the size </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Texas.</v>

1190
00:53:57.061 --> 00:54:00.300
<v Speaker 3>It's a goddamn enormous state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they are,</v>

1191
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:02.910
<v Speaker 3>they are big and there's a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1192
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.863
<v Speaker 3>And they decimate herds of Caribou elk </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they estimate that something around </v>

1193
00:54:08.881 --> 00:54:09.714
<v Speaker 3>like where John and Jen live in Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than 50 percent of the Moose are </v>

1194
00:54:13.141 --> 00:54:15.580
<v Speaker 3>killed at birth by bears.</v>

1195
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:17.610
<v Speaker 2>That's where the bears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they follow.</v>

1196
00:54:17.611 --> 00:54:21.360
<v Speaker 2>So a cow moose is pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to drop,</v>

1197
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.100
<v Speaker 2>drop the calf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1198
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:26.850
<v Speaker 2>And so bears will know that Moose is </v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant.</v>

1199
00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:28.710
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's going to be dropping a calf.</v>

1200
00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:32.100
<v Speaker 2>They follow her as soon as she drops a </v>
<v Speaker 2>calf right there,</v>

1201
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:33.540
<v Speaker 2>kill it and eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how.</v>

1202
00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.280
<v Speaker 2>That's how they get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just follow the Moose around.</v>

1203
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:38.410
<v Speaker 3>Not even then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times they're pulling it out of</v>

1204
00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.160
<v Speaker 3>the cow's body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1205
00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:40.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's how</v>

1206
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:41.870
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're brutal.</v>

1207
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:43.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life in the wild.</v>

1208
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fairy tale out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real deal.</v>

1209
00:54:46.191 --> 00:54:48.560
<v Speaker 2>It's life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're doing,</v>

1210
00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:50.840
<v Speaker 2>they're just going to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to kill.</v>

1211
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:52.490
<v Speaker 2>That's all they care about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throwing a kill.</v>

1212
00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they survive.</v>

1213
00:54:53.751 --> 00:54:55.370
<v Speaker 2>So there's nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1214
00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:56.733
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

1215
00:54:57.020 --> 00:55:00.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to judge them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1216
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:02.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so where I was,</v>

1217
00:55:02.061 --> 00:55:02.894
<v Speaker 2>I was in um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 16 in Alaska and you can see a </v>

1218
00:55:06.201 --> 00:55:10.820
<v Speaker 2>nonresident can kill to brown bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are basically salmon fed,</v>

1219
00:55:10.821 --> 00:55:13.430
<v Speaker 2>grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzly bear and three black bear,</v>

1220
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:15.530
<v Speaker 2>so he can go up there and kill five </v>
<v Speaker 2>bear,</v>

1221
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:19.010
<v Speaker 2>which I wanted to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't think that I'm blood thirsty.</v>

1222
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Thank that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1223
00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:22.340
<v Speaker 2>I want to help the most and I like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bear meat.</v>

1224
00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:23.970
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1225
00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:26.810
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that's what killed three.</v>

1226
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.823
<v Speaker 2>I killed three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that gives you an example of how </v>

1227
00:55:29.571 --> 00:55:32.120
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many bears are our.</v>

1228
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:36.440
<v Speaker 2>And this is by biologists who are paid </v>
<v Speaker 2>and who have went to school and with who</v>

1229
00:55:36.441 --> 00:55:37.274
<v Speaker 2>have studied the carrying capacity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the land and how many animals they </v>

1230
00:55:39.711 --> 00:55:41.330
<v Speaker 2>determined this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't,</v>

1231
00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:45.110
<v Speaker 2>this isn't hunters determining this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is Alaska fish and game.</v>

1232
00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.480
<v Speaker 2>So that's where I have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are,</v>

1233
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.820
<v Speaker 2>who think they know better than people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who this is their passion,</v>

1234
00:55:50.821 --> 00:55:52.640
<v Speaker 2>this is what they care about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have boots on the ground,</v>

1235
00:55:52.641 --> 00:55:53.320
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1236
00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.153
<v Speaker 2>they're setting the bag limits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't know if you don't live </v>

1237
00:55:56.601 --> 00:55:59.330
<v Speaker 2>there and study this and this has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life mission.</v>

1238
00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.520
<v Speaker 2>You don't know more than them so.</v>

1239
00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Well their wildlife biologist and by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

1240
00:56:03.671 --> 00:56:06.520
<v Speaker 3>if those populations aren't kept at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy level,</v>

1241
00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:07.653
<v Speaker 3>they send in people that they pay to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill these animals and this is an </v>

1242
00:56:10.481 --> 00:56:11.314
<v Speaker 3>important factor and this is what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about with California because </v>

1243
00:56:13.151 --> 00:56:16.000
<v Speaker 3>California doesn't have a hunting season</v>
<v Speaker 3>for mountain lions.</v>

1244
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.640
<v Speaker 3>They have to pay people to go in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill these mountain lions.</v>

1245
00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:20.490
<v Speaker 3>They're not just letting them out in </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines live.</v>

1246
00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.050
<v Speaker 3>Not if they become a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're taking them out.</v>

1247
00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.730
<v Speaker 3>They just don't want to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>backlash.</v>

1248
00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:25.570
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1249
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:28.490
<v Speaker 3>So they're just avoiding the backlash </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not doing it quietly.</v>

1250
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.333
<v Speaker 3>It's not for the betterment of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal or or you know the ecosystem or </v>

1251
00:56:33.671 --> 00:56:34.504
<v Speaker 3>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just because they don't want to </v>

1252
00:56:35.261 --> 00:56:36.820
<v Speaker 3>deal with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the drama.</v>

1253
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:40.330
<v Speaker 3>And then you get these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they were here first.</v>

1254
00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Where were they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they were here?</v>

1255
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:43.091
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't.</v>

1256
00:56:43.091 --> 00:56:47.260
<v Speaker 3>First of all that mountain lions five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was here way before that fuck.</v>

1257
00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:48.933
<v Speaker 3>And they as in they come on stop.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Fantasy land if they haven't seen.</v>

1285
00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.433
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a giant problem with bears in </v>

1286
00:58:03.971 --> 00:58:05.140
<v Speaker 3>New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

1287
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:07.870
<v Speaker 3>this is this facts behind this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1288
00:58:07.871 --> 00:58:08.704
<v Speaker 3>a student from rutgers was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed by a bear right outside of </v>

1289
00:58:11.861 --> 00:58:12.250
<v Speaker 3>rutgers.</v>

1290
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:13.083
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that photograph student took this photo </v>

1291
00:58:14.351 --> 00:58:16.980
<v Speaker 3>of a bear just before it killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1292
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:18.063
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a guy who is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows rangers out there and they're </v>

1293
00:58:21.401 --> 00:58:22.234
<v Speaker 3>telling people not to hike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have so many Goddamn bear in New </v>

1294
00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why do they have so many bear?</v>

1295
00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Because they didn't have a hunt for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1296
00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:32.710
<v Speaker 3>So these God damn things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got overpopulated and they have now</v>

1297
00:58:32.711 --> 00:58:33.544
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're entering into residential </v>

1298
00:58:34.481 --> 00:58:36.200
<v Speaker 3>neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these laundry.</v>

1299
00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:39.940

<v Speaker 3>Bear fight far rockaway,</v>

1300
00:58:39.941 --> 00:58:42.700
<v Speaker 3>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>August 14th of 2014.</v>

1301
00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:46.750
<v Speaker 3>These bears are duking it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are big black bears,</v>

1302
00:58:46.751 --> 00:58:50.560
<v Speaker 3>like seven foot bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>400 plus pound bears,</v>

1303
00:58:50.561 --> 00:58:53.470
<v Speaker 3>and they are going to war in this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 3>front lawn.</v>

1304
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:54.723
<v Speaker 3>These are huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you were in Alberta and you </v>

1305
00:58:56.861 --> 00:58:58.420
<v Speaker 3>saw one of these bears coming in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

1306
00:58:58.450 --> 00:58:59.283
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

1307
00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:01.810
<v Speaker 3>that's a trophy bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a giant bear.</v>

1308
00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.850
<v Speaker 3>That's hundreds of pounds of meat for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the grill.</v>

1309
00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:07.300
<v Speaker 3>And these bears are in this guy's lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1310
00:59:07.301 --> 00:59:10.240
<v Speaker 3>this isn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't some crazy rural,</v>

1311
00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:11.133
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Akins living in the middle of the </v>

1312
00:59:12.941 --> 00:59:13.720
<v Speaker 3>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1313
00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.900
<v Speaker 3>in this jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing just knocked over a lamp post</v>

1314
00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.700
<v Speaker 3>and now it's colliding with these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1315
00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:20.740
<v Speaker 3>garbage pails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch this.</v>

1316
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:21.950
<v Speaker 3>They come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're</v>

1317
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.700
<v Speaker 1>fighting over territory by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's created by garbage.</v>

1318
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:26.803
<v Speaker 1>That's what the territory is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They attack people's garbage and these </v>

1319
00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:31.593
<v Speaker 1>two bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bite each other and then they do </v>

1320
00:59:33.041 --> 00:59:34.730
<v Speaker 1>get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of these bears.</v>

1321
00:59:34.731 --> 00:59:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are huge,</v>

1322
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:37.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1323
00:59:37.161 --> 00:59:38.630
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>

1324
00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe there was before there's houses</v>

1325
00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:44.360
<v Speaker 1>that was perfect bear habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>

1326
00:59:44.361 --> 00:59:45.194
<v Speaker 1>There's houses now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means we have to control the </v>

1327
00:59:47.511 --> 00:59:48.830
<v Speaker 1>bare numbers that's hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1328
00:59:48.831 --> 00:59:52.550
<v Speaker 1>here's another part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These bears weren't here 30 years ago.</v>

1329
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:53.743
<v Speaker 1>These bears are overpopulating and </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving into these neighborhoods and </v>

1330
00:59:56.751 --> 00:59:57.584
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it because they know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people live there and it's a steady </v>

1331
00:59:59.811 --> 01:00:01.220
<v Speaker 1>supply of food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garbage.</v>

1332
01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you live in Colorado.</v>

1333
01:00:03.381 --> 01:00:04.214
<v Speaker 1>And Colorado is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a big issue with it in this </v>

1334
01:00:05.871 --> 01:00:06.704
<v Speaker 1>area where I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the bears would find out that </v>

1335
01:00:09.171 --> 01:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>people put their garbage in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>area and once they eat there,</v>

1336
01:00:12.081 --> 01:00:12.914
<v Speaker 1>once that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to capture those bears and </v>

1337
01:00:15.351 --> 01:00:19.340
<v Speaker 1>they either relocate them to zoos or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or figure something out.</v>

1338
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:20.630
<v Speaker 1>But one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was there,</v>

1339
01:00:20.631 --> 01:00:21.610
<v Speaker 1>we went to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1340
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:22.483
<v Speaker 1>wildlife rescue place and they had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic grizzly bear that they had </v>

1341
01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:26.204
<v Speaker 1>gotten because we'll get a fucking giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>chunks of further tearing off of each </v>

1342
01:00:29.901 --> 01:00:31.220
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

1343
01:00:31.221 --> 01:00:34.570
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bs.</v>

1344
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:35.503
<v Speaker 1>And now I love this video because a car </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulls up and the cars that they started </v>

1345
01:00:37.851 --> 01:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>taking selfies with the bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1346
01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:41.623
<v Speaker 1>they had to relocate this grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just started tearing apart </v>

1347
01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.130
<v Speaker 1>people's cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found it,</v>

1348
01:00:46.131 --> 01:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>found food and someone's car once was at</v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly black.</v>

1349
01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>It was a brown bear and it's one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had had,</v>

1350
01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where they had gotten it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1351
01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:55.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it happens with black bear.</v>

1352
01:00:55.221 --> 01:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>It happens with bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1353
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:57.531
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1354
01:00:57.531 --> 01:00:58.364
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1355
01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:00.710
<v Speaker 1>the numbers need to be controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all there is to.</v>

1356
01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have a large brown bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

1357
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris?</v>

1358
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:04.183
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be brown bear brown bear </v>

1359
01:01:05.781 --> 01:01:08.450
<v Speaker 1>when they're near the coast and Grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're inland brown bear.</v>

1360
01:01:08.451 --> 01:01:10.880
<v Speaker 1>They eat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're on,</v>

1361
01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>how do they call them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different names,</v>

1362
01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:15.620
<v Speaker 1>different species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess is what they've determined.</v>

1363
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:16.583
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are bigger because they fish and </v>

1364
01:01:17.651 --> 01:01:19.440
<v Speaker 1>they get all that protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

1365
01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:22.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be up 1400 pounds.</v>

1366
01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Where as a mountain grizzly in average </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain grizzly might be seven foot 500</v>

1367
01:01:29.091 --> 01:01:30.200
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1368
01:01:30.201 --> 01:01:32.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life's tough or up in the mountains,</v>

1369
01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.760
<v Speaker 1>they're eating blueberries when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blueberries are on,</v>

1370
01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1371
01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:41.180
<v Speaker 1>eating what they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the bears that eat the fish there,</v>

1372
01:01:41.181 --> 01:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>gorging on fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get big.</v>

1373
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:45.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just a high protein diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like what you're on right now.</v>

1374
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:48.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm on a high protein diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like fat too?</v>

1375
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1376
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:51.920
<v Speaker 1>this diet is kind of for the birds but </v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

1377
01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Birds eat grain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm enjoying.</v>

1378
01:01:56.181 --> 01:01:57.014
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not bad but for two weeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really like a bowl of pasta right </v>

1379
01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:01.880
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going well.</v>

1380
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:03.830
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1381
01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Well that whole Cecil and the bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>hugging thing that it's insane.</v>

1382
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you a woman made that.</v>

1383
01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:14.660
<v Speaker 1>How about that folks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm now.</v>

1384

<v Speaker 1>I'm done with that part.</v>

1385
01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may be.</v>

1386
01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>It could be a gay guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be a week.</v>

1387
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.920
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

1388

<v Speaker 4>all that nonsense aside.</v>

1389
01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:26.640
<v Speaker 4>We're joking around here folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What that is,</v>

1390
01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:28.230
<v Speaker 4>is just someone who doesn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1391
01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:30.880
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy ignorance and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1392
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:31.783
<v Speaker 4>the idea that you want to let these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things keep fucking and breeding and </v>

1393
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:35.813
<v Speaker 4>overpopulating to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're killing college students just </v>

1394
01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:40.320
<v Speaker 4>outside of rutgers and they're having </v>
<v Speaker 4>these two,</v>

1395
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:43.320
<v Speaker 4>400 plus pound bears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>duke it out on your front lawn.</v>

1396
01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:45.330
<v Speaker 4>That's not good folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not good.</v>

1397
01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:46.150
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd,</v>

1398
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:49.380
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to see these people that think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the bears hugging each other.</v>

1399
01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:50.430
<v Speaker 4>Go break the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1400
01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:51.900
<v Speaker 4>come on guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's settle down.</v>

1401
01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:53.640
<v Speaker 4>Break it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go break those bears up.</v>

1402
01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:54.683
<v Speaker 4>Up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Since apparently they cry and have </v>

1403
01:02:55.921 --> 01:02:57.600
<v Speaker 4>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1404
01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:00.600
<v Speaker 4>Cecil has a brother who's protecting his</v>
<v Speaker 4>family.</v>

1405
01:03:00.601 --> 01:03:01.710
<v Speaker 4>Jericho.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kay.</v>

1406
01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:04.140
<v Speaker 4>Go break up that bear fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me know how that goes.</v>

1407
01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.003
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>

1408
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:08.310
<v Speaker 4>Samantha is from their website.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Save and Jay Baer's dot com.</v>

1409
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:11.420
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is another name you don't part.</v>

1410
01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.750
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1411
01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:13.584
<v Speaker 4>we're only facilitating this issue right</v>
<v Speaker 4>here with naming the bears that </v>

1412
01:03:16.831 --> 01:03:19.260
<v Speaker 4>humanizing them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you watch the superbowl,</v>

1413
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:20.243
<v Speaker 4>it seemed like every other commercial </v>
<v Speaker 4>was something an animal seeing foreign </v>

1414
01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.390
<v Speaker 4>animal talking or it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1415
01:03:27.391 --> 01:03:31.950
<v Speaker 4>I saw sheep singing in the acapella </v>
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>

1416
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is going on?</v>

1417
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that's,</v>

1418
01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:39.690
<v Speaker 4>that's where hunters are fighting for </v>
<v Speaker 4>our place right now because the kids are</v>

1419
01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:43.590
<v Speaker 4>seeing that and weak people are seeing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and people that don't get,</v>

1420
01:03:43.591 --> 01:03:44.424
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be part of the food chain are </v>

1421
01:03:46.081 --> 01:03:48.660
<v Speaker 4>seeing that and they're like humanizing </v>
<v Speaker 4>these animals.</v>

1422
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:54.060
<v Speaker 4>Sheep don't care about anything but </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating,</v>

1423
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:55.310
<v Speaker 4>eating and fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1424
01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.520
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They stay alive.</v>

1425
01:03:56.550 --> 01:03:58.810
<v Speaker 4>They're not talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not talking about,</v>

1426
01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:00.210
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here comes a guy who was bringing us our</v>

1427
01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:00.510
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>

1428
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:01.343
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1429
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.430
<v Speaker 4>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not.</v>

1430
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.800
<v Speaker 4>It's not realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the,</v>

1431
01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:07.320
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the programming,</v>

1432
01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:08.183
<v Speaker 4>the programming that's getting out there</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just met missing with the hardwire </v>

1433
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:13.730
<v Speaker 4>of these young people coming up with A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1434
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:14.573
<v Speaker 4>a lot of hunters attribute Bambi as </v>
<v Speaker 4>being a turning point in the way </v>

1435
01:04:17.791 --> 01:04:19.410
<v Speaker 4>Americans viewed hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1436
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.273
<v Speaker 4>because then all of a sudden you've seen</v>
<v Speaker 4>this beautiful animal getting chased </v>

1437
01:04:23.341 --> 01:04:24.810
<v Speaker 4>down and killed by a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1438
01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.450
<v Speaker 4>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to fight.</v>

1439
01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.700
<v Speaker 4>We need to fight to change that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we are.</v>

1440
01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:32.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean we are because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1441
01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.460
<v Speaker 4>every time you see a hunter on a show or</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a who,</v>

1442
01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:38.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what it's been on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think south parks even had something,</v>

1443
01:04:38.881 --> 01:04:43.881
<v Speaker 4>but it's obviously it's some redneck </v>
<v Speaker 4>hillbilly drinking beer,</v>

1444
01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:49.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no respect for anything that's always,</v>

1445
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:51.360
<v Speaker 4>even in all the Hollywood movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what,</v>

1446
01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:54.600
<v Speaker 4>that's what they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the image they portray.</v>

1447
01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:57.690
<v Speaker 4>We need to change that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to,</v>

1448
01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:58.673
<v Speaker 4>we're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think with podcasts and with </v>

1449
01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:02.124
<v Speaker 4>conversations on the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least information is getting to </v>

1450
01:05:04.711 --> 01:05:06.960
<v Speaker 4>people that they weren't getting before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had many,</v>

1451
01:05:06.961 --> 01:05:11.610
<v Speaker 4>many people both on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on my website forum,</v>

1452
01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:12.693
<v Speaker 4>on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on all these different forms of social </v>

1453
01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 4>media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say I had a perception of</v>

1454
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.310
<v Speaker 3>hunters until yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys like Cameron Hanes on Jim Shockey,</v>

1455
01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.920
<v Speaker 3>Steve Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steven know remy warrant.</v>

1456
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:24.754
<v Speaker 3>He's really intelligent people that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about Tim Barnett who can talk </v>

1457
01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:32.170
<v Speaker 3>about these things in a way where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>explain to you their perspective,</v>

1458
01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:35.650
<v Speaker 3>their grew up with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how they've lived their life and</v>

1459
01:05:35.651 --> 01:05:38.440
<v Speaker 3>if you lived your life in a city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make sense to you.</v>

1460
01:05:38.441 --> 01:05:40.150
<v Speaker 3>It seems alien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Watch Bambi,</v>

1461
01:05:40.151 --> 01:05:43.630
<v Speaker 3>you see these Yogi talks to booboo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have conversations.</v>

1462
01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:46.920
<v Speaker 3>Why would you want to shoot one of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>until you,</v>

1463
01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.900
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You venture into that world.</v>

1464
01:05:49.901 --> 01:05:52.240
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're.</v>

1465
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:55.210
<v Speaker 3>We're insulated from it because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>supermarkets,</v>

1466
01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.790
<v Speaker 3>because of this bizarre world we live </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1467
01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:01.030
<v Speaker 3>When we've created these artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures that we think are normal,</v>

1468
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:02.690
<v Speaker 3>these cities and these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1469
01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:03.623
<v Speaker 3>this method of acquiring food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you just run a piece of plastic </v>

1470
01:06:06.911 --> 01:06:09.670
<v Speaker 3>through a machine and you walk away with</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this food?</v>

1471
01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:11.740
<v Speaker 3>It's not healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1472
01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:12.880
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

1473
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:13.953
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you could have sex with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>faceless person where you didn't even </v>

1474
01:06:18.761 --> 01:06:19.594
<v Speaker 3>get to see their face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all you saw was like their body </v>

1475
01:06:21.371 --> 01:06:24.120
<v Speaker 3>from the shoulder down and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you had sex within you.</v>

1476
01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:26.500
<v Speaker 3>You had a kid with that person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you even know that kidney and walk away,</v>

1477
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.700
<v Speaker 3>but I got my needs met.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean almost.</v>

1478
01:06:28.701 --> 01:06:29.534
<v Speaker 3>That's almost what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost what's going on when you're </v>

1479
01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:35.880
<v Speaker 3>acquiring food without ever growing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without planting that seed,</v>

1480
01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:37.013
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not saying you should fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>plant all your food and I'm not saying </v>

1481
01:06:39.461 --> 01:06:41.110
<v Speaker 3>you should only hunt if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat me,</v>

1482
01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:43.600
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is if you could do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1483
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:47.890
<v Speaker 3>it would bring you a little closer to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding where that food comes from</v>

1484
01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:48.903
<v Speaker 3>and it'll give you a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A just a broader view of this world we </v>

1485
01:06:52.721 --> 01:06:57.340
<v Speaker 3>live in and what you're doing by </v>
<v Speaker 3>consuming food you are consuming.</v>

1486
01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:59.410
<v Speaker 3>Whether you consuming salad and here's </v>
<v Speaker 3>another thing,</v>

1487
01:06:59.411 --> 01:07:01.360
<v Speaker 3>vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put this up the other day.</v>

1488
01:07:01.361 --> 01:07:04.150
<v Speaker 3>I was fucking with a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I've trolled.</v>

1489
01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:06.700
<v Speaker 3>People are sending me all this vegan </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

1490
01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:07.534
<v Speaker 3>so I just started trolling them by </v>
<v Speaker 3>sending them all these scientific </v>

1491
01:07:09.911 --> 01:07:13.540
<v Speaker 3>studies about plants and plant </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>

1492
01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:14.733
<v Speaker 3>which is a new form of study or it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a new field of study where they're </v>

1493
01:07:18.491 --> 01:07:19.324
<v Speaker 3>finding out more and more each day that </v>
<v Speaker 3>plants can do calculations that they </v>

1494
01:07:23.351 --> 01:07:26.110
<v Speaker 3>respond to being eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have a.</v>

1495
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:30.760
<v Speaker 3>They have different mechanisms to </v>
<v Speaker 3>discourage predation.</v>

1496
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.713
<v Speaker 3>That's where poisoned plants come from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are communicating with each other </v>

1497
01:07:34.691 --> 01:07:38.350
<v Speaker 3>in some sort of strange way that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>one tree is getting chopped down,</v>

1498
01:07:38.351 --> 01:07:39.184
<v Speaker 3>it's sending signals to other trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's whether it's an in it's own way in </v>

1499
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:46.030
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your reading life,</v>

1500
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:48.160
<v Speaker 3>if you're eating a plant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your eating life,</v>

1501
01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:52.090
<v Speaker 3>if you say that it's okay to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetable life,</v>

1502
01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.300
<v Speaker 3>but it's not okay to eat fish if you say</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay to eat fish,</v>

1503
01:07:55.301 --> 01:07:58.010
<v Speaker 3>but it's not okay to eat animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>

1504
01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:02.520
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing is you're making these</v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre moral judgments and they're,</v>

1505
01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:06.910
<v Speaker 3>they're based on convenience and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them are based on ignorance and</v>

1506
01:08:06.911 --> 01:08:08.290
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't hold up.</v>

1507
01:08:08.291 --> 01:08:11.260
<v Speaker 3>When you start looking at things </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjectively and people say to you,</v>

1508
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:12.820
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you eat your dog?</v>

1509
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to eat my dog.</v>

1510
01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

1511
01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.970
<v Speaker 4>but my dog as a pet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1512
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:20.150
<v Speaker 4>My dog was raised from the time it was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>baby,</v>

1513
01:08:20.151 --> 01:08:22.250
<v Speaker 4>have had it since it was young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to eat it,</v>

1514
01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:23.503
<v Speaker 4>but if someone does have a wild dog and </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat it and it's between that wild dog </v>

1515
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.560
<v Speaker 4>eating them and them eating that wild </v>
<v Speaker 4>dog,</v>

1516
01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:32.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an unfortunate situation,</v>

1517
01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:35.330
<v Speaker 4>but you got to eat that fucking dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1518
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:38.840
<v Speaker 4>Manny Pacquiao is parents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They eat their dog when they were,</v>

1519
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:40.550
<v Speaker 4>when he was starving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you were a kid.</v>

1520
01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:44.450
<v Speaker 4>It was like a really traumatic moment </v>
<v Speaker 4>for him where his family was.</v>

1521
01:08:44.451 --> 01:08:46.520
<v Speaker 4>So there were starving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were so poor.</v>

1522
01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.270
<v Speaker 4>They had to eat their pet dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1523
01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the people would say,</v>

1524
01:08:49.701 --> 01:08:50.720
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not starving.</v>

1525
01:08:50.721 --> 01:08:52.070
<v Speaker 4>Why are you killing animals?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1526
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:53.420
<v Speaker 4>For us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't want to starve.</v>

1527
01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:57.630
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would I like active?</v>

1528
01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.573
<v Speaker 4>What I liked the most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talked about changing the stereotype </v>

1529
01:09:00.351 --> 01:09:01.320
<v Speaker 4>is I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1530
01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:05.750
<v Speaker 4>working as we know workout all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like when people asked me,</v>

1531
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:09.110
<v Speaker 4>why are you working out so hard for </v>
<v Speaker 4>bowhunting?</v>

1532
01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:11.990
<v Speaker 4>And this was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the craziest look,</v>

1533
01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:14.150
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's been the same answer for me for</v>

1534
01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:16.730
<v Speaker 4>years is because I want to be the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the mountains.</v>

1535
01:09:16.731 --> 01:09:19.760
<v Speaker 4>I think that the best that you can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>the best I can be.</v>

1536
01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:20.653
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understood that way more after I went </v>

1537
01:09:21.681 --> 01:09:22.760
<v Speaker 4>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1538
01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:25.010
<v Speaker 4>after I went hunting with you in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Colorado,</v>

1539
01:09:25.011 --> 01:09:25.844
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it more because you're in better </v>

1540
01:09:26.781 --> 01:09:28.910
<v Speaker 4>cardiovascular shape than me and I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 4>good shape.</v>

1541
01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:30.053
<v Speaker 4>You take the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in better shape than the average </v>

1542
01:09:31.431 --> 01:09:33.110
<v Speaker 4>person and I'm not in better shape than </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1543
01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:34.880
<v Speaker 4>You're fucking running ahead of me.</v>

1544
01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this the fuck I can't catch up.</v>

1545
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.863
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's a certain pace that </v>

1546
01:09:39.891 --> 01:09:40.724
<v Speaker 4>you can keep because you run mountains </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time that I'm just not capable </v>

1547
01:09:43.941 --> 01:09:47.030
<v Speaker 4>of keeping right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It made me up my cardio and a big time,</v>

1548
01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.073
<v Speaker 4>big time way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I came back from that hunt was the </v>

1549
01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.680
<v Speaker 4>first thing I started doing is really up</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my cardio.</v>

1550
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:52.860
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

1551
01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:54.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we had a real,</v>

1552
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:57.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real life example of that.</v>

1553
01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.170
<v Speaker 4>What I like as much as that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean not,</v>

1554
01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:01.093
<v Speaker 4>not as much as that because I love being</v>
<v Speaker 4>with somebody who is successful and who </v>

1555
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:06.860
<v Speaker 4>experiences a hunt and I'm able to share</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that.</v>

1556
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:09.230
<v Speaker 4>And that's a whole nother thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I didn't,</v>

1557
01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:10.123
<v Speaker 4>I didn't kill anything but I was part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your hunt and that meant as much to me </v>

1558
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:15.610
<v Speaker 4>is me getting my animals.</v>

1559
01:10:15.610 --> 01:10:18.830
<v Speaker 4>So we have the whole comradery and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1560
01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.870
<v Speaker 4>it's not every man for himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1561
01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.610
<v Speaker 4>we're out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're working together,</v>

1562
01:10:22.611 --> 01:10:23.444
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we want to be successful in harvest </v>

1563
01:10:25.011 --> 01:10:26.780
<v Speaker 4>meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take me home to our families.</v>

1564
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:30.950
<v Speaker 4>But what I like is people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>inspired,</v>

1565
01:10:30.951 --> 01:10:31.784
<v Speaker 4>they're not with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they see the training and they're </v>

1566
01:10:33.681 --> 01:10:35.930
<v Speaker 4>inspired to up their game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe they're,</v>

1567
01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:40.190
<v Speaker 4>maybe they won't run a 200 mile race or </v>
<v Speaker 4>run 10 miles a day or do any of this,</v>

1568
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.890
<v Speaker 4>but maybe they'll run one mile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1569
01:10:42.891 --> 01:10:47.390
<v Speaker 4>And maybe it's making.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My whole thing is if you're not making,</v>

1570
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:50.180
<v Speaker 4>if you're not making a positive impact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's your point?</v>

1571
01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:51.523
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to make a positive impact on </v>

1572
01:10:53.151 --> 01:10:53.984
<v Speaker 4>people and that's why I love social </v>
<v Speaker 4>media and sharing what I do and </v>

1573
01:10:56.751 --> 01:10:58.460
<v Speaker 4>hopefully it can inspire others to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>

1574
01:10:58.461 --> 01:11:00.200
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's my motivation daily.</v>

1575
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:01.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a great.</v>

1576
01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.090

<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1577
01:11:05.091 --> 01:11:05.924
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a great venue or a great a </v>

1578
01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.020
<v Speaker 4>vehicle through social media that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>exist before.</v>

1579
01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Inspire people and I am constantly</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1581
01:11:15.301 --> 01:11:16.750

<v Speaker 3>Deaf fucking guy is up every morning.</v>

1587
01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:29.484
<v Speaker 3>If he's got to work at seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's up at four and he's in the gym and </v>

1588
01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:33.203
<v Speaker 3>they'll show a photo of his alarm clock </v>
<v Speaker 3>going off and it'll show a photo of him </v>

1589
01:11:36.301 --> 01:11:40.530
<v Speaker 3>in the gym making crazy faces where it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>folded sweat and it makes me realize I'm</v>

1590
01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:42.960
<v Speaker 3>a lazy bitch and it makes me want to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and work out.</v>

1591

<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

<v Speaker 3>real life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you the conversation </v>

1626
01:13:07.021 --> 01:13:07.854
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be like it is in these one </v>
<v Speaker 3>sided debates or these one sided </v>

1627
01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:12.800
<v Speaker 3>broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone makes a blogs,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they're negative,</v>

1631
01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:24.270
<v Speaker 3>it's a very ineffective form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication and negative videos.</v>

1632
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:25.223
<v Speaker 3>They're very ineffective because this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a not a real conversation like the way </v>

1633
01:13:29.911 --> 01:13:33.300
<v Speaker 3>people are supposed to communicate is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you and I talking to each other,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even fucking podcasts and a lot of ways.</v>

1635
01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.700
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the things why people get </v>
<v Speaker 3>angry because a,</v>

1636

<v Speaker 3>we would talk,</v>

1640
01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:49.650

<v Speaker 3>Should we take a few calls?</v>

1641

<v Speaker 3>We don't do Colin's thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>people that think they're,</v>

1651
01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a new world we're living in this</v>

1652
01:14:17.561 --> 01:14:18.394
<v Speaker 3>world of social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this world where anybody can start a </v>

1653
01:14:20.861 --> 01:14:25.861
<v Speaker 3>blog or anybody can start putting things</v>
<v Speaker 3>up on twitter or facebook or whatever.</v>

1654
01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a new world and we got to learn how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to navigate it better.</v>

<v Speaker 2>happen in my life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

1661
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:39.303

<v Speaker 2>as positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm overcoming all sorts of hurdles all </v>

<v Speaker 2>that waited a long time to come up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>share their story,</v>

1668
01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.210
<v Speaker 2>share their story about losing weight or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the success they've had or the,</v>

1669
01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:08.770

<v Speaker 3>this is inspirational and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive and and through you,</v>

1710
01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:52.323
<v Speaker 3>you meet me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use my what I've created this vehicle </v>

1711
01:16:57.131 --> 01:17:01.630
<v Speaker 3>of social media and podcasting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcast it more and then all these new</v>

1712
01:17:01.631 --> 01:17:04.370
<v Speaker 3>positive branches spread out from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>

1713
01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:05.900
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

1714
01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:08.290
<v Speaker 3>It's so much better than shitting on </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1715
01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.000
<v Speaker 3>It is so much better than negativity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1716
01:17:11.001 --> 01:17:14.210
<v Speaker 3>when I had these guys from cowspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and these guys are vegans,</v>

1717
01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.073
<v Speaker 3>they're vegans who made a documentary </v>
<v Speaker 3>about veganism and the powerful message </v>

1718
01:17:18.231 --> 01:17:21.110
<v Speaker 3>that they had about the anti factory </v>
<v Speaker 3>farming message.</v>

1719
01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:24.320
<v Speaker 3>I had a great conversation with them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

1720
01:17:24.321 --> 01:17:25.154
<v Speaker 3>I truly believe that most of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are making angry posts on </v>

1721
01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:30.493
<v Speaker 3>twitter or angry videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I sat down with them and had </v>

1722
01:17:33.051 --> 01:17:35.630
<v Speaker 3>conversations with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be positive conversations.</v>

1723
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:39.770
<v Speaker 3>Whether we agree or disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a very well thought out point.</v>

1724
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:40.783
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine they have a very well </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought out point to where they're </v>

1725
01:17:42.861 --> 01:17:44.270
<v Speaker 3>coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bad thing.</v>

1726
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:47.430
<v Speaker 3>It's just this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something is lost in this,</v>

1727
01:17:47.650 --> 01:17:52.650
<v Speaker 3>the broadcasting of this message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a real problem that we're</v>

1728
01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:53.534
<v Speaker 3>all sort of navigating in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that somehow or another the messages </v>

1729
01:17:58.521 --> 01:18:01.360
<v Speaker 3>that get the most reaction or a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>times the negative.</v>

1730
01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:02.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1731
01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.450
<v Speaker 3>I know well On,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1732
01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:08.480
<v Speaker 3>in regard to hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you like archery?</v>

1733
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:12.770
<v Speaker 3>Do you like archery better than rifle?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hunting definitely is more challenging.</v>

1734
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:15.860
<v Speaker 3>It's more in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's there's,</v>

1735
01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:18.800
<v Speaker 3>there's a book called Zen and the art of</v>
<v Speaker 3>archery.</v>

1736
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:20.623
<v Speaker 3>It was a book that I need to read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody tells me I need to read this </v>

1737
01:18:22.791 --> 01:18:23.624
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's something about archery </v>

1738
01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.170
<v Speaker 3>itself like today when we're practicing </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting at that rubber elk.</v>

1739
01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something about the.</v>

1740
01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:34.593
<v Speaker 3>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a moment when you were at full </v>

1741
01:18:38.301 --> 01:18:43.301
<v Speaker 3>draw and you're about to release that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arrow where everything is still.</v>

1742
01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:48.110
<v Speaker 3>Everything is calm and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about anything else.</v>

1743
01:18:48.111 --> 01:18:48.944
<v Speaker 3>You can't other than releasing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect Arrow because it requires so </v>

1744
01:18:51.741 --> 01:18:56.741
<v Speaker 3>much concentration and so much focus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was completely unexpected to me.</v>

1745
01:18:56.990 --> 01:19:00.440
<v Speaker 3>When I first started practicing archery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was going to be like,</v>

1746
01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.260
<v Speaker 3>like shooting a rifle requires a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>focus.</v>

1747
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:04.123
<v Speaker 3>It requires trigger discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to like steady the gun arrests </v>

1748
01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.060
<v Speaker 3>do you have to look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1749
01:19:08.061 --> 01:19:11.210
<v Speaker 3>really stay still and squeeze that </v>
<v Speaker 3>trigger and there's problems with that.</v>

1750
01:19:11.210 --> 01:19:12.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get the shakes,</v>

1751
01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:13.543
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get nerves and even at a target </v>

1752
01:19:14.721 --> 01:19:15.271
<v Speaker 3>range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1753
01:19:15.271 --> 01:19:19.880
<v Speaker 3>you know the gun's going to make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>kick and say you get paid a flint chase.</v>

1754
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:22.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing like archery archery's that</v>

1755
01:19:22.431 --> 01:19:23.630
<v Speaker 3>times 100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1756
01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:25.310
<v Speaker 3>it requires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no resting,</v>

1757
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:27.050
<v Speaker 3>there's no rifle rest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1758
01:19:27.051 --> 01:19:32.051
<v Speaker 3>you have to hold your arm steady and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of movement that you make because</v>

1759
01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.290
<v Speaker 3>the arrows only going at the most 300 </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet a second,</v>

1760
01:19:36.291 --> 01:19:37.970
<v Speaker 3>3:50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've got some super bone,</v>

1761
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.300
<v Speaker 3>a light Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between that and a rifle.</v>

1762
01:19:40.301 --> 01:19:42.140
<v Speaker 3>Six thousand feet a second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says arrive.</v>

1763
01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.153
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So any movement translates to a giant </v>

1764
01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:49.480
<v Speaker 3>amount of movement at the end where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrowheads.</v>

1765
01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just as a discipline,</v>

1766
01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:54.830
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cleansing.</v>

1767
01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:57.860
<v Speaker 3>Like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love after a long day,</v>

1768
01:19:57.861 --> 01:19:59.270
<v Speaker 3>I do a lot of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1769
01:19:59.271 --> 01:20:01.520
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of things going on in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>

1770
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have between comedy and podcasting and</v>

1771
01:20:04.881 --> 01:20:08.310
<v Speaker 3>the UFC and family and the business </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit</v>

1772
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:09.203
<v Speaker 4>and it's like so much bullshit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many different things in my </v>

1773
01:20:11.671 --> 01:20:16.250
<v Speaker 4>mind that for me would archery is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is like,</v>

1774
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:17.183
<v Speaker 4>this is like ultimate meditation is </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimate focus point where I draw back </v>

1775
01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:26.780
<v Speaker 4>and I see that target and then I release</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Arrow and then when that,</v>

1776
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.670
<v Speaker 4>when that Arrow goes right into that </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullseye,</v>

1777
01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:30.653
<v Speaker 4>like we were shooting that rubber elk </v>
<v Speaker 4>today and when you nail one it gets </v>

1778
01:20:32.851 --> 01:20:35.380
<v Speaker 4>right in that small circle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1779
01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:37.710
<v Speaker 4>it's a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>satisfying feeling.</v>

1780
01:20:37.711 --> 01:20:38.544
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's that moment that in the impact and </v>

1781
01:20:40.561 --> 01:20:42.360
<v Speaker 4>seeing where it hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1782
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:45.210
<v Speaker 4>and then so that's just the process of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1783
01:20:45.211 --> 01:20:49.020
<v Speaker 4>But then when that happens because what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are we doing that?</v>

1784
01:20:49.021 --> 01:20:50.610
<v Speaker 4>We're doing that to prepare for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt.</v>

1785
01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:51.553
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when all that work pays off on the </v>

1786
01:20:54.121 --> 01:20:55.890
<v Speaker 4>hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

1787
01:20:55.891 --> 01:20:57.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1788
01:20:57.541 --> 01:20:58.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to,</v>

1789
01:20:59.060 --> 01:20:59.893
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see some videos and I see people </v>

1790
01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:05.040
<v Speaker 4>running around and tackling each other </v>
<v Speaker 4>and doing all that.</v>

1791
01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.940
<v Speaker 4>I never feel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always feel like I'm,</v>

1792
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.863
<v Speaker 4>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess blessed are thankful for the </v>

1793
01:21:11.401 --> 01:21:16.401
<v Speaker 4>moment and mostly thankful that I made </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's very difficult happen.</v>

1794
01:21:18.150 --> 01:21:21.440
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I achieved that goal and it's a,</v>

1795
01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:23.573
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1796
01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.320
<v Speaker 4>it's so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just,</v>

1797
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.550
<v Speaker 4>that's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1798
01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:29.610
<v Speaker 4>I like people to shoot a bow because as </v>
<v Speaker 4>you said,</v>

1799
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:30.473
<v Speaker 4>shooting a bow is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is centering and it zen like I guess if </v>

1800
01:21:33.871 --> 01:21:35.790
<v Speaker 4>I even know what zen means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if I do,</v>

1801
01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:37.980
<v Speaker 4>but it is relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

1802
01:21:37.981 --> 01:21:40.220
<v Speaker 4>requires an amazing focus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1803
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:41.183
<v Speaker 4>so that's a good start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you can block everything out </v>

1804
01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:45.024
<v Speaker 4>because you say you have to block </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything out to make a good shot on </v>

1805
01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:48.900
<v Speaker 4>that target,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the foam rubber,</v>

1806
01:21:49.330 --> 01:21:51.510
<v Speaker 4>the reinhart elk today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1807
01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:56.590
<v Speaker 4>on an animal when the animal's moving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's different factors that at,</v>

1808
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:58.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in line,</v>

1809
01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:59.183
<v Speaker 4>he's bugling your heart's going a </v>
<v Speaker 4>million miles an hour and then when he </v>

1810
01:22:01.861 --> 01:22:04.920
<v Speaker 4>can do it there and then where you take </v>
<v Speaker 4>that up,</v>

1811
01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:05.754
<v Speaker 4>another level is hunting the mounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if your sheep hunting and then you </v>

1812
01:22:10.171 --> 01:22:14.130
<v Speaker 4>have it's such a physical and then it </v>
<v Speaker 4>could be dangerous also.</v>

1813
01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:15.023
<v Speaker 4>So you have so many things and when that</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens on something like a sheep and </v>

1814
01:22:18.121 --> 01:22:22.170
<v Speaker 4>the sheep mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is to me life changing.</v>

1815
01:22:22.690 --> 01:22:25.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean experiences like that have made </v>
<v Speaker 4>me who I am.</v>

1816
01:22:25.711 --> 01:22:27.690
<v Speaker 4>When people say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1817
01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:30.390
<v Speaker 4>bowhunting has made you who?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1818
01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:35.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean because coming through and crunch</v>
<v Speaker 4>time like that is more pressure and more</v>

1819
01:22:36.241 --> 01:22:41.241
<v Speaker 4>accomplishment than anything I'll ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>do in normal life because it's just that</v>

1820
01:22:42.151 --> 01:22:42.984
<v Speaker 4>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll through difficult things are </v>

1821
01:22:44.311 --> 01:22:46.650
<v Speaker 4>character,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets challenged,</v>

1822
01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.680
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

1823
01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.513
<v Speaker 4>our will and our focus get tested and </v>
<v Speaker 4>through those tests and through this </v>

1824
01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:58.290
<v Speaker 4>very difficult task,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you learn more about yourself,</v>

1825
01:22:58.291 --> 01:23:00.690
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You learn more about your ability,</v>

1826
01:23:00.691 --> 01:23:02.500
<v Speaker 4>you learn more about your faults,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1827
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 4>you learn about your weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you learn about your and you learn</v>

1828
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.980
<v Speaker 1>how to shore up those weaknesses and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

1829
01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:10.083
<v Speaker 1>and that's why people who have never </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced it don't understand your </v>

1830
01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:13.534
<v Speaker 1>dedication to fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand your dedication to </v>

1831
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.860
<v Speaker 1>making sure you're in the best possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape you can be.</v>

1832
01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:18.933
<v Speaker 1>Also that your your archery practice is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the best it can be so that when </v>

1833
01:23:22.451 --> 01:23:25.330
<v Speaker 1>that moment of truth arises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can steady your nerves.</v>

1834
01:23:25.331 --> 01:23:28.960
<v Speaker 1>You can keep it all together and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>execute and that execution,</v>

1835
01:23:28.961 --> 01:23:29.794
<v Speaker 1>that that is an insanely difficult tasks</v>
<v Speaker 1>that very few people have to ever do </v>

1836
01:23:33.551 --> 01:23:38.170
<v Speaker 1>anything in life that's remotely as </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult as shoot an Arrow at an elk.</v>

1837
01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:39.063
<v Speaker 1>It's 50 yards away and wash that arrows </v>
<v Speaker 1>sink right into the vitals and realize </v>

1838
01:23:42.491 --> 01:23:46.450
<v Speaker 1>that you've done it and realize that now</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have enough meat for a year for your</v>

1839
01:23:46.451 --> 01:23:47.980
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one animal,</v>

1840
01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:51.460
<v Speaker 1>one animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and are we quantifying life?</v>

1841
01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we saying that you know this,</v>

1842
01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:56.680
<v Speaker 1>that all animals are worth something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will.</v>

1843
01:23:56.770 --> 01:24:00.430
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every pasta bowl that you eat,</v>

1844
01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:03.340
<v Speaker 1>you eat a bowl of pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That pasta comes from grain.</v>

1845
01:24:03.341 --> 01:24:08.341
<v Speaker 1>That grain most likely was chopped from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a field from a combine that is 100 yards</v>

1846
01:24:08.351 --> 01:24:09.184
<v Speaker 1>long that it's indiscriminate and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>running over everything as we were </v>

1847
01:24:11.351 --> 01:24:12.184
<v Speaker 1>talking about running over mice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rabbits and fonts and ground nesting </v>

1848
01:24:14.981 --> 01:24:15.814
<v Speaker 1>birds and anything else that might be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>its path and there's a lot of death </v>

1849
01:24:17.861 --> 01:24:20.500
<v Speaker 1>involved in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so every bowl of pasta that you eat,</v>

1850
01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:24.190
<v Speaker 1>even though you feel like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely immune and we're a completely</v>

1851
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.120
<v Speaker 1>free of any responsibility of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not true,</v>

1852
01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:33.190
<v Speaker 1>but one elk with one arrow feed you for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>

1853
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:34.340
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1854
01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Just I have to fucking commercial </v>
<v Speaker 1>freezers in the back.</v>

1855
01:24:36.431 --> 01:24:37.264
<v Speaker 1>They're filled with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave Gary Clarke the musician the </v>

1856
01:24:38.921 --> 01:24:40.690
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came to pounds of elk,</v>

1857
01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:41.830
<v Speaker 1>like take this home and cook it.</v>

1858
01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:42.853
<v Speaker 1>They'll bird the other day said he sent </v>
<v Speaker 1>me this text message that he made elk </v>

1859
01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Chili.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave him some advice.</v>

1860
01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.210
<v Speaker 1>I give people meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1861
01:24:48.211 --> 01:24:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

1862
01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:50.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Chris Ryan sent me this </v>

1863
01:24:52.361 --> 01:24:54.400
<v Speaker 1>photograph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Dunkin actually sit with Chris.</v>

1864
01:24:54.401 --> 01:24:55.234
<v Speaker 1>Ryan did too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Duncan sent me this photograph of </v>

1865
01:24:56.411 --> 01:24:58.180
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his girlfriend made meatballs,</v>

1866
01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:00.910
<v Speaker 1>elk meat balls and they were sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>there eating with their friends.</v>

1867
01:25:00.911 --> 01:25:04.780
<v Speaker 1>They had a friend over for dinner with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some meat from an animal.</v>

1868
01:25:04.781 --> 01:25:05.700
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1869
01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:08.740
<v Speaker 1>You're given it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1870
01:25:08.741 --> 01:25:10.060
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fantastic.</v>

1871
01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:10.894
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful warm feeling and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>connects you in some weird primal way </v>

1872
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:18.040
<v Speaker 1>that we're immune to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not getting it anymore.</v>

1873
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:20.000
<v Speaker 1>We're not getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

1874
01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:22.240
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people asked why?</v>

1875
01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Because I've always been drawn to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to wild places.</v>

1876
01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big wild places and people ask,</v>

1877
01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:30.220
<v Speaker 1>how did that start?</v>

1878
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:31.623
<v Speaker 1>For me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How that started was I didn't come from </v>

1879
01:25:34.091 --> 01:25:35.370
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have,</v>

1880
01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:36.213
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just a guy who couldn't even </v>

1881
01:25:38.741 --> 01:25:42.310
<v Speaker 1>afford an elk license for was $25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't afford it,</v>

1882
01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.310
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I felt like,</v>

1883
01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:47.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1884
01:25:47.471 --> 01:25:48.304
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel special in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel like I had any advantage </v>

1885
01:25:51.461 --> 01:25:53.830
<v Speaker 1>over anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt lower class essentially,</v>

1886
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:58.270
<v Speaker 1>but in the wilderness when I went there </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be the richest guy in the world.</v>

1887
01:25:58.271 --> 01:25:59.950
<v Speaker 1>There could be the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>businessman,</v>

1888
01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:03.890
<v Speaker 1>but if he was there and I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden the playing was equal</v>

1889
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.910
<v Speaker 2>and if I'm in better shape than him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm above him in the mountains.</v>

1890
01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:08.893
<v Speaker 2>I can be somebody I can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can be special and that's how our </v>

1891
01:26:13.371 --> 01:26:14.204
<v Speaker 2>prepare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I liked it back there is </v>

1892
01:26:15.891 --> 01:26:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have to conform to society's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1893
01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.730
<v Speaker 2>this guy's an a list or you are nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1894
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.863
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was always drawn me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because it was a level playing </v>

1895
01:26:25.821 --> 01:26:30.080
<v Speaker 2>field for me and if I came in more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a beast than somebody else,</v>

1896
01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.660
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden I was the guy back </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1897
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.863
<v Speaker 2>That's what I did and it was just like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have anything and I thought this </v>

1898
01:26:36.711 --> 01:26:40.550
<v Speaker 2>is the only way I'm going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieved.</v>

1899
01:26:40.551 --> 01:26:41.610
<v Speaker 2>My dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1900
01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.390
<v Speaker 2>get to get to where I can be in control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1901
01:26:44.391 --> 01:26:46.480
<v Speaker 2>it gives you an understanding</v>

1902
01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:47.353
<v Speaker 3>of that environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That environment really doesn't care </v>

1903
01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.780
<v Speaker 3>that you make six figures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't care that you drive a bmw.</v>

1904
01:26:53.781 --> 01:26:54.890
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't care that you have a nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

1905
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:56.180
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't care.</v>

1906
01:26:56.181 --> 01:26:57.014
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of ways like I gravitate </v>

1907
01:26:59.871 --> 01:27:01.420
<v Speaker 3>towards absolutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1908
01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:03.410
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the reasons why I like </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts.</v>

1909
01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:07.310
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons I like pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that ball drops in the whole.</v>

1910
01:27:07.311 --> 01:27:08.760
<v Speaker 3>It's because he made it dropped in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hole.</v>

1911
01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:11.060
<v Speaker 3>If you miss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you miss and there's no if,</v>

1912
01:27:11.061 --> 01:27:11.811
<v Speaker 3>ands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or buts about it.</v>

1913
01:27:11.811 --> 01:27:16.760
<v Speaker 3>It's an absolute thing and I think a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of ways hunting is similar in that way.</v>

1914
01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:19.610
<v Speaker 3>I get doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're playing pool and you're a</v>

1915
01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:23.000
<v Speaker 3>millionaire and you're playing against a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy who was $2 in his bank,</v>

1916
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:24.620
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The balls don't know this.</v>

1917
01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:29.450
<v Speaker 3>They don't care and it's the same in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>woods when you were out there and you're</v>

1918
01:27:29.451 --> 01:27:30.200
<v Speaker 3>in that environment.</v>

1919
01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.033
<v Speaker 3>That is an absolute environment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolute also in the fact that if you </v>

1920
01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:36.960
<v Speaker 3>fuckin zig when you should have zagged </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you run across a sow,</v>

1921
01:27:36.961 --> 01:27:39.980
<v Speaker 3>grizzly and her cubs and she just </v>
<v Speaker 3>decides today's your day.</v>

1922
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:41.390
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>

1923
01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:44.060
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck if you host the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC,</v>

1924
01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.070
<v Speaker 3>that bear doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know,</v>

1925
01:27:46.071 --> 01:27:46.904
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1926
01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:47.773
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the CEO of your company and </v>

1927
01:27:49.041 --> 01:27:50.480
<v Speaker 3>you're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't care.</v>

1928
01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:53.990
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wilderness is its own world.</v>

1929
01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:55.880
<v Speaker 3>It has its own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an unforgiving.</v>

1930
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.770
<v Speaker 3>It's unforgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's absolute.</v>

1931
01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:58.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like that Arrow hitting the artery </v>

1932
01:28:01.341 --> 01:28:04.450
<v Speaker 3>or hitting the vitals of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an elk I give you.</v>

1933
01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.470
<v Speaker 3>If it doesn't hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't hit.</v>

1934
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:08.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to go where it's supposed to go</v>

1935
01:28:08.601 --> 01:28:09.950
<v Speaker 3>or are you fucked up?</v>

1936
01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:12.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there there's a,</v>

1937
01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:13.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is real.</v>

1938
01:28:13.591 --> 01:28:14.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1939
01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:17.760
<v Speaker 2>that's not just in this talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not talk where he zig zagged.</v>

1940
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1941
01:28:20.821 --> 01:28:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Roy Roy story is a perfect example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that front and explained who roy is.</v>

1942
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roy is,</v>

1943
01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:29.393
<v Speaker 2>he's who got me started in bow hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he is the toughest man I've ever </v>

1944
01:28:33.601 --> 01:28:34.434
<v Speaker 2>met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've shared more experiences with Roy </v>

1945
01:28:36.691 --> 01:28:39.060
<v Speaker 2>and the mountains these life defining </v>
<v Speaker 2>type experiences that,</v>

1946
01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:41.340
<v Speaker 2>that we've talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1947
01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:45.960
<v Speaker 2>the bond we've created together has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>over a handful of experiences,</v>

1948
01:28:46.110 --> 01:28:46.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

1949
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:47.703
<v Speaker 2>you realize when you're out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfort zone like that and when you're </v>

1950
01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:54.630
<v Speaker 2>both so committed to a pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those bonds formed quickly,</v>

1951
01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:57.420
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we've formed a strong bond over a</v>

1952
01:28:57.421 --> 01:29:00.240
<v Speaker 2>handful of experiences over a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years will really.</v>

1953
01:29:00.241 --> 01:29:01.530
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1954
01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went to high school together,</v>

1955
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:06.660
<v Speaker 2>we started bowhunting as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think 18,</v>

1956
01:29:06.661 --> 01:29:10.830
<v Speaker 2>19 years old and had hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

1957
01:29:10.831 --> 01:29:11.664
<v Speaker 2>life changing life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defining experiences together over the </v>

1958
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.750
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1959
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:20.260
<v Speaker 2>So our bond naturally was like brothers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1960
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:21.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1961
01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:25.230
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when everybody doubted me,</v>

1962
01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:29.880
<v Speaker 2>when I was growing up and doubted my </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream of ever becoming anything he never</v>

1963
01:29:29.881 --> 01:29:31.170
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always,</v>

1964
01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:34.740
<v Speaker 2>he was always the guy that believed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1965
01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this year of sheep hunting,</v>

1966
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:38.783
<v Speaker 2>he was up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she punted where we had sheep hunted </v>

1967
01:29:40.891 --> 01:29:42.990
<v Speaker 2>before together and I killed a ram and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1968
01:29:42.991 --> 01:29:43.824
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1969
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:46.020
<v Speaker 2>it's a tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult,</v>

1970
01:29:46.021 --> 01:29:46.854
<v Speaker 2>dangerous hunt and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's more prepared or he was more </v>

1971
01:29:50.131 --> 01:29:52.290
<v Speaker 2>prepared for hunting like that than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody in the world.</v>

1972
01:29:52.291 --> 01:29:53.124
<v Speaker 2>He's done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's done it as much as anyone that I </v>

1973
01:29:55.291 --> 01:29:58.080
<v Speaker 2>know and I've been successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's killed,</v>

1974
01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:03.140
<v Speaker 2>had killed nine rams and he one misstep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fell and died,</v>

1975
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:05.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prime of his life,</v>

1976
01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:09.780
<v Speaker 2>essentially 49 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

1977
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:13.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a father,</v>

1978
01:30:13.051 --> 01:30:15.060
<v Speaker 2>husband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three kids,</v>

1979
01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:20.330
<v Speaker 2>somebody who even the toughest Alaska </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunters looked up to one step gone.</v>

1980
01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:25.050
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1981
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:26.031
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1982
01:30:26.031 --> 01:30:28.310
<v Speaker 2>it's not just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say zig zagged,</v>

1983
01:30:28.311 --> 01:30:30.360
<v Speaker 2>there's risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

1984
01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:32.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to it,</v>

1985
01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:36.090
<v Speaker 2>it just puts everything in perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the allure to it.</v>

1986
01:30:36.091 --> 01:30:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Because I can speak for Roy and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know we,</v>

1987
01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:40.393
<v Speaker 2>we always have known about the risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was part of the draw is we wanted </v>

1988
01:30:45.061 --> 01:30:50.010
<v Speaker 2>to go where nobody else wanted to go or </v>
<v Speaker 2>do things that nobody else wanted to do.</v>

1989
01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:52.530
<v Speaker 2>That was the only thing that made us </v>
<v Speaker 2>different and it goes back.</v>

1990
01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:54.300
<v Speaker 2>That made us different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1991
01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:57.100
<v Speaker 2>and it goes back to the level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the playing field.</v>

1992
01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we felt like,</v>

1993
01:30:58.560 --> 01:30:59.393
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we would go and do the hardest hunts </v>

1994
01:31:00.541 --> 01:31:03.870
<v Speaker 2>and the toughest conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody else would want to do that,</v>

1995
01:31:03.871 --> 01:31:04.704
<v Speaker 2>but we would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden we were calling the </v>

1996
01:31:06.781 --> 01:31:09.080
<v Speaker 2>shots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't call the shots,</v>

1997
01:31:09.100 --> 01:31:11.010
<v Speaker 2>the mountain calls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shots and all that.</v>

1998
01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.113
<v Speaker 2>That hunt the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One at Roy fell and he died and it's a </v>

1999
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:18.930
<v Speaker 2>file 700 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2000
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:19.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2001
01:31:19.651 --> 01:31:20.700
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2002
01:31:20.701 --> 01:31:25.701
<v Speaker 2>that where he fell just tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unforgiving sheep country.</v>

2003
01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:27.570
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2004
01:31:27.571 --> 01:31:30.000
<v Speaker 2>once you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you start going there,</v>

2005
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:32.280
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2006
01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:35.520
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the most dangerous hunts </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheep.</v>

2007
01:31:35.521 --> 01:31:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2008
01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.280
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2009
01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:40.533
<v Speaker 2>on that hunt specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give 100 tags and a lot of times </v>

2010
01:31:44.071 --> 01:31:44.904
<v Speaker 2>there's this one sheep killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that difficult in and I think 40 </v>

2011
01:31:48.871 --> 01:31:49.704
<v Speaker 2>percent of the people never even go </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the weather because of the </v>

2012
01:31:51.841 --> 01:31:52.674
<v Speaker 2>conditions because it's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they draw the tag and don't even get </v>

2013
01:31:55.381 --> 01:31:56.720
<v Speaker 2>up the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a.</v>

2014
01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:59.320
<v Speaker 2>That was the case with you when you went</v>
<v Speaker 2>up there?</v>

2015
01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Grizzly hunting,</v>

2016
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.870
<v Speaker 4>you were supposed to go sheep hunting as</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2017
01:32:01.871 --> 01:32:02.710
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:04.340
<v Speaker 4>Well now it's moose hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Moose Hunt.</v>

2019
01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:07.180
<v Speaker 4>We were going to do a moose sheep Combo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's so much.</v>

2020
01:32:07.181 --> 01:32:08.014
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we couldn't even get to sheep country </v>

2021
01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.310
<v Speaker 4>and that was a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to go sheep hunting.</v>

2022
01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:13.990
<v Speaker 4>And that was with Roy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was with Roy.</v>

2023
01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:15.280
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we had,</v>

2024
01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:16.293
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an amazing moose hunt together and I </v>

2025
01:32:18.191 --> 01:32:21.070
<v Speaker 4>killed a nice big bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2026
01:32:21.071 --> 01:32:25.360
<v Speaker 4>we just had just a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just another epic adventure,</v>

2027
01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:26.680
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2028
01:32:26.681 --> 01:32:27.514
<v Speaker 4>a haunt that maybe a handful of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>would want to do because we were so far </v>

2029
01:32:30.911 --> 01:32:32.160
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2030
01:32:32.170 --> 01:32:37.170
<v Speaker 4>miles back and had to haul a moose out </v>
<v Speaker 4>over a mountain in the snow.</v>

2031
01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:39.040
<v Speaker 4>A very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

2032
01:32:39.250 --> 01:32:40.360
<v Speaker 4>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh.</v>

2033
01:32:40.450 --> 01:32:42.370
<v Speaker 4>But the ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was just,</v>

2034
01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:44.890
<v Speaker 4>it was perfect because it's our last </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt together.</v>

2035
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:50.020
<v Speaker 4>He died two weeks later and that hunt </v>
<v Speaker 4>and capsulated everything about us,</v>

2036
01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:50.980
<v Speaker 4>it was just hard.</v>

2037
01:32:51.010 --> 01:32:54.220
<v Speaker 4>It was miserable and it was rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2038
01:32:54.670 --> 01:32:55.503
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we achieved success were not very many </v>

2039
01:32:58.271 --> 01:33:00.940
<v Speaker 4>people would have and we did it together</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2040
01:33:02.170 --> 01:33:03.070
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2041
01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:05.680
<v Speaker 4>and then two weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>years was his sheep hunting.</v>

2042
01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:07.113
<v Speaker 4>There was an iconic photo that I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was forever going to define you from </v>

2043
01:33:11.051 --> 01:33:11.884
<v Speaker 4>that hunt with you with a big cut in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your face and blood streaming down your </v>

2044
01:33:14.501 --> 01:33:16.810
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you sent it to me while you were out</v>

2045
01:33:16.811 --> 01:33:17.460
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2046
01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:18.970
<v Speaker 4>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're saying we haven't,</v>

2047
01:33:19.150 --> 01:33:20.610
<v Speaker 4>we haven't gotten one yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2048
01:33:20.710 --> 01:33:21.543
<v Speaker 4>We're out here hustling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's this photo of you looking </v>

2049
01:33:25.210 --> 01:33:28.390
<v Speaker 4>grizzled is fuck with blood coming down </v>
<v Speaker 4>your face.</v>

2050
01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:30.140
<v Speaker 4>Snow in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2051
01:33:30.250 --> 01:33:31.083
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2052
01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:32.290
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2053
01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:35.920
<v Speaker 4>that's Cameron Hanes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

2054
01:33:35.921 --> 01:33:36.754
<v Speaker 4>Because in enrolling it would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would always say we can make an easy </v>

2055
01:33:40.631 --> 01:33:43.180
<v Speaker 4>hunt hard because we want it to be hard.</v>

2056
01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:47.680
<v Speaker 4>But you went into an area where very few</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were having success and even with</v>

2057
01:33:47.681 --> 01:33:49.420
<v Speaker 4>rifles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going deep,</v>

2058
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:51.820
<v Speaker 4>deep into area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a rifle area,</v>

2059
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:52.833
<v Speaker 4>so that means you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hunter had a different size of animal </v>

2060
01:33:56.141 --> 01:33:59.740
<v Speaker 4>that was legal if you're hunting with a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're hunting in this area,</v>

2061
01:33:59.741 --> 01:34:02.440
<v Speaker 4>it was a rifle area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had to be a little bigger so I had to be</v>

2062
01:34:02.441 --> 01:34:04.840
<v Speaker 4>15 inches wide but had to have for Brow </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tine switch.</v>

2063
01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:06.220
<v Speaker 4>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2064
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:07.623
<v Speaker 4>you're making it harder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we were there and there in the rifle </v>

2065
01:34:09.581 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 4>area and we got it done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>

2066
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:15.160
<v Speaker 4>it was the hunt that it was a hunt that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what we love.</v>

2067
01:34:15.161 --> 01:34:18.700
<v Speaker 4>We loved hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just loved the test.</v>

2068
01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:19.593
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you go out there and there's a </v>

2069
01:34:19.871 --> 01:34:22.510
<v Speaker 4>bowhunter have different standards in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>rifle hunter.</v>

2070
01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.353
<v Speaker 4>Like if you were there with a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you have to have shot a bigger </v>

2071
01:34:25.061 --> 01:34:25.480
<v Speaker 4>bowl?</v>

2072
01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:26.230
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was I,</v>

2073
01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:28.450
<v Speaker 4>I went to the bigger area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to the big area.</v>

2074
01:34:28.690 --> 01:34:30.370
<v Speaker 4>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the bowl area,</v>

2075
01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:34.000
<v Speaker 4>it only has to have three brown times </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Moose in the rifle or it had to have</v>

2076
01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:35.440
<v Speaker 4>four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I had to find one with four.</v>

2077
01:34:35.441 --> 01:34:37.220
<v Speaker 4>Well mine had five on one side for him </v>
<v Speaker 4>and another,</v>

2078
01:34:37.230 --> 01:34:38.950
<v Speaker 4>so it was good and it was over 50 inches</v>
<v Speaker 4>wide,</v>

2079
01:34:38.951 --> 01:34:39.784
<v Speaker 4>so as it was league all the way around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if I would've just focused on the </v>

2080
01:34:42.090 --> 01:34:42.923
<v Speaker 4>area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could have been a lesser bullet in </v>

2081
01:34:44.441 --> 01:34:46.420
<v Speaker 4>regard to time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2082
01:34:46.810 --> 01:34:51.220
<v Speaker 4>and they do this to make sure again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the mature animals are harvested so</v>

2083
01:34:51.221 --> 01:34:52.054
<v Speaker 4>that the younger animals can breed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this is all calculated by </v>

2084
01:34:55.241 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 4>wildlife biologists to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have healthy populations</v>

2085
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:58.873
<v Speaker 1>of these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a mature bull has served his </v>

2086
01:35:01.731 --> 01:35:03.200
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

2087
01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:07.070
<v Speaker 1>He's bred the animals over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably on the decline,</v>

2088
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:10.040
<v Speaker 1>so it's a perfect time to take them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not what people,</v>

2089
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:12.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people associated almost instantly with,</v>

2090
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:14.560
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're full control of your own and the,</v>

2091
01:35:14.561 --> 01:35:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just want a bigger rack.</v>

2092
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:21.230
<v Speaker 1>But they do that specifically because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for the health of the population of</v>

2093
01:35:21.231 --> 01:35:22.140
<v Speaker 1>these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2094
01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2095
01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:24.673
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we care about the animals we care about </v>

2096
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:31.030
<v Speaker 1>and do like to kill a big animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's dual purpose.</v>

2097
01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:34.670
<v Speaker 1>We want to kill a big animal because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2098
01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:36.350
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard,</v>

2099
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:38.000
<v Speaker 1>it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're smart,</v>

2100
01:35:38.001 --> 01:35:40.130
<v Speaker 1>they're wiser and older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mature animals,</v>

2101
01:35:40.131 --> 01:35:42.710
<v Speaker 1>especially with the bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's hard to do.</v>

2102
01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:46.620
<v Speaker 1>And then also on the dual purpose side </v>
<v Speaker 1>is it helps the health,</v>

2103
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:47.960
<v Speaker 1>the health of the herd.</v>

2104
01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.430
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2105
01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:51.830
<v Speaker 1>we're doing the best we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of all,</v>

2106
01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:52.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2107
01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.410
<v Speaker 1>when you go back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2108
01:35:53.490 --> 01:35:56.060
<v Speaker 1>to bow hunting in general is just for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2109
01:35:56.061 --> 01:35:56.894
<v Speaker 1>it's just the tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate test is something that's </v>

2110
01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.740
<v Speaker 1>very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the draw.</v>

2111
01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:01.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

2112
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:07.030
<v Speaker 1>that hunt also really exemplifies why </v>
<v Speaker 1>your hard work is so important.</v>

2113
01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.040
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shot the moose at 90 yards,</v>

2114
01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:11.233
<v Speaker 1>which is an incredibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were shooting today at 45 yards and </v>

2115
01:36:13.731 --> 01:36:14.720
<v Speaker 1>as far as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2116
01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:17.630
<v Speaker 1>I never said how far I shot that Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just tell people.</v>

2117
01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll listen to,</v>

2118
01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:20.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Tim Gillingham,</v>

2119
01:36:20.351 --> 01:36:21.184
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about on the Gritty Bowman</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts who is a world champion Archer </v>

2120
01:36:23.601 --> 01:36:28.100
<v Speaker 1>who was talking about routinely shooting</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals over a hundred yards and then he</v>

2121
01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:28.963
<v Speaker 1>does this because he's a world champion </v>
<v Speaker 1>Archer and he can do that when you're </v>

2122
01:36:32.091 --> 01:36:32.924
<v Speaker 1>shooting a Moose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distance that you can shoot a moose </v>

2123
01:36:34.941 --> 01:36:38.810
<v Speaker 1>versus a guy like me who by the way I </v>
<v Speaker 1>still shoot every day but I just,</v>

2124
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:39.710
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>

2125
01:36:39.710 --> 01:36:42.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an ethical distance for me,</v>

2126
01:36:42.141 --> 01:36:45.860
<v Speaker 1>but it is for you and to have to haul </v>
<v Speaker 1>that animal out.</v>

2127
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to blow up your spot on the yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you already told people but it</v>

2128
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:51.560
<v Speaker 1>was the perfect shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2129
01:36:51.561 --> 01:36:53.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a,</v>

2130
01:36:53.931 --> 01:36:56.270
<v Speaker 1>that's a funny area with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a shooting.</v>

2131
01:36:56.271 --> 01:36:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Something like a rifle shot at 91st </v>
<v Speaker 1>meal,</v>

2132
01:36:58.950 --> 01:37:01.970
<v Speaker 1>deer mule deer right there to your left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was 200 yards.</v>

2133
01:37:02.130 --> 01:37:03.890
<v Speaker 1>It was the first time I ever pull the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger on anything.</v>

2134
01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>

2135
01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was 200 years,</v>

2136
01:37:06.541 --> 01:37:08.180
<v Speaker 1>but of the rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's normal.</v>

2137
01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:09.830
<v Speaker 1>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get arrested with a rifle,</v>

2138
01:37:09.831 --> 01:37:14.330
<v Speaker 1>you just thrown on my stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was perfect.</v>

2139
01:37:14.331 --> 01:37:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the rifle is a tool.</v>

2140
01:37:17.210 --> 01:37:19.070
<v Speaker 1>You just let her perform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to work,</v>

2141
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:21.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bow hunt with a bow.</v>

2142
01:37:21.051 --> 01:37:23.240
<v Speaker 1>It's just a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of variables.</v>

2143
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:28.390
<v Speaker 1>So all of your preparation is shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day for years and decades really.</v>

2144
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:32.660
<v Speaker 1>And then also your physical fitness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to pack out.</v>

2145
01:37:33.250 --> 01:37:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean a moose is how big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many pounds of that thing way.</v>

2146
01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:41.180
<v Speaker 1>We had about 600 pounds of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the meat,</v>

2147
01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:42.380
<v Speaker 1>just the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2148
01:37:42.381 --> 01:37:44.150
<v Speaker 1>how much did the animal way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2149
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:46.850
<v Speaker 1>I dunno over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean 1200 pounds.</v>

2150
01:37:46.851 --> 01:37:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Probably a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2151
01:37:48.150 --> 01:37:50.480
<v Speaker 1>It's an enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous animal.</v>

2152
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:52.400
<v Speaker 1>Until you see one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in,</v>

2153
01:37:52.401 --> 01:37:55.010
<v Speaker 1>you're there physically next to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't realize.</v>

2154
01:37:55.190 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

2155
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.300
<v Speaker 2>took us hours to break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2156
01:37:57.301 --> 01:37:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2157
01:37:58.450 --> 01:38:02.070
<v Speaker 2>it was in the evening and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roy and I,</v>

2158
01:38:02.071 --> 01:38:03.680
<v Speaker 2>we had cameraman there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they ended up,</v>

2159
01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:07.140
<v Speaker 2>they found a little bit of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the process of breaking it down.</v>

2160
01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:11.760
<v Speaker 2>Then they headed back to the spike camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a row and I stayed there,</v>

2161
01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:16.440

<v Speaker 2>it's just what we did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

01:38:54.241 --> 01:38:55.074
<v Speaker 2>times with him because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just hard knowing that the journey </v>

2178
01:39:01.291 --> 01:39:02.820
<v Speaker 2>we'd been through together.</v>

2179

<v Speaker 2>That's why it's so appreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2180
01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:08.790
<v Speaker 2>who else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2181
01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:11.580
<v Speaker 2>there's another example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hunted this year and hunted the Brown</v>

2182
01:39:11.581 --> 01:39:14.190
<v Speaker 2>bear together and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2183
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:15.450
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2184
01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:16.553
<v Speaker 2>I killed this bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sow went over and was attacking the </v>

2185
01:39:20.791 --> 01:39:22.500
<v Speaker 2>corpse of the bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the bear died.</v>

2186
01:39:22.770 --> 01:39:25.110
<v Speaker 2>She didn't know what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She smelled blood.</v>

2187
01:39:25.111 --> 01:39:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Just went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2188
01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:29.910
<v Speaker 2>these brown bear are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big predators.</v>

2189
01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:33.060
<v Speaker 2>And something goes in their head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to have an issue.</v>

2190
01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:36.330
<v Speaker 2>So she hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I shot the bore,</v>

2191
01:39:37.110 --> 01:39:40.350
<v Speaker 2>it made a noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sorta ran towards her.</v>

2192
01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:43.380
<v Speaker 2>She stood up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what was going on,</v>

2193
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:47.160
<v Speaker 2>knew he'd made this noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she ran towards where he was.</v>

2194
01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as she hit his path,</v>

2195
01:39:49.891 --> 01:39:52.260
<v Speaker 2>she smelled the blood from where my </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrow past thrown.</v>

2196
01:39:52.770 --> 01:39:54.900
<v Speaker 2>So she tracked him by the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just basically running,</v>

2197
01:39:54.901 --> 01:39:55.890
<v Speaker 2>smelling blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood,</v>

2198
01:39:55.891 --> 01:39:56.430
<v Speaker 2>blood.</v>

2199
01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:59.550
<v Speaker 2>She got to him and he had died already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She started attacking him.</v>

2200
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:01.610
<v Speaker 2>This is just what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are,</v>

2201
01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:03.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these aren't crying,</v>

2202
01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.370
<v Speaker 2>hugging bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2203
01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:08.100
<v Speaker 2>so she's gone and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with rolling on.</v>

2204
01:40:08.130 --> 01:40:10.830
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's turned on my bed and I'm like,</v>

2205
01:40:11.230 --> 01:40:13.610
<v Speaker 2>God my bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm yelling to her.</v>

2206
01:40:13.611 --> 01:40:14.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2207
01:40:14.710 --> 01:40:16.710
<v Speaker 2>so I tell Roy on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

2208
01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:17.700
<v Speaker 2>we've got to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2209
01:40:17.701 --> 01:40:19.680
<v Speaker 2>shoot out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he shoots boom.</v>

2210
01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:23.520
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even know he didn't shoot at her.</v>

2211
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:25.680
<v Speaker 2>He was making the noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a scare.</v>

2212
01:40:25.890 --> 01:40:26.723
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm like,</v>

2213
01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get off that there.</v>

2214
01:40:28.590 --> 01:40:31.350
<v Speaker 2>And she looked up and then she liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw us,</v>

2215
01:40:31.530 --> 01:40:33.660
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden here she comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprinting,</v>

2216
01:40:33.930 --> 01:40:35.820
<v Speaker 2>and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is going on?</v>

2217
01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:38.280
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like a blood friends.</v>

2218
01:40:38.281 --> 01:40:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2219
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:39.833
<v Speaker 2>it was so much going on at one time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it got something triggered in her </v>

2220
01:40:43.921 --> 01:40:47.250
<v Speaker 2>head and she was just crazy.</v>

2221
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:50.070
<v Speaker 2>So here she comes and I killed my bears </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a creek.</v>

2222
01:40:50.730 --> 01:40:51.563
<v Speaker 2>She got to the creek and Roy says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says if she doesn't stop long enough </v>

2223
01:40:54.821 --> 01:40:55.930
<v Speaker 2>to shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

2224
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.823
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she comes up to our side of the </v>

2225
01:40:58.541 --> 01:40:59.374
<v Speaker 2>creek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I have an arrow knocked and you </v>

2226
01:41:00.601 --> 01:41:01.434
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm going to do with </v>

2227
01:41:01.871 --> 01:41:02.561
<v Speaker 2>an Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2228
01:41:02.561 --> 01:41:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never pack a gun.</v>

2229
01:41:04.141 --> 01:41:07.480
<v Speaker 2>So I just had my bow and he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had the gun,</v>

2230
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:11.960
<v Speaker 2>she stands up at 20 yards away and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing there and it's in,</v>

2231
01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:13.870
<v Speaker 2>it's a standoff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we think,</v>

2232
01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:15.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she stood up,</v>

2233
01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:17.740
<v Speaker 2>she going to see what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2234
01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:20.530
<v Speaker 2>there was three of us standing there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's going to say,</v>

2235
01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:22.690
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dropped down and leave.</v>

2236
01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.490
<v Speaker 2>So we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of here.</v>

2237
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:25.623
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she drops down bee line right towards </v>

2238
01:41:28.270 --> 01:41:32.470
<v Speaker 2>this charging and so roy boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

2239
01:41:32.471 --> 01:41:34.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he drops her,</v>

2240
01:41:34.650 --> 01:41:36.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one shot made a good shot.</v>

2241
01:41:36.130 --> 01:41:36.963
<v Speaker 2>He hit like Mr. Head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hit like right here and it was </v>

2242
01:41:39.071 --> 01:41:41.310
<v Speaker 2>folded or right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

2243
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:44.970
<v Speaker 2>what the law stands out for me is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2244
01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:48.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were out,</v>

2245
01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:53.080
<v Speaker 2>we were never worried about our lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>were at stake,</v>

2246
01:41:53.081 --> 01:41:54.970
<v Speaker 2>were never worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2247
01:41:54.971 --> 01:41:57.310
<v Speaker 2>like maybe a typical reaction to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2248
01:41:57.670 --> 01:41:58.503
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could have died or something like </v>

2249
01:41:59.471 --> 01:42:00.910
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2250
01:42:01.210 --> 01:42:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just because I'm like,</v>

2251
01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I was mad she did that and required Roy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to act,</v>

2252
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:10.870
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was just,</v>

2253
01:42:10.930 --> 01:42:12.880
<v Speaker 2>I cussed and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2254
01:42:12.881 --> 01:42:14.020
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to.</v>

2255
01:42:14.410 --> 01:42:16.990
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we were worried about ourselves.</v>

2256
01:42:17.010 --> 01:42:17.843
<v Speaker 2>We were just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't want to have to kill another </v>

2257
01:42:18.521 --> 01:42:22.690
<v Speaker 2>bear and we weren't nervous about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

2258
01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:23.741
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2259
01:42:23.741 --> 01:42:25.420
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

2260
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:28.900
<v Speaker 2>where else am I going to have somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on that same page with me that,</v>

2261
01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:29.793
<v Speaker 2>that's common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that situation and not see their life </v>

2262
01:42:31.631 --> 01:42:34.530
<v Speaker 2>flash before their eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do what you have to do to,</v>

2263
01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.730
<v Speaker 2>to stop the risk.</v>

2264
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:38.223
<v Speaker 2>That's never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to have somebody like </v>

2265
01:42:40.271 --> 01:42:43.930
<v Speaker 2>that in my life again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think about we were,</v>

2266
01:42:44.410 --> 01:42:45.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2267
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:47.800
<v Speaker 2>we knew the risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're involved in everything that we did</v>

2268
01:42:47.801 --> 01:42:50.340
<v Speaker 2>and we embraced it and we're fine with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it,</v>

2269
01:42:50.410 --> 01:42:51.243
<v Speaker 2>and it didn't consume us or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm going to miss is </v>

2270
01:42:55.480 --> 01:43:00.190
<v Speaker 2>having somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on my same page that I can trust like</v>

2271
01:43:00.191 --> 01:43:01.024
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2272
01:43:01.210 --> 01:43:02.043
<v Speaker 2>Roy was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to have someone who's </v>

2273
01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:06.600
<v Speaker 2>experienced that as many times as Roy </v>
<v Speaker 2>has had where it was,</v>

2274
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:08.920
<v Speaker 2>he knew exactly what he had to do in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that moment.</v>

2275
01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>

2276
01:43:09.881 --> 01:43:12.430
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people know what they have to do.</v>

2277
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:14.710
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's executing.</v>

2278
01:43:14.890 --> 01:43:16.810
<v Speaker 2>That is what's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2279
01:43:16.811 --> 01:43:17.590
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2280
01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:20.500
<v Speaker 2>so knowing what it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not panicking,</v>

2281
01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:24.100
<v Speaker 2>being in control and then getting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>job done with one shot,</v>

2282
01:43:25.090 --> 01:43:30.090
<v Speaker 2>very rare and he was so roy in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations was,</v>

2283
01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:33.820
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know everybody,</v>

2284
01:43:33.821 --> 01:43:34.654
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been with everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say he's as good as anybody </v>

2285
01:43:37.481 --> 01:43:39.370
<v Speaker 2>that I know of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2286
01:43:39.371 --> 01:43:40.750
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2287
01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.120
<v Speaker 2>that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2288
01:43:43.121 --> 01:43:46.570
<v Speaker 2>when he fell and I got the news that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>fell and died.</v>

2289
01:43:48.010 --> 01:43:48.843
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

2290
01:43:49.150 --> 01:43:51.130
<v Speaker 2>I could believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

2291
01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:54.350
<v Speaker 2>but I was mad and I'm still mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2292
01:43:54.370 --> 01:43:56.670
<v Speaker 2>and I know everything happens for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason and I know,</v>

2293
01:43:57.010 --> 01:43:57.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has,</v>

2294
01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:00.240
<v Speaker 2>he has a lot of faith and I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2295
01:44:00.770 --> 01:44:04.370
<v Speaker 2>we want to think everything's gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay and we'll see each other again.</v>

2296
01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:07.910
<v Speaker 2>I know all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it still makes me mad,</v>

2297
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:11.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

2298
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we missed or we missed out on a lot of </v>

2299
01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:18.793
<v Speaker 2>experiences we'd still love to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we talked about and we were just </v>

2300
01:44:21.891 --> 01:44:23.390
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had these big,</v>

2301
01:44:23.690 --> 01:44:28.550
<v Speaker 2>big goals and big dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm mad that that's gone.</v>

2302
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:33.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2303
01:44:33.730 --> 01:44:36.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not just understandable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2304
01:44:36.111 --> 01:44:36.944
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that very few people </v>

2305
01:44:37.641 --> 01:44:38.474
<v Speaker 1>could probably relate to the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate friendship that you would have </v>

2306
01:44:40.911 --> 01:44:43.970
<v Speaker 1>with someone who's experienced those </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of hunts.</v>

2307
01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:44.893
<v Speaker 1>It's been in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the wilderness that's done like that </v>

2308
01:44:47.301 --> 01:44:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Moose hunt that you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you guys were deep,</v>

2309
01:44:50.631 --> 01:44:54.440
<v Speaker 1>deep in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the wilderness like that.</v>

2310
01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.790
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that very few people will</v>

2311
01:44:58.791 --> 01:44:59.624
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few people ever experienced that </v>

2312
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:03.103
<v Speaker 1>kind of danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of an intimate moment in the </v>

2313
01:45:05.721 --> 01:45:06.554
<v Speaker 1>wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that connection to the wild that </v>

2314
01:45:09.471 --> 01:45:10.610
<v Speaker 1>you guys had together.</v>

2315
01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the whole point,</v>

2316
01:45:13.610 --> 01:45:16.520
<v Speaker 2>I guess with all that is it's people </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2317
01:45:16.521 --> 01:45:17.354
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

2318
01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:18.913
<v Speaker 2>your murderous or you want to kill such </v>
<v Speaker 2>a small part of what me and really </v>

2319
01:45:22.731 --> 01:45:26.750
<v Speaker 2>experienced together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kills were.</v>

2320
01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we achieved our goal.</v>

2321
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:33.050
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the journey.</v>

2322
01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:35.330
<v Speaker 2>It was the Brotherhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2323
01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:36.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up.</v>

2324
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:39.920
<v Speaker 2>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what hunting is.</v>

2325
01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:41.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not just you're out killing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2326
01:45:41.871 --> 01:45:42.704
<v Speaker 2>you're experiencing nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its most brutal or it's most rewarding </v>

2327
01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:51.290
<v Speaker 2>or the entire gamut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>

2328
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:54.300
<v Speaker 2>when that makes you who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2329
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:56.810
<v Speaker 2>it's powerful and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2330
01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:57.490
<v Speaker 2>that's hunting</v>

2331
01:45:57.490 --> 01:45:59.900
<v Speaker 1>was to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2332
01:45:59.910 --> 01:46:01.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this.</v>

2333
01:46:01.501 --> 01:46:03.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2334
01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:05.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

2335
01:46:05.521 --> 01:46:06.354
<v Speaker 1>Why should you feel any worse for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend than we should for the animals </v>

2336
01:46:10.261 --> 01:46:11.850
<v Speaker 1>that you killed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2337
01:46:11.851 --> 01:46:16.851
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that they sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of connect animals almost with people in</v>

2338
01:46:17.611 --> 01:46:20.400
<v Speaker 1>a way or maybe even better than people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way.</v>

2339
01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:21.413
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's this and I think that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good part of this disconnect that we're </v>

2340
01:46:24.571 --> 01:46:25.404
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people that they don't experience </v>

2341
01:46:26.731 --> 01:46:28.500
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these moments.</v>

2342
01:46:29.150 --> 01:46:31.890
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know anybody like that.</v>

2343
01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:32.753
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a friendship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like Roy that they haven't had </v>

2344
01:46:35.011 --> 01:46:39.050
<v Speaker 1>these experiences like you did with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2345
01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:39.933
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2346
01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:41.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you said,</v>

2347
01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:43.380
<v Speaker 1>you sent me the text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>

2348
01:46:43.381 --> 01:46:45.630
<v Speaker 1>but you sent me the text when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he died.</v>

2349
01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:49.050
<v Speaker 1>And I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that that had to be</v>

2350
01:46:50.610 --> 01:46:55.610
<v Speaker 4>devastating to his still is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2351
01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:58.230
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2352
01:46:58.230 --> 01:47:00.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's a,</v>

2353
01:47:01.110 --> 01:47:03.420
<v Speaker 4>there's very few men like Roy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2354
01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:06.330
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a capable,</v>

2355
01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:08.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

2356
01:47:08.071 --> 01:47:10.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just somebody you could count on,</v>

2357
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:15.470
<v Speaker 4>anybody could count on and I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2358
01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:18.900
<v Speaker 4>tough to replace what's very easy to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>by in this world today.</v>

2359
01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:20.513
<v Speaker 4>It's very easy to get by without being </v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of a person and it's very </v>

2360
01:47:22.921 --> 01:47:23.754
<v Speaker 4>difficult to become that kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person to always make the right </v>

2361
01:47:26.431 --> 01:47:28.380
<v Speaker 4>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to always push ahead,</v>

2362
01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:30.990
<v Speaker 4>to always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>always show character.</v>

2363
01:47:31.290 --> 01:47:34.110
<v Speaker 4>To always be someone that you can count </v>
<v Speaker 4>on is hard.</v>

2364
01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.040
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2365
01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:38.460
<v Speaker 4>it's a society today is too easy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>

2366
01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:40.040
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2367
01:47:40.230 --> 01:47:41.063
<v Speaker 4>that's why I think that's kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>draw for me to pushing myself the way I </v>

2368
01:47:44.761 --> 01:47:46.290
<v Speaker 4>do physically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mentally.</v>

2369
01:47:46.650 --> 01:47:48.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like if something's easy,</v>

2370
01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not attracted to it.</v>

2371
01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:51.780
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll want to,</v>

2372
01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:54.000
<v Speaker 4>I want to be hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want it to be hard.</v>

2373
01:47:54.001 --> 01:47:56.790
<v Speaker 4>I want it to be difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2374
01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:57.773
<v Speaker 4>because society makes us weak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes us feel entitled and I don't </v>

2375
01:48:02.281 --> 01:48:03.270
<v Speaker 4>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2376
01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:05.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2377
01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:10.260
<v Speaker 4>every day I feel like unless I'm beat </v>
<v Speaker 4>down or tired or whatever,</v>

2378
01:48:10.261 --> 01:48:15.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I achieved what I needed to achieve that</v>

2379
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.770
<v Speaker 4>day and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2380
01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:19.260
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't expect anybody else to feel like</v>

2381
01:48:19.261 --> 01:48:20.160
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just me.</v>

2382
01:48:20.250 --> 01:48:23.310
<v Speaker 4>Everybody else is motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>motivated by different things,</v>

2383
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:27.340
<v Speaker 4>have different priorities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just for me and uh,</v>

2384
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:29.010
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2385
01:48:29.130 --> 01:48:29.963
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so finding somebody who have the </v>

2386
01:48:31.381 --> 01:48:35.400
<v Speaker 4>same mindset as me can be tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very rare.</v>

2387
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:36.623
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for people to gravitate </v>

2388
01:48:38.521 --> 01:48:39.354
<v Speaker 4>towards challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but through challenge you get the </v>

2389
01:48:42.241 --> 01:48:44.730
<v Speaker 4>greatest reward because through staying </v>
<v Speaker 4>in bed,</v>

2390
01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:47.880
<v Speaker 4>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the call of the bed is strong,</v>

2391
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:49.530
<v Speaker 4>the warm bed and just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2392
01:48:49.531 --> 01:48:53.190
<v Speaker 4>let me just hit fucking snooze and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>alarm clock and get nine more minutes.</v>

2393
01:48:53.190 --> 01:48:55.650
<v Speaker 4>Or let me just shut it off and call in </v>
<v Speaker 4>sick to work.</v>

2394
01:48:55.651 --> 01:48:57.420
<v Speaker 4>Let me just not do what I'm supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

2395
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:58.343
<v Speaker 4>Let me just sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there was an article that I posted </v>

2396
01:49:01.321 --> 01:49:04.180
<v Speaker 4>recently where they were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2397
01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:07.680
<v Speaker 4>the power that dopamine has dope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean meaning memories.</v>

2398
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:10.830
<v Speaker 4>And it's one of the reasons why people </v>
<v Speaker 4>have such a hard time kicking bad habits</v>

2399
01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:11.813
<v Speaker 4>is because we gravitate towards these </v>
<v Speaker 4>like reward experiences that we have in </v>

2400
01:49:17.281 --> 01:49:19.800
<v Speaker 4>our head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reward of eating shitty food or have</v>

2401
01:49:19.801 --> 01:49:22.040
<v Speaker 4>a drinking too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or it's your,</v>

2402
01:49:22.530 --> 01:49:27.530
<v Speaker 4>your mind sort of carves these paths </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards these real rewarding,</v>

2403
01:49:29.490 --> 01:49:33.330
<v Speaker 4>like a almost self destructive behaviors</v>
<v Speaker 4>because those,</v>

2404
01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:34.223
<v Speaker 4>they give you a dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's eating shitty food or </v>

2405
01:49:35.821 --> 01:49:36.654
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the rare person who's mind </v>

2406
01:49:39.511 --> 01:49:43.530
<v Speaker 4>gravitates towards the reward of </v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplishment through reward of pushing</v>

2407
01:49:43.531 --> 01:49:46.320
<v Speaker 4>yourself through a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very difficult circumstance.</v>

2408
01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:51.320
<v Speaker 4>Very difficult to get to that feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplishment like you get.</v>

2409
01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:52.684
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure when you run a marathon or like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get when you get to the top of the </v>

2410
01:49:55.031 --> 01:49:56.170
<v Speaker 4>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you pushing,</v>

2411
01:49:56.290 --> 01:49:57.123
<v Speaker 4>when you don't want to and you get to it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you did it and you know that you </v>

2412
01:49:59.951 --> 01:50:03.760
<v Speaker 4>overcome this weakness inside of you </v>
<v Speaker 4>that wants you to quit,</v>

2413
01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:06.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That everybody experiences at some point</v>

2414
01:50:06.161 --> 01:50:11.020
<v Speaker 4>in their life and it's a matter of how </v>
<v Speaker 4>you react to that experience and how you</v>

2415
01:50:11.021 --> 01:50:12.970
<v Speaker 4>react to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That poll,</v>

2416
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.100
<v Speaker 4>the poll towards the bed is strong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull towards weaknesses,</v>

2417
01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:19.690
<v Speaker 4>strong because it's so easy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so easy to quit.</v>

2418
01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:21.100
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

2419
01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:23.470
<v Speaker 4>See it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one reason why,</v>

2420
01:50:23.471 --> 01:50:25.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean it seems minor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2421
01:50:25.650 --> 01:50:27.530
<v Speaker 4>when I get up at four or five in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>morning,</v>

2422
01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:28.393
<v Speaker 4>I have to be at work at seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I get up early to do my fasted </v>

2423
01:50:30.911 --> 01:50:32.900
<v Speaker 4>cardio runs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2424
01:50:33.010 --> 01:50:35.980
<v Speaker 4>and I'm out and so I have no fuel.</v>

2425
01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:37.113
<v Speaker 4>I'm out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nobody out four or five in the </v>

2426
01:50:38.981 --> 01:50:41.530
<v Speaker 4>morning and I'm running into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods by my house.</v>

2427
01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:42.633
<v Speaker 4>All the lights are off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just envision people in their </v>

2428
01:50:44.681 --> 01:50:48.760
<v Speaker 4>comfortable sleeping and I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2429
01:50:48.850 --> 01:50:49.690
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2430
01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:51.940
<v Speaker 4>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel the best.</v>

2431
01:50:51.941 --> 01:50:53.650
<v Speaker 4>Then when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2432
01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:55.570
<v Speaker 4>it's like when I run the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it's sunny,</v>

2433
01:50:55.660 --> 01:50:59.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel as good as when I run it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it's pouring rain because it's easy</v>

2434
01:50:59.711 --> 01:51:01.540
<v Speaker 4>to go out and do it when it's sunny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I run,</v>

2435
01:51:01.810 --> 01:51:02.643
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it on a weekend in the middle of the </v>

2436
01:51:04.031 --> 01:51:06.250
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lots of people out there,</v>

2437
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:07.143
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel that accomplished when I do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it at four or five in the morning when </v>

2438
01:51:09.671 --> 01:51:13.750
<v Speaker 4>nobody's out there and it's just like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that in my head and I,</v>

2439
01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:16.370
<v Speaker 4>my head might not be normal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

2440
01:51:16.570 --> 01:51:18.670
<v Speaker 4>I just love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2441
01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:20.700
<v Speaker 4>and people always say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2442
01:51:20.701 --> 01:51:22.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that running your,</v>

2443
01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:25.000
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be in a wheelchair by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time you're 60.</v>

2444
01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:27.880
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's guaranteed to live to 60?</v>

2445
01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:29.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might die tomorrow,</v>

2446
01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:30.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what am I supposed to do?</v>

2447
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:33.330
<v Speaker 4>Save myself for what I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2448
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:34.833
<v Speaker 4>I want to know that I gave all I have </v>
<v Speaker 4>every day because tomorrow's not </v>

2449
01:51:39.791 --> 01:51:41.380
<v Speaker 4>guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

2450
01:51:41.650 --> 01:51:44.430
<v Speaker 4>I just don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a hard time with that.</v>

2451
01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:49.330
<v Speaker 4>That mindset of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moderation mindset,</v>

2452
01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:50.193
<v Speaker 4>those people that are saying that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're peering through the curtains </v>

2453
01:51:51.971 --> 01:51:55.690
<v Speaker 4>while you're running by their house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their sleeves gonna,</v>

2454
01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:58.600
<v Speaker 4>he's gonna wind up in a wheelchair and </v>
<v Speaker 4>not me,</v>

2455
01:51:58.990 --> 01:52:01.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm here Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2456
01:52:01.601 --> 01:52:02.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2457
01:52:02.651 --> 01:52:03.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2458
01:52:03.890 --> 01:52:04.723
<v Speaker 4>so some people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people criticize and maybe maybe I </v>

2459
01:52:07.631 --> 01:52:08.464
<v Speaker 4>will be on a wheelchair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll know that I lived as hard as I </v>

2460
01:52:12.551 --> 01:52:13.384
<v Speaker 4>could live and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and pushed as hard as I could when I </v>

2461
01:52:14.771 --> 01:52:16.900
<v Speaker 4>could do it and I'm not going to regret </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2462
01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:18.213
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people that try to knock someone </v>

2463
01:52:20.561 --> 01:52:24.700
<v Speaker 4>down for working hard and overcoming </v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme obstacles,</v>

2464
01:52:25.090 --> 01:52:28.720
<v Speaker 4>what they're doing is they're responding</v>
<v Speaker 4>to their own insecurity.</v>

2465
01:52:28.810 --> 01:52:30.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's logical things.</v>

2466
01:52:30.370 --> 01:52:31.360
<v Speaker 4>There's people that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2467
01:52:31.361 --> 01:52:32.194
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people that look at certain </v>

2468
01:52:33.311 --> 01:52:35.500
<v Speaker 4>types of extreme sports where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2469
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:37.390
<v Speaker 4>there's a bmx guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's his name,</v>

2470
01:52:37.391 --> 01:52:39.280
<v Speaker 4>Dave Mirra,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who just committed suicide,</v>

2471
01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:41.860
<v Speaker 4>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible tragedy,</v>

2472
01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:42.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>husband,</v>

2473
01:52:42.970 --> 01:52:44.410
<v Speaker 4>father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole deal.</v>

2474
01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:46.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta</v>

2475
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:48.980
<v Speaker 3>think it's connected to head trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2476
01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:50.053
<v Speaker 3>I think you're talking about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely different thing when you're </v>

2477
01:52:51.201 --> 01:52:53.030
<v Speaker 3>talking about head trauma because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2478
01:52:53.050 --> 01:52:55.430
<v Speaker 3>these poor guys that do these extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports,</v>

2479
01:52:55.470 --> 01:52:56.303
<v Speaker 3>they wind up getting really banged up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that causes some pretty severe </v>

2480
01:53:00.411 --> 01:53:04.070
<v Speaker 3>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think in circumstances like that,</v>

2481
01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:06.740
<v Speaker 3>I think you're talking about a kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>different animal,</v>

2482
01:53:06.741 --> 01:53:09.860
<v Speaker 3>but people will criticize people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>take chances in life.</v>

2483
01:53:10.190 --> 01:53:12.500
<v Speaker 3>People will criticize people who work </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard,</v>

2484
01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:14.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like why do you have to lift weights?</v>

2485
01:53:14.241 --> 01:53:17.480
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think there was an article </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we had talked about at some asshole</v>

2486
01:53:17.481 --> 01:53:20.630
<v Speaker 3>at written in some bowhunting magazine </v>
<v Speaker 3>about you.</v>

2487
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:22.200
<v Speaker 3>It online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2488
01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:23.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was,</v>

2489
01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:25.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just talking shit about you.</v>

2490
01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:27.410
<v Speaker 3>Like why does he have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2491
01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:29.120
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to lift weights like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

2492
01:53:29.121 --> 01:53:29.690
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to.</v>

2493
01:53:29.690 --> 01:53:31.850
<v Speaker 3>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But guess what?</v>

2494
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>

2495
01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:35.210
<v Speaker 3>If you want to do what you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to.</v>

2496
01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It mean.</v>

2497
01:53:36.030 --> 01:53:40.190
<v Speaker 3>And what he's doing by writing that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at someone who works harder than</v>

2498
01:53:40.191 --> 01:53:41.024
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplishes more than him and he's </v>

2499
01:53:41.871 --> 01:53:44.330
<v Speaker 3>trying to chop you down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's crabs in a bucket,</v>

2500
01:53:44.331 --> 01:53:45.141
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's people.</v>

2501
01:53:45.141 --> 01:53:45.974
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever see crabs in a bucket?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't know what I'm talking </v>

2502
01:53:47.781 --> 01:53:48.450
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks,</v>

2503
01:53:48.450 --> 01:53:49.283
<v Speaker 3>if you see crabs in a bucket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never get out of that fucking </v>

2504
01:53:50.451 --> 01:53:52.490
<v Speaker 3>bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if they work together,</v>

2505
01:53:52.610 --> 01:53:53.443
<v Speaker 3>one crap could stand on another crab and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other crab grab on the top and then </v>

2506
01:53:55.791 --> 01:53:58.160
<v Speaker 3>they could figure out a way to push that</v>
<v Speaker 3>bucket over and they get all get out,</v>

2507
01:53:58.161 --> 01:54:00.800
<v Speaker 3>but nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens is one crab tries to get to</v>

2508
01:54:00.801 --> 01:54:01.634
<v Speaker 3>the top and the other crabs pull him </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and that's what a lot of people </v>

2509
01:54:04.251 --> 01:54:04.430
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

2510
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:05.263
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are crabs in a bucket </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just a weakness and an </v>

2511
01:54:08.001 --> 01:54:08.834
<v Speaker 3>insecurity and a lot of times it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't know anybody like </v>

2512
01:54:12.051 --> 01:54:13.850
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know anybody like Roy.</v>

2513
01:54:14.150 --> 01:54:16.070
<v Speaker 3>They don't know anybody that can push </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2514
01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:16.933
<v Speaker 3>They don't know anybody that they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can look at their friend and they </v>

2515
01:54:19.701 --> 01:54:21.050
<v Speaker 3>could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2516
01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:23.220
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do it too.</v>

2517
01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:25.580
<v Speaker 3>If this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I know what he would do right now.</v>

2518
01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:27.560
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a funny story.</v>

2519
01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:28.723
<v Speaker 3>I was in Texas with Aubrey and we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>pig hunting and we were in this fucking </v>

2520
01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:38.090
<v Speaker 3>moves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reliable environment.</v>

2521
01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:41.030
<v Speaker 3>There was so many mosquitoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was brutal.</v>

2522
01:54:41.031 --> 01:54:42.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were just getting mauled.</v>

2523
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:44.090
<v Speaker 3>By the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2524
01:54:44.091 --> 01:54:45.740
<v Speaker 3>it looked like I had some kind of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>

2525
01:54:45.741 --> 01:54:46.574
<v Speaker 3>like my whole body was covered in </v>
<v Speaker 3>mosquito bites and I thought to myself </v>

2526
01:54:50.181 --> 01:54:52.760
<v Speaker 3>while I was out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if campaigns was out here,</v>

2527
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:54.110
<v Speaker 3>he would fucking keep going.</v>

2528
01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:54.973
<v Speaker 3>He would just deal with the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes are biting him and he would </v>

2529
01:54:56.451 --> 01:54:57.284
<v Speaker 3>keep going and rob said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck did you get through all </v>

2530
01:55:00.531 --> 01:55:02.180
<v Speaker 3>those mosquitoes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

2531
01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:04.820
<v Speaker 3>I thought if campaigns was out here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would keep going.</v>

2532
01:55:04.821 --> 01:55:05.900
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious.</v>

2533
01:55:05.901 --> 01:55:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Because I thought if Joe Rogan can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2534
01:55:08.331 --> 01:55:13.331
<v Speaker 3>I can do it without even be there pushed</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and me because I kept going.</v>

2535
01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:17.060
<v Speaker 3>It pushed him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we were,</v>

2536
01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:18.310
<v Speaker 3>it was fucking miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were,</v>

2537
01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:21.650
<v Speaker 3>there's this cloud of mosquitoes we just</v>
<v Speaker 3>swarmed on.</v>

2538
01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:22.431
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2539
01:55:22.431 --> 01:55:23.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2540
01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:24.483
<v Speaker 3>it is a funny story but I do in some way</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel responsibility to the people that </v>

2541
01:55:30.651 --> 01:55:34.790
<v Speaker 3>follow me or look up to me to not give </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2542
01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:39.070
<v Speaker 3>I know people look to me for inspiration</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2543
01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:40.160
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it helps.</v>

2544
01:55:40.161 --> 01:55:42.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like when I don't feel like doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

2545
01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 3>I think about all the people who</v>

2546
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:45.173
<v Speaker 1>expect me to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have a huge drive to do it </v>

2547
01:55:47.191 --> 01:55:48.024
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like sometimes those </v>

2548
01:55:49.981 --> 01:55:51.810
<v Speaker 1>little things and thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2549
01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:56.850
<v Speaker 1>this story with you or people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost a hundred pounds thinking about,</v>

2550
01:55:56.910 --> 01:55:59.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work I put in,</v>

2551
01:55:59.251 --> 01:56:02.190
<v Speaker 1>it's like all those things have made me </v>
<v Speaker 1>who I am.</v>

2552
01:56:02.191 --> 01:56:03.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I,</v>

2553
01:56:03.731 --> 01:56:04.564
<v Speaker 1>I think about specific stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think about all the people who </v>

2554
01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:07.613
<v Speaker 1>have been such a positive message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a positive impact on me because I guess </v>

2555
01:56:14.401 --> 01:56:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I haven't on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2556
01:56:15.901 --> 01:56:18.750
<v Speaker 1>so can return it and it makes me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2557
01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:21.600
<v Speaker 1>it like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the big foot $200 that I'm doing.</v>

2558
01:56:22.170 --> 01:56:25.830
<v Speaker 1>If I'm just on my own and nobody knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>who I am,</v>

2559
01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:28.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm much less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less,</v>

2560
01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:33.680
<v Speaker 1>a much are not as tough a muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a less resilient as the guy I'm going to</v>

2561
01:56:35.101 --> 01:56:35.934
<v Speaker 1>be who will line up to run the big foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>200 and August because I'll feel like </v>

2562
01:56:39.001 --> 01:56:44.001
<v Speaker 1>I'll have an army of people helping me </v>
<v Speaker 1>push me and I just think that that's,</v>

2563
01:56:44.490 --> 01:56:45.323
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a society that's a type of things we </v>

2564
01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:49.440
<v Speaker 1>need to focus on.</v>

2565
01:56:49.530 --> 01:56:52.230
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So inspiration to two way street.</v>

2566
01:56:52.290 --> 01:56:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you inspire people,</v>

2567
01:56:53.941 --> 01:56:58.170
<v Speaker 1>those like I do these meet and greets </v>
<v Speaker 1>after shows you all the time and I can't</v>

2568
01:56:58.171 --> 01:57:02.010
<v Speaker 1>tell you how many people have come up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>after show that say I lost 100 pounds.</v>

2569
01:57:02.011 --> 01:57:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Once I started listening to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

2570
01:57:03.451 --> 01:57:04.284
<v Speaker 1>I started eating healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started looking at my body in a </v>

2571
01:57:05.581 --> 01:57:09.270
<v Speaker 1>different way and I started realizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I will be happier if I took care of</v>

2572
01:57:09.271 --> 01:57:13.440
<v Speaker 1>myself and then I'm happier when I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>force myself to exercise and now I do it</v>

2573
01:57:13.441 --> 01:57:14.274
<v Speaker 1>everyday and I'm drinking Kale shakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm eating healthy foods and I </v>

2574
01:57:16.321 --> 01:57:19.620
<v Speaker 1>stopped drinking and all this and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes me feel better.</v>

2575
01:57:19.670 --> 01:57:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about it when I work out,</v>

2576
01:57:21.850 --> 01:57:22.683
<v Speaker 1>I quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where inspiration is a two way </v>

2577
01:57:25.111 --> 01:57:27.450
<v Speaker 1>street and then it's also what we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

2578
01:57:27.451 --> 01:57:29.790
<v Speaker 1>like you've created a community through </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2579
01:57:29.850 --> 01:57:34.110
<v Speaker 1>your social media and through the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive posts that you make and through</v>

2580
01:57:34.570 --> 01:57:36.840
<v Speaker 1>through all your actions and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things you've done,</v>

2581
01:57:36.841 --> 01:57:40.020
<v Speaker 1>you've created this sort of sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>community where all these other people,</v>

2582
01:57:40.290 --> 01:57:41.123
<v Speaker 1>they feed off of that and you feed off </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them and we all feed off of each </v>

2583
01:57:43.861 --> 01:57:44.160
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

2584
01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:44.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2585
01:57:45.050 --> 01:57:46.440
<v Speaker 1>it's through this podcast to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2586
01:57:46.441 --> 01:57:48.870
<v Speaker 1>this has been a nuisance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an inspirational podcasts.</v>

2587
01:57:48.871 --> 01:57:50.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to listen to this podcast when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I workout tomorrow.</v>

2593
01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:03.990

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2594
01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:07.380
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to be a lazy fuck who </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizes people for no reason.</v>

2595
01:58:07.381 --> 01:58:08.214
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be that guy that's </v>

2596
01:58:08.851 --> 01:58:12.510
<v Speaker 1>weak and that talk shit about someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're not there because they feel</v>

2597
01:58:12.511 --> 01:58:14.490
<v Speaker 1>bad that that person is out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>working out.</v>

2598
01:58:14.491 --> 01:58:15.324
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to have to do with Kim </v>

2599
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:16.913
<v Speaker 1>Haines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2600
01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:18.570
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're doing,</v>

2601
01:58:18.571 --> 01:58:19.680
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're doing.</v>

2602
01:58:19.681 --> 01:58:21.330
<v Speaker 1>When you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're doing it,</v>

2603
01:58:21.331 --> 01:58:22.590
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you're making those,</v>

2604
01:58:22.710 --> 01:58:23.543
<v Speaker 1>you know there's a little sneaky voice </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the back of your head unless you're </v>

2605
01:58:25.351 --> 01:58:26.184
<v Speaker 1>completely obtuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're completely oblivious to </v>

2606
01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:30.600
<v Speaker 1>the way you interact and interface with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

2607
01:58:30.750 --> 01:58:32.430
<v Speaker 1>you know what you do and when you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>

2608
01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:33.473
<v Speaker 1>he tried to chop someone down because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they make you feel weak and instead of </v>

2609
01:58:35.971 --> 01:58:36.804
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is out there doing something </v>

2610
01:58:38.671 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 1>awesome instead of just what's what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative about someone working</v>

2611
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:45.820
<v Speaker 3>out and being healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's negative about someone who values</v>

2612
01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:48.970
<v Speaker 3>physical fitness and accomplishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult goals?</v>

2613
01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:50.223
<v Speaker 3>That is the essence of character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the essence of what's </v>

2614
01:58:52.841 --> 01:58:53.674
<v Speaker 3>inspirational about a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not inspired by someone who sleeps </v>

2615
01:58:56.531 --> 01:58:57.364
<v Speaker 3>till two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not inspired by someone who can not </v>

2616
01:58:59.231 --> 01:59:01.540

<v Speaker 2>So I'm inspired by you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Rock and so in my own little </v>

2627
01:59:26.181 --> 01:59:29.360
<v Speaker 2>bowhunting world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just try to live up to that and,</v>

2628
01:59:29.690 --> 01:59:32.690
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess what I wanted,</v>

2629
01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:35.270
<v Speaker 2>I want to thank you for giving me this </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform,</v>

2630
01:59:35.550 --> 01:59:39.230
<v Speaker 2>given me access to all you've created </v>
<v Speaker 2>here because,</v>

2631
01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:41.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we've talked about,</v>

2632
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:44.690
<v Speaker 2>that's what feels good to reach people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inspire people,</v>

2633
01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:45.673
<v Speaker 2>and yet maybe they'll be inspired maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>even a little by the heartbreak of </v>

2634
01:59:48.621 --> 01:59:50.180
<v Speaker 2>losing a good buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2635
01:59:50.330 --> 01:59:54.620
<v Speaker 2>maybe to be a better friend or maybe to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be somebody who,</v>

2636
01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:55.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2637
01:59:55.971 --> 01:59:57.710
<v Speaker 2>that integral part of somebody else's </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2638
01:59:57.711 --> 01:59:59.810
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that'll inspire them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the workout part,</v>

2639
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:02.240
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it'll be a better,</v>

2640
02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:03.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2641
02:00:03.591 --> 02:00:06.800
<v Speaker 2>more understanding to the vegans and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to explain it better.</v>

2642
02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:07.753
<v Speaker 2>There's so much you can take from this </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast and without you giving me this </v>

2643
02:00:10.971 --> 02:00:12.350
<v Speaker 2>microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would never happen.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I want to thank you and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:17.233
<v Speaker 2>I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so happy I've met you and now we've </v>

2647
02:00:18.891 --> 02:00:19.760
<v Speaker 2>created this friendship.</v>

2648
02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:22.560
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't be more happy myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2649
02:00:22.590 --> 02:00:23.423
<v Speaker 3>that inspiration is a two way street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This podcast doesn't exist if it's not </v>

2650
02:00:26.101 --> 02:00:30.030
<v Speaker 3>for other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean what all I am is like an antenna or</v>

2651
02:00:30.031 --> 02:00:30.864
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just broadcasting my thoughts and other </v>

2652
02:00:32.911 --> 02:00:33.744
<v Speaker 3>people's thoughts too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And without a guy like you to introduce </v>

2653
02:00:35.401 --> 02:00:37.560
<v Speaker 3>me to something like bowhunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have no idea.</v>

2654
02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:38.633
<v Speaker 3>I would've gone to my grave without </v>
<v Speaker 3>having any idea how rewarding it is to </v>

2655
02:00:41.161 --> 02:00:45.090
<v Speaker 3>go and get my own meat through archery </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the woods.</v>

2656
02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:48.600
<v Speaker 3>How difficult it is to pursue such an </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly,</v>

2657
02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:50.753
<v Speaker 3>incredibly demanding discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what that's about and for you being </v>

2658
02:00:54.961 --> 02:00:57.540
<v Speaker 3>inspirational and for you creating those</v>
<v Speaker 3>videos,</v>

2659
02:00:57.810 --> 02:01:02.490
<v Speaker 3>you reached me and in you touched me </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your positivity and with your,</v>

2660
02:01:02.491 --> 02:01:05.340
<v Speaker 3>your inspiration and with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>dedication and focus.</v>

2661
02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:08.700
<v Speaker 3>And I live for that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live for inspiration.</v>

2662
02:01:08.701 --> 02:01:10.230
<v Speaker 3>That's my fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

2663
02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:11.333
<v Speaker 3>I love inspiring people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love people that are inspiring me and </v>

2664
02:01:14.791 --> 02:01:17.520
<v Speaker 3>I love inspiring other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love inspiration.</v>

2665
02:01:17.790 --> 02:01:18.623
<v Speaker 3>I think it's one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most powerful aspects about </v>

2666
02:01:21.241 --> 02:01:23.730
<v Speaker 3>our new found ability to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>with each other,</v>

2667
02:01:23.850 --> 02:01:24.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2668
02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:25.400
<v Speaker 2>Social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can.</v>

2669
02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:28.040
<v Speaker 2>You can be a negative anchor or you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspire,</v>

2670
02:01:28.041 --> 02:01:28.874
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's the message of the podcast </v>

2671
02:01:31.311 --> 02:01:32.450
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get out there,</v>

2672
02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:33.433
<v Speaker 2>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a positive difference and it </v>

2673
02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:36.710
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can all do.</v>

2674
02:01:36.711 --> 02:01:38.960
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be to 40 million,</v>

2675
02:01:39.050 --> 02:01:40.220
<v Speaker 2>10 million or a 1 million</v>

2676
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Haggen Beto one guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2677
02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Make a positive difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can all do it and we can all do it in</v>

2678
02:01:45.801 --> 02:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>our own way and it's the better way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

2679
02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:50.473
<v Speaker 1>It's the better way to live this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This world that we're living in right </v>

2680
02:01:53.961 --> 02:01:57.860
<v Speaker 1>now is essentially a global community </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is coming to awaken.</v>

2681
02:01:57.890 --> 02:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>It's aware of itself now in a way that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>never been a before.</v>

2682
02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:04.040
<v Speaker 1>We can communicate with each other like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2683
02:02:04.410 --> 02:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>there's this strange new time where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

2684
02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>You could seek out shit that pisses you </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

2685
02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:14.150
<v Speaker 1>You can see you could just fucking spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day on Kanye West instagram page and</v>

2686
02:02:14.151 --> 02:02:14.984
<v Speaker 1>get angry.</v>

2687
02:02:16.700 --> 02:02:17.533
<v Speaker 1>You can just scour through all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst aspects of all sorts of different </v>

2688
02:02:21.351 --> 02:02:24.590
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can choose to be inspired.</v>

2689
02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:29.620
<v Speaker 1>You can choose to live your life in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful and dedicated way,</v>

2690
02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:32.600
<v Speaker 1>but there's only one way to do that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>through action.</v>

2691
02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:34.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2692
02:02:34.701 --> 02:02:36.950
<v Speaker 1>it is a choice man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good choice.</v>

2693
02:02:36.951 --> 02:02:41.951
<v Speaker 1>It's a great choice to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way through that choice.</v>

2694
02:02:42.441 --> 02:02:43.274
<v Speaker 1>You enrich yourself and enrich the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you've come in contact with </v>

2695
02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:48.620
<v Speaker 1>and then we're strong or a stronger as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as as society.</v>

2696
02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:49.673
<v Speaker 1>You know we're not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People folks know we're all we all fuck </v>

2697
02:02:52.551 --> 02:02:53.384
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all get mad when we shouldn't get </v>

2698
02:02:54.651 --> 02:02:55.484
<v Speaker 1>mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all falter and through those lessons </v>

2699
02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:02.090
<v Speaker 1>of failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the disappointment you have in</v>

2700
02:03:02.091 --> 02:03:02.924
<v Speaker 1>yourself when you come up short is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel you need to make sure you never </v>

2701
02:03:06.141 --> 02:03:06.974
<v Speaker 1>come up short that way again and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll come up short and another way </v>

2702
02:03:09.141 --> 02:03:09.620
<v Speaker 1>next week.</v>

2703
02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:10.040
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2704
02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:11.900
<v Speaker 1>that fucking thing is never going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen again either.</v>

2705
02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And you find a way to assess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2706
02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:15.253
<v Speaker 1>it is a process and that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that I really try to drill into </v>

2707
02:03:18.651 --> 02:03:19.461
<v Speaker 1>people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2708
02:03:19.461 --> 02:03:20.031
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2709
02:03:20.031 --> 02:03:21.740
<v Speaker 1>can you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How have you done so many things?</v>

2710
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I've done so many things because I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucked at all of them.</v>

2711
02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Everything I've ever tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sucked at in the beginning,</v>

2712
02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:32.690
<v Speaker 1>everything you fail and then you learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to not fail and you,</v>

2713
02:03:32.691 --> 02:03:33.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

2714
02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:35.720
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you take God damn chances?</v>

2715
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:36.763
<v Speaker 1>That's how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you start a bow hunting at </v>

2716
02:03:37.821 --> 02:03:39.740
<v Speaker 1>45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to fucking take chances.</v>

2717
02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:42.470
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't take chances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you stay within your comfort zone,</v>

2718
02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:44.720
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a fun life.</v>

2719
02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:45.613
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a,</v>

2720
02:03:45.650 --> 02:03:47.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2721
02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:49.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a cushy life.</v>

2722
02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:52.040
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a little safer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insulated.</v>

2723
02:03:52.041 --> 02:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I've always respected </v>
<v Speaker 1>about you is you,</v>

2724
02:03:54.670 --> 02:03:57.200
<v Speaker 1>when you started bowhunting and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2725
02:03:57.290 --> 02:03:59.870
<v Speaker 1>it's because I know firsthand how </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult it is.</v>

2726
02:03:59.930 --> 02:04:03.080
<v Speaker 1>So you've been successful in so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different arenas,</v>

2727
02:04:03.110 --> 02:04:04.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And been,</v>

2728
02:04:05.050 --> 02:04:05.883
<v Speaker 1>you're Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden Joe Rogan is a new bow </v>

2729
02:04:09.191 --> 02:04:11.930
<v Speaker 1>hunter who doesn't know shit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and it's like,</v>

2730
02:04:11.931 --> 02:04:16.160
<v Speaker 1>for you to say I'm okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>

2731
02:04:16.190 --> 02:04:17.023
<v Speaker 1>Most people who have been so successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be starting out on ground </v>

2732
02:04:20.451 --> 02:04:21.870
<v Speaker 1>zero again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

2733
02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:24.520
<v Speaker 1>for you to do that and then and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes.</v>

2734
02:04:24.521 --> 02:04:25.354
<v Speaker 1>So just disciplined and enamored with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the discipline of bowhunting has been </v>

2735
02:04:31.431 --> 02:04:32.570
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2736
02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love doing things I suck at.</v>

2737
02:04:36.230 --> 02:04:37.063
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like yoga and I mean it's </v>

2738
02:04:39.931 --> 02:04:40.550
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2739
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:41.383
<v Speaker 1>like when we were working out today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have that same sort of approach to </v>

2740
02:04:44.071 --> 02:04:44.904
<v Speaker 1>like we were showing you all these crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>new exercises and you were gravitating </v>

2741
02:04:48.181 --> 02:04:49.700
<v Speaker 1>towards the ones that you weren't good </v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

2742
02:04:50.650 --> 02:04:51.483
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2743
02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:52.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2744
02:04:52.331 --> 02:04:54.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love pushing myself.</v>

2745
02:04:54.061 --> 02:04:56.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I work out with New People,</v>

2746
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I love exposing them to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2747
02:04:59.581 --> 02:05:00.414
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this workout doesn't start until you're </v>

2748
02:05:02.611 --> 02:05:05.040
<v Speaker 1>miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once you're miserable,</v>

2749
02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:08.700
<v Speaker 1>then it counts because everybody can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it when it's easy.</v>

2750
02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2751
02:05:09.991 --> 02:05:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Now you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we start and it's just like I,</v>

2752
02:05:13.371 --> 02:05:14.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a good eye.</v>

2753
02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I just like exposing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would always say,</v>

2754
02:05:17.521 --> 02:05:18.354
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people,</v>

2755
02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:20.250
<v Speaker 1>other people have said it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't invent this,</v>

2756
02:05:20.251 --> 02:05:21.084
<v Speaker 1>but being comfortable from being </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable and that's this getting </v>

2757
02:05:24.211 --> 02:05:25.350
<v Speaker 1>that moment where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2758
02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:28.620
<v Speaker 1>now I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I want to start gaining,</v>

2759
02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:30.030
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

2760
02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:32.520
<v Speaker 1>that's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the journey that anything,</v>

2761
02:05:32.521 --> 02:05:34.920
<v Speaker 1>this has a big reward is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>require that.</v>

2762
02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the essence of Jujitsu.</v>

2763
02:05:37.590 --> 02:05:38.423
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is being comfortable while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're uncomfortable because everybody </v>

2764
02:05:42.331 --> 02:05:43.100
<v Speaker 1>gets tapped.</v>

2765
02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:43.933
<v Speaker 1>There is no way to get good at Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you get mauled by another person </v>

2766
02:05:46.711 --> 02:05:48.960
<v Speaker 1>is the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2767
02:05:48.961 --> 02:05:52.230
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started Jujitsu as you know,</v>

2768
02:05:52.290 --> 02:05:53.123
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a former taekwondo champion who would </v>

2769
02:05:54.631 --> 02:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>spend my whole lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was successful.</v>

2770
02:05:56.801 --> 02:05:59.370
<v Speaker 1>It's striking my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had done,</v>

2771
02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:03.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different forms of striking competitions</v>

2772
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:04.343
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and getting fucking crushed by </v>

2773
02:06:06.881 --> 02:06:10.740
<v Speaker 1>people were my size or smaller and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just beating the piss out of me.</v>

2774
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a ragdoll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

2775
02:06:12.331 --> 02:06:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm a grappling dummy and for me I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized I had,</v>

2776
02:06:15.931 --> 02:06:16.764
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to address the fact that I was </v>

2777
02:06:18.301 --> 02:06:21.480
<v Speaker 1>nowhere near as competent in self </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense is.</v>

2778
02:06:21.481 --> 02:06:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as these guys got ahold of me,</v>

2779
02:06:23.821 --> 02:06:24.990
<v Speaker 1>they were just strangling me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2780
02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:25.863
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my perception of what I could do </v>

2781
02:06:27.571 --> 02:06:30.750
<v Speaker 1>versus the reality of what I could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>was I had to,</v>

2782
02:06:30.810 --> 02:06:34.050
<v Speaker 1>I had to just address it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to figure it out and so okay,</v>

2783
02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:37.020
<v Speaker 1>now I've got to get fucking crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to this shit.</v>

2784
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>And then I became completely obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that about of training and getting.</v>

2785
02:06:43.720 --> 02:06:45.820
<v Speaker 1>But that's one of the beautiful things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Jujitsu.</v>

2786
02:06:45.850 --> 02:06:46.683
<v Speaker 1>One of the things about Jujitsu that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>admire most in the truly good </v>

2787
02:06:50.011 --> 02:06:53.810
<v Speaker 1>practitioners is they have very healthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>egos because their,</v>

2788
02:06:53.890 --> 02:06:55.740
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their egos get tested.</v>

2789
02:06:55.741 --> 02:06:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in check all the time.</v>

2790
02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Constantly tapping tap all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2791
02:07:00.510 --> 02:07:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever gone more than a</v>

2792
02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:03.900
<v Speaker 1>few months in my whole life without </v>
<v Speaker 1>tapping.</v>

2793
02:07:04.170 --> 02:07:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the same with bowhunting.</v>

2794
02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Don't start bowhunting unless you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with failure.</v>

2795
02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:10.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a humbling.</v>

2796
02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you know,</v>

2797
02:07:11.940 --> 02:07:15.270
<v Speaker 1>the discipline you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bowhunting is a discipline.</v>

2798
02:07:15.271 --> 02:07:16.104
<v Speaker 1>Just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will humble you no matter how good </v>

2799
02:07:17.821 --> 02:07:18.654
<v Speaker 1>you think you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all very difficult things are </v>

2800
02:07:22.141 --> 02:07:23.130
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

2801
02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:25.410
<v Speaker 1>as long as it doesn't kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good for you.</v>

2802
02:07:25.411 --> 02:07:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean like these goddamn ultra </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathons,</v>

2803
02:07:27.541 --> 02:07:32.430
<v Speaker 1>you're running this crazy fuck you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 miles is not enough.</v>

2804
02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:33.091
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2805
02:07:33.091 --> 02:07:34.500
<v Speaker 1>I've already done that a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

2806
02:07:34.501 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Now I got to do 200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2807
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:37.420
<v Speaker 3>here's the big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200.</v>

2808
02:07:37.421 --> 02:07:38.254

<v Speaker 3>feet of a sent 15,240 meters of a cent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More than 96,000 feet of elevation </v>

2810
02:07:48.611 --> 02:07:49.444
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred and three point eight miles </v>

2811
02:07:51.971 --> 02:07:54.970
<v Speaker 3>nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Point to point six.</v>

2812
02:07:54.971 --> 02:07:57.010
<v Speaker 3>Sleep stations with full aid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hot food,</v>

2813
02:07:57.011 --> 02:08:00.190
<v Speaker 3>medical and crew access.</v>
<v Speaker 3>16 full aid stations.</v>

2814
02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:04.960
<v Speaker 3>The race starts at Mount St Helens in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cascade mountain range of Washington</v>

2815
02:08:04.961 --> 02:08:07.480
<v Speaker 3>state and finishes in Randall </v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington.</v>

2816
02:08:07.481 --> 02:08:10.570
<v Speaker 3>Traversing point to point the cascade </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains.</v>

2817
02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:11.493
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

2818
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:15.030
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my goal with it and I've never done a</v>

2819
02:08:15.031 --> 02:08:15.864
<v Speaker 2>200,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously the furthest I've run is 106 </v>

2820
02:08:18.031 --> 02:08:21.990
<v Speaker 2>and a half miles in 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this will be a new test.</v>

2821
02:08:22.050 --> 02:08:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my goal for this ad,</v>

2822
02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:27.660
<v Speaker 2>and I don't even know if it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to sleep,</v>

2823
02:08:27.661 --> 02:08:29.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't take advantage of any of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep stages.</v>

2824
02:08:29.381 --> 02:08:33.660
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to push through and </v>
<v Speaker 2>finish in 60 hours and last year,</v>

2825
02:08:33.661 --> 02:08:36.150
<v Speaker 2>64 hours one it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm trying to,</v>

2826
02:08:36.270 --> 02:08:39.510
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm training you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>beat that I want to beat that.</v>

2827
02:08:39.590 --> 02:08:40.423
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to beat six 64 and I just want </v>

2828
02:08:42.341 --> 02:08:43.710

<v Speaker 2>I want to grind it out.</v>

2829
02:08:43.711 --> 02:08:46.740
<v Speaker 2>I want to be better than I've ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

2830
02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:48.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now I'm training.</v>

2831
02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:52.200
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been training this hard this </v>
<v Speaker 2>early in the year so I'm taking it.</v>

2832
02:08:52.690 --> 02:08:53.523
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing a lot of miles but not </v>
<v Speaker 2>hammering hard and a bill trying to </v>

2833
02:08:57.361 --> 02:08:59.970
<v Speaker 2>build up that base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So come August,</v>

2834
02:09:00.210 --> 02:09:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I hope to line up there for the big foot</v>
<v Speaker 2>200.</v>

2835
02:09:02.341 --> 02:09:04.500
<v Speaker 2>And I hope to run it faster than it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever been run.</v>

2836
02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:05.823
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to lose body mass before </v>

2837
02:09:08.491 --> 02:09:10.290
<v Speaker 2>you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're always lifting weights.</v>

2838
02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do differently?</v>

2839
02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:16.450
<v Speaker 2>I need to get lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A way about what [inaudible] 77.</v>

2840

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was up one 82 or 83 and so I'm </v>

2842
02:09:20.731 --> 02:09:22.140
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get down.</v>

2843
02:09:22.290 --> 02:09:25.320
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to get 69 maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2844
02:09:25.321 --> 02:09:29.220
<v Speaker 2>and I think I just really feel like I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>be efficient at that and I just,</v>

2845
02:09:29.250 --> 02:09:30.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2846
02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:32.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's physical,</v>

2847
02:09:32.401 --> 02:09:36.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's a lot mental also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean I'll get my,</v>

2848
02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:37.193
<v Speaker 2>I'll prepare my body for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just whether I can hydrate and </v>

2849
02:09:40.921 --> 02:09:42.450
<v Speaker 2>fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2850
02:09:42.451 --> 02:09:45.690
<v Speaker 2>well enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart enough and just do everything.</v>

2851
02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:48.270
<v Speaker 2>Keep my feet healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's going to determine whether</v>

2852
02:09:48.271 --> 02:09:49.770
<v Speaker 2>I can finish the 60 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2853
02:09:49.771 --> 02:09:50.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>

2854
02:09:50.940 --> 02:09:53.780
<v Speaker 2>I believe I have what it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2855
02:09:54.570 --> 02:09:56.940
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people probably have what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes,</v>

2856
02:09:57.330 --> 02:09:59.610
<v Speaker 2>but to implement it is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>

2857
02:09:59.611 --> 02:10:00.444
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2858
02:10:00.570 --> 02:10:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish it was tomorrow.</v>

2859
02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:05.910
<v Speaker 2>What's the percentage of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>start that thing versus completed?</v>

2860
02:10:06.230 --> 02:10:07.063
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty high percentage </v>

2861
02:10:08.311 --> 02:10:12.690
<v Speaker 2>because if you line up for 200,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't just decide to do that.</v>

2862
02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2863
02:10:13.860 --> 02:10:14.693
<v Speaker 2>These people are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've put in a lot of training and so </v>

2864
02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:21.090
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're crazy enough,</v>

2865
02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:22.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a thousand dollars to run </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2866
02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:26.730
<v Speaker 2>So if they're crazy enough to pay the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entry fee lineup there,</v>

2867
02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:30.000
<v Speaker 2>they didn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't on a whim.</v>

2868
02:10:30.210 --> 02:10:31.620
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've geared their life,</v>

2869
02:10:31.621 --> 02:10:32.940
<v Speaker 2>tore it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy too.</v>

2870
02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:34.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not a thousand mile.</v>

2871
02:10:34.350 --> 02:10:36.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not 200 miles on a flat track.</v>

2872
02:10:36.580 --> 02:10:38.540
<v Speaker 4>Now it's mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mountains.</v>

2873
02:10:38.541 --> 02:10:39.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2874
02:10:39.381 --> 02:10:44.210
<v Speaker 4>that 50,000 feet of ascent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what does that to Mount Everest.</v>

2875
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:47.600
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ is Mount Everest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thirty thousand feet.</v>

2876
02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:50.240
<v Speaker 4>I think it's 26.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She something like that.</v>

2877
02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:54.980
<v Speaker 4>So it's two of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it has that same,</v>

2878
02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:57.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's 96,000 feet or changed.</v>

2879
02:10:57.801 --> 02:10:58.634
<v Speaker 4>So what that means is you're grinding up</v>
<v Speaker 4>as much as you're hammering down and </v>

2880
02:11:01.131 --> 02:11:03.500
<v Speaker 4>that down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Break your quads down.</v>

2881
02:11:03.501 --> 02:11:06.390
<v Speaker 4>As you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a hard low yourself down.</v>

2882
02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:08.900
<v Speaker 4>This is a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2883
02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:11.030
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a country that it's in.</v>

2884
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:12.830
<v Speaker 4>What is this guy doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's walking.</v>

2885
02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:16.340
<v Speaker 4>Run Bitch while you're walking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there's like God,</v>

2886
02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:17.400
<v Speaker 4>this is the country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2887
02:11:17.420 --> 02:11:19.250
<v Speaker 4>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't run this.</v>

2888
02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:20.420
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold on a second.</v>

2889
02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:21.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like this.</v>

2890
02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:23.000
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck.</v>

2891
02:11:23.110 --> 02:11:24.890
<v Speaker 4>Artist ultra in the USA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2892
02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:26.660
<v Speaker 4>Do you know which way to go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you go left or right?</v>

2893
02:11:26.690 --> 02:11:27.523
<v Speaker 4>There'll be ribbons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's probably ribbons that'll </v>

2894
02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:30.890
<v Speaker 4>mark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this isn't.</v>

2895
02:11:31.190 --> 02:11:34.400
<v Speaker 4>Now you're not on a bike trail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the hardest ultra and the USA.</v>

2896
02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:36.020
<v Speaker 4>We need to document this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need.</v>

2897
02:11:36.021 --> 02:11:39.110
<v Speaker 4>This is 200 miles of this and if you try</v>
<v Speaker 4>to run,</v>

2898
02:11:39.210 --> 02:11:43.070
<v Speaker 4>here's what I learned with ultra is if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you try to run where it's super steep,</v>

2899
02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:45.020
<v Speaker 4>all you're doing is gonna blow your legs</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2900
02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:46.333
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you have to get good hiking tooth </v>

2901
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:51.350
<v Speaker 4>because you hiked the super steep stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>or this isn't even runnable really,</v>

2902
02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:52.403
<v Speaker 4>but you don't want even want to try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's all about being efficient in </v>

2903
02:11:55.311 --> 02:11:57.650
<v Speaker 4>managing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>managing your resource,</v>

2904
02:11:57.830 --> 02:12:00.240
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a test that's a,</v>

2905
02:12:00.530 --> 02:12:01.880
<v Speaker 4>to put it mildly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2906
02:12:01.910 --> 02:12:05.240
<v Speaker 4>So I mean that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2907
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:07.100
<v Speaker 4>this is what I live for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but listen dude,</v>

2908
02:12:07.101 --> 02:12:07.934
<v Speaker 4>there's a problem and that is that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>is in August and you need to be healthy </v>

2909
02:12:10.701 --> 02:12:13.720
<v Speaker 4>and September because we got to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're bowhunting temper.</v>

2910
02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:15.033
<v Speaker 4>It's all mental.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mental Madison is definitely some </v>

2911
02:12:18.891 --> 02:12:20.720
<v Speaker 4>physical involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2912
02:12:21.070 --> 02:12:24.050
<v Speaker 4>People have completed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno what,</v>

2913
02:12:24.410 --> 02:12:25.243
<v Speaker 4>what does that one nutty run that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>told me about that very few people know </v>

2914
02:12:27.771 --> 02:12:30.730
<v Speaker 4>about the Barclays.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you heard about this?</v>

2915
02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:31.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's intense.</v>

2916
02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:33.590
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like A.</v>

2917
02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:35.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if there's really a </v>
<v Speaker 4>course.</v>

2918
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.823
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have</v>

2919
02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:38.010
<v Speaker 5>snow course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

2920
02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:39.200
<v Speaker 5>it's really loose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

2921
02:12:39.250 --> 02:12:40.640
<v Speaker 5>it's not marked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can get lost.</v>

2922
02:12:40.641 --> 02:12:41.540
<v Speaker 5>You have to have your own map.</v>

2923
02:12:41.650 --> 02:12:42.610
<v Speaker 4>Oh Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2924
02:12:42.611 --> 02:12:46.240
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's something like 64 miles maybe,</v>

2925
02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:47.890
<v Speaker 4>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2926
02:12:47.891 --> 02:12:50.440
<v Speaker 4>you're in swamps it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's nasty.</v>

2927
02:12:50.441 --> 02:12:51.274
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like for people finish or </v>

2928
02:12:53.891 --> 02:12:55.630
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they only allow in.</v>

2929
02:12:56.650 --> 02:12:58.660
<v Speaker 4>It's a small number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twelve 20.</v>

2930
02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:00.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that much about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've heard about it just yet.</v>

2931
02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:03.420
<v Speaker 5>Two people finish it each time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people don't finish it.</v>

2932
02:13:03.450 --> 02:13:04.283
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five.</v>

2933
02:13:04.590 --> 02:13:06.450
<v Speaker 5>You do it like I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I remember correctly,</v>

2934
02:13:06.451 --> 02:13:07.284
<v Speaker 5>it's like one one way up during the day </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you come back down at during the </v>

2935
02:13:11.031 --> 02:13:14.580
<v Speaker 5>night and then you switch and go the </v>
<v Speaker 5>opposite way the next day up and down.</v>

2936
02:13:14.581 --> 02:13:16.800
<v Speaker 5>And then if you can make it to that </v>
<v Speaker 5>fifth turn,</v>

2937
02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:18.930
<v Speaker 5>it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's also the same kind of way.</v>

2938
02:13:18.931 --> 02:13:20.550
<v Speaker 5>It's nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to sleep,</v>

2939
02:13:20.551 --> 02:13:21.384
<v Speaker 5>you sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You only have I think a window of like </v>

2940
02:13:22.921 --> 02:13:25.620
<v Speaker 5>36 hours total to finish the whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you can make it.</v>

2941
02:13:25.710 --> 02:13:26.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you don't,</v>

2942
02:13:26.581 --> 02:13:27.990
<v Speaker 4>maybe 48 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

2943
02:13:27.991 --> 02:13:29.790
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got your eye on that fucking thing.</v>

2944
02:13:30.660 --> 02:13:31.493
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that to me the navigation is a </v>

2945
02:13:36.301 --> 02:13:37.950
<v Speaker 4>whole different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2946
02:13:37.951 --> 02:13:39.840
<v Speaker 4>I want to be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be prepared.</v>

2947
02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:41.820
<v Speaker 4>I want to know where the course is </v>
<v Speaker 4>roughly.</v>

2948
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.070
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really want to waste time having</v>

2949
02:13:44.071 --> 02:13:47.130
<v Speaker 4>to read a map and a compass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a whole different challenge,</v>

2950
02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:49.440
<v Speaker 4>which maybe I'll get to that at some </v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

2951
02:13:49.441 --> 02:13:54.050
<v Speaker 4>Right now I just want to run 200 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to run it that race as fast as it</v>

2952
02:13:54.051 --> 02:13:56.670
<v Speaker 4>has been run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that.</v>

2953
02:13:56.671 --> 02:13:59.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what my body's going to do,</v>

2954
02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:01.080
<v Speaker 4>but I want to find out and I'm looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>forward to it.</v>

2955
02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:03.210
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's intense,</v>

2956
02:14:03.211 --> 02:14:03.600
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2957
02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:05.700
<v Speaker 4>I'll be ready by tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should document it.</v>

2958
02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:07.800
<v Speaker 4>I should be looking at a range rover </v>
<v Speaker 4>next to,</v>

2959
02:14:07.801 --> 02:14:09.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's conditioned.</v>

2960
02:14:09.790 --> 02:14:11.240
<v Speaker 4>Sipping lemonade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Control a drone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A drone.</v>

2962
02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:15.040
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2963
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:16.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2964
02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:18.240
<v Speaker 4>it's neat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does someone document that you would</v>

2965
02:14:18.241 --> 02:14:19.074
<v Speaker 4>have to have gopros on or something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that because someone has to go with you </v>

2966
02:14:21.250 --> 02:14:22.650
<v Speaker 4>that people have talked about filming </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2967
02:14:22.651 --> 02:14:23.484
<v Speaker 4>Maybe under armour will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure how they're going to do </v>

2968
02:14:24.811 --> 02:14:25.650
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2969
02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:28.290
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to have some fucking savage </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's willing to run it with you.</v>

2970
02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:30.870
<v Speaker 4>My brother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know my brother's going to run some of</v>

2971
02:14:30.871 --> 02:14:32.490
<v Speaker 4>it with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's a beast.</v>

2972
02:14:33.370 --> 02:14:34.203
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2973
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:36.210
<v Speaker 4>So He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he runs,</v>

2974
02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:40.350
<v Speaker 4>he's done 100 before run in your family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2975
02:14:40.351 --> 02:14:41.280
<v Speaker 4>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's tough.</v>

2976
02:14:41.281 --> 02:14:42.114
<v Speaker 4>Dad was like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was your dad wouldn't track and </v>

2977
02:14:44.221 --> 02:14:45.210
<v Speaker 4>field athlete as well?</v>

2978
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:46.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

2979
02:14:46.250 --> 02:14:46.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

2980
02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:50.700
<v Speaker 4>my dad was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not athletic.</v>

2981
02:14:50.730 --> 02:14:55.730
<v Speaker 4>My Dad was a freak and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had full scholarships at Oregon,</v>

2982
02:14:56.521 --> 02:15:00.120
<v Speaker 4>Oregon State for track and field and </v>
<v Speaker 4>gymnastics to different sports.</v>

2983
02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:03.510
<v Speaker 4>He's pretty tall for a gymnast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was around six foot tall,</v>

2984
02:15:03.511 --> 02:15:07.050
<v Speaker 4>but just crazy ability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2985
02:15:08.090 --> 02:15:10.410
<v Speaker 4>he was an amazing athlete so I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>get that,</v>

2986
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:15.470
<v Speaker 4>but maybe I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got enough of it to be tough to see.</v>

2987
02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:17.430
<v Speaker 4>When people say that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2988
02:15:17.431 --> 02:15:19.980
<v Speaker 4>what have you attempted to do that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletic wear?</v>

2989
02:15:19.981 --> 02:15:21.300
<v Speaker 4>You failed that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like people that say,</v>

2990
02:15:21.301 --> 02:15:22.380
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a really good athlete.</v>

2991
02:15:22.381 --> 02:15:23.214
<v Speaker 4>Like what does a really good athlete and</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who practices the techniques of </v>

2992
02:15:26.521 --> 02:15:28.740
<v Speaker 4>whatever sport they're trying to do and </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets really good at it.</v>

2993
02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:29.611
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2994
02:15:29.611 --> 02:15:31.980
<v Speaker 4>you're really good at running and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>really good at bowhunting.</v>

2995
02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:34.320
<v Speaker 4>Bonnie is absolutely athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2996
02:15:34.710 --> 02:15:37.200
<v Speaker 4>It's like if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if golf is a fucking sport,</v>

2997
02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:41.070
<v Speaker 4>what's Boeing is a problem with calling </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting a sport.</v>

2998
02:15:41.071 --> 02:15:45.810
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people out because I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>best described as a discipline because I</v>

2999
02:15:45.811 --> 02:15:47.340
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like to think of it as something</v>

3000
02:15:47.341 --> 02:15:48.600
<v Speaker 4>that you score points.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3001
02:15:48.601 --> 02:15:50.130
<v Speaker 4>either I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too trivial.</v>

3002
02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:51.990
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's too much of life.</v>

3003
02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:53.580
<v Speaker 4>But I do think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3004
02:15:54.090 --> 02:15:57.430
<v Speaker 4>there is athleticism within bowhunting </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred percent,</v>

3005
02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:00.720
<v Speaker 4>especially out west,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in the mountains in Alaska.</v>

3006
02:16:01.140 --> 02:16:02.670
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>

3007
02:16:02.671 --> 02:16:03.504
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3008
02:16:04.450 --> 02:16:04.920
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3009
02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:05.753
<v Speaker 4>when I think when people think athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think to General the sports track </v>

3010
02:16:09.121 --> 02:16:10.440
<v Speaker 4>and field football,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basketball,</v>

3011
02:16:10.700 --> 02:16:11.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>

3012
02:16:11.701 --> 02:16:12.534
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3013
02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:13.373
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get that elite athleticism in </v>

3014
02:16:15.391 --> 02:16:17.490
<v Speaker 4>those sports as my dad did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3015
02:16:17.491 --> 02:16:20.130
<v Speaker 4>I think he had the ability to make the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Olympics.</v>

3016
02:16:20.170 --> 02:16:21.990
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3017
02:16:22.260 --> 02:16:23.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>life happened.</v>

3018
02:16:23.191 --> 02:16:25.740
<v Speaker 4>I was born this or that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he was.</v>

3019
02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:28.260
<v Speaker 4>He was a freak and in what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you might.</v>

3020
02:16:29.330 --> 02:16:30.550
<v Speaker 4>Normal athletic</v>

3021
02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:32.560
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe bowhunting,</v>

3022
02:16:32.670 --> 02:16:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>qualifies on.</v>

3023
02:16:34.020 --> 02:16:37.460
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 percent qualifies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this fighting qualifiers,</v>

3024
02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:38.890
<v Speaker 1>athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it does,</v>

3025
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:41.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's way more intense than regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletics.</v>

3026
02:16:41.291 --> 02:16:42.124
<v Speaker 1>It's something way more personal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous about the goal of knocking </v>

3027
02:16:46.961 --> 02:16:49.760
<v Speaker 1>someone unconscious while they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to knock you unconscious and if,</v>

3028
02:16:49.780 --> 02:16:51.490
<v Speaker 1>if fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that counts.</v>

3029
02:16:52.030 --> 02:16:55.060
<v Speaker 1>That's athletics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bowhunting is most certainly athletics,</v>

3030
02:16:55.061 --> 02:16:55.894
<v Speaker 1>but I think we both agree that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit more intense than a </v>

3031
02:16:58.841 --> 02:16:59.770
<v Speaker 1>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3032
02:16:59.950 --> 02:17:01.000
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more,</v>

3033
02:17:01.090 --> 02:17:04.460
<v Speaker 1>it's almost disrespectful in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>

3034
02:17:04.510 --> 02:17:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you consider it a sport,</v>

3035
02:17:05.651 --> 02:17:06.670
<v Speaker 1>you call it a sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine,</v>

3036
02:17:06.671 --> 02:17:07.504
<v Speaker 1>but in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much about the life and the </v>

3037
02:17:11.621 --> 02:17:13.810
<v Speaker 1>reverence for this animal that you hunt </v>
<v Speaker 1>an intake.</v>

3038
02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:15.273
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

3039
02:17:15.970 --> 02:17:18.520
<v Speaker 1>We won the superbowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we scored the goal.</v>

3040
02:17:18.550 --> 02:17:19.383
<v Speaker 1>The ball went in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hole is the journey is the journey </v>

3041
02:17:22.091 --> 02:17:23.310
<v Speaker 1>is not just a punch tags.</v>

3042
02:17:23.310 --> 02:17:24.370
<v Speaker 1>So the Punch tag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>

3043
02:17:24.610 --> 02:17:25.750
<v Speaker 1>well I won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3044
02:17:26.140 --> 02:17:26.973
<v Speaker 1>I won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a sport there's a winner and the </v>

3045
02:17:28.721 --> 02:17:30.130
<v Speaker 1>loser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kill the animal,</v>

3046
02:17:30.131 --> 02:17:31.060
<v Speaker 1>you punch your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tag,</v>

3047
02:17:31.061 --> 02:17:32.740
<v Speaker 1>you one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not it.</v>

3048
02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:34.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole journey that lease it.</v>

3049
02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:35.793
<v Speaker 1>And then also we talk about the getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meat home and providing for your </v>

3050
02:17:38.891 --> 02:17:41.190
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you score that you can.</v>

3051
02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:42.033
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a sport in that regard for </v>

3052
02:17:43.541 --> 02:17:44.374
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3053
02:17:45.430 --> 02:17:48.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a discipline and even that word is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3054
02:17:48.611 --> 02:17:52.150
<v Speaker 1>it's Bonnie is bowhunting man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

3055
02:17:52.290 --> 02:17:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on the song.</v>

3056
02:17:53.250 --> 02:17:55.150
<v Speaker 1>It's not a tone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got its own thing.</v>

3057
02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:57.310
<v Speaker 1>And on that note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to catch a flight.</v>

3058
02:17:57.350 --> 02:17:58.300
