WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.270
<v Speaker 1>It's always hard to stop a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we started in a natural way</v>

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>after you smoke pot at 10:00 in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning on a Monday.</v>

3
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot.</v>

4
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too much going on.</v>

5
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>We can't be asked to start and stop a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

6
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>

7
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:26.090
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go.</v>

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the pot pauses are weird,</v>

9
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>and start the show data that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

11
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>you got to listen to a whole theme song</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you going to wait.</v>

12
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>And then like how long ago?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the wrong way to do it.</v>

13
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>We made a few mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big one was um.</v>

14
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.413
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that me?</v>

15
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Whoops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done that in a long time.</v>

16
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I thought I had this close to swear to</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

17
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>I come the apple thing when you hit your</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple TV press play on your fucking</v>

18
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>itunes on your computer.</v>

19
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>

23
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.390

<v Speaker 1>Both.</v>

24
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>So if you have apple TV and the computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>open at the same time.</v>

25
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>So if you're watching on TV and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a computer or if you have a quicktime</v>

61
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the question.</v>

62
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.600
<v Speaker 1>If you could live with everything else</v>
<v Speaker 1>being yes fingertips.</v>

63
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe one hand.</v>

64
00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:57.580
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cock phase.</v>

65
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

66
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people are smart enough to start</v>

67
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>manipulating bodies like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think they're going to keep the</v>

68
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:09.920
<v Speaker 1>same shape that we have now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

69
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Go round like the rod to from the New</v>
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars.</v>

70
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that looks right.</v>

71
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Would there be a better designed than</v>
<v Speaker 1>this bipedal hominid form that we use?</v>

72
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Like would we get to a point where like</v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetically,</v>

73
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>like we started changing things on</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

74
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like have a chainsaw hands while I was</v>

75
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>thinking like Minotaur bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like clearly you know,</v>

76
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.510
<v Speaker 1>how much of you wants to be a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many legs want run a lot faster on</v>

77
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>four legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the first guy to have four legs and</v>

78
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like Whoa.</v>

79
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And for no reason it doesn't make any</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

80
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>but girls are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hard to get lucky.</v>

81
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Some fucking freak DNA thing that pops</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a female's head when they see a man</v>

82
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>with four legs and they just can't help</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

83
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did this to get faster,</v>

84
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:03.570

<v Speaker 1>the viral companies and the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and the PR firms and like get it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there where it's an attractive thing.</v>

88
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.290

92
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.880

<v Speaker 1>That could totally be done.</v>

93
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen some of the crazy things</v>

00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>that people are doing with their bodies</v>
<v Speaker 1>these days.</v>

95
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Definitely want something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

<v Speaker 1>modifications today.</v>

98
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I was jealous when those shoes with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheels came out of the bottom of the</v>

99
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll never made it for adult sizes.</v>

100
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:47.380
<v Speaker 1>So I was pissed about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To make feet with wheels on it.</v>

101
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 1>You should start a company licensed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

102
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

103
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.070

<v Speaker 1>They'd be so much.</v>

104
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Why is it no fun to do it as an adult?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the problem.</v>

105
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Straight away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't fucking.</v>

106
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to be enjoying so</v>
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.340
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a grownup.</v>

108
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Supposed to stop the one with chores</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheeled around the mall.</v>

111
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>But you got to stay on your back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feet seems like an awkward way to stand.</v>

112
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 1>It's probably bad for old people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop in back wise.</v>

113
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>You look back a lot of strain on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>back like that.</v>

114
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.000

00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:40.920
<v Speaker 1>at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

119
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>this dude who's a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is his name?</v>

120
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Jamie know that dude's name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about,</v>

121
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir?</v>

122
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Ben Kingsley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

123
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Might have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot his name.</v>

124
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

125
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.400
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

126
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 1>he has a white one who's tooling around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parking lot with tate and I go,</v>

127
00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how</v>

128
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 2>hard is it to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

129
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 2>try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

130
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got on and I was like,</v>

131
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I'll ever get good at</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking insane.</v>

132
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:05.931
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

133
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 2>Just two wheels and basically it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>

134
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.380
<v Speaker 2>it's some form of a gyroscope and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like those scooter things that they have</v>

135
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 2>the mall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are those things called again?</v>

136
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Segues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>segways,</v>

137
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 2>segway things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever ridden one of those?</v>

138
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really Fun.</v>

139
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 2>Kevin James had one on the set of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zookeeper moving.</v>

140
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually had a couple of them and he</v>

141
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 2>would zoom around the parking them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do Dare fucking fun.</v>

142
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 2>They're really cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when they run out of batteries,</v>

143
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.950
<v Speaker 2>you go flying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then another stop brighter.</v>

144
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Do the battery just breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the battery runs out of juice,</v>

145
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 2>you go down hard on it because it's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>only reason why it's keeping you up,</v>

146
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:47.680
<v Speaker 2>but you're not doing that yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a gyroscope like gets it's</v>

147
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.500
<v Speaker 2>counter balancing you as you really</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be a stable.</v>

148
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could definitely fall.</v>

149
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 2>You definitely can fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really easy to ride like you</v>

150
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm saying gyroscope properly or</v>

151
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 2>explaining the physics behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No idea what a gyroscope is to be</v>

152
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:04.610
<v Speaker 2>honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scooters it called.</v>

153
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you say that it's run like a</v>

154
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:08.780
<v Speaker 2>gyroscope?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that.</v>

155
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.050
<v Speaker 2>Am I making things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a gyroscope of the thing that you</v>

156
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 2>get to the air and space museum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that's keeping balance like</v>

157
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.173
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

158
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Can you pull up the definition of</v>
<v Speaker 2>gyroscope?</v>

159
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Just so I don't feel like an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to know if that's what it is</v>

160
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:27.370
<v Speaker 2>because I've always been saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

161
00:07:27.371 --> 00:07:27.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I'm,</v>

162
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking while I'm saying,</v>

163
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:32.870
<v Speaker 2>am I right that that's a gyroscope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what a gyroscope covers,</v>

164
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever this technology they've</v>

165
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 2>invented for segue there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pull the string and it stays.</v>

166
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.370
<v Speaker 2>It stays spending forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

167
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 2>The orientation of the access is</v>
<v Speaker 2>unaffected by tilting the rotation of</v>

168
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:46.910
<v Speaker 2>the mounting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

169
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:50.860
<v Speaker 2>So that does make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also in like drones to keep them up,</v>

170
00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:51.694
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

171
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.573
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

172
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.100
<v Speaker 2>GPS to help them keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right to the good Lord.</v>

173
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Was the drone almost switch gear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

174
00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:59.540
<v Speaker 2>we watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck,</v>

175
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:01.740
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember the guy who died in the</v>

176
00:08:01.741 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 2>segway guy died.</v>

177
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 2>We went off a cliff at one of the guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>that own the company or the inventor of</v>

178
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:10.480
<v Speaker 2>it</v>
<v Speaker 2>died on a segway going off a cliff when</v>

179
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 2>he went to patent that thing my friend</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked at the patent office.</v>

180
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 2>When he came in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't,</v>

181
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.770
<v Speaker 2>he didn't submit any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a blueprint.</v>

182
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.360
<v Speaker 2>You just brought one in and had</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody write it.</v>

183
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.290
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is he near cliff?</v>

184
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Why is he like got on the road?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

185
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 2>he went off the cliff then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Off-Road segue.</v>

186
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a terrible idea.</v>

187
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 2>Until they have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

188
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 2>But if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a terrible idea.</v>

189
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Road segway because unless those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>are like way improved,</v>

190
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 2>I would think that the batteries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you couldn't rocks and shit,</v>

191
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:44.240
<v Speaker 2>giant tires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of like running over a rock and</v>

192
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:48.530
<v Speaker 2>hitting your electrical system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me As someone with zero knowledge of</v>

193
00:08:48.531 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 2>even how electricity works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to comment on this</v>

194
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

195
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 2>like I don't know what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>electricity</v>

196
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you can't stick a fork in the</v>

197
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:00.410
<v Speaker 1>hole or you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I</v>

198
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.310
<v Speaker 1>have such a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like.</v>

199
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Hold on because your feet though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connect like shut up.</v>

200
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was this dude.</v>

201
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.690
<v Speaker 1>What are you showing me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The TV shredder.</v>

202
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:18.590
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll segue segue.</v>

203
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.350
<v Speaker 1>It's just real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at where to hold gas masks.</v>

204
00:09:23.351 --> 00:09:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Looks like Halo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like a fucking.</v>

205
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's wearing a business suit.</v>

206
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.380
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got tires like a tank.</v>

207
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.820
<v Speaker 1>That is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That desert video.</v>

208
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:42.250
<v Speaker 1>You gotta show me a video though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it goes sidesaddle sports.</v>

209
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess right.</v>

210
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.860
<v Speaker 1>That guy in that position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

211
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 1>that seems weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a weird way to stay.</v>

212
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just that one picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this fucking little mini tank.</v>

213
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 1>That is bad ass.</v>

214
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fucking why not,</v>

215
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:06.451
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

216
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:11.451
<v Speaker 1>he's going up the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No way there was going to jump.</v>

217
00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Just a seesaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A seesaw wise is one of the dumbest</v>

218
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.080
<v Speaker 1>tricks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why this is to show that he can go</v>

219
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:26.730
<v Speaker 1>over obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh whoa.</v>

220
00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:27.564
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hell yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

223
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:34.170
<v Speaker 1>this thing is actually really bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts over.</v>

224
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:39.171
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easy.</v>

225
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

226
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.920
<v Speaker 1>What is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This a DTV shredder.</v>

227
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one.</v>

228
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.370
<v Speaker 1>The thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even that heavy.</v>

229
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Like when he falls down and she wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fell down,</v>

230
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.170
<v Speaker 1>look like he just picks it up and moves</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

231
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not that big of a flip back</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

232
00:10:57.091 --> 00:10:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

233
00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.370
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking a motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why the fuck do you want a</v>

234

360
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.390
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about like a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that it did like a,</v>

361
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.400
<v Speaker 1>like there was one that was a nurse that</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

369
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:19.780
<v Speaker 1>would want to consciously,</v>

<v Speaker 2>someone to get it here.</v>

00:21:10.631 --> 00:21:12.080
<v Speaker 2>I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the fact I.</v>

452
00:21:12.081 --> 00:21:13.840
<v Speaker 2>I would never do what you're doing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your phone,</v>

453
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.870
<v Speaker 2>but I like what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing is you're looking at</v>

454
00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:19.600
<v Speaker 2>the data and deciding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

455
00:21:19.601 --> 00:21:21.670
<v Speaker 2>how much willpower do I have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Enough.</v>

456
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

00:21:22.961 --> 00:21:23.630
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how.</v>

458
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.830
<v Speaker 2>That's where to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I analyze the stats on my life and I was</v>

459
00:21:26.831 --> 00:21:27.281
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

460
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:29.920
<v Speaker 2>I can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you did it very intelligently.</v>

461
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Like it's very difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult for people to not</v>

462
00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Speaker 2>just look at some weird addiction that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might have,</v>

463
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.310
<v Speaker 2>but to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

464
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.450
<v Speaker 2>even though there's all this amazing</v>
<v Speaker 2>convenience of being able to buy movie</v>

465
00:21:43.451 --> 00:21:47.470
<v Speaker 2>tickets and being able to check websites</v>
<v Speaker 2>and answer emails on your phone,</v>

466
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:49.060
<v Speaker 2>it's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the justification.</v>

467
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too much.</v>

468
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how when you see someone on TV</v>

469
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:55.540
<v Speaker 2>smoking cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never really smoked,</v>

470
00:21:55.541 --> 00:21:56.470
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

471
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:57.460
<v Speaker 2>I never spoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only smoke.</v>

472
00:21:57.461 --> 00:21:59.300
<v Speaker 2>When you see somebody just triggers</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

473
00:21:59.301 --> 00:22:01.250
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

474
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.370

<v Speaker 2>Some people smoke no matter what,</v>

475
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.160
<v Speaker 2>just or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted the comedy store at smoke.</v>

476
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.331
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny though,</v>

477
00:22:07.331 --> 00:22:09.760
<v Speaker 2>when I see people get high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does the opposite.</v>

478
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.640
<v Speaker 2>It makes me not want to get high go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My God.</v>

479
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Do I sound that stupid?</v>

480
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because sometimes you'll say things when</v>

481
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:19.590
<v Speaker 2>you're high and as you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me like,</v>

482
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.690
<v Speaker 2>like you would if you were to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

483
00:22:22.691 --> 00:22:24.640
<v Speaker 2>he's an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But believe me,</v>

484
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

485
00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:29.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come say as I'm saying it,</v>

486
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking I'm an idiot sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

487
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.480
<v Speaker 2>this is somebody should write this down</v>
<v Speaker 2>or lift the media because it's brilliant</v>

489
00:22:36.191 --> 00:22:38.920

<v Speaker 2>I did a scene on news radio once with</v>

490
00:22:38.921 --> 00:22:41.740
<v Speaker 2>Bob Costa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a very nice guy.</v>

491
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Bob Cost is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very,</v>

492
00:22:43.511 --> 00:22:46.630
<v Speaker 2>very intelligent guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had the scene and um,</v>

493
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.690
<v Speaker 2>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he beats me up pillar custard,</v>

494

<v Speaker 2>flip me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does this like judo flip and go into</v>

495
00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:54.690

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

496
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.880
<v Speaker 2>but afterwards we were all out talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and while we were talking I had smoked</v>

497
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
<v Speaker 2>pot and I was rambling to him</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I was.</v>

498
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I remember talking to him about dupont</v>
<v Speaker 2>making the chemical compound for nylon,</v>

499
00:23:14.861 --> 00:23:18.050
<v Speaker 2>like at the same time when they made</v>

536
00:24:52.101 --> 00:24:53.960
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

<v Speaker 1>All the minorities,</v>

<v Speaker 1>being that thing of girls or minority.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl TV.</v>

544
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.700
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard a girl be described as</v>

545
00:25:10.701 --> 00:25:12.260
<v Speaker 1>a minority even though they're 52</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I would see a ratio on TV.</v>

548
00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

549
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.660
<v Speaker 1>When you say underrepresented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like less than half the people on TV are</v>

550
00:25:23.661 --> 00:25:24.520
<v Speaker 1>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Standup is a lot more to do.</v>

552
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 1>It's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show me more about what you think about</v>

553
00:25:31.341 --> 00:25:34.310
<v Speaker 1>movies or TV shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very few walking dead.</v>

554
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Women have an even number.</v>

555
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.250
<v Speaker 1>They have an even number of boys and</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls,</v>

556
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and somehow those people aren't hooking</v>

557
00:25:42.711 --> 00:25:44.330
<v Speaker 1>up like what do we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Forever.</v>

558
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I remember that couple barely and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fall deeply in love while they</v>

559
00:25:48.801 --> 00:25:51.050
<v Speaker 1>fight off the zombies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

560
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.750
<v Speaker 1>They never even filed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Land was watching him in that one</v>

561
00:25:53.751 --> 00:25:55.010
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just staring at them.</v>

562
00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

563
00:25:56.041 --> 00:25:57.230
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The comedian,</v>

564
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Josh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh,</v>

565
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Josh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh,</v>

566
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Josh is looking at and let them look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember how we worked with Josh</v>

567
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:10.580
<v Speaker 1>would do that Gig?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it Duncan?</v>

568
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Might've been Duncan on me and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in Arizona.</v>

569
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in Arizona and this was,</v>

570
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:20.830
<v Speaker 1>I think this was a d has no show</v>
<v Speaker 1>started it,</v>

571
00:26:21.581 --> 00:26:23.900
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I went out on the road with</v>

572
00:26:23.901 --> 00:26:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan is because he needed a second</v>
<v Speaker 1>person to open for him because Diaz was</v>

573
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:30.530
<v Speaker 1>at best 70 slash 30 to show up.</v>

574
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.270
<v Speaker 1>It was more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was more than that.</v>

575
00:26:32.271 --> 00:26:35.540
<v Speaker 1>In all fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was only a few instances where it</v>

576
00:26:35.541 --> 00:26:37.910
<v Speaker 1>didn't work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I get stuck with nobody.</v>

577
00:26:37.911 --> 00:26:40.580
<v Speaker 1>So you'll find the hub to case he showed</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

578
00:26:40.581 --> 00:26:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd Joey and I always felt like I have</v>

579
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:48.140
<v Speaker 1>an obligation to let joey be Joey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What great.</v>

580
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.071
<v Speaker 1>When it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

581
00:26:50.071 --> 00:26:52.320
<v Speaker 1>you might not show up today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just hire more people.</v>

582

<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

587
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.870
<v Speaker 1>if you get close to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's beautiful.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He could do that forever,</v>

604
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:45.954
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

606
00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:53.361
<v Speaker 1>I've never met anybody who I've known</v>

618
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was the verification from onstage?</v>

619
00:28:20.711 --> 00:28:22.380
<v Speaker 1>She calls you and you were at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Improv?</v>

620
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did I.</v>

621
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.040
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This girl said,</v>

622
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.510
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not friends,</v>

623
00:28:27.511 --> 00:28:29.700
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my phone or something like that.</v>

624
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.410
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that I'm getting on the phone</v>

625
00:28:33.411 --> 00:28:34.500
<v Speaker 1>proves it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

626
00:28:34.501 --> 00:28:36.360
<v Speaker 1>It was a heckler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's being mean to him?</v>

627
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's better with the hecklers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>triple,</v>

628
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.980
<v Speaker 1>triple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's franchise.</v>

629
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:43.950
<v Speaker 1>He's been in the trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

630
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Diaz</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tripoli's a comedy store at dude.</v>

631
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Those comedy store guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially us from like the nineties,</v>

632
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.120
<v Speaker 1>there was no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was.</v>

633
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.020
<v Speaker 1>There was no crowd control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely get off like there's no one</v>

634
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:59.400
<v Speaker 1>fighting for 10 minutes.</v>

635
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.870
<v Speaker 1>No one's even telling him to shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come fucking Holtzman got knocked</v>

636
00:29:03.871 --> 00:29:04.860
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

637
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:05.743
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got.</v>

638
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.670
<v Speaker 1>He got punched in the face by someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodyguard.</v>

639
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately one time tackled somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking by the front row and the</v>

640
00:29:18.061 --> 00:29:22.980
<v Speaker 1>original room and they walked in between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the front row of chairs and the table</v>

641
00:29:22.981 --> 00:29:23.640
<v Speaker 1>chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

642
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.570
<v Speaker 1>this was one of the words like it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage one,</v>

643
00:29:26.571 --> 00:29:29.430
<v Speaker 1>like with the tables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're walking through there and he</v>

644
00:29:29.431 --> 00:29:32.340
<v Speaker 1>saw them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just leaned over and grabbed onto</v>

645
00:29:32.341 --> 00:29:35.440
<v Speaker 1>their shoulders and just left his body</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight drop.</v>

646
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I just brought him to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just going back to their seat.</v>

647
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a responsible person and an adult,</v>

648
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:51.850
<v Speaker 1>if you're running that business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you fire a gun check theirs?</v>

649
00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that how you look at it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can Be like you can't.</v>

650
00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:58.120
<v Speaker 1>That's why yelp reviews of comedy clubs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of the greatest things in the</v>

651
00:29:58.121 --> 00:30:00.490
<v Speaker 1>world because they point out stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like.</v>

652
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.590
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it as a yelp review of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

653
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.710
<v Speaker 1>but they're like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally one of the employees said,</v>

654
00:30:05.711 --> 00:30:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I hope I die in a fire when I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

655
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if a waiter set out to you and</v>

656
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.421
<v Speaker 1>then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

657
00:30:13.421 --> 00:30:17.020
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about David Taylor came</v>
<v Speaker 1>from running you out of there and now</v>

658
00:30:17.021 --> 00:30:19.600
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you think about it on the way home.</v>

659
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:26.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't want your business that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>running out of there too.</v>

660
00:30:26.021 --> 00:30:27.700
<v Speaker 1>You were probably a dick enough to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

661
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:29.380
<v Speaker 1>we don't want you back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most important.</v>

662
00:30:29.381 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 1>What will you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can run into Dick's man,</v>

663
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.380
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of times it's just people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know how to behave.</v>

664
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Like Chapelle was at the store the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>night and some guy kept yelling shit out</v>

665
00:30:39.821 --> 00:30:40.541
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the crowd.</v>

666
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Started yelling at the guy to shut the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck up.</v>

667
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:43.710
<v Speaker 1>That's both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

668
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:47.710
<v Speaker 1>was he was just so obnoxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he just couldn't believe he was</v>

669
00:30:47.711 --> 00:30:49.570
<v Speaker 1>talking to Dave Chappelle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

670
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:54.310
<v Speaker 1>he's just drunk and he fucked up and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people around him were responding and it</v>

671
00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:58.840
<v Speaker 1>started getting Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the star never had anybody to like,</v>

672
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.720
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that at the Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will grab you and they'll pull you</v>

673
00:31:01.721 --> 00:31:02.380
<v Speaker 1>out of there.</v>

674
00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like was this comedian,</v>

675
00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.280
<v Speaker 1>so we're outside fucking smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's parent attrition.</v>

676
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.450
<v Speaker 1>We're worried about talking to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>chick.</v>

677
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.810
<v Speaker 1>No one's paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to get a door guy.</v>

678
00:31:13.811 --> 00:31:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

679
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I would say that it's way less necessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>today than it's ever been before.</v>

680
00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.470
<v Speaker 1>The crowds have been amazing at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>store lately.</v>

681
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.520
<v Speaker 1>They also sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

682
00:31:24.521 --> 00:31:26.320
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why Canadian crutches better</v>

683
00:31:26.321 --> 00:31:28.260
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's if you go into it and like</v>

684
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.300
<v Speaker 1>your listeners good with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of like,</v>

685
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.440
<v Speaker 1>here's the etiquette of what it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in a comedy show.</v>

686
00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I sort of get it already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they're just like a base level</v>

687
00:31:35.591 --> 00:31:37.870
<v Speaker 1>better crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know you're supposed to shut up</v>

688
00:31:37.871 --> 00:31:41.440
<v Speaker 1>and laugh and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people didn't get that message</v>

689
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.380
<v Speaker 1>going on though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

690
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.060
<v Speaker 1>That's part of what it is.</v>

691
00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't just don't know that yet.</v>

692
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is.</v>

693
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.910
<v Speaker 1>No one else is doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

694
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:58.960
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for some people that grew up</v>

695
00:31:58.961 --> 00:32:00.750
<v Speaker 1>around morons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

696
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:05.560
<v Speaker 1>if you grow up like exclusively around</v>
<v Speaker 1>morons and you've been responding to</v>

697
00:32:05.561 --> 00:32:08.530
<v Speaker 1>morons or whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden you're drinking</v>

699
00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.030
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know why you're doing it.</v>

700
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Like as it's coming out of your mouth,</v>

<v Speaker 1>great spirit that is inside?</v>

702
00:32:19.361 --> 00:32:22.050
<v Speaker 1>And I used to have more problems like</v>
<v Speaker 1>right after Chappelle show with a.</v>

703
00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.560

<v Speaker 1>like trouble,</v>

721
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:03.530

<v Speaker 1>steps,</v>

722
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.960
<v Speaker 1>watch while he was the biggest thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And there was a line out the door,</v>

725
00:33:10.491 --> 00:33:11.970
<v Speaker 1>people not being able to get in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

726

736
00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.113
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've lived outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go get a cigarette and come back in and</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll sit and watch the show.</v>

739
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:42.200
<v Speaker 1>And if someone is not doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you say something?</v>

740
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.720
<v Speaker 1>If your waiters being super rude to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or somebody,</v>

741
00:33:44.721 --> 00:33:46.180
<v Speaker 1>a plumber is being an asshole to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

743
00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:49.280
<v Speaker 1>but not if it's ruining everyone else's</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

744
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:50.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a movie.</v>

745
00:33:50.121 --> 00:33:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Go outside and complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

746
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:53.870
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessary.</v>

747
00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:58.700
<v Speaker 1>If other people were enjoying it for you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to enjoy pleasure.</v>

748
00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that happened sometimes.</v>

749
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:04.150
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned leading star wars going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a kid's movie I don't like.</v>

750
00:34:04.151 --> 00:34:06.950
<v Speaker 1>This is for kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids Go,</v>

751
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.350
<v Speaker 1>who are you rooting for me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

752
00:34:09.351 --> 00:34:11.000
<v Speaker 1>we know that because we're in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

753
00:34:11.001 --> 00:34:15.380
<v Speaker 1>I think for a lot of people this is all</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand and then there's</v>

754
00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:18.170
<v Speaker 1>also people who will tell you later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to hear and losing.</v>

755
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.110
<v Speaker 1>We were up on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to handle anything</v>

756
00:34:21.111 --> 00:34:23.540
<v Speaker 1>they throw at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the ways I had to</v>

757
00:34:23.541 --> 00:34:27.260
<v Speaker 1>handle this is to make you leave by an</v>
<v Speaker 1>off duty cop who's working with</v>

758
00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.280
<v Speaker 1>some weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people tell you what you're</v>

759
00:34:31.281 --> 00:34:34.790
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be able to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as a comedian,</v>

760
00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to be able to handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that magic going to a restaurant,</v>

761
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.070
<v Speaker 1>throwing a plate onto the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so will,</v>

762
00:34:40.071 --> 00:34:42.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because deal with spills all the time,</v>

764
00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:47.160
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody literally said when,</v>

765
00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:50.360
<v Speaker 1>when the subject of stealing jokes came</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

766
00:34:50.361 --> 00:34:51.860
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to write more jokes.</v>

767
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:55.970
<v Speaker 1>I remember someone saying that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to write more jokes.</v>

768
00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.680

<v Speaker 2>lesbians and set a bunch of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay things to them.</v>

855
00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was like a nasty exchange</v>

856
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:42.060
<v Speaker 2>trans guy and this girl and I'm the</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman sued and apparently I believe one</v>

857
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.000
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the specific mental damages.</v>

858
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Well I think she sued for like Jamie see</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he could pull that up.</v>

859
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what the charges</v>

860
00:38:56.711 --> 00:38:59.740
<v Speaker 2>were but it was everybody was like Whoa,</v>

861
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.530

862
00:39:02.531 --> 00:39:05.020
<v Speaker 2>$10,000 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then it becomes a thing where it's</v>

863
00:39:05.021 --> 00:39:08.590
<v Speaker 2>like you either have to make everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>sign a release for coming to a comedy</v>

864
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:11.600
<v Speaker 2>club or just saying you're going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>the art form as Jimmy pulls it off.</v>

865
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.650
<v Speaker 2>You can't take any more risks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to misquote anything.</v>

866
00:39:14.651 --> 00:39:16.720
<v Speaker 2>So I want to make sure I say this</v>
<v Speaker 2>incorrectly,</v>

867
00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:19.510
<v Speaker 2>but it was a story I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what happened was to Mike</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ward,</v>

869
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.620

<v Speaker 2>and so he was doing this,</v>

870
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.910
<v Speaker 2>there was this kid who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a wish kid,</v>

871
00:39:27.911 --> 00:39:28.810

<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going out and it was a big like on</v>

873
00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:35.170
<v Speaker 2>TV is like a coke campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

874
00:39:35.171 --> 00:39:37.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike had a bit about the 10 years later</v>

875
00:39:37.151 --> 00:39:39.550
<v Speaker 2>this kid's still alive and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my money back.</v>

876
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:44.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it started going off because I was</v>

877
00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.010
<v Speaker 3>fucking 23 now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

878

<v Speaker 3>and I think so fucking.</v>

879
00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.630
<v Speaker 3>And the kid said he got made fun of</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of it.</v>

880
00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't cool.</v>

881
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Jesus was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

882
00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.900
<v Speaker 3>sorry man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were like a celebrity and I'm going</v>

883
00:39:58.901 --> 00:40:02.300
<v Speaker 3>to make fun of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he got taken to a tribunal is going</v>

884
00:40:02.301 --> 00:40:04.090
<v Speaker 3>right now to a French Canadian tribunal.</v>

885
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

886
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:10.740
<v Speaker 2>What are they suing them for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charging them with or what are they</v>

887
00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:13.830
<v Speaker 2>doing a signing up for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the exact charges,</v>

888
00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:17.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's either 80 grand or more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sort of for,</v>

889
00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.980
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is then that just makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything off limits.</v>

890
00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.460
<v Speaker 2>It makes any sort of subject where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have no idea.</v>

891
00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.211
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

892
00:40:24.211 --> 00:40:29.211

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

897
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:46.000

<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

898
00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.720
<v Speaker 2>That's what Mike has been brought up</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a human rights tribunal.</v>

899

<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

903
00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.680
<v Speaker 2>here's one thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

906
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:08.100

<v Speaker 2>I'm on her side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she,</v>

908

<v Speaker 2>girlfriend and she didn't do anything,</v>

909
00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:16.710

<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

928
00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.760
<v Speaker 1>but how do you do a monetary number?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

929
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like how do you make,</v>

930
00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.500
<v Speaker 1>these are my doctor's bills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my cycle,</v>

931
00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.440
<v Speaker 1>my psychologist bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how much workup I've missed.</v>

932
00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.870
<v Speaker 1>You could do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in this case in grant is not a</v>

933
00:42:14.871 --> 00:42:15.980
<v Speaker 1>huge amount of money.</v>

934
00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like those Mcdonald's</v>

935
00:42:18.201 --> 00:42:19.450
<v Speaker 1>settlements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

936
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:23.010
<v Speaker 1>For comic though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's working for?</v>

937
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:23.771
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>

938
00:42:23.771 --> 00:42:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure has legal fees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

939
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.720
<v Speaker 1>But what I was going to get at is did</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl Heco first?</v>

940
00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:30.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that.</v>

941
00:42:30.401 --> 00:42:34.250
<v Speaker 1>That's what I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if she did then fuck her.</v>

942
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

943
00:42:35.451 --> 00:42:38.390
<v Speaker 1>he probably shouldn't say mean shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about her.</v>

944
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I've seen stories about a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comic going off on somebody,</v>

945
00:42:41.661 --> 00:42:45.290
<v Speaker 1>so when the court of public opinion like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get eviscerated because they went</v>

946
00:42:45.291 --> 00:42:47.880
<v Speaker 1>off to hard on somebody but then people</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have to show.</v>

947
00:42:47.881 --> 00:42:50.210
<v Speaker 1>But like none of this lady was heckling</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in the show.</v>

948
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what it says here in May of</v>
<v Speaker 1>2007.</v>

949
00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:58.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to read her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a girlfriend were at a club in</v>

950
00:42:58.131 --> 00:43:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have restaurant Vancouver restaurant</v>

951
00:43:00.351 --> 00:43:02.060
<v Speaker 1>with a largely gay clientele.</v>

952
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.810
<v Speaker 1>When an open mic night hosted by Mr Earl</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked off,</v>

953
00:43:05.811 --> 00:43:09.470
<v Speaker 1>the two women decided to stay according</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the latest findings of the human</v>

954
00:43:09.471 --> 00:43:14.471
<v Speaker 1>rights tribunal during the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mrs purdy's girlfriend had ms dot</v>

955
00:43:14.751 --> 00:43:19.751
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] girlfriend had merely pecked</v>
<v Speaker 1>her on the cheek when Mr Earl told the</v>

956
00:43:20.151 --> 00:43:22.940
<v Speaker 1>crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't mind that inconsiderate dyke table</v>

957
00:43:22.941 --> 00:43:23.751
<v Speaker 1>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

958
00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:25.450
<v Speaker 1>lesbians are always ruin it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

959
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Stop right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop right there.</v>

960
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Go back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me read that.</v>

961
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.360
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I did was this one,</v>

962
00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:36.020
<v Speaker 1>their mom being fully making out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then just dropping everyone.</v>

963
00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Why else would we say don't mind that</v>
<v Speaker 1>inconsiderate.</v>

964
00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:43.550
<v Speaker 1>You're ruining it for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine there's probably some</v>

965
00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.710
<v Speaker 1>chatter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

966
00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.810
<v Speaker 1>probably that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went off to hard,</v>

967
00:43:46.811 --> 00:43:47.960
<v Speaker 1>but we've all seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

968
00:43:47.961 --> 00:43:49.580
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to admit that they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

969
00:43:49.581 --> 00:43:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

970
00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.340
<v Speaker 1>It's always that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always like,</v>

971
00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:53.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do anything.</v>

972
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.980
<v Speaker 1>All he did was move my chair and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

973
00:43:54.981 --> 00:43:56.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would anyone throw you out when</v>

974
00:43:56.721 --> 00:44:00.770
<v Speaker 1>you're a customer for doing nothing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just laughing.</v>

975
00:44:00.771 --> 00:44:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different kinds of</v>

976
00:44:03.291 --> 00:44:04.280
<v Speaker 1>lesbians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

977
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.760
<v Speaker 1>there's like educated lesbians that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the art and then there's like the</v>

978
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:15.200
<v Speaker 1>bull dykey lesbians that are like more</v>
<v Speaker 1>thicker,</v>

979
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:17.270
<v Speaker 1>bigger boned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

980
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:21.020
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a lipstick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lesbians,</v>

981
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.980
<v Speaker 1>they all Buddhism as line prompted boost</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ms dot parties table and then they</v>

982
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.800
<v Speaker 1>escalated the string of slurs and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

983
00:44:27.801 --> 00:44:29.000
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like it,</v>

984
00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:30.620
<v Speaker 1>you're singing artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out.</v>

985
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this.</v>

986
00:44:32.011 --> 00:44:33.720
<v Speaker 1>So leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's okay.</v>

987
00:44:33.721 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 1>You can just leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

988
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:38.250
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to watch your money back fine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get your money back.</v>

989
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Or was it this where they just to really</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty interesting women.</v>

990
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:48.150
<v Speaker 1>And one of them did kiss her friend on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cheek lightly in the comic was</v>

991
00:44:48.151 --> 00:44:52.080
<v Speaker 1>eating Dick on stage and he started</v>
<v Speaker 1>blaming these girls for the fact that</v>

992
00:44:52.081 --> 00:44:52.860
<v Speaker 1>he's eating Dick onstage.</v>

993
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.210
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

994
00:44:54.211 --> 00:44:56.400
<v Speaker 1>So here's the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we should be fair here.</v>

995
00:44:56.401 --> 00:44:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

996
00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.450
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it was that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that scenario they should get</v>

997
00:45:00.451 --> 00:45:05.451
<v Speaker 1>their money back and leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still can't stop a guy of artists</v>

998
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:06.970
<v Speaker 1>from fucking trying something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

999
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd never get to know what the line is</v>

1000
00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:11.250
<v Speaker 1>unless you cross it and then you pull it</v>
<v Speaker 1>back a little bit,</v>

1001
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.060
<v Speaker 1>so if you don't let a guy even try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to the line,</v>

1002
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:16.500
<v Speaker 1>then you're hurting art in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what he said.</v>

1003
00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:18.900
<v Speaker 1>That's really rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not even lesbians.</v>

1004
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.390
<v Speaker 1>No Guy will fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're with each other.</v>

1005
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:22.543
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1006
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:27.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm still on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm smart.</v>

1007
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.760
<v Speaker 1>I see myself saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My darkest moments for sure depends</v>

1008
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

1009
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:35.150
<v Speaker 1>We see like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another problem.</v>

1010
00:45:35.151 --> 00:45:36.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem with when Kramer did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff,</v>

1011
00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:37.710
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1012
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the point of like,</v>

1013
00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:42.240
<v Speaker 1>I just want to hurt you now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not even what he was trying</v>

1014
00:45:42.241 --> 00:45:44.640
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing and looking at it on</v>

1015
00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:45.570
<v Speaker 1>print here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1016
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.310
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much different.</v>

1017
00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Much different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at it on print is so much</v>

1018
00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:51.300
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're missing.</v>

1019
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:52.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1020
00:45:52.921 --> 00:45:55.080
<v Speaker 1>we don't know if that's exactly what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>

1021
00:45:55.081 --> 00:45:57.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just taking from a recording or</v>

1022
00:45:57.061 --> 00:46:00.900
<v Speaker 1>just from people's memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how exactly do we know exactly what</v>

1023
00:46:00.901 --> 00:46:04.620
<v Speaker 1>he said and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said to call that discrimination,</v>

1024
00:46:04.621 --> 00:46:07.120
<v Speaker 1>but discrimination is if they wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them in because there were less</v>

1025
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:07.590
<v Speaker 1>young.</v>

1026
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Jamie</v>
<v Speaker 1>says in the court case,</v>

1027
00:46:11.191 --> 00:46:14.490
<v Speaker 1>they used a witness testimony from junk</v>
<v Speaker 1>patrons that were there.</v>

1028
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:17.670
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that because I don't</v>

1029
00:46:17.671 --> 00:46:21.150
<v Speaker 1>remember guys joke sometimes and I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking comedian.</v>

1030
00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.940
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doubt they remember exactly what he</v>

1031
00:46:23.941 --> 00:46:26.070
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if they're hammered.</v>

1032
00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was bullying him.</v>

1033
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.230
<v Speaker 1>He was an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1034
00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.280
<v Speaker 1>here's just going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

1035
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Know from Mike or if comics are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will eventually stop.</v>

1036
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.660
<v Speaker 1>They'll stop or they'll get better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll get better,</v>

1037
00:46:39.661 --> 00:46:42.860
<v Speaker 1>but if you're hecklin he's not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

1038
00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.690
<v Speaker 1>You're just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to do that.</v>

1039
00:46:45.691 --> 00:46:48.240
<v Speaker 1>And when you do do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you open the door to chaos.</v>

1040
00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had stuff where it's like,</v>

1041
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take it down one road and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll,</v>

1042
00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it clear in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry if you just be quiet and</v>

1043
00:46:55.111 --> 00:46:55.950
<v Speaker 1>listen the whole time.</v>

1044
00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:57.900
<v Speaker 1>You'll see where I'm going with this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be fine,</v>

1045
00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:00.750
<v Speaker 1>but if you stop me in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to make it seem really bad</v>

1046
00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:03.360
<v Speaker 1>what I said exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So exactly.</v>

1047
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:06.120
<v Speaker 1>If if you get interrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to look bad and it's a</v>

1048
00:47:06.121 --> 00:47:09.390
<v Speaker 1>long second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make someone pay money off of doing the</v>

1049
00:47:09.391 --> 00:47:10.980
<v Speaker 1>art badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1050
00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Except for when I'm not even saying it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was bad.</v>

1051
00:47:12.991 --> 00:47:14.760
<v Speaker 1>He might have fucking gotten other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people laughing at him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>

1053
00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.420

<v Speaker 1>up to the rest of the audience that</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can't stop anyone from doing or</v>

1090
00:48:46.841 --> 00:48:49.450
<v Speaker 1>saying anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you allowed to smoke on stage</v>

1091
00:48:49.451 --> 00:48:51.940
<v Speaker 1>here because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's part of the stage.</v>

1092
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Just like our pal smoke four cigarettes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other night in a 20 minutes set.</v>

1093
00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Once I saw might have another one.</v>

1095
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.810
<v Speaker 1>What does it say here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition to Mr earls $15,000 penalty,</v>

1096
00:49:04.811 --> 00:49:09.640
<v Speaker 1>the restaurant was also ordered to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>$70,000 since he was,</v>

1097
00:49:09.641 --> 00:49:10.510
<v Speaker 1>had a bar tab.</v>

1098
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.870
<v Speaker 1>He was illegally an employee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1099
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:18.880
<v Speaker 1>So because the comedian had a small bar</v>
<v Speaker 1>tab to host the event,</v>

1100
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.510
<v Speaker 1>the comedian was legally an employee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

1101
00:49:22.511 --> 00:49:24.480
<v Speaker 1>that's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Earl Lloyd.</v>

1102
00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:26.770
<v Speaker 1>The tribunal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tribunal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What rights do they have?</v>

1104
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Nordic gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek and fucking thor comes down and</v>

1105
00:49:34.451 --> 00:49:36.610

<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

1106
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.240
<v Speaker 1>So stupid looking ms.party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that Mr the guy,</v>

1107
00:49:40.241 --> 00:49:41.800
<v Speaker 1>the comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that host of the show,</v>

1108
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:46.570
<v Speaker 1>we try to say that the lady played a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vital and highly dramatic role,</v>

1109
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:49.720
<v Speaker 1>utterly disrupting a performance by</v>
<v Speaker 1>unpaid volunteers.</v>

1110
00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Comedy clubs like no other places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The quintessential element that</v>

1111
00:49:53.531 --> 00:49:56.950
<v Speaker 1>distinguishes them from vapid mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 1>media is the fearless pursuit of free</v>

1112
00:49:56.951 --> 00:50:01.050
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's listen to this though too.</v>

1113
00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Played a vital and highly dramatic role</v>
<v Speaker 1>in utterly disrupting or performance by</v>

1114
00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:11.490
<v Speaker 1>unpaid volunteers from Mike can go on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guys are for that sentence.</v>

1115
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:14.050
<v Speaker 1>When he finished that sentence and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit that period,</v>

1116
00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:16.690
<v Speaker 1>the judge should have said this over</v>
<v Speaker 1>here when you.</v>

1117
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.610
<v Speaker 1>When you get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is over.</v>

1118
00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was messing you guys up.</v>

1119
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1120
00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm on his side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just by the way he spells things spelled</v>

1121
00:50:24.031 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>things out like his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his sentencing project and the judge's</v>

1122
00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:30.380
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The comic was not giving a comedy</v>

1123
00:50:30.381 --> 00:50:33.830
<v Speaker 1>performance when he launched into his</v>
<v Speaker 1>tirade of ugly words directly at Ms Dot</v>

1124
00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can see that there were jokes</v>

1125
00:50:36.681 --> 00:50:37.514
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.850
<v Speaker 1>that's not true because it was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if he doesn't land them,</v>

1127
00:50:40.851 --> 00:50:43.310
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you can see any committee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get an expert to say,</v>

1128
00:50:43.311 --> 00:50:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's where he was trying to get a</v>

<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what he's trying to get a laugh.</v>

1130
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's scroll back up to the thing that</v>

1131
00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:50.840
<v Speaker 1>he said to her because it's clearly a</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke and if,</v>

<v Speaker 1>She threw water at him twice instead of</v>

1135
00:51:00.441 --> 00:51:03.230
<v Speaker 1>telling them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1136
00:51:03.231 --> 00:51:05.360
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She threw water at him.</v>

1137
00:51:05.361 --> 00:51:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1157
00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clearly joke.</v>

1158
00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:45.873
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to his,</v>

1159
00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:49.120
<v Speaker 1>his point of view though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says the couple was passionately</v>

1160
00:51:49.121 --> 00:51:53.410
<v Speaker 1>kissing in the front and repeatedly</v>
<v Speaker 1>interrupting the set with obscenities</v>

1161
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:58.880
<v Speaker 1>when Mr Earl tried to shut up the table</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the quip.</v>

1162
00:51:58.881 --> 00:52:01.040
<v Speaker 1>You're not even lesbians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Guy will fuck you.</v>

1163
00:52:01.041 --> 00:52:05.210
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're with each other just</v>
<v Speaker 1>thus kissing off the ugly escalation.</v>

1164
00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1165
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.810
<v Speaker 1>so that's the exact situation that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened a billion times that you've</v>

1166
00:52:08.811 --> 00:52:10.730
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are being way too loud and</v>

1167
00:52:10.731 --> 00:52:12.740
<v Speaker 1>disruptive and they don't believe they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

1168
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:13.910
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1169
00:52:13.911 --> 00:52:15.270
<v Speaker 1>it's people who were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1170
00:52:15.271 --> 00:52:16.850
<v Speaker 1>So this tribunal said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1171
00:52:16.851 --> 00:52:20.180
<v Speaker 1>if that happens and you're too harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to pay money that</v>

1172
00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:24.080
<v Speaker 1>you can't afford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an open mic or is paying 15 grand.</v>

1173
00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Canada has legislated politeness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how serious they take their</v>

1174
00:52:27.891 --> 00:52:28.910
<v Speaker 1>politeness up there.</v>

1175
00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:33.400
<v Speaker 1>They made laws where you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>polite.</v>

1176
00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this situation,</v>

1177
00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:38.860
<v Speaker 1>clubs are going to start recording,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filming sets.</v>

1178
00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.140
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

1179
00:52:40.141 --> 00:52:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this owner would have had it been.</v>

1180
00:52:42.251 --> 00:52:47.251
<v Speaker 1>That takes away the sort of stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy is counterculture and part of it</v>

1181
00:52:47.381 --> 00:52:48.340
<v Speaker 1>exists because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1182
00:52:48.341 --> 00:52:50.920
<v Speaker 1>nobody's recording this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all just existing right now in a</v>

1183
00:52:50.921 --> 00:52:54.420
<v Speaker 1>basement of some whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree and I think that's it.</v>

1184
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Then you take away like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

1185
00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:57.693
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1186
00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a beautiful aspect of it,</v>

1187
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:03.190
<v Speaker 1>but this poor fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if this is the landscape,</v>

1188
00:53:03.191 --> 00:53:07.750
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to operate again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the owner of the God damn club is</v>

1189
00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:10.000
<v Speaker 1>getting fucked over by an open mic or</v>
<v Speaker 1>hood.</v>

1190
00:53:10.001 --> 00:53:11.260
<v Speaker 1>So Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has no incentive.</v>

1191
00:53:11.261 --> 00:53:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't just the,</v>

1192
00:53:12.551 --> 00:53:15.760
<v Speaker 1>the thought of any club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any place,</v>

1193
00:53:15.761 --> 00:53:19.450
<v Speaker 1>have an open mic at their place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Open mic nights are filled with crazy</v>

1194
00:53:19.451 --> 00:53:22.690
<v Speaker 1>people and people will become great</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians.</v>

1195
00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ratio very high</v>

1196
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.680
<v Speaker 2>too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even the ones that are going to</v>

1197
00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:30.030
<v Speaker 2>become great or terrible when they're at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the open mic.</v>

1198
00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can make terrible decisions</v>

1199
00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:35.130
<v Speaker 2>fucking right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they might be one day,</v>

1200
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:37.590
<v Speaker 2>20 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your all time favorite comedian,</v>

1201
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.050
<v Speaker 2>but right now they're clunking their way</v>
<v Speaker 2>through everything and spilling their</v>

1202
00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:45.870
<v Speaker 2>fucking drink and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just nobody does it right in the</v>

1203
00:53:45.871 --> 00:53:47.820
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an ad Lib thing.</v>

1204
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.300
<v Speaker 2>And when you're ad libbing like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where there's people in the</v>

1205
00:53:51.301 --> 00:53:55.800
<v Speaker 2>audience that are disrupting this show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's true from his perspective,</v>

1206
00:53:55.801 --> 00:53:58.040
<v Speaker 2>what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they're,</v>

1207
00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:02.070
<v Speaker 2>they're interrupting with his job and</v>
<v Speaker 2>his job is to talk and to be funny.</v>

1208
00:54:02.071 --> 00:54:06.630
<v Speaker 2>So now you've engaged in some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>verbal warfare with a comedian who has a</v>

1209
00:54:06.631 --> 00:54:08.370
<v Speaker 2>microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can pay for that because they</v>

1210
00:54:08.371 --> 00:54:11.970
<v Speaker 2>couldn't see where the comedy will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that she threw drinks at home,</v>

1211
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:14.190
<v Speaker 2>that's just sort of void out the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1212
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Like I guess was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well she was already so disrupted that</v>

1213
00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.380
<v Speaker 2>she had a.</v>

1214
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like talking about these things</v>

1215
00:54:23.461 --> 00:54:25.800
<v Speaker 2>if I wasn't there because we all see how</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1216
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.570
<v Speaker 2>how this could play out exactly like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

1217
00:54:27.571 --> 00:54:31.170
<v Speaker 2>You've been on that side of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he is 100 percent.</v>

1218
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:32.820
<v Speaker 2>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now what you're saying is,</v>

1219
00:54:32.821 --> 00:54:34.200
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open mic places don't,</v>

1220
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:36.090
<v Speaker 2>don't start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst part about it.</v>

1221
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:40.380
<v Speaker 2>It's going to discourage the clubs from</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a chance and putting on these</v>

1222
00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:44.340
<v Speaker 2>amateurs who they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people owe you an open mic night,</v>

1223
00:54:44.341 --> 00:54:46.740
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just put it in perspective.</v>

1224
00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:52.010
<v Speaker 2>We had a guy who dropped a bomb maybe 75</v>
<v Speaker 2>times at this place on sunset at this</v>

1225
00:54:53.641 --> 00:54:57.250
<v Speaker 2>recovery place of recovery place with</v>
<v Speaker 2>recovery place.</v>

1226
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:59.830
<v Speaker 2>It was just where people hung out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1227
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.290
<v Speaker 2>and he did like a set thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1228
00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:01.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1229
00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:04.470
<v Speaker 2>It was an open mic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was open mic and it was so</v>

1230
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:05.550
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>

1231
00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then whatever he felt it too</v>

1232
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:13.050
<v Speaker 2>probably won't do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or he will or he will cut it down about</v>

1233
00:55:13.051 --> 00:55:16.860
<v Speaker 2>10 n words or that's his point is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to shock everyone.</v>

1234
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1235
00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 2>He said it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just maybe doesn't know how goofy</v>

1236
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:23.550
<v Speaker 2>sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't know how goofy they</v>

1237
00:55:23.551 --> 00:55:25.020
<v Speaker 2>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1238
00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:29.480
<v Speaker 2>you gotta get a response from people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're around and it's going to</v>

1239
00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.450
<v Speaker 2>shock what if that's what you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>for is to offend.</v>

1240
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:35.010
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the emotion you're trying to get</v>

1241
00:55:35.011 --> 00:55:38.250
<v Speaker 2>out of it audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like we're going to legislate</v>

1242
00:55:38.251 --> 00:55:41.340
<v Speaker 2>and say that's not one you can get it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of them or what if it's like you</v>

1243
00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:45.780
<v Speaker 2>think that that's going to be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like you just suck it.</v>

1244
00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.480
<v Speaker 2>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not working like you suck at this.</v>

1245
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like diy as angry is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>funniest things ever on his fucking face</v>

1246
00:55:53.221 --> 00:55:56.940
<v Speaker 2>gets red and he starts getting mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started screaming about how when he</v>

1247
00:55:56.941 --> 00:55:58.010
<v Speaker 2>was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottled water,</v>

1248
00:55:58.011 --> 00:55:59.400
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to drink puddle water.</v>

1249
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.990
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking beat red in the face like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1250
00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:07.950
<v Speaker 2>That real anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit's hilarious because he's got</v>

1251
00:56:07.951 --> 00:56:11.610
<v Speaker 2>jokes and real anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you have like a manufactured</v>

1252
00:56:11.611 --> 00:56:16.440
<v Speaker 2>anger and you're trying to be edgy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brands can see through them.</v>

1253
00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:17.610
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's offensive.</v>

1254
00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.180
<v Speaker 2>It's offensive if you're not in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment for sure.</v>

1255
00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Like when Joey's talking about bottled</v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

1256
00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.670
<v Speaker 2>he's in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1257
00:56:24.671 --> 00:56:27.640
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a puddle of water.</v>

1258
00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:31.150
<v Speaker 2>We've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've all sort of figured this out in</v>

1259
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:33.850
<v Speaker 2>our own way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're on stage and you're</v>

1260
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:35.350
<v Speaker 2>locked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1261
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:38.290
<v Speaker 2>You're either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The audience is laughing hard,</v>

1262
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:42.520
<v Speaker 2>everything's going great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like some kind of a mass</v>

1263
00:56:42.521 --> 00:56:46.400
<v Speaker 2>hypnosis in a way because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>conducting them,</v>

1264
00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:47.920
<v Speaker 2>like pointed them at all.</v>

1265
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1266
00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:49.910
<v Speaker 2>both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1267
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:52.840
<v Speaker 2>it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like I feel like when I</v>

1268
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:57.930
<v Speaker 2>watch were in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched bird the other day at the,</v>

1269
00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.460
<v Speaker 2>at the store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main room and then Chappelle the</v>

1270
00:57:00.461 --> 00:57:04.270
<v Speaker 2>other day in the EOA locked in to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>

1271
00:57:04.271 --> 00:57:08.560
<v Speaker 2>I loved it as a an audience member and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was thinking like when they were doing</v>

1272
00:57:08.561 --> 00:57:13.060
<v Speaker 2>their jokes and I'm laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like going along with their thought</v>

1273
00:57:13.061 --> 00:57:17.570
<v Speaker 2>process and I'm as it's happening to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm recognizing this thing that it's</v>

1274
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:22.240
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another they're thinking for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like they're thinking for you and</v>

1275
00:57:22.241 --> 00:57:25.080
<v Speaker 2>you just on a ride with those things for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1276
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.170
<v Speaker 2>your comic on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1277
00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:30.580
<v Speaker 2>So when someone had some fake rant and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1278
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:31.900
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

1279
00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone came over your house and</v>
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>

1280
00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:39.130
<v Speaker 2>the problem with the government is</v>
<v Speaker 2>programs on tv or programming you.</v>

1281
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:41.020
<v Speaker 2>That's what they call them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Programs.</v>

1282
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.033
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were,</v>

1283
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.390
<v Speaker 2>this guy was in your house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

1284
00:57:43.391 --> 00:57:45.310
<v Speaker 2>will you shut the fuck up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>C'Mon man.</v>

1285
00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:50.440
<v Speaker 2>If dns is in your house and he starts</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to you about some shit you,</v>

1286
00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:52.610
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a free show you.</v>

1287
00:57:52.611 --> 00:57:56.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like a show with Ds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have shows with him whenever we hang</v>

1288
00:57:56.171 --> 00:57:59.560
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he'll perform restaurant.</v>

1289
00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:01.720
<v Speaker 2>He was on the ride over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fun.</v>

1290
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:04.760
<v Speaker 2>He's always on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a live,</v>

1291
00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:07.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think it should be up to</v>

1292
00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:09.560
<v Speaker 2>anyone to decide what that line is of</v>
<v Speaker 2>right or wrong.</v>

1293
00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Nailed it or didn't nail it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1294
00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.400
<v Speaker 2>You just can't align is different than</v>
<v Speaker 2>your law.</v>

1295
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:16.480
<v Speaker 2>Even the too soon kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I heard somebody,</v>

1296
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:21.370
<v Speaker 2>her Jeff Roth do a joke about something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was South Carolina but it was like a</v>

1297
00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:22.900
<v Speaker 2>year later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember people trying to do jokes</v>

1298
00:58:22.901 --> 00:58:24.160
<v Speaker 2>right there and people like no.</v>

1299
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:26.950
<v Speaker 2>And so then jeff did it and it hit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>still got an oh,</v>

1300
00:58:26.951 --> 00:58:28.300
<v Speaker 2>like a year later and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1301
00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:30.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well I want as far as an audience</v>

<v Speaker 2>we like different things.</v>

1304
00:58:34.841 --> 00:58:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I like spicier foods so it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My favorite example of people saying</v>

1305
00:58:38.591 --> 00:58:41.170
<v Speaker 2>something isn't funny that was fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Was already laying already laying got in</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble for that twitter stuff because</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was having sex with.</v>

1309

<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm paraphrasing,</v>

1310
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I was having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hot black girl.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't breathe.</v>

1312
00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:00.220
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not make this political.</v>

1313
00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:04.340
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring politics into the bedroom</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

1314
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:10.950
<v Speaker 2>People got up and screamed at him at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cellar in New York and they stormed out</v>

1315
00:59:12.091 --> 00:59:12.401
<v Speaker 2>of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1316

<v Speaker 2>the guy attempted suicide too,</v>

1317

<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

1327
00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:39.860
<v Speaker 1>the only way you would look at it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say you can't make jokes about that is</v>

1328
00:59:39.861 --> 00:59:44.360
<v Speaker 1>if you feel like it's somehow racist</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if it was any other,</v>

1329
00:59:44.361 --> 00:59:47.050
<v Speaker 1>any other reason like you could totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a joke about.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just you're just going,</v>

1332
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:52.670

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to interrupt him.</v>

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Yell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1334
00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:55.850
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to what he's saying and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the joke like,</v>

1335
00:59:55.851 --> 00:59:58.720
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that'd be like interrupting fucking</v>

1336
00:59:59.590 --> 01:00:02.600
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even a Joe Jonathan swift essay</v>

1337
01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:03.530
<v Speaker 1>because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1338
01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:08.030
<v Speaker 1>are you saying we should kill kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just appreciate chosen.</v>

1339
01:00:08.031 --> 01:00:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1340
01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Let's get this guy to fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the joke is not saying it's not</v>

1341
01:00:13.731 --> 01:00:17.360
<v Speaker 1>making fun of the guy who died in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cops killing him.</v>

1342
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:20.420
<v Speaker 1>The joke is making fun of everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it.</v>

1343
01:00:20.421 --> 01:00:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1344
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The joke is him with a hot black girl</v>

1345
01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>that needs smothering here because he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>

1346
01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.060
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't breathe.</v>

1347
01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:31.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking great joke.</v>

1348
01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a great joke and it's not mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the joke.</v>

1349
01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:39.950
<v Speaker 1>The protests are affecting my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last week I was having sex with a black</v>

1350
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She yelled out,</v>

1351
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:43.490
<v Speaker 1>I can't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to heat.</v>

1352
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>So he put it on twitter right at the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 2014.</v>

1353
01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>So at the height of the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1354
01:00:50.511 --> 01:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh well this was the punchline.</v>

1355
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I think the black lives matter thing has</v>
<v Speaker 1>never been bigger,</v>

1356
01:00:55.761 --> 01:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>so I'm thinking you'd say it the harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's bigger now than ever</v>

1357
01:00:58.041 --> 01:00:58.874
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1358
01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so at all.</v>

1359
01:01:01.341 --> 01:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's kind of eating itself a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little when people going ah,</v>

1360
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all the</v>

1361
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>comps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well also one of the guys that worked</v>

1362
01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:11.420
<v Speaker 1>for him was white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1363
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.710
<v Speaker 1>real estate that kind of proved this guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>was white who one of the guys in black</v>

1364
01:01:15.711 --> 01:01:17.300
<v Speaker 1>lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was white guys.</v>

1365
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he's a white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly.</v>

1366
01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:25.220
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is that one was</v>

1367
01:01:25.221 --> 01:01:29.060
<v Speaker 1>particularly agregious that incident</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that Eric Gardener Guy.</v>

1368
01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I got disgusted by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1369
01:01:30.661 --> 01:01:32.870
<v Speaker 1>I was terrible because they all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was with cigarettes.</v>

1370
01:01:32.871 --> 01:01:35.390
<v Speaker 1>The guy was selling loose cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do anything.</v>

1371
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem with that is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from that.</v>

1372
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:39.890
<v Speaker 1>It creates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sorry,</v>

1373
01:01:39.891 --> 01:01:44.240
<v Speaker 1>it comes from a place of back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to sell loose cigarettes to make a</v>

1374
01:01:44.241 --> 01:01:44.630
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

1375
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Not like he ain't Robin people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's selling loose cigarettes for a</v>

1376
01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:51.920
<v Speaker 1>fucking dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece like the people who can't afford</v>

1377
01:01:51.921 --> 01:01:55.790
<v Speaker 1>a it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a guy who's wants to dream of</v>

1378
01:01:55.791 --> 01:01:58.250
<v Speaker 1>that as a job and a career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

1379
01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:00.740
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're poor people and you're saying we</v>

1380
01:02:00.741 --> 01:02:03.710
<v Speaker 1>have regulations with the government's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to get paid so some guys are able to</v>

1381
01:02:03.711 --> 01:02:05.570
<v Speaker 1>push you around and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

1382
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:06.620
<v Speaker 1>he had asthma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

1383
01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:09.850
<v Speaker 1>why is he fucking big that violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this beat it.</v>

1384
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Cops are not supposed to be revenue</v>
<v Speaker 1>collector's.</v>

1385
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just not that stupid stupid for</v>

1386
01:02:15.621 --> 01:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>the cop to be put in that position where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making them arrest people because</v>

1387
01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>you have</v>

1388
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.980
<v Speaker 2>a quota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we have to figure out a way where</v>

1389
01:02:22.981 --> 01:02:25.260
<v Speaker 2>these people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get paid that way.</v>

1390
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea that you have to have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of crime every day in</v>

1391
01:02:30.901 --> 01:02:35.070
<v Speaker 2>order to keep your position as a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

1392
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Like what about a perfect world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would we employ?</v>

1393
01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.620
<v Speaker 2>A lot of great cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become a member of the community</v>

1394
01:02:40.621 --> 01:02:42.720
<v Speaker 2>respected member because you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>any fucking crime,</v>

1395
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:46.700
<v Speaker 2>so the cop doesn't be a problem anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the old west.</v>

1396
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Look at them as a thing here because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sheriff's got to.</v>

1397
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:51.120
<v Speaker 2>We'll comp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should look at comps.</v>

1398
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:53.820
<v Speaker 2>W it would be ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in a perfect world.</v>

1399
01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the people that were police officers</v>

1400
01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.890
<v Speaker 2>would be the coolest fucking people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1401
01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:03.810
<v Speaker 2>They just wanted everything to be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything to stay calm and in the best</v>

1402
01:03:03.811 --> 01:03:06.570
<v Speaker 2>case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in a world where like we were</v>

1403
01:03:06.571 --> 01:03:08.880
<v Speaker 2>talking about how little violence there</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1404
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.320
<v Speaker 2>imagines that got way better.</v>

1405
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.580
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if like the Douche douchebag</v>
<v Speaker 2>factor got reduced dramatically.</v>

1406
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:16.320
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For whatever way,</v>

1407
01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:18.240
<v Speaker 2>in whatever way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine,</v>

1408
01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.970
<v Speaker 2>imagine how wonderful it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world would be perfect.</v>

1409
01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:23.760
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't have this fear that people</v>

1410
01:03:23.761 --> 01:03:27.420
<v Speaker 2>constantly have of getting their home</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken into getting their ass kicked or</v>

1411
01:03:27.421 --> 01:03:29.250
<v Speaker 2>getting in a fight or getting this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're getting that.</v>

1412
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.460
<v Speaker 2>All of it could go away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1413
01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:37.440
<v Speaker 2>you can't just fucking choke a guy for</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes.</v>

1414
01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:40.800
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just can't do it the way they slam</v>

1415
01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:44.340
<v Speaker 2>people's faces into that Shit meant what</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it?</v>

1416
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.330
<v Speaker 2>Because it's written down somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1417
01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.173
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some,</v>

1418
01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:52.340
<v Speaker 2>some one decided there's a swath of land</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've got a market cross it.</v>

1419
01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Some people sneak over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have good paperworks.</v>

1420
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't get a good education or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1421
01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:00.990
<v Speaker 2>this guy's life was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he was an immigrant.</v>

1422
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:04.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm making up an immigrant story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's so many people that do so</v>

1423
01:04:04.291 --> 01:04:09.050
<v Speaker 2>many different things in this world</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're trying to get by and the</v>

1424
01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:12.360
<v Speaker 2>idea that someone would tackle you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>choke you just because you're selling</v>

1425
01:04:12.361 --> 01:04:14.370
<v Speaker 2>loose cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for worse,</v>

1426
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.150
<v Speaker 2>a ticketable offense if.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about if he's selling stolen</v>

1427
01:04:18.151 --> 01:04:21.210
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes that he broke into a building</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing.</v>

1428
01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

1429
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:23.280
<v Speaker 2>so they told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they told that,</v>

1430
01:04:23.281 --> 01:04:24.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1431
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:27.150
<v Speaker 2>the head cop there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more choke holds.</v>

1432
01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.530
<v Speaker 2>And so he did it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1433
01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:30.590
<v Speaker 2>he had a PPO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1434
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:33.030
<v Speaker 2>So he'll have to choke a guy like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their defense.</v>

1435
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.010
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that choke shouldn't kill you.</v>

1436
01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.660
<v Speaker 2>You certainly do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a fight,</v>

1437
01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.130
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly in that situation and if he's</v>

1438
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.070
<v Speaker 2>defending himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying the only time you would have</v>

1439
01:04:44.071 --> 01:04:49.071
<v Speaker 2>to use a chokehold against a person is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if that person is somehow right.</v>

1440
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:51.390
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just dragging.</v>

1441
01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.940
<v Speaker 2>The guy told them to stop using short</v>
<v Speaker 2>codes and use it anyway.</v>

1442
01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.490
<v Speaker 2>Now you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to take the gun to the</v>

1443
01:04:56.491 --> 01:04:57.000
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1444
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.010
<v Speaker 2>but he said the head cop was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

1445
01:04:59.011 --> 01:05:01.350
<v Speaker 2>no more of this before this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was anyway.</v>

1446
01:05:01.351 --> 01:05:05.940
<v Speaker 2>So if I went and choke somebody and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>died and I can say,</v>

1447
01:05:05.941 --> 01:05:07.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just had had asthma.</v>

1448
01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:10.380
<v Speaker 2>What trouble would I be in big time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manslaughter.</v>

1449
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:11.250
<v Speaker 2>Manslaughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1450
01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't I couldn't use the excuse.</v>

1451
01:05:13.371 --> 01:05:15.630
<v Speaker 2>So it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depends on what evidence the guy could</v>

1452
01:05:15.631 --> 01:05:19.060
<v Speaker 2>be like in this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's look at this situation because</v>

1453
01:05:19.061 --> 01:05:21.340
<v Speaker 2>in this situation that guy was totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>passive.</v>

1454
01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:23.770
<v Speaker 2>He didn't do anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was ugly.</v>

1455
01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.330
<v Speaker 2>It was ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way they grabbed him.</v>

1456
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:26.670
<v Speaker 2>It was ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm.</v>

1457
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.920
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>control a guy who's that big once,</v>

1458
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:33.190
<v Speaker 2>once it's a physical altercation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't wait until he starts punching you</v>

1459
01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:34.480
<v Speaker 2>or biting you before he choked him.</v>

1460
01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:37.240
<v Speaker 2>You choke them quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just what you do and I don't.</v>

1461
01:05:37.241 --> 01:05:39.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not condoning it in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>

1462
01:05:39.191 --> 01:05:43.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible miscarriage of of like what's</v>

1463
01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:45.910
<v Speaker 2>ethically right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's ethically right.</v>

1464
01:05:45.911 --> 01:05:49.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not that the people with guns that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are employed by the state come after you</v>

1465
01:05:49.871 --> 01:05:52.810
<v Speaker 2>and drag you to the ground because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not getting their tax money from</v>

1466
01:05:52.811 --> 01:05:54.590
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is all this loose cigarette thing.</v>

1467
01:05:54.591 --> 01:05:56.620
<v Speaker 2>And what if the store owner did the</v>
<v Speaker 2>exact same thing?</v>

1468
01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if what you were saying you did,</v>

1469
01:05:58.970 --> 01:06:00.460
<v Speaker 2>you would have to have a reason to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1470
01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would have some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like the same reason the cut</v>

1471
01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:04.481
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1472
01:06:04.481 --> 01:06:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sell cigarettes in here.</v>

1473
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:07.870
<v Speaker 2>I think I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to do.</v>

1474
01:06:07.871 --> 01:06:09.820
<v Speaker 2>And then he just ran up on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>choked him,</v>

1475
01:06:09.821 --> 01:06:11.230
<v Speaker 2>and then he has asthma made him die.</v>

1476
01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.000
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how it escalates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1477
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:15.010
<v Speaker 2>if you just attacked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

1478
01:06:15.011 --> 01:06:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just assaulted him for no reason.</v>

1479
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:20.740
<v Speaker 2>Like what if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if he told you to fuck off and then</v>

1480
01:06:20.741 --> 01:06:23.140
<v Speaker 2>try to sucker punch you and you had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>duck under his punch.</v>

1481
01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:24.400
<v Speaker 2>He didn't do this though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1482
01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:26.170
<v Speaker 2>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then it would be a different story.</v>

1483
01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:29.050
<v Speaker 2>So in this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this wasn't like the store owner</v>

1484
01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:30.520
<v Speaker 2>didn't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They called the cops,</v>

1485
01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.680
<v Speaker 2>the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was about a fight because that</v>

1486
01:06:32.681 --> 01:06:33.580
<v Speaker 2>guy had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had,</v>

1487
01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:37.120
<v Speaker 2>there's been a fight before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why the cops had showed up.</v>

1488
01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.130
<v Speaker 2>So they showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All geared up.</v>

1489
01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They showed up geared up because there</v>

1490
01:06:41.711 --> 01:06:46.390
<v Speaker 2>was an incident and I think this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>might've even called it in.</v>

1491
01:06:46.810 --> 01:06:49.030
<v Speaker 2>The guy who they wound up killing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

1492
01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1493
01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:54.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this dude just happened to be there</v>

1494
01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.500
<v Speaker 2>when it went down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong about him calling it</v>

1495
01:06:56.501 --> 01:06:59.520
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was just there and so they,</v>

1496
01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:03.010
<v Speaker 2>they come looking for this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fight wasn't there and then they</v>

1497
01:07:03.011 --> 01:07:05.260
<v Speaker 2>started going after the result of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>cop.</v>

1498
01:07:05.261 --> 01:07:06.670
<v Speaker 2>What's happened to them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1499
01:07:06.671 --> 01:07:08.230
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to single the cop out.</v>

1500
01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:10.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to mention his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is you get offers in</v>

1501
01:07:10.931 --> 01:07:13.280
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he was a cop,</v>

1502
01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:14.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just looking right now,</v>

1503
01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.880
<v Speaker 2>two days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplished.</v>

1504
01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Charged in this incident in the Eric</v>
<v Speaker 2>Garner,</v>

1505
01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:20.080
<v Speaker 2>a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not the one that put him in a</v>

1506
01:07:20.081 --> 01:07:24.000
<v Speaker 2>choke hold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we could be one of the ones</v>

1507
01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:25.480
<v Speaker 2>that's in charge of the people that did</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1508
01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:26.650
<v Speaker 2>So I'm looking right now though.</v>

1509
01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.540
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens when you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>leader,</v>

1510
01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:29.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

1511
01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:31.660
<v Speaker 2>That's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the club owner and the open miker</v>

1512
01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.600
<v Speaker 2>magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a sergeant and you're a rookie</v>

1513
01:07:34.601 --> 01:07:36.670
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>choke some guy to death and you get in</v>

1514
01:07:36.671 --> 01:07:38.020
<v Speaker 2>trouble and you get kicked off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>force,</v>

1515
01:07:38.021 --> 01:07:40.960
<v Speaker 2>you lose your cushy job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's charged right now with failure to</v>

1516
01:07:40.961 --> 01:07:45.790
<v Speaker 2>supervise an internal charge him that</v>
<v Speaker 2>God would failure to supervise.</v>

1517
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:47.860
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck is she supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>supervise?</v>

1518
01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:50.110
<v Speaker 2>Like these guys choking this guy on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>street?</v>

1519
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Who would it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is she supposed to do?</v>

1520
01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like the losses on the coach is</v>
<v Speaker 2>your forearm under his chin?</v>

1521
01:07:55.931 --> 01:07:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Yes or no?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

1522
01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Let me check your technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is she supposed to?</v>

1523
01:08:01.781 --> 01:08:06.280
<v Speaker 2>New York and there was cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember passing by this cops talking</v>

1524
01:08:06.281 --> 01:08:08.980
<v Speaker 2>to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One was gone and that's not a choke to</v>

1525
01:08:08.981 --> 01:08:10.150
<v Speaker 2>fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a choke.</v>

1526
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:11.110
<v Speaker 2>Let me put you in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

1527
01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.120
<v Speaker 2>And in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a hold on his neck.</v>

1528
01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Let me put you in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1529
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:17.390
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll choke the shit out of somebody.</v>

1530
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Anybody tells me that's not a chuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me hold you in like that.</v>

1531
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what qualifications?</v>

1532
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.640
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to say what a choke</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

1533
01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.570
<v Speaker 2>Me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1534
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a couple of things.</v>

1535
01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Would you definitely be called an</v>
<v Speaker 2>expert?</v>

1536
01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:30.740
<v Speaker 2>I said it on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said as a martial arts expert,</v>

1537
01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.290
<v Speaker 2>I even said that it's a professional</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts expert.</v>

1538
01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:35.270
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you very clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a joke.</v>

1539
01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.580
<v Speaker 2>I will choke the fucking life out of you</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

1540
01:08:38.370 --> 01:08:41.990
<v Speaker 2>If I have your head in between my arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget me.</v>

1541
01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about Eddie Bravo?</v>

1542
01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Eddie Bravo has your neck and it's</v>

1543
01:08:46.911 --> 01:08:49.850
<v Speaker 2>trapped in between his arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to sleep,</v>

1544
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.290
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to sleep.</v>

1545
01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:54.680
<v Speaker 2>That's a choke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he's got your neck like they had eric</v>

1546
01:08:54.681 --> 01:08:56.000
<v Speaker 2>gardener,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to sleep.</v>

1547
01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.030
<v Speaker 2>If Jake she look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>

1548
01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:01.670
<v Speaker 2>That guy has his finger tucked under his</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrist,</v>

1549
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:04.310
<v Speaker 2>the hand in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just got a shitty choke.</v>

1550
01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:05.990
<v Speaker 2>He's got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't have the proper technique for</v>

1551
01:09:05.991 --> 01:09:07.040
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1552
01:09:07.050 --> 01:09:08.840
<v Speaker 2>and the other guys hold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

1553
01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.360
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely underneath the guy's</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chin though,</v>

1554
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:14.420
<v Speaker 2>but this is just a freeze frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might've been like a brief</v>

1555
01:09:14.421 --> 01:09:17.330
<v Speaker 2>millisecond of of struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1556
01:09:17.331 --> 01:09:20.900
<v Speaker 2>where he was pushing down with his left</v>
<v Speaker 2>arm and up with is right.</v>

1557
01:09:20.901 --> 01:09:22.940
<v Speaker 2>Because if you look at his right arm in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this position,</v>

1558
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:25.820
<v Speaker 2>that right arm is just an under hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not putting any pressure on his</v>

1559
01:09:25.821 --> 01:09:27.410
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that's putting pressure</v>

1560
01:09:27.411 --> 01:09:29.450
<v Speaker 2>on the neck is the left arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's under the chin,</v>

1561
01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.190
<v Speaker 2>but there's definitely some space.</v>

1562
01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:34.610
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely some space between</v>
<v Speaker 2>you because it's not under his chin.</v>

1563
01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:36.290
<v Speaker 2>You see where his chin is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at.</v>

1564
01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:37.280
<v Speaker 2>Make it bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real quick,</v>

1565
01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:39.350
<v Speaker 2>make it bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is just one picture.</v>

1566
01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.910
<v Speaker 2>If you see where his chin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his back,</v>

1567
01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.610
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go into your twitter.</v>

1568
01:09:43.611 --> 01:09:47.150
<v Speaker 2>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh um,</v>

1569
01:09:47.690 --> 01:09:52.690
<v Speaker 2>but I saw an image where they were like</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground.</v>

1570
01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1571
01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:58.670
<v Speaker 2>I saw a different image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

1572
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:59.870
<v Speaker 2>See that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1573
01:09:59.871 --> 01:10:02.150
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always got under the neck.</v>

1574
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:07.330
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking 100 percent choke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Choke you to death with one arm like</v>

1575
01:10:07.491 --> 01:10:08.450
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you let me,</v>

1576
01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.860
<v Speaker 2>if you let me get under your Chin like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1577
01:10:09.861 --> 01:10:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy's letting them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>

1578
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:15.330
<v Speaker 2>he's not resisting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's being what I mean he's letting him</v>

1579
01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:17.270
<v Speaker 2>and he's in a position where you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>do anything about it,</v>

1580
01:10:17.271 --> 01:10:18.080
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>

1581
01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Even if it doesn't halt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say nothing happened to him.</v>

1582
01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:23.553
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>

1583
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:25.310
<v Speaker 2>he's not defending it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1584
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.160
<v Speaker 2>he's not defending it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 100 percent of that guys might,</v>

1585
01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:30.560
<v Speaker 2>the left guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an aside choke position.</v>

1586
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:35.340
<v Speaker 2>So he's pushing down with his left</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder as well as pulling up with his</v>

1587
01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.210
<v Speaker 2>left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if he puts his left hand on his,</v>

1588
01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:42.860
<v Speaker 2>on the Guy Eric Gardener shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he uses that as leverage like guys took.</v>

1589
01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Luke rockhold tapped out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Bisping with one arm.</v>

1590
01:10:45.981 --> 01:10:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Get the okay from the mount position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a powerful move.</v>

1591
01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Mean this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not exactly this move here,</v>

1592
01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's very similar in regards to how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much pressure you can put down what your</v>

1593
01:10:55.101 --> 01:10:57.200
<v Speaker 2>shoulder and how much you can pull up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your,</v>

1594
01:10:57.201 --> 01:10:59.030
<v Speaker 2>with your arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking choke.</v>

1595
01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Choked the shit out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With that.</v>

1596
01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Somebody gets you into like Marcello</v>
<v Speaker 2>Garcia.</v>

1597
01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.180
<v Speaker 2>How about Jocko?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ray?</v>

1598
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Chakra ray gets a hold of you like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1599
01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:10.760
<v Speaker 2>that's a fucking choke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to go to sleep and he's not</v>

1600
01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:12.830
<v Speaker 2>the best in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1601
01:11:12.831 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

1602
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.100
<v Speaker 1>not like the perfect choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The perfect joke is,</v>

1603
01:11:17.101 --> 01:11:20.640
<v Speaker 1>you know like a Marcello Garcia rear</v>
<v Speaker 1>naked choke where the technique is just</v>

1604
01:11:20.641 --> 01:11:24.610
<v Speaker 1>so laser sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a laser.</v>

1605
01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Laser's might not even be sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in Star Wars,</v>

1606
01:11:27.471 --> 01:11:32.471
<v Speaker 1>they're not sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really need to watch this guy die.</v>

1607

<v Speaker 1>I think we all did.</v>

1625
01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:56.130

01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:06.930
<v Speaker 1>there was a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to rape you.</v>

1637
01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:20.640
<v Speaker 1>then maybe a video of the guy getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested later.</v>

1638
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't go.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Experienced some weirdness.</v>

1679
01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:21.370
<v Speaker 1>They sell so much Viagra on the streets</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Bangkok.</v>

1680
01:15:21.371 --> 01:15:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Thank God is everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just look at you.</v>

1681
01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:26.720

<v Speaker 1>I got.</v>

1682
01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.720
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like Viagra.</v>

1683
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.660
<v Speaker 1>It's such clearly a knockoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it work?</v>

1684
01:15:31.690 --> 01:15:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going to try it because they</v>

1685
01:15:33.971 --> 01:15:36.040
<v Speaker 1>weren't discounted to like a dollar a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pill.</v>

1686
01:15:36.041 --> 01:15:37.840
<v Speaker 1>There was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were like half as much as they</v>

1687
01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:41.020
<v Speaker 1>would have cost and like a store here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was offensive to you.</v>

1688
01:15:41.021 --> 01:15:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Look at your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1689
01:15:42.011 --> 01:15:43.790
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're a third world country.</v>

1690
01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:46.720
<v Speaker 1>My money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are children working right now and</v>

1691
01:15:46.721 --> 01:15:49.960
<v Speaker 1>it's 3:00 AM and that's guys six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He tried to sell me shit.</v>

1692
01:15:49.961 --> 01:15:52.480
<v Speaker 1>So I think the places should reflect</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1693
01:15:53.290 --> 01:15:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need a lot of money to get by</v>

1694
01:15:55.841 --> 01:15:56.680
<v Speaker 1>and Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>And it's doing everything safe.</v>

1697
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Thailand's a little more dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

1698
01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:06.970
<v Speaker 1>super safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thailand you can get.</v>

1699
01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:10.240
<v Speaker 1>You can get fucked with a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's relatively safe.</v>

1700
01:16:10.241 --> 01:16:13.060
<v Speaker 1>It ain't like any worse than here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1701
01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:14.920
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I gotta worry about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Tie you up maybe,</v>

1705
01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:23.380
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked around the streets and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>

1722
01:17:01.001 --> 01:17:04.000
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are they talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to do this.</v>

1723
01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:07.690
<v Speaker 1>They introduced each person and then as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both in there.</v>

1724
01:17:07.691 --> 01:17:08.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that you together</v>

1725
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:11.660
<v Speaker 2>maybe one at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really sure.</v>

1726
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:15.680
<v Speaker 2>They just do this act out dance where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just sort of like kick a knee up</v>

1727
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:21.020
<v Speaker 2>and then do like a fake clench</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick and stuff,</v>

1728
01:17:21.021 --> 01:17:23.030
<v Speaker 2>but just by themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at anybody.</v>

1729
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:25.970
<v Speaker 2>And then they do that for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go all the way down to like one</v>

1730
01:17:25.971 --> 01:17:26.804
<v Speaker 2>knee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1731
01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:30.620
<v Speaker 2>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the hardcore guys.</v>

1732
01:17:30.621 --> 01:17:31.970
<v Speaker 2>They're doing a lot more of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>matches.</v>

1733
01:17:31.971 --> 01:17:34.220
<v Speaker 2>You see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See this guy's wraps on their hands.</v>

1734
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:36.200
<v Speaker 2>They're going to fight bare knuckle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1735
01:17:36.201 --> 01:17:38.240
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not totally bare knuckle.</v>

1736
01:17:38.241 --> 01:17:40.400
<v Speaker 2>You have wraps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not going to wear gloves and</v>

1737
01:17:40.401 --> 01:17:43.310
<v Speaker 2>there's quite a few fights they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking place where guys are fighting</v>

1738
01:17:43.311 --> 01:17:44.144
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1739
01:17:44.490 --> 01:17:48.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering if it's an impact of a mma</v>
<v Speaker 2>be more popular.</v>

1740
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1741
01:17:49.971 --> 01:17:54.610
<v Speaker 2>because once I saw how these boxing</v>
<v Speaker 2>gloves on because this guy following</v>

1742
01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:58.100
<v Speaker 2>instagram sand shy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad motherfucker and he um,</v>

1743
01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:03.340
<v Speaker 2>he just fought the other night with</v>
<v Speaker 2>those gloves on were wraps rather no</v>

1744
01:18:03.621 --> 01:18:04.454
<v Speaker 2>gloves.</v>

1745
01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:05.211
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1746
01:18:05.211 --> 01:18:09.800
<v Speaker 2>he's doing those fights like the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the top Thai guys are doing</v>

1747
01:18:09.801 --> 01:18:12.980
<v Speaker 2>these fights wrapped around their head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just sort of like,</v>

1748
01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:15.140
<v Speaker 2>this is all ceremonial right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's so,</v>

1749
01:18:15.170 --> 01:18:17.390
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a spin things with their</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

1750
01:18:17.391 --> 01:18:18.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also a warmup.</v>

1751
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:21.700
<v Speaker 2>See when you watch what he's doing here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he bends his knee down and picks</v>

1752
01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:23.750
<v Speaker 2>his foot up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's stretching his hips,</v>

1753
01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:28.040
<v Speaker 2>he's stretching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like all the muscles around his</v>

1754
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:31.610
<v Speaker 2>upper leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to make it more loose for kicking</v>

1755
01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:33.320
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's loosening up.</v>

1756
01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:36.560
<v Speaker 2>See all the power in your kick comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>from weight,</v>

1757
01:18:36.561 --> 01:18:40.040
<v Speaker 2>but it comes from your hips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is the swinging of the hips</v>

1758
01:18:40.041 --> 01:18:41.900
<v Speaker 2>and the engaging of the hips when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw kicks.</v>

1759
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:45.140
<v Speaker 2>So what he's doing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's conducive to warming up that area</v>

1760
01:18:45.141 --> 01:18:47.270
<v Speaker 2>where you were going to light someone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>legs up.</v>

1761
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:49.640
<v Speaker 2>They're both doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See how they're doing it.</v>

1762
01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:53.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a warmup to warm up for their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

1763
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:56.270
<v Speaker 2>But it's also spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have these,</v>

1764
01:18:56.271 --> 01:18:58.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're walking down the street and</v>

1765
01:18:58.041 --> 01:19:01.100
<v Speaker 2>you see an alley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you just go down the alley and</v>

1766
01:19:01.101 --> 01:19:04.760
<v Speaker 2>there's just a ring in the middle of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a pool table and like for like</v>

1767
01:19:04.761 --> 01:19:06.820
<v Speaker 2>makeshift bars around it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

1768
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:08.900
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it almost looks like a lemonade</v>

1769
01:19:08.901 --> 01:19:11.030
<v Speaker 2>stand at the Rose Bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>swap meet,</v>

1770
01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you just get booze.</v>

1771
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Some people come around taking bets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who do you want?</v>

1772
01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then if you pick the right guy,</v>

1773
01:19:18.381 --> 01:19:21.020
<v Speaker 2>you can get whatever you want and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll just pay it off.</v>

1774
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.020
<v Speaker 2>It is a beautiful art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1775
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:26.240
<v Speaker 2>I love Moitai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>

1776
01:19:26.241 --> 01:19:28.640
<v Speaker 2>But it seemed like that he was doing one</v>
<v Speaker 2>legged squats.</v>

1777
01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:31.110
<v Speaker 2>And when you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just trying to catch them up.</v>

1778
01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just trying to warm up his hips and</v>

1779
01:19:34.641 --> 01:19:36.920
<v Speaker 2>they're right next to each other too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're about to beat the fuck out</v>

1780
01:19:36.921 --> 01:19:38.420
<v Speaker 2>of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>

1781
01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:39.890
<v Speaker 2>They're all real respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1782
01:19:39.891 --> 01:19:41.780
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went to a couple of different ones</v>

1783
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:45.460
<v Speaker 2>that he's weird promoters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just back alley things.</v>

1784
01:19:45.490 --> 01:19:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Then they just get like 50 people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>show up.</v>

1785
01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Well they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1786
01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:51.380
<v Speaker 2>they are the same way though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when they're world champions,</v>

1787
01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:52.610
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting.</v>

1788
01:19:52.611 --> 01:19:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen world championship fights with</v>

1789
01:19:54.941 --> 01:19:57.950
<v Speaker 2>the two fighters get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've also seen animosity.</v>

1790
01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:01.970
<v Speaker 2>I watched his fight in La were bookout</v>
<v Speaker 2>was fighting this guy and blue cow,</v>

1791
01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:07.250
<v Speaker 2>I think his name was par permit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like their name,</v>

1792
01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:12.400
<v Speaker 2>the part of their name is what their gym</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're fighting out of,</v>

1793
01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:15.010
<v Speaker 2>but I think is his actual name is bull</v>
<v Speaker 2>cow.</v>

1794
01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I think I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure either way.</v>

1795
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:20.190
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad motherfucker like a world</v>
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>

1796
01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:24.450
<v Speaker 2>World class tie fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he fought this dude who was really</v>

1797
01:20:24.451 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 2>disrespectful to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he did this like very violent and</v>

1798
01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:32.390
<v Speaker 2>aggressive dance towards him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1799
01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very different.</v>

1800
01:20:33.451 --> 01:20:35.130
<v Speaker 2>It's very different than I'd ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1801
01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Or He'd like launched arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam and shit and like had all this</v>

1802
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:42.150
<v Speaker 2>choreographed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like directed towards this</v>

1803
01:20:42.151 --> 01:20:44.610
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they fought and he fucked him up.</v>

1804
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.220
<v Speaker 2>He lit him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shut the arrows out of and also</v>

1805
01:20:47.221 --> 01:20:48.090
<v Speaker 2>fucked them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1806
01:20:48.091 --> 01:20:50.280
<v Speaker 2>he fake shot the arrows during his</v>
<v Speaker 2>dance,</v>

1807
01:20:50.281 --> 01:20:52.740
<v Speaker 2>but when they thought he fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

1808
01:20:52.741 --> 01:20:55.450
<v Speaker 2>I felt the trash he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well blue cows on.</v>

1809
01:20:55.530 --> 01:21:00.090
<v Speaker 2>He's on a very high level as a tie</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter and there's a lot of fighters</v>

1810
01:21:00.091 --> 01:21:05.091
<v Speaker 2>who were maybe aggressive and athletic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they hit really hard and they</v>

1811
01:21:05.191 --> 01:21:08.900
<v Speaker 2>overestimate their ability and they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>think they're a bad motherfucker.</v>

1812
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:12.330
<v Speaker 2>They've knocked a bunch of guys out cow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to knock this mother</v>

1813
01:21:12.331 --> 01:21:14.370
<v Speaker 2>fucker out too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people have this idea in their</v>

1814
01:21:14.371 --> 01:21:16.440
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you get in there with that guy and</v>

1815
01:21:16.441 --> 01:21:17.820
<v Speaker 2>you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1816
01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:18.720
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1817
01:21:18.721 --> 01:21:22.590
<v Speaker 2>I can't even hit him and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I move he's killing my legs.</v>

1818
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:25.980
<v Speaker 2>Every time I come close to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his knee is getting burned into my rib</v>

1819
01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:27.840
<v Speaker 2>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's elbowing me in the head on the</v>

1820
01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:30.480
<v Speaker 2>brake and then smiling at me and doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all over again.</v>

1821
01:21:30.481 --> 01:21:32.970
<v Speaker 2>He's going to keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body's gonna start breaking down</v>

1822
01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.520
<v Speaker 2>and that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just started beating the fuck out of</v>

1823
01:21:35.521 --> 01:21:37.260
<v Speaker 2>this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those guys were getting a little</v>

1824
01:21:37.261 --> 01:21:38.110
<v Speaker 2>aggressive there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1825
01:21:38.130 --> 01:21:39.730
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got in the way of,</v>

1826
01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.880
<v Speaker 2>this is what lasts way longer than</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything I saw.</v>

1827
01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:43.680
<v Speaker 2>These guys love each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1828
01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.440
<v Speaker 2>I think they're gonna start making out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Jamie just tricked us into</v>

1829
01:21:46.441 --> 01:21:49.860
<v Speaker 2>watching some gay porn that's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>start off.</v>

1830
01:21:49.861 --> 01:21:53.400
<v Speaker 2>That's why I didn't have gloves on each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other with those things.</v>

1831
01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.141
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1832
01:21:58.141 --> 01:22:02.550
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I saw probably 10 fights the first</v>

1833
01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:05.820

<v Speaker 2>He would've had her on the payroll.</v>

1976
01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:50.270
<v Speaker 2>She'd been riding right next to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That cadillac with the bull horns and</v>

1977
01:28:50.271 --> 01:28:52.790
<v Speaker 2>the front of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she came on to the other guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>just become electrified.</v>

2176
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that totally seems like it would be a</v>

2177
01:37:34.401 --> 01:37:35.810
<v Speaker 2>real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2178
01:37:36.230 --> 01:37:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2179
01:37:38.361 --> 01:37:39.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did they not?</v>

2180
01:37:39.561 --> 01:37:40.281
<v Speaker 2>If they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

2181
01:37:40.281 --> 01:37:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Batman should have that.</v>

2182
01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should have that.</v>

2183
01:37:44.630 --> 01:37:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Superman was still fucking him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why this movie stupid.</v>

2184
01:37:48.110 --> 01:37:51.400

<v Speaker 2>Just going to put crypt to modal</v>
<v Speaker 2>overlays.</v>

01:37:53.570 --> 01:37:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Bodie into superman is going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go and make the world spin backwards so</v>

2187
01:37:57.661 --> 01:38:02.280
<v Speaker 2>that Batman doesn't get the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kryptonite suit dummy to make the world</v>

2188
01:38:02.281 --> 01:38:03.300
<v Speaker 2>spin backwards.</v>

2189
01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Only has to do is stay like 100 feet</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from Batman.</v>

2190
01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:08.760
<v Speaker 2>He could find that when I got the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kryptonite just keeps spinning</v>

2191
01:38:08.761 --> 01:38:09.960
<v Speaker 2>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like a month ago.</v>

2192
01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:14.940
<v Speaker 2>He would just pick up cars and throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>them at Batman till he died to stop.</v>

2193
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not trying to kill him because he's</v>

2194
01:38:16.170 --> 01:38:18.510
<v Speaker 2>all good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if he wanted to he could.</v>

2195
01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea.</v>

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:59.061
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I barely barely know something about</v>

2211
01:38:59.221 --> 01:39:04.110
<v Speaker 2>comic books almost for Star Wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the superhero movies were exactly</v>

2212
01:39:04.111 --> 01:39:05.310
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was like it was.</v>

2218
01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:23.430
<v Speaker 2>It was more than one preview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in star wars was that same movie.</v>

2219
01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:26.280
<v Speaker 2>The last avengers felt really stale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2220
01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>x market,</v>

2223
01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.980
<v Speaker 2>which was excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you haven't seen x Maki.</v>

2224
01:39:36.981 --> 01:39:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a movie about artificial</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and it is beautiful.</v>

2225
01:39:41.731 --> 01:39:45.190
<v Speaker 2>It is a perfect movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't change a thing about that</v>

2226
01:39:45.570 --> 01:39:47.190
<v Speaker 2>movie was so good.</v>

2227
01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:49.390
<v Speaker 2>The ending wasn't like boring and long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2228

2229
01:39:50.650 --> 01:39:51.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2230
01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.150
<v Speaker 2>That movie was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That movie was like,</v>

2231
01:39:54.151 --> 01:39:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the reality of these things have</v>

2232
01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:02.310
<v Speaker 2>this artificial intelligence is guide</v>
<v Speaker 2>created was fucking feasible.</v>

2233
01:40:02.370 --> 01:40:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2234
01:40:03.150 --> 01:40:05.320
<v Speaker 2>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good though.</v>

2235
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:07.350
<v Speaker 2>The dramas good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is good.</v>

2236
01:40:07.351 --> 01:40:10.830
<v Speaker 2>It's just so good and then after that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to see the vendors.</v>

2237
01:40:11.190 --> 01:40:12.870
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so stupid.</v>

2238
01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:14.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this movie is so dumb.</v>

2239
01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:19.860
<v Speaker 2>It's just like I'm watching the Dukes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hazzard take place with superheroes.</v>

2240
01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:21.660
<v Speaker 2>It's just was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't mean anything.</v>

2241
01:40:21.730 --> 01:40:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like X,</v>

2242
01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Mokena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything meant something like the.</v>

2243
01:40:25.330 --> 01:40:26.910
<v Speaker 2>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their interactions,</v>

2244
01:40:26.911 --> 01:40:31.911
<v Speaker 2>the other interactions felt we'll the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some real palpable tension.</v>

2245
01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:37.940
<v Speaker 2>There's a real danger that they're being</v>
<v Speaker 2>played by these artificial creatures</v>

2246
01:40:38.221 --> 01:40:40.470
<v Speaker 2>that they've created that look exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people.</v>

2247
01:40:40.471 --> 01:40:41.700
<v Speaker 2>It's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2248
01:40:41.701 --> 01:40:43.350
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why star wars to me,</v>

2249
01:40:43.351 --> 01:40:44.030
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're pretty big now.</v>

2293
01:42:33.190 --> 01:42:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she's pretty big too.</v>

2294
01:42:35.890 --> 01:42:37.270
<v Speaker 2>We don't know dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're out of the loop.</v>

2295
01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:38.313
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2296

<v Speaker 2>You've heard it.</v>

2297
01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:44.290
<v Speaker 2>She didn't even have a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got some fucking 1980 Morris code</v>

2298
01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:46.580
<v Speaker 2>thing in your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even get.</v>

2299
01:42:46.630 --> 01:42:48.370
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even vibrate when I get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>text.</v>

2300
01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:52.240
<v Speaker 2>It's in my phone if my pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if people texted me</v>

2301
01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:53.810
<v Speaker 2>and then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are you?</v>

2302
01:42:53.811 --> 01:42:54.960
<v Speaker 2>And it isn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2303
01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:55.813
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was walking.</v>

2304
01:42:56.530 --> 01:42:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

2305
01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to only vibrate when it rings and</v>

2306
01:43:00.821 --> 01:43:01.750
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2307
01:43:01.751 --> 01:43:05.170
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't only notification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to a clusterfuck when my phone</v>

2308
01:43:05.230 --> 01:43:10.230
<v Speaker 2>upgraded and went from text messaging to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sending messages and then I turned the I</v>

2309
01:43:11.761 --> 01:43:13.840
<v Speaker 2>message off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then people were still sending me</v>

2310
01:43:13.841 --> 01:43:16.240
<v Speaker 2>ims juice that was getting them on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>

2311
01:43:16.241 --> 01:43:17.710
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't getting them on my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2312
01:43:17.711 --> 01:43:21.730
<v Speaker 2>this is so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this system is so goofy.</v>

2313
01:43:22.330 --> 01:43:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Like how do you opt out of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you just.</v>

2314
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:27.760
<v Speaker 2>I want everything in one place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need it going every.</v>

2315
01:43:27.790 --> 01:43:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to be getting phone calls</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my fucking computer when I'm.</v>

2316
01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:35.100
<v Speaker 2>When I put my phone over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to get like the voice</v>

2317
01:43:35.101 --> 01:43:38.170
<v Speaker 2>mails later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see it on my computer</v>

2318
01:43:38.171 --> 01:43:40.000
<v Speaker 2>when I'm working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what do I have to do now?</v>

2319
01:43:40.001 --> 01:43:43.150
<v Speaker 2>I have to disable this and I've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is this set there by default?</v>

2320
01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Why is my phone making my computer ring</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the fuck?</v>

2321
01:43:46.210 --> 01:43:48.720
<v Speaker 2>Can I get some shit done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

2322
01:43:48.730 --> 01:43:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Ari Shaffir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always infringing.</v>

2323
01:43:50.261 --> 01:43:53.510
<v Speaker 2>It's always infringing in your day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ken Did the ball.</v>

2324
01:43:53.530 --> 01:43:55.040
<v Speaker 2>Go check twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been four minutes.</v>

2325
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if there's no response to ball?</v>

2326
01:43:59.750 --> 01:44:03.260
<v Speaker 2>He'll resistances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>few tile independence,</v>

2327
01:44:03.261 --> 01:44:04.850
<v Speaker 2>which is my real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's getting better,</v>

2328
01:44:04.851 --> 01:44:07.190
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think we've developed an</v>
<v Speaker 2>etiquette around phones yet.</v>

2329
01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:09.730
<v Speaker 2>You say that until you have four legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every girl wants</v>

2330
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:14.780
<v Speaker 2>to get that for less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Girls don't even know why.</v>

2331
01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Something about them for legs just looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2332
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:22.460
<v Speaker 2>It didn't get way easier.</v>

2333
01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:23.650
<v Speaker 7>Jim.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll just say what about,</v>

2334
01:44:23.651 --> 01:44:27.140
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the twitter news of the weekend where</v>

2335
01:44:27.141 --> 01:44:29.690
<v Speaker 7>they might be changing some free</v>
<v Speaker 7>spirits,</v>

2336
01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:32.030
<v Speaker 7>free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 7>stuff that pulled away verification</v>

2337
01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:32.660
<v Speaker 7>from.</v>

2338
01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:35.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pull away Milo Yiannopoulos</v>

2339
01:44:35.121 --> 01:44:39.530
<v Speaker 2>verification for bold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Verification Away why they said that?</v>

2340
01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't say exactly violation of</v>

2341
01:44:42.441 --> 01:44:44.720
<v Speaker 2>terms of service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now he's no a verified.</v>

2342
01:44:44.930 --> 01:44:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's still allowed to post.</v>

2343
01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:49.470
<v Speaker 2>So there's some posts are saying if it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>offensive or the,</v>

2344
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:50.420
<v Speaker 2>your account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2345
01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Well they did not see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not being any more like here's a</v>

2346
01:44:54.681 --> 01:44:57.590
<v Speaker 2>problem with that guy and it's not a bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

2347
01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:02.270
<v Speaker 2>He's funny and a lot of what he's doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>is theater like.</v>

2348
01:45:02.271 --> 01:45:05.270
<v Speaker 2>And if he gets you riled up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if he has a point.</v>

2349
01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:08.000
<v Speaker 2>And I think he has a point with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things he's picking on,</v>

2350
01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:09.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not dumb.</v>

2351
01:45:09.081 --> 01:45:14.081
<v Speaker 2>He's very smart and so he's getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>people riled up like a professional</v>

2352
01:45:14.631 --> 01:45:17.420
<v Speaker 2>troll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was also a very bright guy who writes</v>

2353
01:45:17.421 --> 01:45:19.690
<v Speaker 2>some pretty good articles and I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>say really good art.</v>

2354
01:45:19.690 --> 01:45:22.100
<v Speaker 2>What is someone who writes for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Breitbart?</v>

2355
01:45:22.101 --> 01:45:23.270
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's hilarious.</v>

2356
01:45:23.271 --> 01:45:27.440
<v Speaker 2>He's a conservative writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a conservative,</v>

2357
01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:29.630
<v Speaker 2>I guess a blogger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess we'd call them.</v>

2358
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:31.730
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't say he's a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's more of a,</v>

2359
01:45:31.731 --> 01:45:32.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he writes editorials,</v>

2360
01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:34.460
<v Speaker 2>writes just pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2361
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:38.780
<v Speaker 2>But he's also gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like gay as fuck and conservative and he</v>

2362
01:45:38.781 --> 01:45:43.550
<v Speaker 2>goes into debates with these feminists</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just crushes them with facts and</v>

2363
01:45:43.551 --> 01:45:46.120
<v Speaker 2>they can't attack him because he's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has the,</v>

2364
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:50.840
<v Speaker 2>he has the sketch down card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got this weird loophole and he</v>

2365
01:45:50.841 --> 01:45:52.640
<v Speaker 2>knows what the fuck he's talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2366
01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:54.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't agree with them on some</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2367
01:45:54.711 --> 01:45:58.790
<v Speaker 2>but he's a very bright guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he finds someone that he can</v>

2368
01:45:58.791 --> 01:46:00.890
<v Speaker 2>pick on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially like he's really into picking</v>

2369
01:46:00.891 --> 01:46:04.820
<v Speaker 2>out feminists and calling them out on</v>
<v Speaker 2>their hypocrisy and picking on people</v>

2370
01:46:04.821 --> 01:46:08.360
<v Speaker 2>that just an eight minute he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll go across the board with anybody</v>

2371
01:46:08.410 --> 01:46:12.170
<v Speaker 2>if he thinks you're being ridiculous and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he makes a big deal out of it.</v>

2372
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:14.430
<v Speaker 2>So then what people got mad at what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying.</v>

2373
01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:15.383
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll say,</v>

2374
01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:16.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2375
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:19.310
<v Speaker 2>he'll say things to rile people up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll say offensive things,</v>

2376
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:21.230
<v Speaker 2>but guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you block them.</v>

2377
01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:23.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's enjoyable.</v>

2378
01:46:23.290 --> 01:46:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Like I would think it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twitter becomes weird where it's like</v>

2379
01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:27.320
<v Speaker 2>you have a bunch of followers who follow</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2380
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:31.550
<v Speaker 2>You say something funny on the offensive</v>
<v Speaker 2>side instead of on the cute side,</v>

2381
01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:34.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get retweets if some cute side or</v>

2382
01:46:34.341 --> 01:46:34.970
<v Speaker 2>if it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2383
01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:38.060
<v Speaker 2>So now the retweets go to people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't follow you and they might not even</v>

2384
01:46:38.061 --> 01:46:39.620
<v Speaker 2>know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then go like,</v>

2385
01:46:39.650 --> 01:46:41.840
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that supposed to mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's this guy,</v>

2386
01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:44.450
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they don't see any context.</v>

2387
01:46:44.451 --> 01:46:47.420
<v Speaker 2>They don't say it's one out of 10 tweets</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a row about a subject.</v>

2388
01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then they see it.</v>

2389
01:46:48.970 --> 01:46:50.250
<v Speaker 2>Then they get mad and they flag</v>

2390
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:51.360
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the people don't know,</v>

2391
01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:51.721
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2392
01:46:51.721 --> 01:46:54.030
<v Speaker 1>It's been flagged 7,000 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess people are mad at this guy.</v>

2393
01:46:54.031 --> 01:46:55.200
<v Speaker 1>We got to band them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2394
01:46:55.201 --> 01:46:57.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially as a terrible road to go down</v>

2395
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:59.560
<v Speaker 1>if there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing a series of,</v>

2396
01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:02.250
<v Speaker 1>of show one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2397
01:47:02.251 --> 01:47:04.020
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even looking at the context.</v>

2398
01:47:04.021 --> 01:47:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2399
01:47:04.891 --> 01:47:08.510
<v Speaker 1>that can definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took away his verify and not be</v>

2400
01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.020
<v Speaker 1>verified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I'm saying.</v>

2401
01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:13.020
<v Speaker 1>They fucked up because now you have even</v>
<v Speaker 1>made him a martyr.</v>

2402
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:14.103
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2403
01:47:14.650 --> 01:47:18.810
<v Speaker 1>you're playing right into a spiderweb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is twitter getting involved in any</v>

2404
01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:20.520
<v Speaker 1>level of celebrity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which he seems like he is.</v>

2405
01:47:20.521 --> 01:47:22.170
<v Speaker 1>If was a known writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he's a known.</v>

2406
01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:24.780
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was great on the podcast.</v>

2407
01:47:24.810 --> 01:47:25.261
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2408
01:47:25.261 --> 01:47:26.360
<v Speaker 1>he's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2409
01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:27.940
<v Speaker 1>he's a nut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2410
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2411
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:30.750
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with them about a lot of</v>

2412
01:47:30.751 --> 01:47:33.280
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like what he's doing.</v>

2413
01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:35.190
<v Speaker 1>It makes me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's.</v>

2414
01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:39.690
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference when he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing and what a lot of like,</v>

2415
01:47:39.810 --> 01:47:42.450
<v Speaker 1>funny humorous journalists have done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about this evidence?</v>

2416
01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:46.360
<v Speaker 1>You say something Ernest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think is like offensively wrong</v>

2417
01:47:46.361 --> 01:47:48.120
<v Speaker 1>and anti free speech and it gets me</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>

2418
01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't try to get them banned from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2419
01:47:50.401 --> 01:47:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind but I don't mind because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't effect my mind.</v>

2420
01:47:54.451 --> 01:47:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to stop them from</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying it.</v>

2421
01:47:56.210 --> 01:47:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean it hasn't affected me on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional level and if it has,</v>

2422
01:47:59.821 --> 01:48:01.210
<v Speaker 1>it's my fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2423
01:48:01.330 --> 01:48:03.410
<v Speaker 1>anything that I've ever been affected by</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2424
01:48:03.411 --> 01:48:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Like if I made a mistake because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly been my fault,</v>

2425
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:09.960
<v Speaker 1>I've made definitely some errors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a difference between</v>

2426
01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:13.310
<v Speaker 1>like I think what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

2427
01:48:15.110 --> 01:48:16.790
<v Speaker 1>decisions for them to make them for you.</v>

2428
01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Well bothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to.</v>

2429
01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Getting back to that guy in Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2430
01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:26.570
<v Speaker 1>that had to pay 15 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What bothers me about any,</v>

2431
01:48:26.730 --> 01:48:31.140
<v Speaker 1>any interaction between two people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one person said something rude or</v>

2432
01:48:31.150 --> 01:48:32.730
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what exactly went down.</v>

2433
01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:37.230
<v Speaker 1>That money starts being a thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown around because then the</v>

2434
01:48:37.231 --> 01:48:38.820
<v Speaker 1>government gets their piece too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

2435
01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're on the side of like,</v>

2436
01:48:41.250 --> 01:48:42.440
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to sue them.</v>

2437
01:48:42.450 --> 01:48:44.460
<v Speaker 1>They also get their piece because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trial,</v>

2438
01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:48.780
<v Speaker 1>like these court costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything has to get factored in.</v>

2439
01:48:48.781 --> 01:48:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly how it works in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

2440
01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:52.890
<v Speaker 1>but if it was in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Ward isn't serious.</v>

2441
01:48:52.891 --> 01:48:54.820
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's had a lot of money in his own and</v>

2442
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:56.880
<v Speaker 1>his own lawyer fees because he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting it.</v>

2443
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.500
<v Speaker 1>He has cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like a,</v>

2444
01:48:58.590 --> 01:49:00.570
<v Speaker 1>he's like a well known French Canadian</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic.</v>

2445
01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:02.750
<v Speaker 1>So he has this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like French Canadian tour.</v>

2446
01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.680
<v Speaker 1>You can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one was he with?</v>

2447
01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Mike Ward is the one with um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you were talking about it earlier,</v>

2448
01:49:08.761 --> 01:49:12.840
<v Speaker 1>but the kid who had some diseases</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he made a joke about that.</v>

2449
01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:13.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2450
01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:18.470
<v Speaker 1>And it was a bit had but like he's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay all his legal fees and try to win</v>

2451
01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:21.100
<v Speaker 1>this and he could pay the 80 grand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sooner for.</v>

2452
01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:23.550
<v Speaker 1>But he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that sets such a terrible</v>

2453
01:49:23.551 --> 01:49:26.910
<v Speaker 1>precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we just in his own battle on free</v>

2454
01:49:26.911 --> 01:49:29.670
<v Speaker 1>speech saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to lose this for what it</v>

2455
01:49:29.671 --> 01:49:31.380
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked.</v>

2456
01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:35.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's people like full qm have</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that joke.</v>

2457
01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:37.890
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course he should have got laughs.</v>

2458
01:49:37.891 --> 01:49:39.930
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of labs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it enough times where was a is a</v>

2459
01:49:39.931 --> 01:49:41.640
<v Speaker 1>winning bit and his act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2460
01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:44.460
<v Speaker 1>And you can't decide that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>

2461
01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you should be able to take money</v>

2462
01:49:47.951 --> 01:49:50.710
<v Speaker 1>away from people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2463
01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might want to say you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to ever go to one of his shows</v>

2464
01:49:53.471 --> 01:49:57.190
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to chick fil a,</v>

2465
01:49:57.191 --> 01:49:58.500
<v Speaker 1>the guy who supports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2466
01:49:58.510 --> 01:49:59.560
<v Speaker 1>anti gay stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2467
01:49:59.561 --> 01:50:01.330
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you speak with your own</v>

2468
01:50:01.331 --> 01:50:02.380
<v Speaker 1>dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2469
01:50:02.450 --> 01:50:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the market decide.</v>

2470
01:50:04.410 --> 01:50:05.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a,</v>

2471
01:50:05.970 --> 01:50:09.130
<v Speaker 1>that's the appropriate way to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking directors.</v>

2472
01:50:09.131 --> 01:50:12.010
<v Speaker 1>That guy who did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who did pan's labyrinth,</v>

2473
01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:16.360
<v Speaker 1>whammo dealt garbage now how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then it's like,</v>

2474
01:50:16.361 --> 01:50:18.220
<v Speaker 1>once you realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like</v>

2475
01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:22.060
<v Speaker 1>he used to be cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's like fucking awful.</v>

2476
01:50:22.061 --> 01:50:23.830
<v Speaker 1>And it's just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gone sour,</v>

2477
01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:25.930
<v Speaker 1>so then it's like I just won't watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>them anymore,</v>

2478
01:50:25.931 --> 01:50:28.420
<v Speaker 1>but of course go make whatever you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make in.</v>

2479
01:50:29.890 --> 01:50:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say went sour.</v>

2480
01:50:32.050 --> 01:50:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I still like it stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd like the hobbit that he wrote just</v>

2481
01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:37.150
<v Speaker 1>like that last movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't like it.</v>

2482
01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:39.790
<v Speaker 1>The last movie he didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like it was an acting class</v>

2483
01:50:39.791 --> 01:50:40.680
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>

2484
01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:45.470
<v Speaker 1>It was just like there was no acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You the cabin thing or you think you are</v>

2485
01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:49.300
<v Speaker 1>main wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was probably pretty high,</v>

2486
01:50:50.290 --> 01:50:53.920
<v Speaker 1>but God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was such terrible acting and no plot</v>

2487
01:50:53.921 --> 01:50:55.030
<v Speaker 1>and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

2488
01:50:55.031 --> 01:50:55.421
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

2489
01:50:55.421 --> 01:50:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you some special effects and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>

2490
01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:58.780

<v Speaker 1>Know what?</v>

2491
01:50:58.781 --> 01:50:59.920
<v Speaker 1>I did leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>

2492
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I left quietly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2493
01:51:01.570 --> 01:51:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Me and the girl I was looking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually we were like.</v>

2494
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:06.340
<v Speaker 1>It was like we both realized we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>both wanting to leave for about 25</v>

2495
01:51:06.341 --> 01:51:07.310
<v Speaker 1>minutes and then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2496
01:51:07.311 --> 01:51:10.150
<v Speaker 1>let's just go here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you just want to get your freak</v>

2497
01:51:10.151 --> 01:51:11.170
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>

2498
01:51:11.210 --> 01:51:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Do you like that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that new movie made?</v>

2499
01:51:13.590 --> 01:51:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Did you really do you have.</v>

2500
01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even going to bring up the what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American side because I'm afraid of</v>

2501
01:51:20.291 --> 01:51:21.880
<v Speaker 1>it because it's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no boots.</v>

2502
01:51:21.881 --> 01:51:23.080
<v Speaker 1>Bring that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's bring that up.</v>

2503
01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Because I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me you didn't like it.</v>

2504
01:51:26.770 --> 01:51:28.780
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a good movie.</v>

2505
01:51:28.781 --> 01:51:30.670
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing.</v>

2506
01:51:30.710 --> 01:51:33.130
<v Speaker 1>No development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2507
01:51:33.131 --> 01:51:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I never get to like him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now he's having trouble sleeping.</v>

2508
01:51:35.921 --> 01:51:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2509
01:51:36.761 --> 01:51:40.810
<v Speaker 1>whites is where it's a scene in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject matter is highly charged and</v>

2510
01:51:40.811 --> 01:51:42.790
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very sensitive to people.</v>

2511
01:51:42.791 --> 01:51:47.710
<v Speaker 1>So anything that's thought of in</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespect of Chris Kyle,</v>

2512
01:51:47.890 --> 01:51:51.640
<v Speaker 1>people automatically get up in arms for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely understood talking about</v>

2513
01:51:51.641 --> 01:51:52.740
<v Speaker 1>his book and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2514
01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I didn't read any that I saw this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking awful movie.</v>

2515
01:51:55.190 --> 01:51:55.670
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2516
01:51:55.670 --> 01:51:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I completely understand people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>position in respecting him as a guy who</v>

2517
01:51:59.770 --> 01:52:01.840
<v Speaker 1>kept people safe over there.</v>

2518
01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I understand where they're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His wife,</v>

2519
01:52:04.530 --> 01:52:06.610
<v Speaker 1>half the movie when he's in battles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very angry,</v>

2520
01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.640
<v Speaker 1>but I was going to say it's just not</v>
<v Speaker 1>well done.</v>

2521
01:52:09.670 --> 01:52:10.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not well done.</v>

2522
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:13.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not just not that well done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2523
01:52:13.681 --> 01:52:16.900
<v Speaker 1>it's just my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just felt like it was flat and this is</v>

2524
01:52:16.901 --> 01:52:18.280
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a good comparison.</v>

2525
01:52:18.290 --> 01:52:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to beat a dead horse,</v>

2526
01:52:20.141 --> 01:52:24.700
<v Speaker 1>but I'm x Mokena Ipa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch x Maki now and watch that movie.</v>

2527
01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:28.170
<v Speaker 1>There's a way that it's shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a way the story's told that</v>

2528
01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:31.840
<v Speaker 1>story is a very compelling story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a crazy story.</v>

2529
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:33.580
<v Speaker 1>That countdown was a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>

2530
01:52:33.581 --> 01:52:35.290
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clipping and fucking yes.</v>

2531
01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Exacerbating the Chris Kyle counselor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2532
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:40.210
<v Speaker 1>would've been fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan was great.</v>

2533
01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:45.660
<v Speaker 1>How about tell the truth about Chris</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle's life like in towards the end</v>

2534
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:48.950
<v Speaker 2>where he was involved in that Jesse</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ventura thing,</v>

2535
01:52:48.951 --> 01:52:52.220
<v Speaker 2>which is really kind of crazy where he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>making up a story about a fight with</v>

2536
01:52:52.221 --> 01:52:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Jesse Ventura.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That never happened.</v>

2537
01:52:54.410 --> 01:52:58.730
<v Speaker 2>So Jesse Ventura sued him and won and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then after he won,</v>

2538
01:52:58.890 --> 01:52:59.710
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2539
01:52:59.710 --> 01:53:02.960
<v Speaker 2>he got Chris Kyle got killed and Jesse</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ventura got all these death threats</v>

2540
01:53:02.961 --> 01:53:04.700
<v Speaker 2>because you want to continue to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2541
01:53:04.701 --> 01:53:06.230
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that much of a year before he</v>
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>

2542
01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:07.970
<v Speaker 2>It was just some guy who's lying about</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2543
01:53:08.860 --> 01:53:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can be both.</v>

2544
01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2545
01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:14.510
<v Speaker 2>This is where things get really</v>
<v Speaker 2>confusing.</v>

2546
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Jackson rapes boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he did.</v>

2547
01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I think he just jerked off in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and shit,</v>

2548
01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:22.160
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he was raping them.</v>

2549
01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like that would have got</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2550
01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:25.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're right.</v>

2551
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:30.670
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just parties and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe stroke,</v>

2552
01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:33.270
<v Speaker 2>but definitely inappropriate boners.</v>

2553
01:53:34.110 --> 01:53:35.570
<v Speaker 2>If he could get one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got one.</v>

2554
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:40.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean during that time period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's got to find time to jerk off</v>

2555
01:53:41.271 --> 01:53:43.800
<v Speaker 2>unless he's jerking off in the shower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2556
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:45.140
<v Speaker 2>touching it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These kids,</v>

2557
01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:48.650
<v Speaker 2>they're over the house all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sitting in his lap and you know,</v>

2558
01:53:48.690 --> 01:53:50.390
<v Speaker 2>just blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sensitive tissue</v>

2559
01:53:52.270 --> 01:53:54.310
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His fault or my fault.</v>

2560
01:53:55.630 --> 01:53:57.420
<v Speaker 2>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just love.</v>

2561
01:53:58.780 --> 01:54:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's so sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just love.</v>

2562
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:02.230
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2563
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:04.810
<v Speaker 2>could just be beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cup of listening to Ben.</v>

2564
01:54:05.090 --> 01:54:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Exactly down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2565
01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Good Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the one in the room with macaulay.</v>

2566
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got on that.</v>

2567
01:54:16.190 --> 01:54:17.540
<v Speaker 2>How do we go that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just,</v>

2568
01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I just went with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're talking about somebody that</v>

2569
01:54:20.890 --> 01:54:24.830
<v Speaker 2>you can be two things at once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean he wasn't a hero.</v>

2570
01:54:25.050 --> 01:54:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those saved.</v>

2571
01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll think about what he did.</v>

2572
01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a great sniper saved American</v>

2573
01:54:32.661 --> 01:54:36.920
<v Speaker 2>citizens that were over there fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the war against other people that</v>

2574
01:54:36.921 --> 01:54:39.110
<v Speaker 2>were fighting against American citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way.</v>

2575
01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

2576
01:54:40.610 --> 01:54:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Draw your conclusion about who's right</v>

2577
01:54:42.201 --> 01:54:44.660
<v Speaker 2>or who's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get that out of your head and he was</v>

2578
01:54:44.661 --> 01:54:46.010
<v Speaker 2>trying to protect his friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2579
01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:48.800
<v Speaker 2>so whether or not you think that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be on this team or that team or</v>

2580
01:54:48.801 --> 01:54:51.740
<v Speaker 2>this team is bad and that team's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll put all that aside.</v>

2581
01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:54.290
<v Speaker 2>He kept a bunch of people live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people came back.</v>

2582
01:54:54.291 --> 01:54:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not you think they should</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back,</v>

2583
01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:58.070
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you think that she'd ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>been in there in the first place.</v>

2584
01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:02.810
<v Speaker 2>He definitely helped countless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's probably actually probably</v>

2585
01:55:02.811 --> 01:55:05.190
<v Speaker 2>if this movie is about the French sniper</v>
<v Speaker 2>or about sniper,</v>

2586
01:55:05.210 --> 01:55:07.640
<v Speaker 2>the world doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's was not a good movie.</v>

2587
01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:11.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good movie he ever took was</v>

2588
01:55:11.031 --> 01:55:14.090
<v Speaker 2>like 2000 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the numbers anymore and</v>

2589
01:55:14.091 --> 01:55:15.960
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he hurts.</v>

2590
01:55:15.961 --> 01:55:18.440
<v Speaker 2>So and so Mustafa was getting shocked</v>
<v Speaker 2>that long.</v>

2591
01:55:18.441 --> 01:55:20.000
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's possible I've shot that,</v>

2592
01:55:20.001 --> 01:55:22.220
<v Speaker 2>but that's the longest I've ever shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when he shoots him at the end,</v>

2593
01:55:22.250 --> 01:55:27.140
<v Speaker 2>it's twice as far as the longest shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's ever heard of it can't even see the</v>

2594
01:55:27.141 --> 01:55:28.280
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just see a blur.</v>

2595
01:55:28.281 --> 01:55:29.420
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's him.</v>

2596
01:55:29.540 --> 01:55:30.890
<v Speaker 2>It must be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling.</v>

2597
01:55:31.190 --> 01:55:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it goes,</v>

2598
01:55:32.211 --> 01:55:33.044
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Them.</v>

2599
01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:35.420
<v Speaker 2>You can't even see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2600
01:55:36.210 --> 01:55:40.310
<v Speaker 2>made the twice as long as any shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ever been recorded without being</v>

2601
01:55:40.311 --> 01:55:40.700
<v Speaker 2>able to see it.</v>

2602
01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:42.380
<v Speaker 2>You just know you have you made it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2603
01:55:42.381 --> 01:55:46.050
<v Speaker 2>You need a spotting for 200 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2604
01:55:46.051 --> 01:55:50.430
<v Speaker 2>people look at as target that's 200</v>
<v Speaker 2>yards away spotting scope to see where</v>

2605
01:55:50.431 --> 01:55:53.430
<v Speaker 2>you're hitting on the target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause like it's not that good to see how</v>

2606
01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:56.880
<v Speaker 2>the scope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're a rifle scope from 200</v>

2607
01:55:56.881 --> 01:55:57.900
<v Speaker 2>yards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is nothing.</v>

2608
01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:01.380
<v Speaker 2>So like two football fields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just.</v>

2609
01:56:01.570 --> 01:56:03.150
<v Speaker 2>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the question though,</v>

2610
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:09.350
<v Speaker 2>is it also a factor of you're telling a</v>
<v Speaker 2>real person's story with his little</v>

2611
01:56:09.721 --> 01:56:14.310
<v Speaker 2>variation from the truth as possible</v>
<v Speaker 2>over at an acceptable period of time,</v>

2612
01:56:14.311 --> 01:56:17.340
<v Speaker 2>a two hour movie or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hard to do,</v>

2613
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.460
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't do a good job of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did a terrible job of it,</v>

2614
01:56:20.610 --> 01:56:23.850
<v Speaker 2>but it would've been incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to do even if it did a great</v>

2615
01:56:23.851 --> 01:56:25.170
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let's just back up a second.</v>

2616
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:28.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm best actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2617
01:56:28.350 --> 01:56:29.490
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not real.</v>

2618
01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

2619
01:56:30.330 --> 01:56:33.810
<v Speaker 2>He looked like he could tell what he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing lines where he was hit a rubber</v>

2620
01:56:33.811 --> 01:56:35.850
<v Speaker 2>baby and I knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget to rubber baby,</v>

2621
01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:38.200
<v Speaker 2>but he's moving the rubber baby with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>fingers and thumb.</v>

2622
01:56:38.450 --> 01:56:39.710
<v Speaker 2>You can go fuck yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2623
01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:41.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you do on a magic trick that I</v>

2624
01:56:41.881 --> 01:56:46.200
<v Speaker 2>can see who and were going to stick this</v>
<v Speaker 2>into my hand and you're shoveling in</v>

2625
01:56:46.201 --> 01:56:50.610
<v Speaker 2>your wrist at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thumbs coming apart,</v>

2626
01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:55.190
<v Speaker 2>bulging your shirt at the fucking Hanky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still sticking out a little bit what?</v>

2627
01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:59.120
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in the beginning when he finds his,</v>

2628
01:56:59.190 --> 01:57:01.820
<v Speaker 2>his girlfriend and the other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are out there having that talk and</v>

2629
01:57:01.821 --> 01:57:02.790
<v Speaker 2>he's drinking a beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2630
01:57:02.791 --> 01:57:03.540
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

2631
01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:05.250
<v Speaker 2>You're not even a real person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is acting class.</v>

2632
01:57:05.250 --> 01:57:08.160
<v Speaker 2>I can see you doing lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not a real person.</v>

2633
01:57:08.190 --> 01:57:11.430
<v Speaker 2>He's behaving in this incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exemplary way.</v>

2634
01:57:11.610 --> 01:57:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Like a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in practice.</v>

2635
01:57:13.290 --> 01:57:16.170
<v Speaker 2>He's a beautiful hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not perfect hero and we can't</v>

2636
01:57:16.171 --> 01:57:17.310
<v Speaker 2>believe he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2637
01:57:17.311 --> 01:57:18.630
<v Speaker 2>that's what he's a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in a</v>

2638
01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.230
<v Speaker 2>fight with his girl and he stands up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2639
01:57:22.231 --> 01:57:24.300
<v Speaker 2>you're just tell that the directors in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the background,</v>

2640
01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:25.290
<v Speaker 2>feel it more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>

2641
01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Feel it more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2642
01:57:26.430 --> 01:57:28.390
<v Speaker 2>Let this hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You love America because it's happening</v>

2643
01:57:28.391 --> 01:57:29.460
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feel it more.</v>

2644
01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:32.880
<v Speaker 2>What's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you try to dramatize anything,</v>

2645
01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:36.870
<v Speaker 2>you know that movie Fox catcher is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>clusterfuck of lies.</v>

2646
01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:40.030
<v Speaker 2>Really movie that's based on Mark</v>
<v Speaker 2>Schultz and David Schultz,</v>

2647
01:57:40.130 --> 01:57:45.130
<v Speaker 2>sort of Olympic wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were a very famous American Olympic</v>

2648
01:57:45.151 --> 01:57:48.720
<v Speaker 2>champion wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were both beasts and there was this</v>

2649
01:57:48.721 --> 01:57:52.200
<v Speaker 2>crazy guy named John Dupont and John</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dupont had a lot of money,</v>

2650
01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:56.790
<v Speaker 2>so like the dupont name and he was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy man and he wanted to wrestle,</v>

2651
01:57:56.940 --> 01:58:01.800
<v Speaker 2>so he hired all these guys and built an</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible world class training facility</v>

2652
01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:04.350
<v Speaker 2>and paid them and these guys were</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggling wrestlers.</v>

2653
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:06.300
<v Speaker 2>They went down there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys,</v>

2654
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Dave wound up getting murdered by dupont</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just crazy store and Steve</v>

2655
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:12.960
<v Speaker 2>Carell played him in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the movie,</v>

2656
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:17.190
<v Speaker 2>although it was a good movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality was way off,</v>

2657
01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:19.920
<v Speaker 2>way off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they changed the timeline of the</v>

2658
01:58:19.921 --> 01:58:21.640
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stayed,</v>

2659
01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:26.490
<v Speaker 2>they had to the UFC existing like way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way before it did.</v>

2660
01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:28.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm less concerned with that than if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a movie then,</v>

2661
01:58:29.010 --> 01:58:31.530
<v Speaker 2>unless they say it's like a actual</v>
<v Speaker 2>biography.</v>

2662
01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm less concerned with that than,</v>

2663
01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:36.060
<v Speaker 2>than if a like narcos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2664
01:58:36.110 --> 01:58:37.610
<v Speaker 2>know some of this is based on truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of this,</v>

2665
01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:39.250
<v Speaker 2>just like they didn't know the</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with this guy in this</v>

2666
01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:42.310
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't have to fake that</v>
<v Speaker 2>historic data.</v>

2667
01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Did they figure because they're idiots?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What benefits of this plot?</v>

2668
01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:48.790
<v Speaker 2>It's somebodies thinks they're smarter</v>
<v Speaker 2>than everyone who's going to know the</v>

2669
01:58:48.791 --> 01:58:50.510
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the dumbest thing too,</v>

2670
01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:51.423
<v Speaker 2>to think.</v>

2671
01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:55.840
<v Speaker 2>You should never think if you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about a subject like the UFC,</v>

2672
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:59.160
<v Speaker 2>which to a person like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're a fan and definitely into.</v>

2673
01:58:59.310 --> 01:59:01.120
<v Speaker 2>You know when it starts offensive as</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

2674
01:59:01.121 --> 01:59:02.860
<v Speaker 2>When you try to pretend it started a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different date.</v>

2675
01:59:02.890 --> 01:59:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Then when you watch him watch on</v>
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>

2676
01:59:06.671 --> 01:59:09.400
<v Speaker 2>watch big daddy goodrich fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when he fights in the movie,</v>

2677
01:59:09.401 --> 01:59:10.870
<v Speaker 2>he fights them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White Russian guy.</v>

2678
01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fought big daddy goodrich.</v>

2679
01:59:13.330 --> 01:59:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Mark Schultz fought big daddy good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I watched it.</v>

2680
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:19.360
<v Speaker 2>He beat his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took him down at will and I remember</v>

2681
01:59:19.361 --> 01:59:21.220
<v Speaker 2>watching it going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

2682
01:59:21.221 --> 01:59:24.550
<v Speaker 2>this is what happens when you get elite</v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympic gold medalists,</v>

2683
01:59:24.670 --> 01:59:26.680
<v Speaker 2>world champion wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was thinking to myself,</v>

2684
01:59:26.681 --> 01:59:28.750
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is going to keep that guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>off of them?</v>

2685
01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:30.820
<v Speaker 2>That could have been a world champion</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2686
01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:33.140
<v Speaker 2>He nobody wanted to know.</v>

2687
01:59:33.190 --> 01:59:35.860
<v Speaker 2>He was in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought big daddy goodrich in the UFC,</v>

2688
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:39.110
<v Speaker 2>but there was no money back then and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a Gig with a.</v>

2689
01:59:39.250 --> 01:59:42.700
<v Speaker 2>He was teaching wrestling at a college</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not paid more.</v>

2690
01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:46.300
<v Speaker 2>What was coach a wrestling coach?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a university gig.</v>

2691
01:59:46.301 --> 01:59:49.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a really respected wrestler</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't want him cage fighting,</v>

2692
01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:52.090
<v Speaker 2>so they told him like this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have to make a decision.</v>

2693
01:59:52.091 --> 01:59:56.290
<v Speaker 2>So he had to go with the the obvious job</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there was no money in the UFC</v>

2694
01:59:56.291 --> 02:00:00.820
<v Speaker 2>back then is fucking really dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they changed in the movie.</v>

2695
02:00:00.821 --> 02:00:02.870
<v Speaker 2>They had them fighting in some unknown</v>
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>

2696
02:00:02.871 --> 02:00:05.880
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the UFC and the guy was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>white Russian guy who was fighting like,</v>

2697
02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:07.360
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you a question.</v>

2698
02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Could this be the reason they changed</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

2699
02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Because what the UFC means right now is</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this massive thing.</v>

2700
02:00:12.970 --> 02:00:14.410
<v Speaker 2>So they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well viewers,</v>

2701
02:00:14.770 --> 02:00:15.810
<v Speaker 2>if they saw this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2702
02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:16.960
<v Speaker 2>you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that's really big.</v>

2703
02:00:16.961 --> 02:00:18.420
<v Speaker 2>I would give up UFC where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2704
02:00:18.421 --> 02:00:19.750
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to be in the place.</v>

2705
02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was just a rogue thing.</v>

2706
02:00:22.990 --> 02:00:25.570
<v Speaker 2>People just did it to mix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2707
02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I see what you want to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cursing in deadwood.</v>

2708
02:00:27.670 --> 02:00:28.241
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2709
02:00:28.241 --> 02:00:30.790
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have that then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not gonna understand the</v>

2710
02:00:30.791 --> 02:00:33.310
<v Speaker 2>cursing they actually had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they have cursing back then?</v>

2711
02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:37.340
<v Speaker 2>They had like rapscallion and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he wouldn't hit as hard as it as an</v>

2712
02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:40.720
<v Speaker 2>scallion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they had to change the reality to</v>

2713
02:00:40.721 --> 02:00:44.410
<v Speaker 2>make it the feeling of the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you were doing a comedy show</v>

2714
02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:46.960
<v Speaker 2>in the wild west and someone tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>heckle you,</v>

2715
02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:51.070
<v Speaker 2>fucking go to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of damage you could do to them</v>

2716
02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:55.240
<v Speaker 2>with the cursing I have now rapscallion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a cunt.</v>

2717
02:00:56.020 --> 02:00:57.520
<v Speaker 2>You fucking bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2718
02:00:57.610 --> 02:00:59.050
<v Speaker 2>you're anchored out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck boy.</v>

2719
02:00:59.051 --> 02:01:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're angry and it's not even a real</v>

2720
02:01:00.491 --> 02:01:01.650
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about.</v>

2721
02:01:01.690 --> 02:01:03.160
<v Speaker 2>It all worked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2722
02:01:03.190 --> 02:01:05.170
<v Speaker 2>Fucking pea pea shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>

2723
02:01:05.171 --> 02:01:08.320
<v Speaker 2>She was Christ peter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rusty Stirrup,</v>

2724
02:01:08.410 --> 02:01:10.450
<v Speaker 2>cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he brings you in front of the</v>

2725
02:01:10.451 --> 02:01:12.940
<v Speaker 2>tribunal and you have to give up three</v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces of gold.</v>

2726
02:01:13.930 --> 02:01:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three pieces of gold,</v>

2727
02:01:16.810 --> 02:01:19.180
<v Speaker 2>gold shift here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it's going to happen,</v>

2728
02:01:19.181 --> 02:01:20.380
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to go bitcoin?</v>

2729
02:01:20.410 --> 02:01:22.450
<v Speaker 2>You think I've got to get Antonopoulos</v>
<v Speaker 2>back on.</v>

2730
02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:23.760
<v Speaker 2>It's been awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2731
02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me again.</v>

2732
02:01:24.761 --> 02:01:25.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll believe them again.</v>

2733
02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:29.950
<v Speaker 2>By the time I come back here in two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how to spend bitcoin.</v>

2734
02:01:30.670 --> 02:01:32.080
<v Speaker 2>How to spin it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spend it.</v>

2735
02:01:32.110 --> 02:01:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Spend it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

2736
02:01:33.610 --> 02:01:35.050
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know how to spend your</v>

2737
02:01:35.051 --> 02:01:36.880
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably look into it,</v>

2738
02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:39.440
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't have this ancient</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking phone,</v>

2739
02:01:39.441 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 2>you have to be plugged</v>

2740
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>into your laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some sort of Ethernet cable,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

2743
02:01:46.370 --> 02:01:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Book pro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even have a USB port,</v>

2744
02:01:50.091 --> 02:01:51.850
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one doesn't have a USB port?</v>

2745

2746
02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:57.200
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them doesn't even have a USB</v>

2747
02:01:57.201 --> 02:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>port.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a real skinny one of the air.</v>

2748
02:02:00.030 --> 02:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even the air.</v>

2749
02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google that shit son.</v>

2750
02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:07.250

2752
02:02:09.531 --> 02:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>which was USB port.</v>
<v Speaker 1>USB is where you would plug things in,</v>

2753
02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>you know like if you were trying to sync</v>
<v Speaker 1>your phone up to it or something like</v>

2754
02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:18.940
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plug your phone by USB or if you want to</v>

2755
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:22.540
<v Speaker 1>save something on a drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have the USB Port to</v>

2756
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.880
<v Speaker 1>port.</v>

2757
02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:24.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a little battery thing.</v>

2758
02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Sticks to charge your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

2760
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it can handle the power draw</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so thin,</v>

2761
02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:36.260
<v Speaker 1>like it only exists as something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can store things in the cloud,</v>

2762
02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:40.010
<v Speaker 1>which is where they're trying to snake.</v>

<v Speaker 1>religious anymore or did I just defend</v>

2765

<v Speaker 1>your sensibility?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I trigger you in any way?</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're never going to get it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>under the main gracie.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know how this one got</v>

2972
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:36.080
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it interesting that the first</v>

2973
02:10:36.081 --> 02:10:40.190
<v Speaker 2>storm trooper we see without a helmet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black guy quit or you're saying the fuck</v>

2974
02:10:40.580 --> 02:10:42.020
<v Speaker 2>the first storm trooper?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2975
02:10:42.050 --> 02:10:43.250
<v Speaker 2>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the first quarter,</v>

2976
02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:46.900
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't concentrate on the storm</v>
<v Speaker 2>trooper helmet maybe,</v>

2977
02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:49.940
<v Speaker 2>but nobody paid attention to them were</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first one they pay attention to is a</v>

2978
02:10:49.941 --> 02:10:53.090
<v Speaker 2>black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

2979
02:10:54.170 --> 02:10:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The version that is the case.</v>

2980
02:10:58.911 --> 02:11:02.750
<v Speaker 2>I think star wars is a case where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could make the argument that even though</v>

2981
02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:06.140
<v Speaker 2>they might have gone towards diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they nailed it.</v>

2982
02:11:06.610 --> 02:11:10.060
<v Speaker 2>A woman's a perfect fucking stopping</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl and the man who's a storm trooper</v>

2983
02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:14.420
<v Speaker 2>was like the right race or the sun's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be like gender.</v>

2984
02:11:14.450 --> 02:11:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Both of them seemed totally fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

2985
02:11:16.761 --> 02:11:21.761
<v Speaker 2>hoping that the fighter pilot and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>storm trooper had a gay affair because</v>

2986
02:11:21.831 --> 02:11:23.480
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were really close,</v>

2987
02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:27.440
<v Speaker 2>like the way they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they hugged,</v>

2988
02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:29.060
<v Speaker 2>they had like a deep embrace.</v>

2989
02:11:29.150 --> 02:11:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you been man?</v>

2990
02:11:30.250 --> 02:11:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Deep embrace there was so happy to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

2991
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:34.130
<v Speaker 2>So happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot like,</v>

2992
02:11:34.410 --> 02:11:36.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that movie,</v>

2993
02:11:36.921 --> 02:11:38.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2994
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:40.580
<v Speaker 2>what does the cowboy movie when they go</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay,</v>

2995
02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Black Mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brokeback mountain.</v>

2996
02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:44.940
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like when those who hadn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen each other for a while and they</v>

2997
02:11:44.941 --> 02:11:46.880
<v Speaker 2>just start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they make it out together and they</v>

2998
02:11:46.881 --> 02:11:49.590
<v Speaker 2>just dove into each other's arms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>went after it?</v>

2999
02:11:49.930 --> 02:11:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they live through life and death</v>

3000
02:11:51.801 --> 02:11:54.560
<v Speaker 2>out there with laser beams and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People shooting at them,</v>

3001
02:11:54.561 --> 02:11:56.750
<v Speaker 2>they survived a crash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>landed together.</v>

3002
02:11:56.900 --> 02:11:59.870
<v Speaker 2>There's a bond with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say that when people form</v>

3003
02:11:59.871 --> 02:12:01.880
<v Speaker 2>relationships after traumatic events,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3004
02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:05.510
<v Speaker 2>like if you met someone during nine</v>
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 and like you grabbed her,</v>

3005
02:12:05.511 --> 02:12:07.130
<v Speaker 2>come with me and you grabbed her hand</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

3006
02:12:07.340 --> 02:12:10.130
<v Speaker 2>you ran and you guys both barely got out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the building and the building</v>

3007
02:12:10.131 --> 02:12:14.600
<v Speaker 2>collapsed and you gotten a car and got</v>
<v Speaker 2>away together and then she's crying and</v>

3008
02:12:14.601 --> 02:12:15.660
<v Speaker 2>she stays in your apartment.</v>

3009
02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:18.470
<v Speaker 2>You want it falling in love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are fucking relationship will be</v>

3010
02:12:18.471 --> 02:12:22.550
<v Speaker 2>super intense because it's always going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be connected to this one,</v>

3011
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:26.150
<v Speaker 2>like really powerful event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Christie Brinkley apparently had a</v>

3012
02:12:26.151 --> 02:12:29.270
<v Speaker 2>situation like that when she was in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopter crash with this dude and then</v>

3013
02:12:29.271 --> 02:12:31.820
<v Speaker 2>wound up marrying the dude and then it</v>
<v Speaker 2>fell apart.</v>

3014
02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:35.810
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make it look live with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like we together baby,</v>

3015
02:12:35.950 --> 02:12:39.830
<v Speaker 2>we're supposed to survive this together</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the bond that you have because you</v>

3016
02:12:39.831 --> 02:12:43.700
<v Speaker 2>sort of imprint on this moment like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever go somewhere where like you had a</v>

3017
02:12:43.701 --> 02:12:47.330
<v Speaker 2>really bad time and year round that area</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even 10 years later you'll still</v>

3018
02:12:47.331 --> 02:12:48.740
<v Speaker 2>feel shitty about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember this,</v>

3019
02:12:48.910 --> 02:12:50.780
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deep emotional connection with somebody</v>

3020
02:12:50.781 --> 02:12:53.120
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have emotional connections with clubs</v>

3021
02:12:53.121 --> 02:12:55.640
<v Speaker 2>where I bombed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go by like,</v>

3022
02:12:55.670 --> 02:12:57.740
<v Speaker 2>like if I went by some places in Boston</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>

3023
02:12:57.770 --> 02:13:00.390
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember eating Dick up their</v>

3024
02:13:01.630 --> 02:13:02.810
<v Speaker 2>restaurant now you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

3025
02:13:02.811 --> 02:13:03.280
<v Speaker 2>I can't eat here.</v>

3026
02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>

3027
02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Like people can develop some serious</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional connections to areas.</v>

3028
02:13:08.530 --> 02:13:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Had that Tom Cruise movie that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually good that nobody saw.</v>

3029
02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that good?</v>

3030
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:14.360

3033
02:13:18.110 --> 02:13:20.210

<v Speaker 2>last one.</v>

3034

<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was good and they handled</v>

3035
02:13:21.891 --> 02:13:23.540
<v Speaker 2>everything right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was happened.</v>

3036
02:13:23.541 --> 02:13:24.520
<v Speaker 2>This would happen.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like pushing forward on an</v>

3095
02:15:55.970 --> 02:16:00.970
<v Speaker 2>abdominal wall that can cause Hernias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot and lows in her and killing</v>

3096
02:16:02.551 --> 02:16:05.340
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was back before they even knew</v>

02:16:05.341 --> 02:16:06.990
<v Speaker 2>what six packs were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had a six pack.</v>

3098
02:16:06.991 --> 02:16:10.160
<v Speaker 2>No one has six pack in the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Pretty cool paintings.</v>

3101
02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Conan was played by Arnold</v>

3102
02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:18.691
<v Speaker 2>Schwartzenegger,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fascinating guy.</v>

3111
02:16:34.090 --> 02:16:39.090
<v Speaker 2>They did a movie about him and the dude</v>

<v Speaker 2>He wasn't going to say he's in it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's in a what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

3121
02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:02.870

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3122
02:17:03.060 --> 02:17:03.880
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3123
02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:05.470
<v Speaker 2>he plays Robert Howard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

3124
02:17:05.770 --> 02:17:09.550
<v Speaker 2>He plays Robert e Dot Howard in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>biography on property.</v>

3125
02:17:09.551 --> 02:17:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Howard's life in a movie and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the movie,</v>

3126
02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:16.000
<v Speaker 2>but Robert Howard was supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>this like really strange guy who lived</v>

3127
02:17:16.001 --> 02:17:19.480
<v Speaker 2>with his mom and he shot himself I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was 36,</v>

3128
02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:21.520
<v Speaker 2>so he had this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it?</v>

3129
02:17:21.550 --> 02:17:22.420
<v Speaker 2>The whole wide world.</v>

3130
02:17:22.750 --> 02:17:25.780
<v Speaker 2>He had some serious mental issues for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

3131
02:17:25.781 --> 02:17:30.781
<v Speaker 2>but he also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't healthy and so he had imagined</v>

3132
02:17:33.220 --> 02:17:35.320
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this superman,</v>

3133
02:17:35.321 --> 02:17:40.321
<v Speaker 2>this uber monch who was destroying</v>
<v Speaker 2>people back in this fictitious world</v>

3134
02:17:40.841 --> 02:17:43.180
<v Speaker 2>that he created that supposedly was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time ago,</v>

3135
02:17:43.181 --> 02:17:44.230
<v Speaker 2>but who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3136
02:17:44.250 --> 02:17:48.430
<v Speaker 2>it was like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these countries that never existed and</v>

3137
02:17:48.431 --> 02:17:52.450
<v Speaker 2>they were doing battle on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>witchcraft and demons and monsters.</v>

3138
02:17:52.451 --> 02:17:54.760
<v Speaker 2>And then there was this barbarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>usurper,</v>

3139
02:17:54.761 --> 02:17:58.330
<v Speaker 2>this king who became a king by killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything in his path.</v>

3140
02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:01.150
<v Speaker 2>He was like this indestructible man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Conan the barbarian.</v>

3141
02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:04.420
<v Speaker 2>And so Robert e Dot Howard sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>created this guy who's the antithesis of</v>

3142
02:18:04.421 --> 02:18:06.880
<v Speaker 2>what he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was as frail guy who lived with his</v>

3143
02:18:06.881 --> 02:18:08.860
<v Speaker 2>mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a pussy and just he,</v>

3144
02:18:09.020 --> 02:18:14.020
<v Speaker 2>he wrote his longing about this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this lust for adventure thing.</v>

3145
02:18:14.490 --> 02:18:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Everything killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything always survived.</v>

3146
02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:22.680
<v Speaker 2>He was just this uber man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the greatest of all time is giant man.</v>

3147
02:18:23.470 --> 02:18:27.010
<v Speaker 2>And moved like a panther who like had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>

3148
02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:30.460
<v Speaker 2>like a steel trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would never show weakness.</v>

3149
02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:31.230
<v Speaker 2>He'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3150
02:18:31.230 --> 02:18:33.220
<v Speaker 2>he'll always was ready to die but never</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

3151
02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:36.790
<v Speaker 2>So he wrote all these really bad ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>

3152
02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:40.060
<v Speaker 2>They were really wild as probably now if</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read them and be like,</v>

3153
02:18:40.061 --> 02:18:43.900
<v Speaker 2>what am I reading?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I was 11 they were the shit</v>

3154
02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:46.880
<v Speaker 2>really stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of,</v>

3155
02:18:46.881 --> 02:18:50.530
<v Speaker 2>I kind of like get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like he put his hard cock in</v>

3156
02:18:50.531 --> 02:18:52.450
<v Speaker 2>her gut and it wasn't like that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

3157
02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:54.220
<v Speaker 2>It was like from antic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3158
02:18:54.530 --> 02:18:58.140
<v Speaker 2>like it was more about like cleaving</v>
<v Speaker 2>heads and,</v>

3159
02:18:58.180 --> 02:19:03.180
<v Speaker 2>and the Gore of him being covered with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gore and bits of sinew cover the</v>

3160
02:19:04.181 --> 02:19:08.190
<v Speaker 2>glistening blade as a slices through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>attackers will,</v>

3161
02:19:08.290 --> 02:19:09.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they realize like how they</v>

3162
02:19:09.701 --> 02:19:13.480
<v Speaker 2>fucked up and try to do battle with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conan and everybody died,</v>

3163
02:19:13.510 --> 02:19:14.020
<v Speaker 2>everybody dies.</v>

3164
02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:17.410
<v Speaker 2>But Conan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just this for a 12 year old</v>

3165
02:19:17.411 --> 02:19:19.900
<v Speaker 2>kid or whatever the fuck I was when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess I was probably like that age when</v>

3166
02:19:19.901 --> 02:19:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I got into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing.</v>

3167
02:19:21.850 --> 02:19:23.100
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whew,</v>

3168
02:19:23.390 --> 02:19:24.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're a boy.</v>

3169
02:19:24.610 --> 02:19:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Like first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's gonna let you see that you're</v>

3170
02:19:27.291 --> 02:19:30.800
<v Speaker 2>like a 12 year old boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't show it in movies.</v>

3171
02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:32.330
<v Speaker 2>They cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3172
02:19:32.331 --> 02:19:34.790
<v Speaker 2>You don't really even like today they</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

02:19:34.890 --> 02:19:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Like today if you watched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3174

<v Speaker 2>a recent barbarian movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there was,</v>

3175
02:19:40.281 --> 02:19:42.050

<v Speaker 2>He's the guy from game of thrones.</v>

3177
02:19:45.550 --> 02:19:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real tall one.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the really handsome guy that dies early.</v>

3180
02:19:49.821 --> 02:19:52.760
<v Speaker 2>This dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dude is a cool motherfucker.</v>

3181
02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:56.660
<v Speaker 2>I ran into him recently at whole foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't be cooler.</v>

3182
02:19:56.661 --> 02:19:58.250
<v Speaker 2>I've ran into with the UFC before too.</v>

3183
02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:01.690
<v Speaker 2>He's just a really nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really friendly guy who uh,</v>

3184
02:20:01.730 --> 02:20:03.650
<v Speaker 2>you want to hate him because he's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little too beautiful.</v>

3185
02:20:03.980 --> 02:20:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Little too beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little too tall.</v>

3186
02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:09.530
<v Speaker 2>But he was my favorite all time Conan</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he,</v>

3187
02:20:10.050 --> 02:20:11.600
<v Speaker 2>that's what Kona is supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>built.</v>

3188
02:20:11.601 --> 02:20:13.850
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe we'll do it on TV show now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did a movie.</v>

3189
02:20:13.851 --> 02:20:16.640
<v Speaker 2>It was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of a shit movie</v>

3190
02:20:16.970 --> 02:20:19.250
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

3191
02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:20.930
<v Speaker 2>it's cool to watch anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed it.</v>

3192
02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:22.310
<v Speaker 2>But Tim is going in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3193
02:20:22.370 --> 02:20:25.730
<v Speaker 2>he's a good size for Kona and like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be like with Conan would be built</v>

3194
02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:28.460
<v Speaker 2>well you'd have a chance to win like</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone of your hand to hand combat</v>

3195
02:20:28.461 --> 02:20:29.031
<v Speaker 2>battles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3196
02:20:29.031 --> 02:20:32.150
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't be built like Arnold</v>
<v Speaker 2>Schwarzenegger if you look at the data</v>

3197
02:20:32.151 --> 02:20:33.120
<v Speaker 2>drawing.</v>

02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:37.390
<v Speaker 2>the classic one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit over there right there</v>

3200
02:20:37.391 --> 02:20:37.880
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>

3201
02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:41.180
<v Speaker 2>So like the real Kona is like a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>more built in him,</v>

3202
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:44.780
<v Speaker 2>but that's probably because a homeboys</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the couch.</v>

3203
02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:46.091
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jason,</v>

3204
02:20:46.091 --> 02:20:47.750
<v Speaker 2>my mom was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually what he's really built,</v>

3205
02:20:47.751 --> 02:20:51.590
<v Speaker 2>like sports and Agora was filled with 32</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds,</v>

3206
02:20:51.630 --> 02:20:53.860
<v Speaker 2>the Mexicans supplements and then give</v>
<v Speaker 2>them time.</v>

3207
02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:55.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he played killing enemy,</v>

3208
02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:58.570
<v Speaker 2>nobody's built like that when he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conan.</v>

3209
02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:01.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had the most ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking body.</v>

3210
02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Schwartzenegger was number one in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world body.</v>

3211
02:21:06.470 --> 02:21:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Well he's slimmed down though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He slimmed down towards the other ones</v>

3212
02:21:10.011 --> 02:21:12.530
<v Speaker 2>like you see Kinda tell a difference</v>
<v Speaker 2>between that one and the other one that</v>

3213
02:21:12.531 --> 02:21:14.960
<v Speaker 2>you just had those monster huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so big.</v>

3214
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:16.880
<v Speaker 2>And by the way that's small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right there,</v>

3215
02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:22.040
<v Speaker 2>like that's very slim in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a guy who is slimming down.</v>

3216
02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Like that guy is built like tyron what?</v>

3217
02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:27.050
<v Speaker 2>The body of the drawings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3218
02:21:27.051 --> 02:21:28.250
<v Speaker 2>that's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

3219
02:21:28.460 --> 02:21:30.110
<v Speaker 2>That must have been one of the later</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>

3220
02:21:30.590 --> 02:21:33.640
<v Speaker 2>So I think like he went from being the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger bodybuilder.</v>

3221
02:21:33.650 --> 02:21:37.460
<v Speaker 2>It looks so weird to see him with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking chest and the sword and a</v>

3222
02:21:37.461 --> 02:21:40.130
<v Speaker 2>backwards baseball cap on backwards</v>
<v Speaker 2>baseball hat.</v>

3223
02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was like a little it go back up.</v>

3224
02:21:43.970 --> 02:21:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Does he really have one yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Backers that almost looks like,</v>

3225
02:21:46.551 --> 02:21:48.930
<v Speaker 2>but it's a Bandana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be a bag.</v>

3226
02:21:48.990 --> 02:21:53.090
<v Speaker 2>You can be like a hillbilly with a sword</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's really yolked really old</v>

3227
02:21:53.460 --> 02:21:55.790
<v Speaker 2>hillbilly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slimmed down.</v>

3228
02:21:55.791 --> 02:21:57.720
<v Speaker 2>He was still massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3229
02:21:57.770 --> 02:22:00.950
<v Speaker 2>even when he got smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you go back to is bodybuilding</v>

3230
02:22:00.951 --> 02:22:03.860
<v Speaker 2>days when he was Mr Olympia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

3231
02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:09.250
<v Speaker 2>He in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of all like the bodybuilders styles,</v>

3232
02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:10.910
<v Speaker 2>like there's a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>styles.</v>

3233
02:22:10.911 --> 02:22:13.910
<v Speaker 2>Like now guys are just massive and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shredded.</v>

3234
02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:18.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that guy is the guy on the left is</v>

3235
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:21.770
<v Speaker 2>the foxes multiple time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr Olympia,</v>

3236
02:22:22.010 --> 02:22:23.660
<v Speaker 2>what the Hell's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it has legs.</v>

3237
02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:26.040
<v Speaker 2>It'll gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is</v>

3238
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:27.390
<v Speaker 1>his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

3239
02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it say?</v>

3240
02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Ronnie Coleman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not real.</v>

3241
02:22:31.530 --> 02:22:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Ronnie Coleman was many years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3242
02:22:34.380 --> 02:22:36.570
<v Speaker 1>So that's just a comparison to the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

3243
02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:37.231
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

3244
02:22:37.231 --> 02:22:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you it back up again.</v>

3245
02:22:41.940 --> 02:22:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Go back to that image again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

3246
02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:46.250
<v Speaker 1>That's really amazing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3247
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:48.450
<v Speaker 1>but if you go back to that image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one.</v>

3248
02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the difference in the legs.</v>

3249
02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:52.530
<v Speaker 1>That's the real difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronnie Coleman's legs are massive.</v>

3250
02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:55.140
<v Speaker 1>They're insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't seem real.</v>

3251
02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:58.830
<v Speaker 1>See Arnold seem ridiculously muscular as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3252
02:22:58.831 --> 02:23:00.810
<v Speaker 1>but real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does he wear shirts,</v>

3253
02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Goldman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either their waists or narrow.</v>

3254
02:23:04.441 --> 02:23:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Why would you were closer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're built like that.</v>

3255
02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Just walk around this little grape</v>
<v Speaker 1>smugglers all day just to let everybody</v>

3256
02:23:10.111 --> 02:23:13.230
<v Speaker 1>know what the fuck is up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't stay like that for very long</v>

3257
02:23:13.231 --> 02:23:14.670
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing you have to</v>

3258
02:23:14.671 --> 02:23:16.800
<v Speaker 1>realize when you're looking at these</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes.</v>

3259
02:23:17.010 --> 02:23:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Should I call them athletes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bodybuilders?</v>

3260
02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're a little bit different</v>

3261
02:23:20.581 --> 02:23:21.191
<v Speaker 1>than an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3262
02:23:21.191 --> 02:23:23.390
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously what their muscles get</v>
<v Speaker 1>tired and they can't.</v>

3263
02:23:23.970 --> 02:23:24.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3264
02:23:24.361 --> 02:23:25.770
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in the state of massive</v>

3265
02:23:25.771 --> 02:23:27.020
<v Speaker 1>dehydration there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3266
02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:31.500
<v Speaker 1>they can't maintain that very long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super dangerous when guys get,</v>

3267
02:23:31.501 --> 02:23:32.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3268
02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:35.820
<v Speaker 1>that dehydrated like that they can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang on for very long.</v>

3269
02:23:36.570 --> 02:23:38.700
<v Speaker 1>They don't have much endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3270
02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:40.620
<v Speaker 1>you're feeling really tired all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

3271
02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:42.810
<v Speaker 1>but that's how you get your skin really</v>
<v Speaker 1>thin.</v>

3272
02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they do that,</v>

3273
02:23:45.091 --> 02:23:46.680
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking exhausted while they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>

3274
02:23:46.681 --> 02:23:51.681
<v Speaker 1>but they maintain a good face and flex</v>
<v Speaker 1>just crazy what people do to their</v>

3275
02:23:52.111 --> 02:23:54.600
<v Speaker 1>bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even then like you look at that,</v>

3276
02:23:55.110 --> 02:23:59.220
<v Speaker 1>which is big giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're the guys who are so much</v>

3277
02:23:59.221 --> 02:24:01.850
<v Speaker 1>bigger today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you see them there</v>

3278

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3282
02:24:13.831 --> 02:24:15.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of those guys that did</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a future.</v>

3283
02:24:15.541 --> 02:24:19.230
<v Speaker 1>They just never had a future like him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just said crazy ambitious</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's not allowed.</v>

3302
02:24:50.970 --> 02:24:53.480
<v Speaker 1>You're a movie star bodybuilder and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

3308
02:25:06.721 --> 02:25:09.600
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a law against it because he was born in</v>

3309
02:25:09.601 --> 02:25:11.490
<v Speaker 1>another country president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't president.</v>

3310
02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I think he could be president now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No bullshit.</v>

3311
02:25:14.290 --> 02:25:16.380
<v Speaker 1>He's too far removed from his face and</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a new woman,</v>

3312
02:25:16.870 --> 02:25:20.520
<v Speaker 1>new woman that really anchors them other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the woman who is religious.</v>

3313
02:25:20.730 --> 02:25:24.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's not like crazy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about Jesus's</v>

3314
02:25:24.111 --> 02:25:25.630
<v Speaker 1>teachings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's really starting to appeal to</v>

3315
02:25:25.631 --> 02:25:28.030
<v Speaker 1>arnold as he gets older in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then boom,</v>

3316
02:25:28.031 --> 02:25:30.970
<v Speaker 1>connects with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Report that data to get Jesus in real</v>

3317
02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.820
<v Speaker 1>rural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pop it over to Jesus forgives.</v>

3318
02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:38.140
<v Speaker 1>You could get Jesus to just listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus said some cool shit.</v>

3319
02:25:38.380 --> 02:25:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just did.</v>

3320
02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:40.630
<v Speaker 1>He really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did some cool.</v>

3321
02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:42.910
<v Speaker 1>If it was a real guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is debatable,</v>

3322
02:25:43.350 --> 02:25:44.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of.</v>

3323
02:25:45.220 --> 02:25:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot of evidence that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real guy.</v>

3324
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:50.800
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about him and Tom Joad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they know what else they write about</v>

3325
02:25:50.801 --> 02:25:54.720
<v Speaker 1>dragons?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything about witches and demons?</v>

3326
02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:55.721
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3327
02:25:55.721 --> 02:25:58.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not the one that tells you if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>jerking off.</v>

3328
02:25:58.700 --> 02:25:59.620
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3329
02:25:59.621 --> 02:26:00.454
<v Speaker 1>the other one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3330
02:26:00.730 --> 02:26:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3331
02:26:02.830 --> 02:26:04.330
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was real.</v>

3332
02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:06.410
<v Speaker 1>I think they did have historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence for them,</v>

3333
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:08.430
<v Speaker 1>but not the powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're walking,</v>

3334
02:26:08.450 --> 02:26:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen that movie?</v>

3335
02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:12.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3336
02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:13.780
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before the internet,</v>

3337
02:26:13.781 --> 02:26:16.990
<v Speaker 1>you remember those videos of that Sensei</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's like trying to rush me and just</v>

3338
02:26:16.991 --> 02:26:19.420
<v Speaker 1>with one finger who draws people back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll fly,</v>

3339
02:26:19.421 --> 02:26:20.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's clearly faked.</v>

3340
02:26:20.890 --> 02:26:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were videos of that,</v>

3341
02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:23.880
<v Speaker 1>they were just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3342
02:26:23.890 --> 02:26:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I heard this guy can knock off any</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacker with one finger and I don't</v>

3343
02:26:27.191 --> 02:26:28.960
<v Speaker 1>have tv either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what's real.</v>

3344
02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:30.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what Jesus does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus got big.</v>

3345
02:26:30.730 --> 02:26:31.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

3346
02:26:31.431 --> 02:26:33.500
<v Speaker 1>people are telling stories about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea,</v>

3347
02:26:33.550 --> 02:26:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Jesus coming back from the dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3348
02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:36.220
<v Speaker 1>That was the big one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3349
02:26:36.370 --> 02:26:38.020
<v Speaker 1>That was probably one of the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones he did.</v>

3350
02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what it is later and then what</v>

3351
02:26:42.791 --> 02:26:43.840
<v Speaker 1>happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes away.</v>

3352
02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:44.661
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

3353
02:26:44.661 --> 02:26:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I think he just cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

3354
02:26:46.060 --> 02:26:47.740
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his body's not in here.</v>

3355
02:26:47.770 --> 02:26:52.480
<v Speaker 1>He must've come back from the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't be that hyenas eight his</v>

3356
02:26:52.481 --> 02:26:55.510
<v Speaker 1>body or anything right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or somebody just would grave rob,</v>

3357
02:26:55.511 --> 02:26:58.070
<v Speaker 1>why don't you leave a body out and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3358
02:26:58.210 --> 02:26:58.710
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3359
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:59.920
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's back up again.</v>

3360
02:27:00.310 --> 02:27:03.190
<v Speaker 1>And then he went to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he came back to life once a heaven.</v>

3361
02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:04.233
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know,</v>

3362
02:27:04.540 --> 02:27:06.460
<v Speaker 1>put him in a tomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put them into them right in front.</v>

3363
02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:09.040
<v Speaker 1>And three days later the rockers moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people's,</v>

3364
02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:11.020
<v Speaker 1>someone saw him go up into heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full body.</v>

3365
02:27:11.050 --> 02:27:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this lion bitch.</v>

3366
02:27:12.370 --> 02:27:14.750
<v Speaker 1>So Dome of the Rock is worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still went up to heaven.</v>

3367
02:27:14.770 --> 02:27:17.050
<v Speaker 1>You know who saw him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those lesbians in that club,</v>

3368
02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were their,</v>

3369
02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:22.190
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their account is totally tribunals.</v>

3370
02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Have too much power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3371
02:27:24.460 --> 02:27:28.180
<v Speaker 1>If you had a Canadian tribunals to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discover whether or not Jesus ever came</v>

3372
02:27:28.181 --> 02:27:30.850
<v Speaker 1>back to life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think if you came back to life</v>

3373
02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:32.770
<v Speaker 1>should probably stick around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to people.</v>

3374
02:27:33.070 --> 02:27:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Let them know that you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

3375
02:27:34.511 --> 02:27:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm so for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys crucified me?</v>

3376
02:27:36.790 --> 02:27:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Not Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use my magic.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

3379
02:27:41.620 --> 02:27:43.390
<v Speaker 1>die for your sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get it together.</v>

3380
02:27:43.391 --> 02:27:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

3381
02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Removing anything we know is not true</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>

3382
02:27:47.410 --> 02:27:48.470
<v Speaker 1>How do you know it's not true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3383
02:27:48.471 --> 02:27:49.870
<v Speaker 1>no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From what you know,</v>

3384
02:27:50.020 --> 02:27:54.760
<v Speaker 1>let's say a atheist or agnostic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy who got strung up for</v>

3385
02:27:54.910 --> 02:27:57.250
<v Speaker 1>saying he was a messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he wasn't the only one at a time</v>

3386
02:27:57.251 --> 02:28:01.360
<v Speaker 1>thing is messiah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got strung up for it and he died and</v>

3387
02:28:01.390 --> 02:28:05.320
<v Speaker 1>the followers had to keep hope alive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they did,</v>

3388
02:28:05.321 --> 02:28:08.570
<v Speaker 1>they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like if it was a real person,</v>

3389
02:28:08.571 --> 02:28:09.161
<v Speaker 1>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3390
02:28:09.161 --> 02:28:10.030
<v Speaker 1>he got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got killed.</v>

3391
02:28:10.031 --> 02:28:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3392
02:28:11.650 --> 02:28:16.000
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to recount the truth in an</v>

3393
02:28:16.001 --> 02:28:18.460
<v Speaker 1>accurate way from things you've actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced.</v>

3394
02:28:18.490 --> 02:28:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm managing the god out of it.</v>

3395
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Those still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But imagine</v>

3396
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:27.190
<v Speaker 2>those stories of whoever he was counted</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and in and re retold by people that</v>

3397
02:28:30.140 --> 02:28:33.500
<v Speaker 2>barely remember the word innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't even the region.</v>

3398
02:28:33.530 --> 02:28:36.710
<v Speaker 2>They added their own bullshit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people do the added their own</v>

3399
02:28:36.711 --> 02:28:38.480
<v Speaker 2>spice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have their own rules,</v>

3400
02:28:38.500 --> 02:28:43.340
<v Speaker 2>their out of their own happy ending or</v>
<v Speaker 2>sad ending or consequences of said</v>

3401
02:28:43.341 --> 02:28:44.580
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3402
02:28:44.660 --> 02:28:47.570
<v Speaker 2>and Jesus said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do not cover from your eyes to</v>

3403
02:28:47.571 --> 02:28:49.130
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your ankles,</v>

3404

<v Speaker 2>you shall be stoned to death and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dishonor telling like you people just</v>

3405
02:28:52.791 --> 02:28:53.840
<v Speaker 2>add shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3406
02:28:54.020 --> 02:28:57.140
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what the original message was</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who the fuck it was that came up</v>

3407
02:28:57.141 --> 02:28:58.880
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might've been to some really cool</v>

3408
02:28:58.881 --> 02:29:02.240
<v Speaker 2>dude wanted everybody to get along and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they decided to kill this fucker</v>

3409
02:29:02.241 --> 02:29:05.030
<v Speaker 2>because he's talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if the Romans came to town.</v>

3410
02:29:05.031 --> 02:29:08.780
<v Speaker 2>They got their swords and ready to kick</v>
<v Speaker 2>some ass and this fucking hippie is over</v>

02:29:08.781 --> 02:29:10.130
<v Speaker 2>here talking some stupid shit.</v>

3412
02:29:10.130 --> 02:29:10.491
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3413
02:29:10.491 --> 02:29:11.780
<v Speaker 2>we're here to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3414
02:29:12.020 --> 02:29:14.210
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to nail you to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>cross like we do.</v>

3415
02:29:14.211 --> 02:29:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Thousands of other fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>

3416
02:29:16.701 --> 02:29:19.970
<v Speaker 2>they had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the story that there's a story</v>

3417
02:29:19.971 --> 02:29:24.971
<v Speaker 2>in history on fire that Danieli Bull Lee</v>
<v Speaker 2>talks about where the Romans,</v>

3418
02:29:25.250 --> 02:29:29.840
<v Speaker 2>they put miles and miles of crucified</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies on this road.</v>

3419
02:29:29.870 --> 02:29:31.280
<v Speaker 2>I can get my thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

3420
02:29:31.281 --> 02:29:33.800
<v Speaker 2>It's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he recounts it,</v>

3421
02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:38.360
<v Speaker 2>it's horrific and they did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why would they give a shit about</v>

3422
02:29:38.361 --> 02:29:42.170
<v Speaker 2>doing this to one other dude will let</v>
<v Speaker 2>them do whatever they want.</v>

3423
02:29:42.190 --> 02:29:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were in the town,</v>

3424
02:29:43.881 --> 02:29:46.280
<v Speaker 2>and this is one cool guy wants everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get along and you're like,</v>

3425
02:29:46.281 --> 02:29:47.660
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad Jesus is here.</v>

3426
02:29:47.661 --> 02:29:49.220
<v Speaker 2>He's talking sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3427

<v Speaker 2>I've always hated the crossbow.</v>

3446
02:30:36.700 --> 02:30:39.260

<v Speaker 2>it makes me mad.</v>

3452
02:30:49.281 --> 02:30:50.081
<v Speaker 2>The walking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

3453
02:30:50.081 --> 02:30:53.180
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the coolest college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that fucking Arrow not get a</v>

3454
02:30:53.181 --> 02:30:54.710
<v Speaker 2>pass through?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3455
02:30:54.890 --> 02:30:57.300
<v Speaker 2>He's shooting people in the bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He should always.</v>

3456
02:30:58.220 --> 02:30:59.960
<v Speaker 2>It always sticks out and he pulls it</v>
<v Speaker 2>right out.</v>

3457
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ruined three or four hours a week,</v>

3458
02:31:03.470 --> 02:31:05.700
<v Speaker 2>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy has been out there.</v>

3459
02:31:05.701 --> 02:31:08.480
<v Speaker 2>It's finding new arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shoot a lot of arrows and sometimes</v>

3460
02:31:08.481 --> 02:31:12.470
<v Speaker 2>when I'm practicing with the New Georgia</v>
<v Speaker 2>new releases,</v>

3461
02:31:12.471 --> 02:31:16.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm practicing a new archer releases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I hit rocks and shit and they</v>

3462
02:31:16.481 --> 02:31:20.280
<v Speaker 2>just break break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm exaggerating the amount per hit a</v>

3463
02:31:20.281 --> 02:31:23.750
<v Speaker 2>rock on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just destroys the arrows.</v>

3464
02:31:23.790 --> 02:31:26.190
<v Speaker 2>The arrows going too fast just shatters</v>
<v Speaker 2>and explodes.</v>

3465
02:31:26.340 --> 02:31:28.950
<v Speaker 2>But my point being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy has the same goddamn arrows.</v>

3466
02:31:28.970 --> 02:31:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's he?</v>

3467
02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:30.900
<v Speaker 2>These arrows are gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3468
02:31:30.901 --> 02:31:32.940
<v Speaker 2>You shot a hundred zombies anymore.</v>

3469
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just don't.</v>

3470
02:31:34.021 --> 02:31:35.670
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to pull them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be perfect.</v>

3471
02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:37.290
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have field points and that's</v>

3472
02:31:37.291 --> 02:31:37.951
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

3473
02:31:37.951 --> 02:31:39.330
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have broad heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3474
02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:44.440
<v Speaker 2>I make to put a little pinhole in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just shoots him in the head,</v>

3475
02:31:45.060 --> 02:31:46.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just sticks right in there</v>

3476
02:31:46.741 --> 02:31:49.650
<v Speaker 2>magically and he pulls it right out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are their heads made of?</v>

3477
02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the long and where did they.</v>

3478
02:31:51.450 --> 02:31:52.320
<v Speaker 2>When they eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3479
02:31:52.321 --> 02:31:54.140
<v Speaker 2>What happens to the food?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

3480
02:31:54.290 --> 02:31:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Their bodies don't still work in</v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

3481
02:31:55.981 --> 02:32:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Stuff is way better off with a regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>bone arrow because irregular bone.</v>

3482
02:32:00.841 --> 02:32:02.590

<v Speaker 2>you can make your own bone now.</v>

3483
02:32:02.591 --> 02:32:04.830

<v Speaker 2>fucking crossbow.</v>

3484
02:32:05.250 --> 02:32:06.930
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want something?</v>

3485
02:32:06.931 --> 02:32:09.210
<v Speaker 2>You can just load up like that and keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting.</v>

3486
02:32:09.211 --> 02:32:11.550
<v Speaker 2>You can shoot several times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stupid thing.</v>

3487
02:32:11.550 --> 02:32:13.200
<v Speaker 2>You've got to grab it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to pull it.</v>

3488
02:32:13.350 --> 02:32:16.230
<v Speaker 2>People just like it because it looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Chewbacca his gun in Star Wars.</v>

3550
02:34:42.460 --> 02:34:45.280

<v Speaker 2>Exactly the exact opposite of what I</v>

3551
02:34:45.281 --> 02:34:48.060
<v Speaker 2>used to love about watching dies in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>or just hurting people.</v>

3552

3556
02:34:58.451 --> 02:35:01.600

<v Speaker 2>He would have a cigarette.</v>

3557

<v Speaker 2>It's sophie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to fuck you gonna.</v>

3560
02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:12.580
<v Speaker 2>You're going to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be sad.</v>

3561
02:35:12.581 --> 02:35:14.660
<v Speaker 2>You're going to fall in love with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hookah.</v>

3562
02:35:15.730 --> 02:35:18.760
<v Speaker 2>Bring him into your life in Sydney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

3563
02:35:18.761 --> 02:35:23.380
<v Speaker 2>all the time she's getting God looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would just go deep,</v>

3564
02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:26.950
<v Speaker 2>but it was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was theater.</v>

3565
02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:28.690
<v Speaker 2>It was theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't seem real,</v>

3566
02:35:28.750 --> 02:35:29.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3567
02:35:29.550 --> 02:35:29.881
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3568
02:35:29.881 --> 02:35:30.230
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3569
02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:34.420
<v Speaker 2>It's it's theater like it's a character</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's doing this mean act.</v>

3570
02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:38.380
<v Speaker 2>When you act like yourself on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people feel way more like how dare you,</v>

3571
02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:40.900
<v Speaker 2>but when it's complete character or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie where it's like dissolve,</v>

3572
02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:42.330
<v Speaker 2>definitely not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's okay.</v>

3573
02:35:42.350 --> 02:35:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Just seems more like reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why people get mad or</v>

3574
02:35:45.011 --> 02:35:45.844
<v Speaker 2>more of stand up.</v>

3575
02:35:45.890 --> 02:35:50.800
<v Speaker 2>Look to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that good?</v>

3578
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:56.140
<v Speaker 2>I loved him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3579
02:35:56.380 --> 02:35:58.750
<v Speaker 2>I saw the exhibit and Melbourne is Bowie</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exhibit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3581
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:02.890
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way he dealt with like live</v>

3582
02:36:02.891 --> 02:36:06.070
<v Speaker 2>performance and like getting costumers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hitting the world's best customers.</v>

3583
02:36:06.071 --> 02:36:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Like I got to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he were just like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want you to design something with me.</v>

3585
02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I forgive him for dancing in the street</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the street with him and Mick Jagger.</v>

3586
02:36:18.310 --> 02:36:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Forgive them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgive them for arguably the most</v>

3587
02:36:21.431 --> 02:36:25.360
<v Speaker 2>confusing sexually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It leads to a young man.</v>

3588
02:36:25.361 --> 02:36:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is happening with</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're confusing the fuck out of me.</v>

3591
02:36:33.250 --> 02:36:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you guys are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it seems like you're flirting with each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other like I need to know.</v>

3594

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>mcjagger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she told everybody that's where when</v>

3597
02:36:53.921 --> 02:36:57.280
<v Speaker 2>you're a guy like David Bowie or mick</v>
<v Speaker 2>jagger becomes really problematic being</v>

3598
02:36:57.281 --> 02:37:01.000
<v Speaker 2>married to some normal person because</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got this amazing story.</v>

3599
02:37:01.001 --> 02:37:03.800
<v Speaker 2>So what if they want to get together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out whether or not there was</v>

3600
02:37:03.930 --> 02:37:04.261
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>contract with where they're not supposed</v>

<v Speaker 2>It makes them more awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look it up.</v>

3622
02:38:05.090 --> 02:38:08.120
<v Speaker 2>These guys from behind you there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You imagine if you and I did a music</v>

3623
02:38:08.121 --> 02:38:10.520
<v Speaker 2>video and we were doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

3624

<v Speaker 2>You can do this.</v>

3625
02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:15.120
<v Speaker 2>These thickness fingers couldn't kiss</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other for more than two seconds for</v>

3626
02:38:15.121 --> 02:38:16.820
<v Speaker 2>a hilarious thing on a pay per view</v>
<v Speaker 2>event.</v>

3627
02:38:17.150 --> 02:38:19.070
<v Speaker 2>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My biggest regret is that it's pulling</v>

3628
02:38:19.071 --> 02:38:22.070
<v Speaker 2>away and laughing when I shouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize I thought the cameras</v>

3629
02:38:22.071 --> 02:38:23.720
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You give him a ton and I give him a</v>

3630
02:38:23.721 --> 02:38:24.554
<v Speaker 2>little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you.</v>

3631
02:38:24.850 --> 02:38:25.680
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he give it back?</v>

3632
02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:26.513
<v Speaker 2>You think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like Dunkin,</v>

3633
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:28.310
<v Speaker 2>but did he give it back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did.</v>

3634
02:38:28.311 --> 02:38:29.230
<v Speaker 2>You guys tongue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3636

<v Speaker 2>lips.</v>

3637

<v Speaker 2>What is he?</v>

3640
02:38:40.260 --> 02:38:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Because it seems like they're both in</v>
<v Speaker 2>different climates.</v>

3641
02:38:42.100 --> 02:38:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like David Bowie,</v>

3642
02:38:43.111 --> 02:38:45.350
<v Speaker 2>he seems like he's in a rainy London</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorta climate,</v>

3643
02:38:45.351 --> 02:38:48.530
<v Speaker 2>but Mick Jagger's in the keys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Florida keys.</v>

3644
02:38:48.710 --> 02:38:50.330
<v Speaker 2>He's having a good old time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3645
02:38:50.331 --> 02:38:52.970
<v Speaker 2>listen to Jimmy Buffet music or some</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit with c eight at night.</v>

3646
02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Blue Pants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on with you?</v>

3647
02:38:56.150 --> 02:38:57.680
<v Speaker 2>What's that about why they freeze frame</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that,</v>

3648
02:38:57.681 --> 02:38:59.870
<v Speaker 2>but does that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you do that Jamie,</v>

3649
02:38:59.871 --> 02:39:02.000
<v Speaker 2>or is that the actual video?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it ends.</v>

3650
02:39:02.270 --> 02:39:06.560
<v Speaker 2>That's unfortunate or fortunate</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on what you're really into.</v>

3651
02:39:07.660 --> 02:39:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Doing ground control to major Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's like startups character and he</v>

3653
02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:18.610
<v Speaker 1>all coked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had these coke spoons as part of</v>

3654
02:39:18.611 --> 02:39:19.720
<v Speaker 1>the exhibit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

3655
02:39:19.721 --> 02:39:21.460

02:44:00.101 --> 02:44:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Like he's not going to keep people alive</v>
<v Speaker 2>by not going there.</v>

3771
02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:04.030
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>

3772
02:44:04.031 --> 02:44:09.031
<v Speaker 2>they believe that the paper trail or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>electronic trail of them setting this up</v>

3773
02:44:09.850 --> 02:44:12.830
<v Speaker 2>is probably what led to them capturing</v>
<v Speaker 2>el chapo in the first place.</v>

3774
02:44:12.850 --> 02:44:16.060
<v Speaker 2>So really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they just did the whole thing it.</v>

3775
02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:19.720
<v Speaker 2>And then he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only caught them like two days ago</v>

3776
02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:22.580
<v Speaker 2>and they caught them like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right as this story is coming out with</v>

3781
02:44:31.780 --> 02:44:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why you would say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think the world works</v>

3782
02:44:34.241 --> 02:44:35.540
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

02:45:13.661 --> 02:45:15.490
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which might be added to your.</v>

3800
02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:16.880
<v Speaker 2>It might be added to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3801
02:45:17.090 --> 02:45:19.800
<v Speaker 2>Why would release it now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conspiracy member.</v>

3802
02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:23.800
<v Speaker 2>It's illuminati controls all of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>

3803
02:45:23.890 --> 02:45:26.110
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you'd get in trouble for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for doing this at all?</v>

3804
02:45:26.740 --> 02:45:27.573
<v Speaker 2>Sean penn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3805
02:45:27.730 --> 02:45:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>foR sure.</v>

3806
02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3807
02:45:30.131 --> 02:45:30.790
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3808
02:45:30.790 --> 02:45:35.790
<v Speaker 2>he just got a story with one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest drug dealers or the apparently</v>

3809
02:45:36.251 --> 02:45:39.670
<v Speaker 2>the biggest drug dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he's to be believed ever it's ever</v>

3810
02:45:39.671 --> 02:45:43.690
<v Speaker 2>lived other than the other that's ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived,</v>

3811
02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:45.730
<v Speaker 2>allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

3812
02:45:45.731 --> 02:45:46.331
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3813
02:45:46.331 --> 02:45:47.410
<v Speaker 2>of course you can get in trouble for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3814
02:45:47.411 --> 02:45:51.580
<v Speaker 2>That's a dangerous move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like anybody that says that what sean</v>

3815
02:45:51.581 --> 02:45:56.581
<v Speaker 2>penn did didn't take any courage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy in anybody who's like,</v>

3816
02:45:57.010 --> 02:45:58.570
<v Speaker 2>why criticize it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just look at it.</v>

3817
02:45:58.600 --> 02:45:59.890
<v Speaker 2>What it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he got.</v>

3818
02:45:59.950 --> 02:46:04.950
<v Speaker 2>He had a conversation with a a known</v>
<v Speaker 2>gangster of incredible reputation.</v>

3819
02:46:08.230 --> 02:46:09.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what that guy is.</v>

3820
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:14.330
<v Speaker 2>He's an unknown gangster of incredible</v>
<v Speaker 2>reputation and sean penn met him in the</v>

3821
02:46:14.331 --> 02:46:17.780
<v Speaker 2>jungle in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that's a ballsy move.</v>

3822
02:46:17.781 --> 02:46:22.670
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the ballsiest moves that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>person can do as a journalist,</v>

3823
02:46:22.830 --> 02:46:26.480
<v Speaker 2>but with sean penn did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to do it as a movie star,</v>

3824
02:46:26.540 --> 02:46:29.540
<v Speaker 2>a fucking guy who's won oscars or at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least an oscar,</v>

3825
02:46:29.541 --> 02:46:30.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's warning us ranks.</v>

3826
02:46:30.930 --> 02:46:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

3827
02:46:33.020 --> 02:46:36.740
<v Speaker 2>I rescind my previous criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very big of you.</v>

3828
02:46:36.810 --> 02:46:40.080
<v Speaker 7>I heard that it was obviously a</v>
<v Speaker 7>conspiracy thing,</v>

3829
02:46:40.081 --> 02:46:43.680
<v Speaker 7>but I heard that the mexican government</v>
<v Speaker 7>might have led el chapo out to get the</v>

3830
02:46:43.860 --> 02:46:47.430
<v Speaker 7>cartels and gangs under control because</v>
<v Speaker 7>once they arrested him vacuum,</v>

3831
02:46:47.460 --> 02:46:49.470
<v Speaker 7>there was a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now that he was out,</v>

3832
02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:52.470
<v Speaker 7>he got everything wrapped up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now that pulled back in,</v>

3833
02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:56.780
<v Speaker 7>which is why he's been arrested again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jamie's with conspiracies over here</v>

3834
02:46:56.790 --> 02:47:01.290
<v Speaker 7>that's on the radio today.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How dare you to repeat these problems?</v>

3835
02:47:01.380 --> 02:47:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows?</v>

3836
02:47:02.291 --> 02:47:03.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they let him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

3837
02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I think somebody paid a shitload of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money to have so many dig a tunnel and I</v>

3838
02:47:09.101 --> 02:47:10.870
<v Speaker 2>don't think they do a good job of</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching their prison.</v>

3839
02:47:11.170 --> 02:47:14.170
<v Speaker 2>That's most like or probably there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably some people in on it.</v>

3840
02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Probably got paid to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely write that.</v>

3841
02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:18.790
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're so that's why they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to keep them here in the good old</v>

3842
02:47:18.791 --> 02:47:20.980
<v Speaker 2>us way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got them locked down when we're</v>

3843
02:47:20.981 --> 02:47:23.650
<v Speaker 2>done with this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take them down to quantico,</v>

3844
02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:25.930
<v Speaker 2>put them down in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got there.</v>

3845
02:47:25.931 --> 02:47:30.220
<v Speaker 2>And the bottom of the denver airport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where he is comparing that.</v>

3846
02:47:30.250 --> 02:47:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Denver airport prison flights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always talk about.</v>

3847
02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:34.810
<v Speaker 2>I want to see that place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3848
02:47:34.811 --> 02:47:37.030
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm pretty sure it's bullshit.</v>

3849
02:47:37.420 --> 02:47:39.730
<v Speaker 2>It was a jail down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

3850
02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:42.060
<v Speaker 2>A lot of jail.</v>

3851
02:47:42.310 --> 02:47:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3852
02:47:43.330 --> 02:47:44.770
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fenway park have a jail too.</v>

3853
02:47:44.860 --> 02:47:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I might've made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3854
02:47:47.050 --> 02:47:48.520
<v Speaker 2>I can see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3855
02:47:48.790 --> 02:47:50.260
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll chop.</v>

3856
02:47:50.261 --> 02:47:52.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll captured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sean penn brody.</v>

3857
02:47:52.270 --> 02:47:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he went down there and fucking it'S</v>

3858
02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:58.420
<v Speaker 2>not the best story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Writing musical to work will dry and</v>

3859
02:47:58.480 --> 02:47:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

3860
02:47:59.790 --> 02:48:01.420
<v Speaker 2>but you still say it's wrong for him to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

3861
02:48:01.421 --> 02:48:06.250
<v Speaker 2>like he's one of our finer sectors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he did was just unnecessary and he</v>

3862
02:48:06.251 --> 02:48:10.420
<v Speaker 2>was just trying to stand up for a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he has for his craft who doesn't</v>

3863
02:48:10.421 --> 02:48:11.330
<v Speaker 2>get comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3864
02:48:11.350 --> 02:48:15.100
<v Speaker 2>But it's his craft that's he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be who he is to be able to do</v>

3865
02:48:15.101 --> 02:48:19.270
<v Speaker 2>harvey milk and to also be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fast times at ridgemont high and the</v>

3866
02:48:19.271 --> 02:48:21.070
<v Speaker 2>irish mob guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's,</v>

3867
02:48:21.460 --> 02:48:24.100
<v Speaker 2>he obviously knows how to get into his</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

3868
02:48:24.250 --> 02:48:27.550
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't do a shit job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's not doing an american sniper.</v>

3869
02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you ever seen a movie where he plays</v>

3870
02:48:30.041 --> 02:48:31.600
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it seems like he's just phoning it</v>

3871
02:48:31.601 --> 02:48:34.540
<v Speaker 2>in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like moments you saw american sniper,</v>

3872
02:48:34.541 --> 02:48:35.560
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not real,</v>

3873
02:48:35.770 --> 02:48:38.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see sean penn and those movies</v>

3874
02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:40.490
<v Speaker 2>in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when here's like the scene where</v>

3875
02:48:40.500 --> 02:48:43.810
<v Speaker 2>you're criticizing the bradley cooper</v>
<v Speaker 2>scene where the girlfriend was banging</v>

3876
02:48:43.811 --> 02:48:47.280
<v Speaker 2>another guy and it just seeMs all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine sean penn and that</v>

3877
02:48:47.281 --> 02:48:47.711
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3878
02:48:47.711 --> 02:48:49.210
<v Speaker 2>of course you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be.</v>

3879
02:48:49.420 --> 02:48:50.840
<v Speaker 2>It would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would figure out how to make it more</v>

3880
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:51.820
<v Speaker 2>to shut up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>

3881
02:48:52.300 --> 02:48:53.860
<v Speaker 2>He would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would figure out how to make it more</v>

3882
02:48:53.861 --> 02:48:58.861
<v Speaker 2>real or he wouldn't be doing it.</v>

3998
02:53:23.711 --> 02:53:26.050
<v Speaker 2>how that happens out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like oh,</v>

3999
02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:28.300
<v Speaker 2>this guy buys prescription drugs or this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

4000
02:53:28.470 --> 02:53:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as solar panels,</v>

4001
02:53:30.011 --> 02:53:33.760
<v Speaker 2>and it sounds like for whatever reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a list that was like a big issue</v>

4002
02:53:33.761 --> 02:53:35.380
<v Speaker 2>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would sell your information.</v>

4003
02:53:35.760 --> 02:53:38.500
<v Speaker 2>So he started getting all these phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>calls from pharmacies and they lose</v>

4004
02:53:38.540 --> 02:53:41.620
<v Speaker 2>people that barely spoke english and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to sell him prescription</v>

4005
02:53:41.621 --> 02:53:45.460
<v Speaker 2>drugs because this was during the day</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there was a kind of a wild west</v>

4006
02:53:45.461 --> 02:53:49.330
<v Speaker 2>period where you'd buy all your drugs</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Canada and overseas and they would</v>

4007
02:53:49.331 --> 02:53:52.000
<v Speaker 2>ship them and so you could get things</v>
<v Speaker 2>without a prescription,</v>

4008
02:53:52.030 --> 02:53:53.920
<v Speaker 2>like really heavy stuff without a</v>
<v Speaker 2>prescription.</v>

4009
02:53:54.430 --> 02:53:59.170
<v Speaker 2>And so eddie would keep these people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the phone for ever.</v>

4010
02:53:59.400 --> 02:54:01.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have these conversations with</v>

4011
02:54:01.901 --> 02:54:05.710
<v Speaker 2>them and pretend that like some noises</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in the background and he would</v>

4012
02:54:05.711 --> 02:54:09.610
<v Speaker 2>talk to him and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you have that I can use?</v>

4013
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be right back.</v>

4014
02:54:10.620 --> 02:54:13.390
<v Speaker 2>I have to clean my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he would go and like put the</v>

4015
02:54:13.391 --> 02:54:16.510
<v Speaker 2>phone down for like five minutes and go</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a leak.</v>

4016
02:54:16.511 --> 02:54:19.510
<v Speaker 2>He would get something to drink and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back to it and then start talking</v>

4017
02:54:19.511 --> 02:54:22.490
<v Speaker 2>to them about what different drugs like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I text,</v>

4018
02:54:22.990 --> 02:54:25.330
<v Speaker 2>what do you have that gets your card?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have anything that gets your dick</v>

4019
02:54:25.331 --> 02:54:29.800
<v Speaker 2>hard and like have these crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations with these people and they</v>

4020
02:54:29.801 --> 02:54:31.080
<v Speaker 2>would go on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

4021
02:54:31.100 --> 02:54:33.220
<v Speaker 2>He would be laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would hold the phone up to his chest</v>

4022
02:54:33.221 --> 02:54:37.030
<v Speaker 2>and he loves playing tricks like that on</v>
<v Speaker 2>people especially like he felt he had</v>

4023
02:54:37.031 --> 02:54:40.450
<v Speaker 2>the green light because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>contacting him so he would drag on</v>

4024
02:54:40.490 --> 02:54:42.370
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hang up though,</v>

4025
02:54:42.460 --> 02:54:43.660
<v Speaker 2>let's be curse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

4026
02:54:43.661 --> 02:54:48.490
<v Speaker 2>So he was dragging it on forever and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would go to like give them an address to</v>

4027
02:54:48.491 --> 02:54:52.150
<v Speaker 2>send it to her credit card number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then he would have some ridiculous</v>

4028
02:54:52.151 --> 02:54:53.260
<v Speaker 2>excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to put the phone down,</v>

4029
02:54:53.261 --> 02:54:55.960
<v Speaker 2>he put the phone down for like 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes and then go back to it and pick</v>

4030
02:54:55.961 --> 02:54:57.300
<v Speaker 2>it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep doing it.</v>

4031
02:54:57.490 --> 02:55:00.040
<v Speaker 2>And it was Just one second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to deal with this idea of like</v>

4032
02:55:00.041 --> 02:55:02.030
<v Speaker 2>crazy fake arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4033
02:55:02.100 --> 02:55:04.040
<v Speaker 2>like in the background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold the phone down</v>

4034
02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:07.370
<v Speaker 1>and fucking scream and yell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you say he was about to get</v>

4035
02:55:07.371 --> 02:55:10.250
<v Speaker 1>raped and he called the police and video</v>
<v Speaker 1>record them.</v>

4036
02:55:10.450 --> 02:55:11.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just for fun.</v>

4037
02:55:11.660 --> 02:55:15.140

<v Speaker 1>He would do it for like I'm telling you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

4041
02:55:18.981 --> 02:55:20.570
<v Speaker 1>He would get excited when the phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>would ring.</v>

4042
02:55:20.600 --> 02:55:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

<v Speaker 1>patience.</v>

4045
02:55:28.190 --> 02:55:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that mind either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got be bored.</v>

02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:32.630
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be bored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be crazy.</v>

4047
02:55:32.820 --> 02:55:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a different way.</v>

4048
02:55:34.940 --> 02:55:36.530
<v Speaker 1>He loves doing that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just.</v>

4049
02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:39.140
<v Speaker 1>He gets such a kick out of doing that or</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

4050
02:55:39.170 --> 02:55:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure now he's too busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

4051
02:55:44.780 --> 02:55:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't do that anymore.</v>

4052
02:55:46.621 --> 02:55:49.160
<v Speaker 1>And do that call you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to not have your cell</v>

4053
02:55:49.161 --> 02:55:50.230
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be like,</v>

4054
02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:51.620
<v Speaker 1>what am I supposed to call my cell phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever?</v>

4055
02:55:51.621 --> 02:55:55.730
<v Speaker 1>That was like a law change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if they didn't know the lord.</v>

4056
02:55:55.760 --> 02:55:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it only came for when people</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have unlimited phone calls.</v>

4057
02:55:58.700 --> 02:55:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't like standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4058
02:56:00.230 --> 02:56:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're using other people's fucking time</v>

4059
02:56:01.911 --> 02:56:04.040
<v Speaker 1>and money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a good argument to keep</v>

4060
02:56:04.041 --> 02:56:05.240
<v Speaker 1>it the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4061
02:56:05.270 --> 02:56:06.470
<v Speaker 1>because now they can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

4062
02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:08.030
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if it's free,</v>

4063
02:56:08.031 --> 02:56:09.740
<v Speaker 1>if you get all the minutes in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>

4064
02:56:09.741 --> 02:56:11.630
<v Speaker 1>then people were free to contact you for</v>
<v Speaker 1>no reason.</v>

4065
02:56:11.660 --> 02:56:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Even fax machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as we had fax machines within,</v>

4066
02:56:15.460 --> 02:56:17.690
<v Speaker 1>it was spam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spam,</v>

4067
02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:21.820
<v Speaker 1>just sending you some fucking ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember when you call someone on</v>

4068
02:56:21.821 --> 02:56:22.870
<v Speaker 1>the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she went answer.</v>
