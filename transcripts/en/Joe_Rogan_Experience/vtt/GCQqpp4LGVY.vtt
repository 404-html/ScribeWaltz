00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 3>You just don't wake up and have a scab.</v>

151
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

152
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.020

<v Speaker 3>But this lobbying for this,</v>

209
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 3>spend money on the young,</v>

210

<v Speaker 3>spend money on the education system,</v>

211
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 3>spend money on inspiration.</v>

212
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.830
<v Speaker 3>Make sure that there's a generation of these great engineers and scientists that</v>

213
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 3>the America is currently,</v>

214
00:04:58.121 --> 00:04:58.954
<v Speaker 3>we're leading in.</v>

218
00:05:02.601 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 3>It makes you,</v>

219
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.911

<v Speaker 3>How do you inspire them?</v>

221
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't want kids to one and be a singer is actually particularly annex fact.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't want them to be famous.</v>

224
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 3>There's a survey done recently,</v>

225
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:12.701
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

226
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 3>where they said to low skilled kids,</v>

227
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 3>what'd you want to be when you grow up?</v>

228
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.180
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

229
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.371
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

230
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of them said,</v>

231
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:17.104
<v Speaker 3>famous.</v>

232
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.310
<v Speaker 3>Famous.</v>

237
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.753
<v Speaker 3>Don't you do one then?</v>

238
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 3>What'd you mean famous?</v>

239
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be famous for something.</v>

240
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 3>So what are you or make you think wearables is on the verge of extinction?</v>

241
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 3>There's articles written about it.</v>

242
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

243
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.670
<v Speaker 3>the instances of genital crabs have drastically reduced since the implementation</v>

244
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 3>of pornographic,</v>

245
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:41.164
<v Speaker 3>visual,</v>

246
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 3>vagina trimming and penis trimming.</v>

247
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

248
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

249
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 3>because people would shave their pussies and does not me not you let it wild.</v>

250
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

251
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.160
<v Speaker 3>100% man has got a afro pick in it,</v>

252
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 3>but then the tires will come into the change room and instead looking at,</v>

253
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 3>they'll come and feel your arms like a horse.</v>

254
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 3>See how fit you are.</v>

255
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 3>Look you up and down like you're just a piece of meat.</v>

256
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 3>Should I put money on him?</v>

257
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

258
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

259
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.380
<v Speaker 3>It looks pretty good or it looks a bit flabby.</v>

260
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

261
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.051
<v Speaker 3>Nah.</v>

262
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:09.884
<v Speaker 3>But on the other guy.</v>

263
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.590
<v Speaker 3>So we'll just check you out and talk and to come and fill you and every touch</v>

264
00:06:14.591 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 3>you touch your belly to see if you have a strong stomach.</v>

265
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 3>These are just gamblers,</v>

266
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 3>gamblers,</v>

267
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 3>and then fucking weird.</v>

268
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:21.520
<v Speaker 3>And then at them,</v>

269
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 3>the change rooms next to the Thai toilets as well.</v>

270
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 3>So as they're coming in for a piece,</v>

271
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:27.370
<v Speaker 3>they might come out and fill your ass white.</v>

272
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 3>So kind of [inaudible] you got pretty much pretty bizarre.</v>

273
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 3>So a lightning bet is you assign a number,</v>

274
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 3>an amount of money to each point that the bat goes over or under,</v>

275
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.290
<v Speaker 3>which means if you lightening bet $1,000 on an over at one 80 once you hit the</v>

276
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:49.814
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>

277
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 3>I get the chills saying,</v>

278
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.910
<v Speaker 3>once you hit the over every single basket that gets hit in the game,</v>

279
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 3>you win $1,000 every from both teams.</v>

280
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.060
<v Speaker 3>Both teams on a basket from the field is to grant a three pointers,</v>

281
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 3>three grams every single bed housing.</v>

282
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 3>So like the shakes you start to get while you're watching her,</v>

283
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:18.030
<v Speaker 3>literally like they're,</v>

284
00:07:18.031 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 3>they're visible.</v>

285
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:19.641
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like,</v>

286
00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

287
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.610
<v Speaker 3>you're having a connection and you have drank,</v>

288
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 3>maybe coax calm you down and every time a shot goes up it's like,</v>

289
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.093
<v Speaker 3>eh.</v>

290
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 3>And to me it's the purest form of degenerate gambling I've ever seen.</v>

291
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 3>I brought you something.</v>

292
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

293
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.883
<v Speaker 3>those yours.</v>

294
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Do you recognize those reading glasses?</v>

295
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 3>Do you recognize those?</v>

296
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.131
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

297
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:40.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

298
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

299
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.320
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

300
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.280
<v Speaker 3>I think you left those bitches at my house and like 2009 uh,</v>

301
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.980
<v Speaker 3>I think Lisa Loeb left these at your house or your housing and nine,</v>

302
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 3>they might be confused.</v>

303
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:55.963
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

304
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

305
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.141
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure.</v>

306
00:07:57.141 --> 00:07:57.974
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

307
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.103
<v Speaker 3>Thanks brother.</v>

308
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.170
<v Speaker 3>Thanks for getting that same routes.</v>

309
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Adam is gentleman in a long running tradition of people leaving shit behind the</v>

310
00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:06.770
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

311
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Adam Corolla has left behind his glasses.</v>

312
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh my goodness.</v>

313
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have your fucking glasses.</v>

314
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.240
<v Speaker 3>It'll talk to you</v>

315
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.041
<v Speaker 4>when you're surviving.</v>

316
00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:17.070
<v Speaker 4>Getting teachers spirit,</v>

317
00:08:17.071 --> 00:08:20.580
<v Speaker 4>animal food in plastic and then eat it and then poop it out and eat it later.</v>

318
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.530
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm take the plastic off and eat it.</v>

319
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.030
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

320
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.080
<v Speaker 4>It seems like it could work.</v>

321
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.480
<v Speaker 4>That's a technique I've never thought.</v>

322
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:29.701
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

323
00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:31.890
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to be like on your own for five days,</v>

324
00:08:31.891 --> 00:08:32.850
<v Speaker 4>you can eat a bunch of food,</v>

325
00:08:32.851 --> 00:08:35.970
<v Speaker 4>but wrap it up in plastic and then later poop it out then and take it out with</v>

326
00:08:35.971 --> 00:08:36.110
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

327
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.070
<v Speaker 4>How would you get the nutrients from the food in the first place?</v>

328
00:08:38.071 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 4>When we go to your stomach in a piece of plot?</v>

329
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:39.810
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>

330
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.620
<v Speaker 4>Poop it out and understand and then you poop it out like before you leave for</v>

331
00:08:43.621 --> 00:08:44.041
<v Speaker 4>your trip,</v>

332
00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:47.340
<v Speaker 4>go to go get stuffed like a loss of market or something</v>

333
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.260
<v Speaker 4>where you're poorly thought out ideas and they get a bunch of plastic.</v>

334
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.640
<v Speaker 4>Don't tell him stop.</v>

335
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.510
<v Speaker 4>Can't,</v>

336
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 4>can't tell guy to eat as poop.</v>

337
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

338
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:56.371
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

339
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:57.204
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

340
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying like eat like a big meal before you're about to leave and he would</v>

341
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:03.264
<v Speaker 4>eat his own food.</v>

342
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.030
<v Speaker 4>It's called the youth.</v>

343
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.430
<v Speaker 4>It's called second harvest and then native Americans and maybe take a bunch of</v>

344
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:09.250
<v Speaker 4>like protein bars,</v>

345
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.200
<v Speaker 4>wrap them up in plastic,</v>

346
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.250
<v Speaker 4>eat it and then poop it out in a couple of days and then unwrap the plastic they</v>

347
00:09:13.251 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 4>need.</v>

348
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 4>What kind of Shit?</v>

349
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:20.160
<v Speaker 4>Really think a fucking whole protein bar in plastic can make it through your</v>

350
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:20.994
<v Speaker 4>digestive track.</v>

351
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 4>Carry the bars in my backpack and just eat him three days later.</v>

352
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 4>Porous understanding of the human digestive tract ever exhibited on a podcast.</v>

353
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to figure out what you were saying.</v>

354
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:32.280
<v Speaker 4>I thought you were saying eating poop.</v>

355
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.050
<v Speaker 4>You're not talking about a little Baggie of heroin that a drug mule swallow.</v>

356
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking like,</v>

357
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 4>maybe we're going to make you survive.</v>

358
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 4>You'll,</v>

359
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 4>you'll get another hour's worth of energy from that little heroin bag.</v>

360
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:42.820
<v Speaker 4>What about petite filets and</v>

361
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 4>he hated ounces wrapped in plastic.</v>

362
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.270
<v Speaker 4>You're going to die.</v>

363
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.830
<v Speaker 4>How long has uncle Paul been around for?</v>

364
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

365
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:50.731
<v Speaker 4>he started,</v>

366
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:51.920
<v Speaker 4>uncle Paul started is,</v>

367
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing calculus for years and relationships long before I did them on</v>

368
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:55.231
<v Speaker 4>the radio.</v>

369
00:09:55.231 --> 00:09:56.470
<v Speaker 4>I didn't to I my girlfriends,</v>

370
00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.610
<v Speaker 4>he was uncle Larry many years ago.</v>

371
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:02.970
<v Speaker 4>There was Roger Davis or Roger [inaudible] and uh,</v>

372
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.880
<v Speaker 4>this is long before chip that was Roger and Roger had a brother Lester,</v>

373
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:08.750
<v Speaker 4>who was burned in a fire and unless was,</v>

374
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.990
<v Speaker 4>you've got a whole time,</v>

375
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:11.130
<v Speaker 4>like all storyline.</v>

376
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.480
<v Speaker 4>Lester was burned everywhere,</v>

377
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 4>but his knees and his,</v>

378
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 4>until he would always wear knickers to show off his legs was a whole thing.</v>

379
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:17.700
<v Speaker 4>And Uncle Roger,</v>

380
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 4>I know uncle,</v>

381
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.890
<v Speaker 4>uncle Larry and then emerged into chip who my girlfriend hated so much.</v>

382
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.550
<v Speaker 4>Chip became the fucking cause they would chip,</v>

383
00:10:26.551 --> 00:10:27.660
<v Speaker 4>would embarrass people.</v>

384
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 4>I did had literally before I ever thought I'd do on the radio,</v>

385
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 4>I would be out with girlfriends and embarrass them by doing that.</v>

386
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 4>Like we,</v>

387
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.190
<v Speaker 4>I'll just be making bad jokes in the cab and my girlfriend and I,</v>

388
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.100
<v Speaker 4>you know a a gen and even grow up go home.</v>

389
00:10:39.101 --> 00:10:40.810
<v Speaker 4>We just go shut the fuck up.</v>

390
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:46.250
<v Speaker 4>It's not funny and it made me so happy and like this is what we're drive Jenny</v>

391
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

392
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.280
<v Speaker 4>He'd be like a really nice steakhouse and the way they would come over and she</v>

393
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.380
<v Speaker 4>would order like the salmon and then chip just goes,</v>

394
00:10:58.381 --> 00:10:59.250
<v Speaker 4>how much is that?</v>

395
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.050
<v Speaker 4>I would ask the way there and she was like,</v>

396
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.370
<v Speaker 4>do you know how humiliating it is that people think I fucked that guy?</v>

397
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.890
<v Speaker 4>He puts think I'm fucking this guy</v>

398
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 5>first.</v>

399
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to talk about the so called philosophical issue of how long would we</v>

400
00:11:13.331 --> 00:11:14.164
<v Speaker 5>want to live.</v>

401
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:20.730
<v Speaker 5>I find that quite remarkable that people worry about this simply because it's</v>

402
00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:24.590
<v Speaker 5>not the way that people actually think about anything else.</v>

403
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.650
<v Speaker 5>When people ask me they things off sometimes say,</v>

404
00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:27.993
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

405
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.840
<v Speaker 5>take yourself back to the first time you got light.</v>

406
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

407
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:33.970
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

408
00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.960
<v Speaker 5>Now think about what you were thinking at the time.</v>

409
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:39.610
<v Speaker 5>What are you thinking?</v>

410
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:40.271
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

411
00:11:40.271 --> 00:11:40.691
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

412
00:11:40.691 --> 00:11:43.720
<v Speaker 5>I have to get this person into bed right now because I've only got another 60</v>

413
00:11:43.721 --> 00:11:44.710
<v Speaker 5>years to live.</v>

414
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:47.081
<v Speaker 5>So what?</v>

415
00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:48.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just ridiculous.</v>

416
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.320
<v Speaker 5>The difference between</v>

417
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Speaker 4>the feeling you get when you hear,</v>

418
00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 4>oh it was brain damage.</v>

419
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I sort of have that feeling about everything.</v>

420
00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:57.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

421
00:11:57.731 --> 00:11:58.051
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

422
00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:58.241
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

423
00:11:58.241 --> 00:11:58.940
<v Speaker 1>if we,</v>

424
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.130
<v Speaker 1>if he gets a brain scan,</v>

425
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:01.870
<v Speaker 1>if he goes to trial now he gets a brain scan and we,</v>

426
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 1>and we find that his brain is just massively damaged and all the right areas</v>

427
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 1>that would have eroded his impulse control.</v>

428
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:09.131
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

429
00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:10.950
<v Speaker 1>That would seem to let him off the hook a little bit.</v>

430
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Which he would,</v>

431
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:16.570
<v Speaker 1>he would look like someone who is unlucky more than he would look like a bad</v>

432
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:17.404
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

433
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

434
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.560
<v Speaker 1>And I sort of see bad people as unlucky to,</v>

435
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I recognize that there's certain people who are quite classically bad people.</v>

436
00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:27.430
<v Speaker 1>There are psychopaths who you just,</v>

437
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.680
<v Speaker 1>not only can you not rely on them,</v>

438
00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:29.791
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

439
00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:32.740
<v Speaker 1>you can rely on them to be bad actors,</v>

440
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:32.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

441
00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:33.201
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

442
00:12:33.201 --> 00:12:33.361
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

443
00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:34.194
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

444
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to be in a posture of,</v>

445
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.020
<v Speaker 1>of self defense with respect to these people.</v>

446
00:12:38.021 --> 00:12:38.960
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

447
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I do view them as an unlucky on some fundamental level</v>

448
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.160
<v Speaker 4>and hair was more of like an eyelash for the vagina,</v>

449
00:12:46.161 --> 00:12:47.270
<v Speaker 4>for periods and stuff.</v>

450
00:12:47.271 --> 00:12:50.120
<v Speaker 4>So when and get everywhere and that's why girls are,</v>

451
00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.013
<v Speaker 4>that's not what it is.</v>

452
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:51.861
<v Speaker 4>The uh,</v>

453
00:12:51.861 --> 00:12:53.810
<v Speaker 4>the butthole hair was always disturbing though.</v>

454
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:54.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

455
00:12:54.201 --> 00:12:57.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't like nobody ever liked the buddle here cause some gals just did not know</v>

456
00:12:57.591 --> 00:12:59.120
<v Speaker 4>what they're doing when Kim to wiping.</v>

457
00:12:59.121 --> 00:13:02.210

587
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.520
<v Speaker 7>But the heat from the lamp started burning the diary</v>

<v Speaker 3>acids on his legs</v>

589

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.160
<v Speaker 3>He showed tonight</v>

591

<v Speaker 3>shitting himself with just sometimes mean regular fresh say.</v>

592
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:07.913
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

593
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.270
<v Speaker 3>Sounded like last night I thought yesterday.</v>

594
00:17:12.271 --> 00:17:12.960
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

595
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

596
00:17:13.201 --> 00:17:16.890
<v Speaker 3>when you stay away from seafood for awhile and then reintroduce it,</v>

597
00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.630
<v Speaker 3>there's bacteria in like,</v>

598
00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:18.811
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

599
00:17:18.811 --> 00:17:21.300
<v Speaker 3>it's different since shellfish and Sushi.</v>

600
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:22.120
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

601
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:22.953
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

602
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:23.611
<v Speaker 3>I thought when,</v>

603
00:17:23.611 --> 00:17:24.450
<v Speaker 3>I guess when I farted,</v>

604
00:17:24.451 --> 00:17:27.990
<v Speaker 3>it sounded like somebody was throwing up like the front sounded like a guy</v>

605
00:17:27.991 --> 00:17:28.824
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

606
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:30.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

607
00:17:30.181 --> 00:17:30.331
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

608
00:17:30.331 --> 00:17:33.410
<v Speaker 3>I've only shaved my ass once in my life,</v>

609
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.710
<v Speaker 3>but once I did,</v>

610
00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:35.431
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

611
00:17:35.431 --> 00:17:37.050
<v Speaker 3>my farts sounded so different.</v>

612
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.520
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

613
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:37.631
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

614
00:17:37.631 --> 00:17:39.480
<v Speaker 3>they were all like wet and sloppy.</v>

615
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.040
<v Speaker 3>It's a hair kind of different.</v>

616
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.730
<v Speaker 3>The hair on your ass literally changes the way your farts smell or sound rather.</v>

617
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.100
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

618
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.000
<v Speaker 3>Smell this smell the same,</v>

619
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.320
<v Speaker 3>but they sound different.</v>

620
00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:52.693
<v Speaker 3>Plop,</v>

621
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:54.000
<v Speaker 3>plop,</v>

622
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.833
<v Speaker 3>plop.</v>

623
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.910
<v Speaker 3>Somebody tells me king her but doesn't shave.</v>

624
00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.130
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole new area he'd get into.</v>

625
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:03.300
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole monster.</v>

626
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.830
<v Speaker 3>That guy dating that guy.</v>

627
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.110
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have a girlfriend or girlfriend.</v>

628
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.290
<v Speaker 3>He scrapes up his youtube,</v>

629
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.420
<v Speaker 3>like add video money.</v>

630
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.150
<v Speaker 3>Then then he gets a hooker farts on her.</v>

631
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:20.911
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

632
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:21.241
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

633
00:18:21.241 --> 00:18:22.074
<v Speaker 3>I hate it.</v>

634
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.700

<v Speaker 3>no you don't.</v>

637
00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:38.040
<v Speaker 8>And then you come out of it and you slowly come out of it and you were like,</v>

638
00:18:38.861 --> 00:18:39.760
<v Speaker 8>noise canceling headphones.</v>

639
00:18:39.761 --> 00:18:41.140
<v Speaker 8>I'm just at a doctor's office,</v>

640
00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:42.250
<v Speaker 8>like in a weird,</v>

641
00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:43.031
<v Speaker 8>not even weird,</v>

642
00:18:43.031 --> 00:18:47.380
<v Speaker 8>like those like 1970s doctors' offices that you see in la,</v>

643
00:18:47.381 --> 00:18:50.350
<v Speaker 8>like just sort of a shitty elevator and whatever.</v>

644
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:51.743
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

645
00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:53.620
<v Speaker 8>so when I came out of the first one,</v>

646
00:18:53.621 --> 00:18:54.454
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

647
00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.130
<v Speaker 8>it was rough because hey,</v>

648
00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.610
<v Speaker 8>I didn't know it was going a trip like that.</v>

649
00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.020
<v Speaker 8>And B,</v>

650
00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.040
<v Speaker 8>I had been,</v>

651
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.370
<v Speaker 8>I didn't get a ton of sleep the night before and uh,</v>

652
00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.300
<v Speaker 8>so I was,</v>

653
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.320
<v Speaker 8>and I'd flown that day.</v>

654
00:19:05.321 --> 00:19:07.780
<v Speaker 8>It was just kind of groggy and uh,</v>

655
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.260
<v Speaker 8>and I felt really shitty and it took me like,</v>

656
00:19:11.261 --> 00:19:11.860
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

657
00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:12.760
<v Speaker 8>after I was done,</v>

658
00:19:12.761 --> 00:19:15.910
<v Speaker 8>I probably laid in the bed there for like an hour.</v>

659
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.690
<v Speaker 8>So it was like,</v>

660
00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.190
<v Speaker 8>I can't do shit right now.</v>

661
00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:18.970
<v Speaker 8>Like I can't,</v>

662
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.170
<v Speaker 8>I could barely stand.</v>

663
00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.680
<v Speaker 8>So the first it was rough and,</v>

664
00:19:23.681 --> 00:19:24.160
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

665
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:24.731
<v Speaker 8>and that,</v>

666
00:19:24.731 --> 00:19:27.340
<v Speaker 8>and I still felt shitty that night and I was like,</v>

667
00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.660
<v Speaker 8>I don't think I'm going to do it again.</v>

668
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.920
<v Speaker 8>Like that was too rough.</v>

669
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:30.761
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>

670
00:19:30.761 --> 00:19:31.594
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

671
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.650
<v Speaker 8>then I woke up Tuesday morning and felt fucking great.</v>

672
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:37.440
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

673
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.273

<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

675
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.060

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

744
00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.420

745

<v Speaker 3>There's something hot about that though.</v>

754
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.001
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

755
00:21:49.001 --> 00:21:49.670
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

756
00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:50.503
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

757
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 9>I met a,</v>

758
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.210
<v Speaker 9>I met a woman at one of my shows in Brooklyn.</v>

759
00:22:03.211 --> 00:22:06.960
<v Speaker 9>She had no hands or feet.</v>

760
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.003
<v Speaker 9>What happened to her?</v>

761
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:08.580
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

762
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:13.080
<v Speaker 9>she came up to me after the show and she like wanted to like give me a hug.</v>

763
00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:13.351
<v Speaker 9>She was like,</v>

764
00:22:13.351 --> 00:22:14.280
<v Speaker 9>you're so funny.</v>

765
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.470
<v Speaker 9>And she had like these stubs and she said,</v>

766
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.770
<v Speaker 9>you remind me of the girls who did my nails when I had hands.</v>

767
00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:23.363
<v Speaker 9>And I was like,</v>

768
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.383
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

769
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Then like I said so much to tape,</v>

770
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.580
<v Speaker 3>it was like racism,</v>

771
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.513
<v Speaker 3>Korea,</v>

772
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:34.443
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam,</v>

773
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.080
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

774
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:36.933
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

775
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:37.973
<v Speaker 9>I was like,</v>

776
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.570
<v Speaker 9>I was thinking like I want to bring it up if I just met her any other way.</v>

777
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:42.990
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

778
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.660
<v Speaker 9>But since she brought up her hand,</v>

779
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.171
<v Speaker 9>I was like,</v>

780
00:22:46.171 --> 00:22:48.120
<v Speaker 9>what happened to your hands?</v>

781
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.820
<v Speaker 9>And she said that she had,</v>

782
00:22:50.821 --> 00:22:51.110
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>

783
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:56.010
<v Speaker 9>something wrong with her appendix went to the hospital and the doctor put the</v>

784
00:22:56.011 --> 00:22:56.844
<v Speaker 9>wrong name,</v>

785
00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:02.070
<v Speaker 9>like mixed up her charts and they amputated her hands and her feet</v>

786
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:07.740
<v Speaker 9>when she was only supposed to get her appendix taken out or something.</v>

787
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:08.603
<v Speaker 9>Very minor.</v>

788
00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.350
<v Speaker 9>What?</v>

789
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.233
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

790
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:13.451
<v Speaker 2>like I did,</v>

791
00:23:13.451 --> 00:23:13.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

792
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.130
<v Speaker 2>my friend Sam Cedars,</v>

793
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.040
<v Speaker 2>a podcast a couple of weeks back and,</v>

794
00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:19.540
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>

795
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:20.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give away with the movies.</v>

796
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:21.281
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

797
00:23:21.281 --> 00:23:21.911
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>

798
00:23:21.911 --> 00:23:25.390
<v Speaker 2>it's not that kind of movie in a hinges largely on the fact that I survived</v>

799
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:26.530
<v Speaker 2>rapes as a child.</v>

800
00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:26.651
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

801
00:23:26.651 --> 00:23:26.950
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

802
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:28.480
<v Speaker 2>I heard from several people said,</v>

803
00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

804
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:31.360
<v Speaker 2>you really should have had a trigger warning on there.</v>

805
00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:32.050
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

806
00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:33.260
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck do you shake?</v>

807
00:23:33.261 --> 00:23:34.094
<v Speaker 2>I was doing,</v>

808
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.620
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck do you think I was doing when I said it hinges largely I was</v>

809
00:23:38.621 --> 00:23:41.170
<v Speaker 2>warning you that what it was about right there.</v>

810
00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.870
<v Speaker 2>But someone has empowered you to,</v>

811
00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 2>to have a way to take issue with me because</v>

812
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm not completely basing.</v>

813
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:48.733
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

814
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

815
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.080
<v Speaker 4>the whole world isn't based around me.</v>

816
00:23:51.081 --> 00:23:53.180
<v Speaker 4>Even though I got raped when I was four years old.</v>

817
00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:56.240
<v Speaker 4>Everybody shouldn't be thinking in terms of that all the time because they'd</v>

818
00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:58.670
<v Speaker 4>been through their own shit and they're dealing with their own shit and they're</v>

819
00:23:58.671 --> 00:23:59.570
<v Speaker 4>trying to survive.</v>

820
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:01.880
<v Speaker 4>So if I can make them more sensitive to this issue,</v>

821
00:24:01.881 --> 00:24:03.890
<v Speaker 4>if I can show them that it matters to them,</v>

822
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:04.770
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

823
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.760
<v Speaker 4>that they deal with other people who have been through this kind of trauma and</v>

824
00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:11.270
<v Speaker 4>we want to reduce it as much as absolutely possible,</v>

825
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:12.403
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>

826
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 4>But after that,</v>

827
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:17.630
<v Speaker 4>if I'm going to find a way to set up a situation where I'm always the injured</v>

828
00:24:17.631 --> 00:24:22.550
<v Speaker 4>party and that prove again and again that I'm persecuted and no one's thinking</v>

829
00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:23.570
<v Speaker 4>in terms of me,</v>

830
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.690
<v Speaker 4>then I'm never going to get fucking hailed.</v>

831
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm never going to get fucking healed.</v>

832
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.100
<v Speaker 4>So one I did was I went out and I try to help other people.</v>

833
00:24:31.101 --> 00:24:32.510
<v Speaker 4>When I help other people,</v>

834
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.160
<v Speaker 4>I realized how far along I've come and I realized there's really something in it</v>

835
00:24:37.161 --> 00:24:38.600
<v Speaker 4>for me to do that.</v>

836
00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:40.670
<v Speaker 4>And it's not like I'm this altruistic guy.</v>

837
00:24:40.671 --> 00:24:42.440
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm saving my own life.</v>

838
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.801
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

839
00:24:42.801 --> 00:24:45.500
<v Speaker 4>looked at AOL investigation that took such courage to do it.</v>

840
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:46.220
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

841
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:50.100
<v Speaker 4>What would have taken courage was turning my back on those kids and walking away</v>

842
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 4>going like,</v>

843
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.631
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

844
00:24:50.631 --> 00:24:53.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to know what's going on in there.</v>

845
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:53.610
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

846
00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:54.980
<v Speaker 4>how would I live with that guy?</v>

847
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.600
<v Speaker 4>How would I live with myself then?</v>

848
00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:57.151
<v Speaker 4>But they,</v>

849
00:24:57.151 --> 00:24:57.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

850
00:24:57.351 --> 00:24:57.651
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>

851
00:24:57.651 --> 00:24:58.101
<v Speaker 4>it was nice.</v>

852
00:24:58.101 --> 00:24:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Everyone said,</v>

853
00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.311
<v Speaker 4>Oh gee,</v>

854
00:24:59.311 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 4>that what he went through when he was doing that investigation.</v>

855
00:25:01.611 --> 00:25:03.620
<v Speaker 4>What about the kids in the fucking pictures?</v>

856
00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.540
<v Speaker 4>That's what I want everyone to know about.</v>

857
00:25:05.541 --> 00:25:07.040
<v Speaker 4>Thanks for caring about me.</v>

858
00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.470
<v Speaker 4>But it's the kids in the pictures I give a shit about.</v>

859
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.840
<v Speaker 4>It's the kids that are suffering right now somewhere within the Sada,</v>

860
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:13.693
<v Speaker 4>my voice,</v>

861
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 4>someone you know,</v>

862
00:25:15.231 --> 00:25:16.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean in this broadcast,</v>

863
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:21.910
<v Speaker 4>like where this is on someone in the next apartment or wherever some kid is</v>

864
00:25:23.001 --> 00:25:24.440
<v Speaker 4>going through this shit,</v>

865
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.420
<v Speaker 4>have the courage to know about it.</v>

866
00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:27.260
<v Speaker 4>That's all I asked.</v>

867
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:32.000
<v Speaker 4>You have the courage to know about it and save the contemporary children so you</v>

868
00:25:32.001 --> 00:25:34.310
<v Speaker 4>don't have to deal with a much a fucking maniac.</v>

869
00:25:34.311 --> 00:25:36.710
<v Speaker 4>Abuse survivors went up.</v>

870
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:37.730
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>

871
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.480
<v Speaker 4>And if anybody can diffuse the arounds Cape guys coming in now,</v>

872
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.000
<v Speaker 4>not everybody agrees.</v>

873
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:44.571
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

874
00:25:44.571 --> 00:25:47.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anybody who doesn't think that these shootings,</v>

875
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.700
<v Speaker 4>police shootings are horrific,</v>

876
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.950
<v Speaker 4>but to to interrupt a guy who is easily the most liberal.</v>

877
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 4>That's what was going to say is that of all the candidates for president,</v>

878
00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.490
<v Speaker 4>a guy who is the most diverse and guy who march with Martin Luther fucking king.</v>

879
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

880
00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.100
<v Speaker 4>he marched in the civil rights movement.</v>

881
00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:09.340
<v Speaker 4>He's been a civil rights advocate since the 1960s and they interrupt his</v>

882
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.770
<v Speaker 4>presidential speeches.</v>

883
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.630
<v Speaker 4>You don't have a theory that a lot of these,</v>

884
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:15.920
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these folks,</v>

885
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.100
<v Speaker 4>the Che Avera wearing tee shirt wearing guys,</v>

886
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:22.850
<v Speaker 4>they want to feel part of a greater cause.</v>

887
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:23.510
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

888
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.910
<v Speaker 4>So even though many of those battles have passed them by they,</v>

889
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:27.680
<v Speaker 4>they'd been one,</v>

890
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean rights,</v>

891
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:28.941
<v Speaker 4>civil rights.</v>

892
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:29.151
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

893
00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:30.320
<v Speaker 4>of course there's still racism,</v>

894
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 4>but in terms of institutionalized and then a criticism,</v>

895
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.630
<v Speaker 4>we certainly are much better than we were 50 years ago.</v>

896
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:36.231
<v Speaker 4>But yet,</v>

897
00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:36.441
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

898
00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 4>they're young kids,</v>

899
00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:38.390
<v Speaker 4>they revolutionary,</v>

900
00:26:38.391 --> 00:26:39.620
<v Speaker 4>they're wearing Che Guevara,</v>

901
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:40.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

902
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.890
<v Speaker 4>Viva La Revolution and they have to engage in this kind of behavior.</v>

903
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.000
<v Speaker 1>30 years from now,</v>

904
00:26:45.001 --> 00:26:47.700
<v Speaker 1>they'll watch that youtube clip and they'll think they're a bunch of buffoons.</v>

905
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:47.881
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

906
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I think anytime you,</v>

907
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:53.760
<v Speaker 1>you could spend resources on something that's going to directly affect the youth</v>

908
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:58.970
<v Speaker 1>of society and sending them a message about what is right and what is wrong.</v>

909
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

910
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:00.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

911
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:02.300
<v Speaker 1>having grown up in a,</v>

912
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 1>in a sporting household myself,</v>

913
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.090
<v Speaker 1>a three daughters,</v>

914
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:06.650
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

915
00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:06.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

916
00:27:06.901 --> 00:27:10.950
<v Speaker 1>played sports growing up and I look at kind of what I went through and what my</v>

917
00:27:10.951 --> 00:27:14.820
<v Speaker 1>daughters have gone through in the life's lessons that you learn in sports that</v>

918
00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:18.450
<v Speaker 1>transcends sports and learn how to work under pressure,</v>

919
00:27:18.451 --> 00:27:20.370
<v Speaker 1>how to work as a team,</v>

920
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.900
<v Speaker 1>how to individually succeed.</v>

921
00:27:21.901 --> 00:27:23.910
<v Speaker 1>There's so many great lessons to be learned,</v>

922
00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:25.980
<v Speaker 1>the health aspects of,</v>

923
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:26.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

924
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:27.480
<v Speaker 1>being healthy and working out.</v>

925
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.660
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you introduce into that equation,</v>

926
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:31.801
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

927
00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:32.430
<v Speaker 1>breaking the rules,</v>

928
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.420
<v Speaker 1>breaking the rules.</v>

929
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.351
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>

930
00:27:34.351 --> 00:27:35.184
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

931
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.200
<v Speaker 1>the ethics to look at surrounding it.</v>

932
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 1>And number two,</v>

933
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:39.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

934
00:27:39.301 --> 00:27:43.920
<v Speaker 1>ultimately there can be risk and health consequences with using these things,</v>

935
00:27:43.921 --> 00:27:45.360
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're young doing that.</v>

936
00:27:45.361 --> 00:27:46.194
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

937
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

938
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:47.011
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

939
00:27:47.011 --> 00:27:48.630
<v Speaker 1>going back to the message,</v>

940
00:27:48.631 --> 00:27:53.631
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's sent to our kids and two parents with where I think society</v>

941
00:27:54.121 --> 00:27:58.470
<v Speaker 1>was going back then with the pervasive use of drugs in sports,</v>

942
00:27:58.471 --> 00:28:02.010
<v Speaker 1>I think was a positive one that's going to benefit people positively.</v>

943
00:28:02.011 --> 00:28:03.060
<v Speaker 1>And I think it did.</v>

944
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.200
<v Speaker 1>It did have an impact.</v>

945
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.650
<v Speaker 1>How much does that guy way about how tall is he rather uh,</v>

946
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.520
<v Speaker 1>find the stats,</v>

947
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:09.310
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

948
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.143
<v Speaker 1>find a stats.</v>

949
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:10.710
<v Speaker 1>If he,</v>

950
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:11.400
<v Speaker 1>it depends.</v>

951
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean he could be like five,</v>

952
00:28:12.331 --> 00:28:15.750
<v Speaker 1>seven and he'd still be 230 pounds built like that.</v>

953
00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:16.950
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking giant.</v>

954
00:28:16.951 --> 00:28:17.784
<v Speaker 1>He's beautiful.</v>

955
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:18.663
<v Speaker 1>You like it?</v>

956
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:19.951
<v Speaker 1>Six feet tall,</v>

957
00:28:19.951 --> 00:28:20.784
<v Speaker 1>two 20.</v>

958
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:24.840
<v Speaker 1>It's just an ape filled with fucking testosterone and fury.</v>

959
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.611
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

960
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:27.444
<v Speaker 1>that's an athlete.</v>

961
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.510
<v Speaker 1>That's about as strong an athlete is.</v>

962
00:28:30.511 --> 00:28:32.760
<v Speaker 1>You get human vans there,</v>

963
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.360
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

964
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

965
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.480
<v Speaker 1>great slave auction back in the day.</v>

966
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.400
<v Speaker 10>And this is just a stat that,</v>

967
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.670
<v Speaker 10>that I like to sum that grips my heart.</v>

968
00:28:44.671 --> 00:28:46.110
<v Speaker 10>So that's why I want to say it now.</v>

969
00:28:46.111 --> 00:28:46.321
<v Speaker 10>But,</v>

970
00:28:46.321 --> 00:28:47.070
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

971
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.610
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

972
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:47.820
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>

973
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:51.990
<v Speaker 10>I think I looked it up right before I got in in here and it was around 11,000</v>

974
00:28:51.991 --> 00:28:53.790
<v Speaker 10>people that a bullet took,</v>

975
00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.620
<v Speaker 10>took out 11,000 people.</v>

976
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:56.454
<v Speaker 10>That's a ton.</v>

977
00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.150
<v Speaker 10>It's a ton.</v>

978
00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:58.380
<v Speaker 10>It's a brutal crisis.</v>

979
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.500
<v Speaker 10>But I just remember the uproar that,</v>

980
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.030
<v Speaker 10>that and the fear,</v>

981
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:08.040
<v Speaker 10>like the outcry that that happened publicly all over the United States and only</v>

982
00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:10.830
<v Speaker 10>a couple people got it here and then,</v>

983
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.971
<v Speaker 10>and still,</v>

984
00:29:11.971 --> 00:29:12.660
<v Speaker 10>that's terrible.</v>

985
00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.493
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

986
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:18.360
<v Speaker 10>but whenever I compare that 11,000 people total in this Ebola crisis,</v>

987
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.670
<v Speaker 10>and then the stat for children,</v>

988
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:25.260
<v Speaker 10>and this is on water for his website and stuff and on ours and dude,</v>

989
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:28.440
<v Speaker 10>it's what I want to fight and let people know because there should be a real</v>

990
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:32.730
<v Speaker 10>public outcry and uproar that 5,000 kids,</v>

991
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.820
<v Speaker 10>5,000 kids under the age of five years old,</v>

992
00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.490
<v Speaker 10>die every single day,</v>

993
00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.590
<v Speaker 10>every single day because of dirty water,</v>

994
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.360
<v Speaker 10>because of water borne disease,</v>

995
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:44.730
<v Speaker 10>because of waterborne illness.</v>

996
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 10>That's a legit stat from like UNICEF or one of those like legit places,</v>

997
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.201
<v Speaker 10>5,000,</v>

998
00:29:50.201 --> 00:29:51.490
<v Speaker 10>5,000 a day.</v>

999
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:52.570
<v Speaker 10>It's like,</v>

1000
00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:56.890
<v Speaker 10>it fluctuates from like 4,700 or something to 5,000 a day.</v>

1001
00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.091
<v Speaker 10>And like for me,</v>

1002
00:29:58.091 --> 00:29:58.331
<v Speaker 10>man,</v>

1003
00:29:58.331 --> 00:29:58.630
<v Speaker 10>I've,</v>

1004
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.930
<v Speaker 10>I've,</v>

1005
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.310
<v Speaker 10>I've held two of those children.</v>

1006
00:30:00.311 --> 00:30:00.700
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

1007
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.030
<v Speaker 10>I've,</v>

1008
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:01.450
<v Speaker 10>I've,</v>

1009
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 10>I've dug the grave,</v>

1010
00:30:02.531 --> 00:30:04.000
<v Speaker 10>I've had blisters on my hands.</v>

1011
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:08.440
<v Speaker 10>I've had a little dude named Andy bow his blood on my hands and like,</v>

1012
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.220
<v Speaker 10>like Bro,</v>

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.430
<v Speaker 10>it wrecks me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I feel like just tell him when he was in the fucking pressure,</v>

1305
00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.730
<v Speaker 3>but I wanted to rape him so bad.</v>

1306
00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.241
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

1307
00:37:37.241 --> 00:37:37.761
<v Speaker 3>Wanting to kill him.</v>

1308
00:37:37.761 --> 00:37:38.141
<v Speaker 3>I want to back.</v>

1309
00:37:38.141 --> 00:37:40.300
<v Speaker 3>You know what car you can blow me like a cup of hot soup.</v>

1310
00:37:40.301 --> 00:37:42.940
<v Speaker 3>You son of a bitch but low me on like a cup of hot soup.</v>

1311
00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:43.873
<v Speaker 3>How's that work?</v>

1312
00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.730
<v Speaker 3>You blow on a cup of hot soup.</v>

1313
00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:46.563
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

1314
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:47.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1315
00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:47.903
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1316
00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.173
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1317
00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.810
<v Speaker 3>but if he just blows you like that.</v>

1318
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:52.630
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's confusing.</v>

1319
00:37:52.631 --> 00:37:54.040
<v Speaker 3>The vernacular is really odd.</v>

1320
00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Like blow jobs.</v>

1321
00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:56.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand where that</v>

1322
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.481
<v Speaker 3>blow me.</v>

1323
00:37:58.481 --> 00:38:00.880
<v Speaker 3>Like a couple hot soup first time.</v>

1324
00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:01.631
<v Speaker 3>First Time.</v>

1325
00:38:01.631 --> 00:38:02.464
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

1326
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1327
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:03.670
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard that one before.</v>

1328
00:38:03.671 --> 00:38:04.504
<v Speaker 3>I've been around</v>

1329
00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.320
<v Speaker 3>the destination of the species,</v>

1330
00:38:08.321 --> 00:38:09.870
<v Speaker 3>the way that men and women interact with each other.</v>

1331
00:38:09.871 --> 00:38:11.470
<v Speaker 3>It's becoming poisoned by these people.</v>

1332
00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:13.780
<v Speaker 3>You grotesquely underestimate their influence.</v>

1333
00:38:13.781 --> 00:38:16.780
<v Speaker 3>If you write them off as a few mad crazies in student unions,</v>

1334
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.950
<v Speaker 3>but they have gigantic purchase on,</v>

1335
00:38:20.951 --> 00:38:22.960
<v Speaker 3>on the media and therefore on politicians.</v>

1336
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:23.111
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1337
00:38:23.111 --> 00:38:25.940
<v Speaker 3>they certainly do when it comes to schools and schools</v>

1338
00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:31.480
<v Speaker 3>for women getting getting sexually assaulted on campus.</v>

1339
00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:32.450
<v Speaker 3>Listen though,</v>

1340
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 3>your president is parroting these myths from these of that.</v>

1341
00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:36.430
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1342
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.110
<v Speaker 4>the Obama has repeated the,</v>

1343
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:38.380
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1344
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.340
<v Speaker 4>the sexual Harrison myth.</v>

1345
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.860
<v Speaker 4>Obama has also repeated the wage gap myth.</v>

1346
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 4>You're dismissing these people are sort of powerless fringe crazies.</v>

1347
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.520
<v Speaker 4>The president of the United States is repeating their talking points.</v>

1348
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.110
<v Speaker 4>Don't tell me these people aren't influential.</v>

1349
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:50.944
<v Speaker 4>It's nuts.</v>

1350
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:51.401
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1351
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:52.450
<v Speaker 4>that's a different thing,</v>

1352
00:38:52.451 --> 00:38:52.930
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

1353
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:53.231
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1354
00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:57.540
<v Speaker 4>when the president and the president is really just a guy who supposed to parrot</v>

1355
00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:00.070
<v Speaker 4>what everybody else sort of already believes anyway.</v>

1356
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:02.410
<v Speaker 4>And if that's what the progressive democratic person,</v>

1357
00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:04.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if the Republican president would be any different,</v>

1358
00:39:04.901 --> 00:39:06.220
<v Speaker 4>there'll be a lot more Jesus talk.</v>

1359
00:39:06.221 --> 00:39:06.940
<v Speaker 4>What else would be different?</v>

1360
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.840
<v Speaker 4>It will tell the truth.</v>

1361
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:09.010
<v Speaker 4>Trump would tell the truth.</v>

1362
00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:14.200
<v Speaker 4>Do you really like Trump or is this a troll not accusing me of trolling?</v>

1363
00:39:14.201 --> 00:39:15.034
<v Speaker 4>What a horrible allegations.</v>

1364
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.383
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1365
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:24.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how we got from Beta comedian skull fucking passed out girls to</v>

1366
00:39:24.371 --> 00:39:24.990
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1367
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:26.710
<v Speaker 4>but I'm trying men and men are different.</v>

1368
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:28.450
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1369
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:33.040
<v Speaker 4>that's the big picture and feminism is something that's created by men as a</v>

1370
00:39:33.041 --> 00:39:33.830
<v Speaker 4>false narrative.</v>

1371

<v Speaker 2>his goal was to like smear it around</v>

00:40:56.181 --> 00:40:57.420
<v Speaker 2>And this is in the room with you?</v>

00:40:57.651 --> 00:40:57.750
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

<v Speaker 2>In the hallway.</v>

1410

1438
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.970

1446
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.510
<v Speaker 3>And where you came from,</v>

1447
00:42:05.511 --> 00:42:06.080
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

1448
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.190
<v Speaker 3>did you actually say it to him?</v>

1449
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:08.024
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1450
00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:16.170
<v Speaker 9>What happened particularly in the academy and I was teaching philosophy in the</v>

1451
00:42:16.171 --> 00:42:20.070
<v Speaker 9>1980s and the chairman of my department asked me to teach a course in feminist</v>

1452
00:42:20.071 --> 00:42:21.240
<v Speaker 9>theory and I thought,</v>

1453
00:42:21.241 --> 00:42:21.810
<v Speaker 9>fine,</v>

1454
00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:22.471
<v Speaker 9>I'm a theorist,</v>

1455
00:42:22.471 --> 00:42:23.191
<v Speaker 9>I'm a feminism.</v>

1456
00:42:23.191 --> 00:42:24.540
<v Speaker 9>I sent away for the textbooks.</v>

1457
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:28.290
<v Speaker 9>I was shocked by what came through the mail.</v>

1458
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:31.690
<v Speaker 9>I spent the summer reading these books and as a,</v>

1459
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.780
<v Speaker 9>as a philosophy professor of many years,</v>

1460
00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.590
<v Speaker 9>I thought there was a sacred commandment about college teaching.</v>

1461
00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:40.230
<v Speaker 9>Thou shalt teach both sides of the argument.</v>

1462
00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:41.431
<v Speaker 9>It never occurred to me.</v>

1463
00:42:41.431 --> 00:42:44.400
<v Speaker 9>It was my job as the teacher to take my views about the world.</v>

1464
00:42:44.401 --> 00:42:44.970
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>

1465
00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:45.230
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>

1466
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.220
<v Speaker 9>and implanting them in the minds of my students.</v>

1467
00:42:47.221 --> 00:42:48.440
<v Speaker 9>I wanted to give them the,</v>

1468
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:50.880
<v Speaker 9>the techniques to make their own decisions.</v>

1469
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.950
<v Speaker 9>And you do that.</v>

1470
00:42:52.951 --> 00:42:56.370
<v Speaker 9>One way to do that is to give them the best that was thought and said on both</v>

1471
00:42:56.371 --> 00:42:57.990
<v Speaker 9>sides of a contentious issue.</v>

1472
00:42:58.290 --> 00:42:58.441
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

1473
00:42:58.441 --> 00:43:00.480
<v Speaker 9>these textbooks were not like that.</v>

1474
00:43:00.481 --> 00:43:05.070
<v Speaker 9>They were a series of mutually reinforcing readings and it was a conspiracy</v>

1475
00:43:05.071 --> 00:43:10.050
<v Speaker 9>theory about the patriarchy buttressed by inflated statistics.</v>

1476
00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:11.850
<v Speaker 9>So I,</v>

1477
00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:13.900
<v Speaker 9>after spending a summer reading this book,</v>

1478
00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.430
<v Speaker 9>I wrote a paper and and gave,</v>

1479
00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:19.920
<v Speaker 9>I went to the American Philosophical Association and presented it.</v>

1480
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.821
<v Speaker 9>And I will tell you,</v>

1481
00:43:20.821 --> 00:43:23.250
<v Speaker 9>typically at the American Philosophical Association,</v>

1482
00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:24.510
<v Speaker 9>if you give a paper,</v>

1483
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:25.940
<v Speaker 9>people are,</v>

1484
00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.630
<v Speaker 9>it's very combative,</v>

1485
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.710
<v Speaker 9>Eh,</v>

1486
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:29.880
<v Speaker 9>but then you go out for drinks.</v>

1487
00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:30.540
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

1488
00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:31.950
<v Speaker 9>we did not go out for drinks.</v>

1489
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.250
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

1490
00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:33.210
<v Speaker 9>I gave this paper.</v>

1491
00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.570
<v Speaker 9>Women mostly women in the audience were hissing and booing.</v>

1492
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:40.620
<v Speaker 9>And I was excommunicated from a religion I didn't even know existed.</v>

1493
00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.500
<v Speaker 9>The church of feminism I was,</v>

1494
00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.060
<v Speaker 9>I was considered a,</v>

1495
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:47.010
<v Speaker 9>that I'd committed an act of Harrison.</v>

1496
00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.610
<v Speaker 1>We're bringing him and I are talking about actually presents a,</v>

1497
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:54.770
<v Speaker 1>a possible solution to what could have brought this planet out of the Ice Age.</v>

1498
00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Something on a grand cosmic scale.</v>

1499
00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.640
<v Speaker 1>And the other point I think I'd like to make is that we have to really to</v>

1500
00:44:01.641 --> 00:44:03.710
<v Speaker 1>understand our planet as a system,</v>

1501
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:08.870
<v Speaker 1>we have to realize that it's part of a cosmic ecosystem and the cosmos has been</v>

1502
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.800
<v Speaker 1>a much bigger player in what's been going on down here than has been a</v>

1503
00:44:12.801 --> 00:44:13.471
<v Speaker 1>previously.</v>

1504
00:44:13.471 --> 00:44:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1505
00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Understood or appreciated.</v>

1506
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1507
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:18.820
<v Speaker 1>And I think our ancestors probably did understand,</v>

1508
00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:19.990
<v Speaker 1>they did understand it.</v>

1509
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:20.640
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1510
00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1511
00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:24.730
<v Speaker 3>the focus on the back then there was all that.</v>

1512
00:44:24.731 --> 00:44:25.660
<v Speaker 3>What were you wearing?</v>

1513
00:44:25.661 --> 00:44:25.781
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1514
00:44:25.781 --> 00:44:27.280
<v Speaker 3>what did you think was going to happen?</v>

1515
00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:28.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was really,</v>

1516
00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:29.613
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1517
00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:31.201

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:52.250

1534
00:44:52.351 --> 00:44:53.460
<v Speaker 8>shit they did with chicks.</v>

1535

1566
00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:35.423
<v Speaker 8>Jesus Christ.</v>

1567

1594
00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:25.510
<v Speaker 4>worried about saying that.</v>

1595
00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.273
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1599
00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:36.740
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

1600

<v Speaker 4>A lot of like,</v>

1601
00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:38.320
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1602
00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.260
<v Speaker 4>like homosexuality.</v>

1603
00:46:39.261 --> 00:46:43.070
<v Speaker 4>So kept down there like maybe they're just guys that are fucking,</v>

1604
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:43.701
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1605
00:46:43.701 --> 00:46:44.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's what it is.</v>

1606
00:46:44.691 --> 00:46:45.441
<v Speaker 4>Sitting in a cave.</v>

1607
00:46:45.441 --> 00:46:45.621
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1608
00:46:45.621 --> 00:46:45.781
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

00:46:45.781 --> 00:46:46.611
<v Speaker 4>when I call blow,</v>

00:46:46.611 --> 00:46:47.241
<v Speaker 4>you and the guys are like,</v>

00:46:47.541 --> 00:46:47.820
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

1613
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:48.070
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1614
00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:48.441
<v Speaker 4>blow up.</v>

1615
00:46:48.441 --> 00:46:49.310
<v Speaker 4>Let's go blow each other up.</v>

1616
00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:50.361
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1617
00:46:50.361 --> 00:46:51.194
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1618
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:53.660
<v Speaker 4>I had Jeff Novitsky on the guy who busted him.</v>

1619
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:55.743
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1620
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:57.560
<v Speaker 4>after he was on,</v>

1621
00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:58.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1622
00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:00.720
<v Speaker 4>lance contacted me and a,</v>

1623
00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:03.400
<v Speaker 4>I had a conversation with him on the phone and he lands,</v>

1624
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.530
<v Speaker 4>he may or may not do the podcast because he wants to tell his story.</v>

1625
00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:09.730
<v Speaker 12>By and large people can have the perspective that you have.</v>

1626
00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:10.301
<v Speaker 12>They can say,</v>

1627
00:47:10.301 --> 00:47:10.560
<v Speaker 12>look,</v>

1628
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.040
<v Speaker 12>it looks to me like everybody did it.</v>

1629
00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.150
<v Speaker 12>So,</v>

1630
00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:13.983
<v Speaker 12>okay.</v>

1631
00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:14.980
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>

1632
00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.510
<v Speaker 12>then they can look to the line and they,</v>

1633
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.160
<v Speaker 12>that's where they really start to not like it.</v>

1634
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:20.470
<v Speaker 12>They say this guy lied to us repeatedly,</v>

1635
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.340
<v Speaker 12>but of course you get,</v>

1636
00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:21.761
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1637
00:47:21.761 --> 00:47:22.120
<v Speaker 12>my,</v>

1638
00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.200
<v Speaker 12>there's no defense to that.</v>

1639
00:47:23.201 --> 00:47:24.034
<v Speaker 12>But if I could,</v>

1640
00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:26.650
<v Speaker 12>if I could share any personal insight,</v>

1641
00:47:26.651 --> 00:47:26.831
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

1642
00:47:26.831 --> 00:47:27.401
<v Speaker 12>once you lie,</v>

1643
00:47:27.401 --> 00:47:31.180
<v Speaker 12>once you just lying and keep listening as if I'm going to sit here,</v>

1644
00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:31.890
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1645
00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:33.730
<v Speaker 12>this is 15 years ago and Joe,</v>

1646
00:47:33.731 --> 00:47:35.470
<v Speaker 12>you're a nice guy and you,</v>

1647
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:35.891
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

1648
00:47:35.891 --> 00:47:37.030
<v Speaker 12>if I was on this podcast,</v>

1649
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:40.540
<v Speaker 12>I would have lied to your fucking face a million times.</v>

1650
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.733
<v Speaker 12>Just so you know,</v>

1651
00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.760
<v Speaker 12>I would have just show you now,</v>

1652
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.633
<v Speaker 12>just so you know,</v>

1653
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.220
<v Speaker 12>that's not a surprise to you or anybody else,</v>

1654
00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.440
<v Speaker 12>but once you're in there,</v>

1655
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:51.281
<v Speaker 12>it's not as if I'm going to go,</v>

1656
00:47:51.281 --> 00:47:51.521
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1657
00:47:51.521 --> 00:47:51.791
<v Speaker 12>this,</v>

1658
00:47:51.791 --> 00:47:53.530
<v Speaker 12>this guy Joe seems like a really nice guy.</v>

1659
00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:54.311
<v Speaker 12>I think I'm going to be real.</v>

1660
00:47:54.311 --> 00:47:55.300
<v Speaker 12>I'm going to be honest with him.</v>

1661
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:56.530
<v Speaker 12>Too much money.</v>

1662
00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:57.520
<v Speaker 12>There's no way you can't.</v>

1663
00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:58.210
<v Speaker 12>One second.</v>

1664
00:47:58.210 --> 00:47:58.421
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

1665
00:47:58.421 --> 00:47:59.140
<v Speaker 12>So I was,</v>

1666
00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:00.130
<v Speaker 12>I was stuck,</v>

1667
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:02.230
<v Speaker 12>for lack of a better word in that,</v>

1668
00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:02.850
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

1669
00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:04.900
<v Speaker 12>in that does that lie or that deception?</v>

1670
00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:08.770
<v Speaker 12>But then the way that I took my competitive nature,</v>

1671
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:13.150
<v Speaker 12>which served me well in training and in racing and took it into the real world,</v>

1672
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:14.650
<v Speaker 12>took it into a press conference,</v>

1673
00:48:14.651 --> 00:48:16.240
<v Speaker 12>took it into a personal relationship,</v>

1674
00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:18.160
<v Speaker 12>took it into former teammates.</v>

1675
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.610
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>

1676
00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:20.080
<v Speaker 12>my relationship with that,</v>

1677
00:48:20.081 --> 00:48:20.260
<v Speaker 12>what,</v>

1678
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.550
<v Speaker 12>that's the part where people go,</v>

1679
00:48:21.551 --> 00:48:22.384
<v Speaker 12>okay,</v>

1680
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.590
<v Speaker 12>fuck this guy forever.</v>

1681
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.430
<v Speaker 12>Right.</v>

1682
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:25.090
<v Speaker 12>I'm done.</v>

1683
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:25.923
<v Speaker 12>And so,</v>

1684
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.010
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1685
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:27.843
<v Speaker 12>that,</v>

1686
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:28.631
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1687
00:48:28.631 --> 00:48:30.340
<v Speaker 12>you've got sort of three phases.</v>

1688
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.390
<v Speaker 12>None of them are good,</v>

1689
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:32.890
<v Speaker 12>but as it got further away,</v>

1690
00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:34.383
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1691
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:35.343
<v Speaker 12>that,</v>

1692
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:36.213
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1693
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:36.580
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

1694
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:40.120
<v Speaker 12>lack of respect for others is the thing that totally fucked me.</v>

1695
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:41.800
<v Speaker 12>And you know,</v>

1696
00:48:41.801 --> 00:48:41.981
<v Speaker 12>too,</v>

1697
00:48:41.981 --> 00:48:43.480
<v Speaker 12>that I would,</v>

1698
00:48:43.481 --> 00:48:46.230
<v Speaker 12>I would say to anybody that I understand and,</v>

1699
00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:46.510
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

1700
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:48.400
<v Speaker 12>I may be in their timeout forever.</v>

1701
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:49.990
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>

1702
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.823
<v Speaker 12>I have,</v>

1703
00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:51.350
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

1704
00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:52.760
<v Speaker 12>and the only thing I will add that,</v>

1705
00:48:52.761 --> 00:48:53.100
<v Speaker 12>that,</v>

1706
00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.740
<v Speaker 12>that may sound like I'm trying to defend myself as I've,</v>

1707
00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.840
<v Speaker 12>I've tried to make amends with all those people.</v>

1708
00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:06.580
<v Speaker 13>[inaudible]</v>

1709
00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:08.740
<v Speaker 13>okay.</v>
