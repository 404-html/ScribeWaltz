00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.920
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to quash sex because the and,</v>

3
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>and gluttony because those are reminders that were just primates for meanwhile</v>

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.620
<v Speaker 1>the depictions of God,</v>

5
00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>he's always ripped.</v>

6
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.773
<v Speaker 1>He's always,</v>

7
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>he's always wearing a robe cause he's modest.</v>

8
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.370
<v Speaker 1>He's reaching over and touching people.</v>

9
00:00:18.371 --> 00:00:19.001
<v Speaker 1>His fingers go,</v>

10
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.890
<v Speaker 1>he's got giant traps and what's great,</v>

11
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.820
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

12
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.380
<v Speaker 1>God looks awesome as his son.</v>

13
00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:25.930
<v Speaker 1>It sounds looking sons on great on the Cross,</v>

14
00:00:25.931 --> 00:00:30.931
<v Speaker 1>beaten to death half and he's got abs and really watch for a guy who was for a</v>

15
00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

16
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.310
<v Speaker 1>was living in the Middle East 2000 years ago,</v>

17
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.630
<v Speaker 1>but skin bronze,</v>

18
00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 1>hair of wool bullshit.</v>

19
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.140
<v Speaker 1>They uh,</v>

20
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 1>the other possibility of a black planet,</v>

21
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Chuck d was right.</v>

22
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Degas that look at that.</v>

23
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>But God beautiful.</v>

24
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>The dude on the left hind a little dot on the dude.</v>

25
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.793
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

26
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Not even,</v>

27
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

28
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:49.774
<v Speaker 1>why even draw it?</v>

29
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.940
<v Speaker 1>You might as well just make him an alien with no genitals.</v>

30
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 1>People back then just had little or dicks.</v>

31
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.993
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

32
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.411
<v Speaker 1>It's possible,</v>

33
00:00:56.411 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>but I've always just assumed that that it's the modesty of the artists like it.</v>

34
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>It kind of changed the frame of the picture of God reaching down and touching</v>

35
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:05.710
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

36
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Speaker 1>If men had a massive schlong just hanging down his leg.</v>

37
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

38
00:01:08.981 --> 00:01:11.980
<v Speaker 1>it would be distracting if you're just giant John Holmes hard,</v>

39
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>but look how big the muscles are in these guys.</v>

40
00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:20.131
<v Speaker 1>Like these guys have to be fucking crossfitting all day as well as being divine.</v>

41
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

42
00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:23.990
<v Speaker 1>that guy on the left is doing a lot of fucking weightlifting.</v>

43
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.480
<v Speaker 1>There is not a regular body that's a body of someone who's picking up heavy shit</v>

44
00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>all day long,</v>

45
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.310
<v Speaker 1>but he's got a skinny neck.</v>

46
00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I bet he's never been choked.</v>

47
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.433
<v Speaker 1>Maybes and act.</v>

48
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.920
<v Speaker 1>That's not a guy who knows how to cut out of a choke.</v>

49
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.080
<v Speaker 1>No Little Dick Skinny neck,</v>

50
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.090
<v Speaker 1>but giant fucking biceps.</v>

51
00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Leave his forearms.</v>

52
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.003
<v Speaker 1>It does a lot of,</v>

53
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of weightlifting for sure.</v>

54
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo's ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and look at the bizarre image of</v>

55
00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>God being supported by Cherubs.</v>

56
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>How weird people are religion it.</v>

57
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:53.950
<v Speaker 1>See got Dick though.</v>

58
00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Notice that.</v>

59
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>

60
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.630
<v Speaker 1>he's got a robot and then other dummy showing his little tiny dick.</v>

61
00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.800
<v Speaker 1>God looks kind of,</v>

62
00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really noticed this before,</v>

63
00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:04.480
<v Speaker 1>but God on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel looks a bit like Meryl Streep,</v>

64
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Meryl Streep with a bead cause I think he's kind of got breasts and he's,</v>

65
00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:16.210
<v Speaker 1>he's wearing like a nice white robe</v>

66
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.081
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

67
00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:18.370
<v Speaker 2>It's to a guy like you,</v>

68
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Google auto drive cars have to be the devil.</v>

69
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

70
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.720
<v Speaker 2>That's the devil.</v>

71
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.553
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

72
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen?</v>

73
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to,</v>

74
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 2>we're going to not be able to drive our own cars in the future.</v>

75
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Is that a possibility?</v>

76
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.751
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

77
00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:32.570
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking long and hard about that and it's been something that um,</v>

78
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.640
<v Speaker 2>different people and um,</v>

79
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.820
<v Speaker 2>my sub culture have openly been concerned and discussing and there's many</v>

80
00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:40.840
<v Speaker 2>different takes on it.</v>

81
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.150
<v Speaker 2>But I think I'm pretty centered on it.</v>

82
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 2>I think actually it's a positive thing and that Carl is like the Prius and</v>

83
00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:48.550
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

84
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Speaker 2>started the generation where people don't have an emotional relationship with</v>

86
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:53.771
<v Speaker 2>their vehicle.</v>

87
00:02:53.771 --> 00:02:54.371
<v Speaker 2>It's a tool.</v>

88
00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:56.710
<v Speaker 2>It's literally like an APP on your phone.</v>

89
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 2>It gets you from a to B or even more dispassionately,</v>

90
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.121
<v Speaker 2>screw it.</v>

91
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 2>You Uber around and you don't care.</v>

92
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 2>You don't have that relationship.</v>

93
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 2>So I think culturally as autonomous vehicles and all that continued to grow and</v>

94
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:10.001
<v Speaker 2>evolve,</v>

95
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.590
<v Speaker 2>you are going to see them eventually become predominant and I think we're going</v>

96
00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:18.591
<v Speaker 2>to start to see lobbying and federal support of that direction because there's a</v>

97
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 2>lot of rational reasons behind it.</v>

98
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 2>That being said,</v>

99
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 2>I think it will further strengthen the demand for the freaks and the Geeks,</v>

100
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.940
<v Speaker 2>the outliers such as my brand because people are going to yearn for that</v>

101
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.961
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

102
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:35.794
<v Speaker 2>that attachment,</v>

103
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's always going to be people,</v>

104
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:41.120
<v Speaker 2>even the guy who's got the autonomous Mercedes at that,</v>

105
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.741
<v Speaker 2>his computer,</v>

106
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 2>but on the week it's like,</v>

107
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.031
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

108
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean this thing's got a,</v>

109
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 2>it's called a manual transmission and there's,</v>

110
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

111
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 2>there's pedals by the way,</v>

112
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 2>and there's three of those pedals and you have to push that one down to get it</v>

113
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.070
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

114
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

115
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.051
<v Speaker 2>I think there,</v>

116
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:58.051
<v Speaker 2>there's that visceral relationship that is always going to be part of mankind</v>

117
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not worried about it.</v>

118
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 2>If I was trying to start a big car company,</v>

119
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 2>then I would be worried about it.</v>

120
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.640
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

121
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 2>this is difficult thought and is a difficult subject,</v>

122
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 2>but did you,</v>

123
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.300
<v Speaker 2>after this was all said and done a horrendous moment in your life,</v>

124
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.710
<v Speaker 2>many moments in your life,</v>

125
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 2>did you try to figure out what would create a person like the guy who did that</v>

126
00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:24.920
<v Speaker 2>to you?</v>

127
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.870
<v Speaker 2>Did you try how much time?</v>

128
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

129
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.910
<v Speaker 2>and I can tell you what created him.</v>

130
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.130
<v Speaker 2>He was taken out of an abusive home.</v>

131
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 2>He was put into foster care and abused many more times and he was gone and he</v>

132
00:04:38.091 --> 00:04:43.091
<v Speaker 2>was gone and it was gone and he was succumbed by the agony I was put through by</v>

133
00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:44.540
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

134
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.470
<v Speaker 2>I survived.</v>

135
00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Somehow I made it so call me lucky.</v>

136
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.071
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

137
00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I didn't become him.</v>

138
00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:51.590
<v Speaker 2>I didn't become what I resisted.</v>

139
00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:52.424
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

140
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.260
<v Speaker 2>I didn't pass along the poison.</v>

141
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I did in some ways when I was difficult or whatever,</v>

142
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.240
<v Speaker 2>but mostly I didn't.</v>

143
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.710
<v Speaker 2>Mostly when I'm mad,</v>

144
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm mad because it's like Hendrix,</v>

145
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.010
<v Speaker 2>a cry of love.</v>

146
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a cry of love that I make.</v>

147
00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:06.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a cry of love.</v>

148
00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:08.210
<v Speaker 2>My Act has been a cry of love.</v>

149
00:05:08.211 --> 00:05:11.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't want the innocent hurt anymore.</v>

150
00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:16.451
<v Speaker 2>I don't want people victimized because of greed and cower to some bullshit,</v>

151
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.091
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

152
00:05:17.091 --> 00:05:18.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that.</v>

153
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.941
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

154
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:21.500
<v Speaker 2>I do what I can to stand up to it to,</v>

155
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.960
<v Speaker 2>were there moments where you wanted to talk to him?</v>

156
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.850
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to talk to him?</v>

157
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.890
<v Speaker 2>I would love to talk to him to show him that I'd been,</v>

158
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.630
<v Speaker 2>didn't become a monster like he was.</v>

159
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.130
<v Speaker 2>I W I would have,</v>

160
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I would have almost become an advocate for him in the sense that like,</v>

161
00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:35.250
<v Speaker 2>well mate,</v>

162
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.220
<v Speaker 2>you let me know if they're mistreating you in here.</v>

163
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.780
<v Speaker 2>But he died in prison.</v>

164
00:05:38.781 --> 00:05:41.480
<v Speaker 2>No one claimed his body and I don't know where his grave is.</v>

165
00:05:41.481 --> 00:05:42.291
<v Speaker 2>If I knew her as grave,</v>

166
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:43.820
<v Speaker 2>it was like go put fucking flowers on it.</v>

167
00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Not for him.</v>

168
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.353
<v Speaker 2>For me.</v>

169
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.540
<v Speaker 2>So the Solomon asch conformity study was framed to people coming into it as a</v>

170
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:54.120
<v Speaker 2>visual perception experiment.</v>

171
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.111
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

172
00:05:55.111 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 2>they'd be brought into a room with several people in a semi circle</v>

173
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.910
<v Speaker 3>and there'll be a person in the front with a card with four lines on it,</v>

174
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 3>a sample line,</v>

175
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 3>and then three other lines of different sizes.</v>

176
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.731
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

177
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 3>let's say a three and simple line,</v>

178
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 3>a three inch or four inch and a five inch,</v>

179
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.350
<v Speaker 3>but everyone is in on the experiment except the person and seat six and after</v>

180
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 3>going around twice giving the correct answer,</v>

181
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 3>everyone confidently starts giving the wrong same answer.</v>

182
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.250
<v Speaker 3>And the test is how many people will start to conform to giving the wrong</v>

183
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 3>answer,</v>

184
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 3>even though they can see what their own eyes,</v>

185
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 3>what the correct answer is.</v>

186
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.140
<v Speaker 3>And that study's been replicated thousands of times and the answer is two thirds</v>

187
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:49.421
<v Speaker 3>start giving the wrong answer even though they know intellectually that it's the</v>

188
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:54.590
<v Speaker 3>wrong answer because it feels too uncomfortable to be in the room.</v>

189
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 3>And is that the,</v>

190
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.810
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

191
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.670
<v Speaker 3>the testimony that they give when they are asked,</v>

192
00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.330
<v Speaker 3>what did they,</v>

193
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure assuming the interview these people absolutely.</v>

194
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

195
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 3>I say it's uncomfortable and I even show a date line and old dateline episode</v>

196
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 3>where they asked Anthony Pratt,</v>

197
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 3>Kansas is one of the foremost social psychologists to to actually do the study</v>

198
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 3>so they could film it and this,</v>

199
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.010
<v Speaker 3>they start out with this Asian woman who is the her role at resistor who gives</v>

200
00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 3>the correct answer but she's grimacing and she's giving the wrong answer even</v>

201
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 3>though she knows it's the right answer.</v>

202
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 3>But because of the social forces we are have mirror neurons,</v>

203
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 3>we want to fit in to the people in the room.</v>

204
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:35.270
<v Speaker 3>It's just human nature.</v>

205
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.810
<v Speaker 3>How people survive.</v>

206
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

207
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Clan behave.</v>

208
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.071
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

209
00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:41.330
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard wired.</v>

210
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:46.331
<v Speaker 3>So I showed that video that that experiment and I always like to ask people,</v>

211
00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:47.880
<v Speaker 3>so tell me a,</v>

212
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.850
<v Speaker 3>something you could do if you were in that situation to scientifically reality</v>

213
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:55.370
<v Speaker 3>test that situation.</v>

214
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.000
<v Speaker 3>Scientifically reality testing meaning meaning one,</v>

215
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 3>you're in this room.</v>

216
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's saying a five inch line is a three inch line.</v>

217
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:05.240
<v Speaker 3>What could you do?</v>

218
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.021
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you,</v>

219
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:06.621
<v Speaker 3>what would you do?</v>

220
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Because you have the data now.</v>

221
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:08.931
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

222
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:09.181
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

223
00:08:09.181 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 3>you're a cult expert.</v>

224
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 3>You would get up and measure it.</v>

225
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

226
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.170
<v Speaker 3>But you would have obviously understand what's going on.</v>

227
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

228
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.551
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

229
00:08:16.551 --> 00:08:21.551
<v Speaker 3>But if you asked me prior to my induction into the moonies that I understand the</v>

230
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 3>asch conformity study or the power of B,</v>

231
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.011
<v Speaker 3>I would have said,</v>

232
00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:25.251
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

233
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm an individual.</v>

234
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm a nonconformist.</v>

235
00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 3>I had the bumper sticker question authority,</v>

236
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 3>and I had the pony tail.</v>

237
00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:35.830
<v Speaker 3>And you know the word unique</v>

238
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 3>fit right in you rebel</v>

239
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.120
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>
