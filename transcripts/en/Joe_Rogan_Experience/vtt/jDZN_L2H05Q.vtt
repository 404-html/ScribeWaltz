1
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.510
All
right.

2
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.333
<v 1>Well good.</v>

3
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.233
<v 0>Yes.</v>

4
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.240
<v 1>Back from the mother fucking jungle.
Justin rand.</v>

5
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:37.990
Savan pygmies hanging out,
having a good time.
It's not brother.
Alright man,

6
00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:39.790
I'm excited to be here and excited to have you.

7
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.200
I've been paying attention to your crazy travels and your journeys and you

8
00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:47.080
brought some pictures and videos for us today to,

9
00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:50.980
and how long have you been back for?
I've been back since,
uh,
late October.

10
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.810
And you were,
you were here for you.

11
00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:55.210
We're here for a little while and the last time you were supposed to be here you

12
00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:57.880
were real sick.
And I gotta be honest with you.

13
00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:02.881
We weren't too excited about a dude fresh back from Africa common and with some

14
00:01:03.221 --> 00:01:07.240
sort of funky jungle virus.
Yeah.
Well I'm glad I didn't come in.

15
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.420
What did you have?
Did you have anything crazy?
What had bronchitis and then,
um,

16
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.450
but before that had Shigella,
which is a intestinal bacteria I don't like,

17
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.220
is that he get that,
uh,
it's a waterborne disease.
Waterborne.

18
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.640
So you turn the corner up there.
Yeah,

19
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.610
there was just times that I couldn't help it,
but uh,
yeah.

20
00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:28.320
Or it could be from food or a fly landing on your food while it's been cooked or

21
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.910
oh,
there's many different ways that you can get it.
Whoa.

22
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.880
So you either leave live your life like the boy in the plastic bubble.

23
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.890
Remember that John Travolta movie?
I think that's the only way.

24
00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:39.220
You can't get sick.
How many times you've gotten sick over there.
Uh,

25
00:01:39.221 --> 00:01:42.070
all throughout.
All throughout.
You're always sick.
Yeah.
Yeah.

26
00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:47.071
I had this guy on the Scifi show that I did who told me that everyone who lives

27
00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:51.520
in South American or,
um,
jungle climate,

28
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.990
everyone has parasites.
Oh yeah.
They just live with them.
Yeah.
I had them too.
Uh,

29
00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:58.120
I got,
I had Amoebas,

30
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.180
some kind of parasite and my stomach also.

31
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.250
I'm actually still a bruise from here cause I've got seven vials of blood drawn

32
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:10.000
to see what kind of parasites are still in me still recently.
Yeah.
Yeah.

33
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:14.650
That's just a few days old.
Yeah.
So it's,
it's been a battle since coming back.

34
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.120
Um,
but I think I'm getting,
I'm on the track to get my health back together.

35
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.460
So crazy place to,
to live,
to spend your time.

36
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.500
It's a,
it's a very strange thing.
This,
uh,

37
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.690
the environment where you have like all these crazy tropical diseases.

38
00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:35.380
Is it the heat and the moisture and all of the above and,
yeah,

39
00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:37.930
I think it's just the entire environment.
It's a,

40
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.610
it's just brutal because right when I got there I got malaria and so that was

41
00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:46.750
pretty bad.
Um,
so the mosquitoes,
the bugs,
the parasites,

42
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.340
everything can come mess with Ya.
Um,
yeah.
So the,
the water,

43
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.160
the climate,
the bad living conditions.
So I mean not having uh,

44
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.270
a nice bed and not having a good to sleep and um,

45
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.520
all those can contribute to what's a sickness.
Malaria is no joke.
Huh?

46
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.340
What was that like?
Oh man,
that was brutal.
That was uh,

47
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.530
one of the toughest times of my life.
But um,
I counted it as,

48
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.970
I dunno,
it was actually a good experience for me in the end because I got to,

49
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.130
to sharing the suffering that they're going through.

50
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.610
Cause cause they don't even have all the antibiotics and are all the medicine to

51
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:24.040
pump your body with to get healed from it.

52
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.400
So I had to be evolved out of the Congo and until you've gone to,

53
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.940
I was misdiagnosed for times.
So they drew my blood,

54
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.800
they did two quick test for malaria and they said it was negative.

55
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.360
Then they drew my blood,
said it was negative,
but a,
I got real sick,
real sick,

56
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:44.400
like six days.
I couldn't eat six days,
I couldn't urinate.
Um,

57
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.130
I think I lost 34 pounds.
Um,

58
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.640
and then whenever I finally did urinate and Uganda is after I got the right

59
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.640
medicine and they saw,
they took my blood out,
saw that had over 70,

60
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.690
70% of my bloodstream was parasites.
Why us?

61
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.650
70% of my,
my blood was,
was full of parasites.

62
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.860
They would hide in the liver and then they would distribute through your blood.

63
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.450
Whoa.
That's crazy.
Like you're invaded.
Yeah,

64
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:14.680
absolutely.
70% of your blood was parasites.

65
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.420
That,
am I getting that wrong?
Or 70% was infected with parasites set.

66
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.870
They said 70% of my bloodstream.
So they said between 60 and 70%.

67
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:25.900
So I was on the third tier,
like there's level one,

68
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:30.250
two and three and four and four.
I was right at right at four,
which was a coma.

69
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.320
So,
um,
when you get the,
for you,
you're in a coma and you,
it's,
it's pretty bad.

70
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:36.190
A lot of people die.
Well,

71
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:40.570
lucky or a strapping healthy young buck of a man that you got through that,
huh?

72
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.990
Yeah,
absolutely.
Man.
It was,
it was really good.
Like,
um,
I mean,

73
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.250
the pilot that flew me out,

74
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.200
it was actually on Thanksgiving of 2013 and he flew me out,
uh,

75
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:53.750
just me and him on the plane and he found out that they're misdiagnosing me,

76
00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:56.290
that,
that my,
my buddy there was like,

77
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.270
the doctors don't know what's going on with him.

78
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.790
He's going to die if we don't get them out of here to a good hospital.

79
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.040
So they took me out of the jungle,
flew me to Uganda,

80
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.090
and when I landed and the ambulance came and picked me up because my vomit had

81
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:11.200
turned to blood and bile.
So it was literally,
I could smell,
you know,

82
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:15.490
like in the fight game,
you can smell the blood.
So a,
I could smell the iron,

83
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.520
I think in my blood.
And it was really,
it was literally Christmas colors,

84
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.600
red and green.

85
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.010
And it was brutal for two weeks after my esophagus was raw.

86
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.860
And so I could barely,
barely eaten much.
I mean,

87
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:30.880
I'd really have to chew it down a lot or it has to just drink a lot.
Um,

88
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.140
and so yeah,
replenishing my body after that was a whole,
I mean,

89
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:38.030
I think it's still happening,
but,
uh,
it was at least a month long process to,

90
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.620
to start putting weight back on.
See,
it's still happening from over a year ago.

91
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.060
Your body's still replenishing well from that and from some of the parasites and

92
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:48.580
everything else.
So yeah.
But the malaria,

93
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.100
I guess there's mixed reviews,

94
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.910
but a lot of times they say that the malaria never literally leaves your body

95
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:58.250
100%.
So it's,
it's it dormant in your

96
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.600
<v 2>liver and then it can come back up whenever stress and other things happen.
So,</v>

97
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.060
um,
wow.
So we're getting that tested.

98
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.730
That's one of the things we're testing for me so we can come back up.

99
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:09.110
Like say if you get run down,

100
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:11.570
like maybe if you get the flu or something like that,
malaria might go,

101
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.290
yeah,
that'd be brutal.
Cause my,

102
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.320
my fever got to like almost one oh five it was like one oh four one oh 4.5 or

103
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:25.330
1.41617 or something like that.

104
00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:28.760
Like one 10 they were saying it was getting high enough to where like they

105
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:32.720
really had to watch me because of a cause.
It can do stuff to your brain,

106
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.980
your heart,
your brain gets too hot.
Right.
Parasites are terrifying,
man.

107
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.570
Don't ever watch that show you ever seen that show the enemy within,

108
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.860
what's it called?
The enemy within you are enemy inside you.

109
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.810
It's all about people who do what you do.
Go,

110
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.610
go to some place and get some crazy parasite.

111
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:50.900
And then they have like some softball size ball of worms living in your brain,

112
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.670
you know?
And they're like,
oh I have headaches.

113
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:55.640
I started seeing Jesus and the angels floating around me.

114
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:56.780
I couldn't figure out what it was.

115
00:06:56.781 --> 00:07:00.950
And then I went to the doctor and they found this mass inside my brain.
And

116
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.990
I probably won't watch that.
Joan,
will you,
you'd live it.
I mean,

117
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:07.700
you don't have to watch it.
You live it.

118
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.080
We've got plenty of coconut water for you,
my friend.
If she wants them,

119
00:07:10.081 --> 00:07:13.040
we got to see two.
Oh,
you ever have that shit?
No.
C Two o is the bomb.

120
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:15.440
Diggity get the man of Qantas.
E Two o.
All right,
thank you.

121
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:18.520
[inaudible] from Thailand.
They're,
they're,
yeah,
they're coconut waters.

122
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.240
Like it's really sweet.
It's weird.
It's a short tree.

123
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:24.890
It's only like five feet tall and a,
you know,
you think of like the big tall,

124
00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:29.690
like palm trees.
It's being coconut trees,
but the tie trees or short and uh,

125
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.970
it's like a much sweeter.
You drink it,

126
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:34.580
you would swear that they have some sort of sugar in it,
but it's not,

127
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:39.350
it's totally natural to thank you.
It's delicious stuff.
Um,
but,

128
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.330
uh,
those parasites,

129
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.720
the thing about parasites is that it's really hard to root them out of your

130
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:51.080
system.
And some of them like trick a Gnosis I've found out recently,

131
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.250
my friend got trick and analysis and uh,
they said he's got essentially for life,

132
00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:56.750
like they give them pills.

133
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.760
It flushed like the active parasites out of his system.

134
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.560
But like say tricking houses comes from an animal eating an animal with chicken

135
00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:10.220
analysis.
So if somebody cannibalized him,
they would get trick analysis.
Wow.
Yeah.

136
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.950
To this day.
And he's walking around like a normal person,

137
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.950
but he's got trick analysis in his system essentially forever.

138
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.300
So that's like kind of how malaria is.
We,
I guess so like that's what,

139
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:22.850
that's what we're looking at.
By eight you I'd get malaria.
I hope not.

140
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.770
If you ain't my liver,
liver,
liver,
dude,
I'll tell you right now,
pretty confident.

141
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.930
Unless we're in some Donner parties type situation and you die first man,

142
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.910
it's,
it's,
it's nuts.
The,

143
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.210
the suffering that they're going through though with malaria is because they

144
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:41.210
don't have mosquito nets and all that other stuff.
So I was kind of a,

145
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.020
not cautious enough and the one thing I didn't want to do is take,
take uh,
uh,

146
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.760
malaria pill that would prevent malaria.
Um,
what's it called?

147
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:52.370
A prophylaxis or something like that,
something like that.
Um,

148
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.220
and so I didn't want to take that because a doctor here state

149
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.340
<v 1>side said that if I took some of them,
they really intense,
um,</v>

150
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.350
they can really hurt your body.
They also said that,
uh,
even mentally,
um,

151
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.800
taking them for a full year,

152
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.890
they could give you night terrors and terrible dreams,

153
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:12.120
but then also like people have a moments of psychosis from deacon on and stuff.

154
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.580
So I was like,
well,
I don't want to be dealing with that.

155
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:19.320
And if the guys in Congo said,
Oh yeah,
once you get malaria,
once,
um,

156
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.820
normally doesn't come back very bad.
And so all we have to do is,
oh,

157
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.850
we have to do it the next time.
The next time is much lower and much lower,

158
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:30.270
much lower.
And it's much more,
uh,
I don't know.
You can control it easier.

159
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.040
And so the thing that was the struggle with me,

160
00:09:33.041 --> 00:09:36.090
it was that they misdiagnosed at four different times and we took it to two

161
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:39.420
different labs.
Um,
and they just didn't have the,

162
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.640
I guess the right tools and technology to really see that because whenever I got

163
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:48.690
there were,
were flying and I'm hugging a bucket and they put me,

164
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.550
whenever they were putting me into the ambulance,

165
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.480
I remember my vision was tunneling and,

166
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.560
and all in front of me was completely,
uh,
I mean it's just blur.
It's just a blur.

167
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.200
And then,
um,
and when you say tattling,

168
00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:05.040
like could you actually see like the walls closing in?
Well,
not at first.

169
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:08.130
It was like I woke up one day and it was like all of a sudden my peripheral

170
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:11.550
vision was kind of blurry and that messed with me.
I was like,
what's going on?

171
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.390
Then all of a sudden started getting darker and so it didn't like start closing,

172
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.150
like if you're getting choked or something,
they didn't do that,

173
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:21.360
but it kind of stopped.
And I think it just prevented my peripheral vision from,

174
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.440
from really functioning or working.
Um,
and then the thing that sucks is,

175
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:30.470
is you get these crazy back and forth between shivering uncontrollably,

176
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:32.341
uncontrollably,

177
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:37.000
and your teeth chattering to then you all of a sudden just like on a diamond

178
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.880
switches and all of a sudden you're incredibly hot sweating and you're throwing

179
00:10:41.881 --> 00:10:45.090
everything off and you're grabbing a fan and it just goes back and forth.

180
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.180
It goes back and forth for maybe 30 minutes or something.
You're,

181
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:50.550
you're terribly cold then for 30 minutes here.

182
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.080
Terribly hot and incredibly thirsty,
but then you drink something,
you vomited up.

183
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.900
Um,
and so they were trying to force me to eat cause they're like,

184
00:10:57.901 --> 00:11:00.810
you don't have malaria.
You got to eat and everything I would eat,
I just vomit.

185
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.520
So don't have malaria.
You got to eat.
Yeah,
I had a,
I had,

186
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.400
I had one doctor there that,
uh,
they,

187
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.300
they couldn't agree with each other because they didn't know what was going on

188
00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:10.134
with me.

189
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:15.000
So the up and coming doctor and one of the young nurses said this guy has got

190
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:18.990
malaria 100%,
but the older ones were just going off of the results.

191
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.480
And they're like,
no,
look,
you're going to see the first test,

192
00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:24.600
second test or test or fourth test that says he doesn't have malaria.

193
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.280
And so there was some,

194
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:30.510
a humanitarian organization there and they had gotten this crazy,

195
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.560
I dunno,
virus or flu kind of thing.
And uh,

196
00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:36.840
there'd be sick for three or four days and then they get better,

197
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.860
but it went through all of them.
And so they thought that I had gotten that.

198
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.270
So they said just let them ride it out and he'll get better.
Um,

199
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.990
and then kind of the,

200
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:51.050
the head kind of doctor that was overseeing it came and I was in my room but she

201
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:55.600
wouldn't even enter into the room cause um,
she was looking at me through the,

202
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.390
through the screen door saying I'm not coming in there.

203
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.640
I'm not risking me getting sick with that.
But malaria,

204
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.680
you can't pass on like that.
It's gotta be from a mosquito.

205
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.940
Do you know that malaria has killed half of all the people that have ever died?

206
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.770
I had no clue.
No.
It's the nuttiest statistic I've ever heard in my life.

207
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:16.210
I had to re re research it and look it up and find corroborating sources.
Yeah,

208
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:20.320
it's killed.
Half of all the people that have ever died ever died from malaria.

209
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.950
I think there's a guy named that's nuts.
That's fucking nuts.
That's crazy.

210
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.630
But listening to your story,
it's not surprising.
No,
not at all.
Um,
yeah,

211
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:32.040
it's brutal.
I think even if you go back and look at Congolese history,
um,

212
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.940
James Jamison I think is his name,

213
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.290
but he's one of the Jamison guys that founded the whiskey in Ireland.
He went,

214
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.350
and this is the story,
I think it's been conflicting,

215
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:42.460
but it's been confirmed by some,

216
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.590
some sources there that were with them traveling.

217
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.300
And he went to some of the cannibalistic like villages there in Congo back in

218
00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:53.620
the day and the 18 hundreds.
And um,
he would actually,
that's crazy.

219
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.650
But he would buy some of the young kids and he would feed them to the cannibals

220
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.000
and he would,
he would do like art and stuff like that.
Um,
but yeah,

221
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.760
that's what they said about the Jamison guy.
The whiskey.

222
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.820
He would buy young kids from who from like slave villages and stuff like that.

223
00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.040
But that's,
that's a big past in Congo.

224
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.000
Is that a tribes of enslaved other tribes and things like that?
Yeah.

225
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.430
So they would buy,
you can buy people there.
That's,

226
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.880
that's what happened whenever we brought a pygmy over to,
to the United States,

227
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.750
put them in the New York Zoo.
Um,

228
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.580
he lived in the monkey house for a couple of years and uh,

229
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.910
but you can just brought by,
yeah,

230
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.280
the Bronx Zoo and then also the Saint Louis world's fair.

231
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.640
And he toured around with them for a little bit,
got depressed,

232
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.200
got a gun and shot himself.
So she got off the security guard I think.
But um,

233
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.540
but with the Jamison Guy,
he,
he,
he died and in Congo or Uganda from,
from malaria.

234
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:51.603
Well,

235
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.220
and that's been confirmed that he actually did that.

236
00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.520
They actually bought people and fed little kids to these cannibals.
Well,

237
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:05.110
it looks like it because I think it was Stanley,
I forget Stanley's first name.

238
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.190
I think he was the one that confirmed it.
Like they had a,

239
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.910
they would go in and they would have to have protection.

240
00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:11.190
So they would get some of the,

241
00:14:11.191 --> 00:14:15.250
the warrior tribes there to protect themselves and then they would,
uh,
yeah,

242
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.600
in his downtime,
that's,

243
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.170
that's he was an artist or something that would paint pictures and stuff like

244
00:14:20.171 --> 00:14:20.321
that.

245
00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:23.890
So we put up pictures of suffering and then I'm pretty sure it happened at least

246
00:14:23.891 --> 00:14:26.890
once I,
I mean maybe that's something that the listeners can go,

247
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.890
you'll look up or Google,
but I'm pretty sure it's a,
it's confirmed.

248
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.990
So are they relate,
I mean,
did the art,

249
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.030
was it related to the children being eaten?
Like draw art about that?

250
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.120
Yeah,
I think,
I think there's one confirmed story,

251
00:14:39.121 --> 00:14:43.630
so I don't know that he did at a time,
but I know he did it once,
which is awful.

252
00:14:43.631 --> 00:14:47.320
Terrible.
You know,
it's crazy.
Wow.
You know,

253
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.990
that's the weirdest thing about people's,
how,

254
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.710
how much they vary and how adaptable people are.
You know,
the people,

255
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:56.620
when they are involved,
when they're in,

256
00:14:56.621 --> 00:15:00.350
in an environment where horrible things are going on,
they do horrible things.

257
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:04.760
Like people who've gone to war and if talked about horrific things that they've

258
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:08.960
witnessed and how it became normal and maybe it became a part of them and they,

259
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.610
they get contributed and they became a part of like these horrific war crimes,

260
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.910
like like riots.
Perfect example.

261
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.410
When people riot [inaudible] you take a person who would never throw a Molotov

262
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:26.000
cocktail or break a window or or stomp a cop to death or whatever,

263
00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:30.110
but you get them involved in a group of 10,000 people that are doing the same

264
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:32.090
thing and it's almost like it's in the air.
It's like,

265
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.690
it's like people get infected by whatever's around them.

266
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:40.610
They sorta imitate their atmosphere and Congo and Uganda,
us all at once,

267
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.180
but they have something called mob justice.
And so that's a crazy thing,

268
00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:46.820
kind of like with riots where if something happens,

269
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.500
someone just has to accuse somebody and then everyone comes in and in some cases

270
00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:56.420
it's okay because if a thief is there and the Yelfie if then the whole community

271
00:15:56.421 --> 00:15:58.460
surrounds a thief.
But the,
the,

272
00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.390
the danger happens whenever someone wants to take justice into their own hands

273
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.000
in a sef,
turning that fif over to the authorities.

274
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.150
What they do is they beat him and kill him.
So me and my buddy Benjamin,

275
00:16:08.151 --> 00:16:11.990
he's my translator.
We're walking down a center street of uh,

276
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.230
like basically main street,
one of these,
these big towns called Buena.

277
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.740
And in Booney they'd have a big,
uh,

278
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.980
past for lots of different struggles.
And even like,

279
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.160
I think a smaller kind of genocides,
well,
I say smaller,

280
00:16:25.161 --> 00:16:28.250
but I think 50,000 people were killed there just in that one town,

281
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.790
50,000 people killed by different rebel groups,
machetes,

282
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:33.650
all this different stuff.
Um,

283
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.410
but we were walking down the street and someone yelled,

284
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:39.320
thief and nobody even confirmed it.
They grabbed the guy,

285
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.950
started beating him and then whenever we got up there,
bins grabbed me.
Say,

286
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:46.790
you don't want to be around this cause I'm,
I'm the only outsider there.
And so,

287
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:49.460
but at first my instant was like an instinct.

288
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.190
I didn't know that they were saying thief,
thief.
My instinct was like,

289
00:16:52.191 --> 00:16:53.720
there's 30 guys pounded on this guy.

290
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.440
Like someone's got to give this guy some rooms,
give them some space.

291
00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.670
He's grabbing my shirt,
pulling me.
And uh,
and so anyways,

292
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.440
whenever we went back and saw him,

293
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:06.260
his body was just twisted up and he's bent up in a,

294
00:17:06.261 --> 00:17:10.220
in basically a ditch and then yeah,
they just beat him to death.
Yeah.

295
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:12.680
There's a lot of that for witchcraft too,
right?
They,

296
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.380
they accuse people of being witches and burn them alive.

297
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.850
That's a big problem with the orphans in,

298
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.770
in the Congo is that if they get accused of witchcraft,

299
00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:26.480
they just excommunicate them from their family.
She so nice.
Yeah.
Well,

300
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:27.980
education man.
Right?

301
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:33.010
It's like these people have these ancient ideas that are based on just one

302
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.870
person who's ignorant telling another person is ignorant and becomes doctrine

303
00:17:38.871 --> 00:17:42.200
and they just pass it down through generation and generation and they really

304
00:17:42.201 --> 00:17:45.690
believe in witchcraft.
They have a real issue with albinos too.

305
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.580
They think that Albinos like that they're cursed or something like that or,
yeah.

306
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:55.590
Kirsten.
Then if you can kill,
Cook and eat an albino guy,
uh,
this is in Tanzania,

307
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.900
then I know that I can confirm this,
that,
um,
they'll,

308
00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:03.090
if they can consume the flesh of an Albino,
then it can cure them of HIV,

309
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.110
tuberculosis.
Uh,
I dunno,

310
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.870
some other sicknesses to fuck.
That's crazy.
And that's,
that's with the pygmies.

311
00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:17.310
While were there celebrating our first water,
well that we accomplished there.
Um,

312
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:21.150
some of the government officials came and said that this is the first ever,
uh,

313
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.800
clean water source among the pygmy people,
the more booties pygmies in,

314
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.840
in eastern Congo because the pygmies in or in many different countries,

315
00:18:27.841 --> 00:18:32.550
but in there that country,
this is the first water source for them.
And so,

316
00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:37.290
but on that day,
a rebel leader named Morgan of the,

317
00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:40.630
my my,
it's a terrible rebel group there.
Um,

318
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:44.820
they had been confirmed in 2012,
uh,
of,
of killing,

319
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.790
cooking and eating pygmies thinking that it makes them invincible going into

320
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:49.920
battle.
But while we were there celebrating,

321
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.790
all of a sudden all the Congolese army,
uh,
is driving by us.

322
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:57.220
And basically the Congolese army is just a bunch of rebel groups like that,
that,

323
00:18:57.221 --> 00:19:01.530
that defected and came together to be the Congolese army.
And so,

324
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.090
but they're all driving by,
you know,
where we are celebrating.
And uh,

325
00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:07.920
and I guess what it turns out,

326
00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:10.860
these guys have RPGs and machine guns and all sorts of crazy stuff.

327
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:15.030
And I guess they had a Morgan,
the main leader in the back.
And,
uh,

328
00:19:15.031 --> 00:19:19.080
they had killed him,
but he had came to peacefully turn himself in.
But anyways,

329
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:23.880
they killed him.
And so that,
that took the,
um,
the,

330
00:19:23.881 --> 00:19:25.410
my mind,
they didn't want to,

331
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.230
the rest of the rebels now they don't want to turn themselves in because if they

332
00:19:28.231 --> 00:19:31.860
turn themselves in peacefully,
then they might be killed or executed,
you know.

333
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.220
So they went back and started killing more,
raping more,
uh,

334
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.910
attacking more gold mine,
stuff like that.
And then,
um,

335
00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:43.940
some of the people there from the UN that were studying the conflict and stuff

336
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:48.060
said,
be careful in that area where you're going.
Don't go,
um,
for a little bit.

337
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:51.000
So we stayed for maybe three weeks and then went back out.
But,
uh,

338
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:53.910
they were saying that the [inaudible] were walking around drinking from all the

339
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:57.570
pygmy skulls,
just drinking out of there.
Oh,
their school.
So it's,

340
00:19:57.571 --> 00:20:01.200
it's pretty nuts,
man.
Fuck yeah.
Jesus,
man.

341
00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:05.490
You've seen some crazy shit in the few years that you've been down there.

342
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:06.331
I mean,

343
00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:11.331
what a wild transformation your life has taken going from the ultimate fighter

344
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:16.740
fighting in the UFC,
experiencing the,
the trip,

345
00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:20.340
the initial trip when you went and you met those people and you became

346
00:20:20.341 --> 00:20:22.530
incredibly committed to helping them.

347
00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:27.360
You just felt like you were overcome with this almost like a calling.
Right.

348
00:20:27.361 --> 00:20:29.010
Is that the best way to describe it and see,
so,

349
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.080
and then you've been there back and forth ever since.
Yeah.
The,

350
00:20:33.081 --> 00:20:34.860
the first time I would say,

351
00:20:34.861 --> 00:20:38.550
it wasn't until my flight back that I felt that initial like,

352
00:20:38.551 --> 00:20:41.220
I got to do something because whenever I was there,

353
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.340
the problem just seems so huge.
And so,
I mean,

354
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.680
so insurmountable that what am I going to do?
How am I going to help?
Um,
and,
and,

355
00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:53.530
and am I going to get endanger myself or get sick or die or whatever in the

356
00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:58.410
process.
Um,
and but on the way back it just felt like,
you know,
if,

357
00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.570
if,
if not me then,
then who,
you know,

358
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:04.360
like they asked me if I would give them a voice if I could help them,
if I could.

359
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.390
Um,
and I just felt,
I dunno,

360
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.410
a yearning and longing that I had to do something.
And,
uh,
so the,

361
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.530
the second trip back,
um,
was,
was great.

362
00:21:14.531 --> 00:21:17.770
I got to actually meet some people that really had some real plans.

363
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:20.530
Cause the first time I went with people that we didn't have plans to actually

364
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:21.850
help or anything,

365
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.130
like sustainability was just kind of a learning trip going and seeing what their

366
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:30.400
problems were.
Second time it was the university,
their,
uh,

367
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.730
their school of community development and they had dreams of,

368
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.220
of giving them water,
given them land,
giving them food,

369
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.110
but they didn't have any way to do it really.

370
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.730
They had the plan and everything in place,

371
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.230
but they didn't have funding behind it.

372
00:21:41.231 --> 00:21:43.540
They didn't have the technology behind it.
Um,

373
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.320
and so the third time was whenever I came back and I,
I had,
uh,

374
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.730
studied how to build those eco domes.
And I partnered with an organization,

375
00:21:51.731 --> 00:21:54.670
it's a great organization called water for and they,
um,

376
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.890
they're big thing is what,
what I was searching for was how to put the,

377
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.690
the tools are basically the power in the hands of the people there instead of

378
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.950
having to have outside help,

379
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:09.850
how could we actually help them to continue to do it,
continue the process.

380
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:14.320
And so water four puts the tools in the people's hands and then they teach them

381
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:16.540
how to do it and then now they can do it for themselves.

382
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.000
It can be a sustainable business forum.
They can,

383
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:22.060
they can use whatever model they want if it's a nonprofit model,

384
00:22:22.061 --> 00:22:24.130
if it's a business model,
um,
to,

385
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.060
to make it sustainable there so that way yet where I'm at,

386
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:32.380
Congolese can help Congolese and that way I can hopefully,
you know,

387
00:22:32.381 --> 00:22:36.580
fan the flame,
uh,
go over there to teach them more,
bring over the right people.

388
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.240
Waterfall were really supported and sent over.
Um,
you know,

389
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:43.420
their director of implementation to come or at least sit down with us for two

390
00:22:43.421 --> 00:22:45.880
weeks,
teach us.
He came back out,
did it again.

391
00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.130
Now he's gone over since I've been back already.

392
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:50.550
He's been back over teaching her team and the more,
you know,

393
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.480
strategies of how to dig these water wells now we had a bunch of people donate

394
00:22:55.481 --> 00:22:58.900
to your cause,
which is,
it's fight for the forgotten.
Um,

395
00:22:58.901 --> 00:23:02.740
we had a bunch of people donate bitcoin and I matched the bitcoin whatever

396
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:06.850
people donated.
I matched it.
But bitcoin is kind of weird,

397
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:08.830
like it's fluctuating up and back.

398
00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:11.680
And although I'm a big believer and supporter and I think it probably be better

399
00:23:11.681 --> 00:23:14.350
if people donate cash so we know exactly what the fuck we're dealing with.

400
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.370
What's the best way they can donate to your cause?

401
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.780
Well they could go to fight for the forgotten.com and they can just click donate

402
00:23:22.781 --> 00:23:26.920
and do it.
There are going to be updating the site real soon,
but um,
but yeah,

403
00:23:26.921 --> 00:23:31.170
that's straight to the,
the nonprofit five zero one c three like bank account.
Um,

404
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.930
they can go to water for if they want to fund the projects,

405
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:38.700
then for a water for water are four,
four,
you are the number,
the number four.

406
00:23:38.701 --> 00:23:41.410
So water in the [inaudible] dot org.
Okay.

407
00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.600
Go to fight for the forgotten.com donate or they could go to water for water.

408
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:49.130
Then the number four,
not flur but the number,
right,
the number.
There you go.

409
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.430
And since coming on the podcast and,
and,

410
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.710
and people becoming aware of what you're doing,

411
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.710
are you getting other organizations that are reaching out to you to try to help

412
00:23:57.711 --> 00:24:01.490
you and to contribute as well?
Yeah,
that's,
that's been a cool thing,

413
00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:04.820
but it's trying to be selective in the process because,
um,

414
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.720
I mean funding is something that,
yeah,
we definitely need,
but at the same time,

415
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.690
we want to do it in a way that's going to be practical for the people there.

416
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.750
So sometimes,
uh,
you have to,
it,
it sucks,

417
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:19.220
but sometimes you got to say no to good opportunities or,
or,
or chunks of money.

418
00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.980
Um,
if they're going to tell you how to use it,
when to use it.
And,
and,

419
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.580
and kind of control if they give it to you with,

420
00:24:25.581 --> 00:24:27.920
with strings attached and set of saying like,
well,

421
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.880
culturally it might not work here.
The doing it that way,
you know,

422
00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:35.780
instead of going and just,
uh,
I don't know if that,
does that make sense?
Well,

423
00:24:35.781 --> 00:24:37.760
sort of like what experiences have you had?

424
00:24:37.761 --> 00:24:41.930
Like what have you had people that just have the wrong idea of what the

425
00:24:41.931 --> 00:24:44.540
environment is like there or what the culture is like?
Yeah.
I don't,

426
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:48.820
I don't wanna I don't wanna knock any organization,
so,
but,

427
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.640
but things have to be sustainable to really continue change.
Um,

428
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.410
my mind frame is that opportunity as much better than charity.

429
00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.430
If you give people an opportunity to get out of their poverty,
um,
then that,
that,

430
00:25:02.431 --> 00:25:05.540
that empowers them,
like teach a man to fish.
Absolutely.

431
00:25:05.541 --> 00:25:08.450
And you feed him for a ride,
you know,
give him a fish,
feed him for a day.

432
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:13.070
And so there's been things where people are like,
Hey,
I'm donating.
Um,
you know,

433
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.270
I had to turn someone away that was going to donate 5,000,
um,

434
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:19.910
of the water straws.
And that might sound really bad.
I didn't turn them away.

435
00:25:19.911 --> 00:25:21.950
I said,
hey,
how about you help us fund a water?
Well,

436
00:25:21.951 --> 00:25:24.650
like you guys did and I got some pictures to show.
It's awesome with,
uh,

437
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.570
the village you guys supported.
But uh,
but really,
um,
the,

438
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.510
the water straw thing is,
is great.
What's a water straw?
Well,

439
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.930
I don't want to knock them,
but,
but it's,
uh,
I think it's a great organization.
Um,

440
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.990
and,
and I didn't turn the organization down.

441
00:25:38.991 --> 00:25:42.650
It turned up a private person that wanted to say,
hey,
I'm doing this and you,

442
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.790
you run with it.
And I said,
thank you.
But I think a water,
we'll,

443
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.770
we'll support them better then because of had one of those.

444
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.060
It's called a LifeStraw.

445
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.800
And I think the way it's marketed is that it's going to save the third world.
Um,

446
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:58.970
but then if you think about it,
how many times does someone in the third world,

447
00:25:58.971 --> 00:26:01.370
every single time they want to get a clean drink of water?

448
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.820
Do they want to have a straw wrapped around their neck and then put their face

449
00:26:04.821 --> 00:26:08.860
in the water truck on what exactly is it?
It's like it's a,
it's a filter.
Yeah.

450
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.740
Yeah.
It's a lifestyle and I think it's great.
I think it's great for survival.
Um,

451
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:17.210
you know,
if,
if you're out camping.
Um,
I also think that because times pull it up,

452
00:26:17.211 --> 00:26:21.970
James.
Yeah.
You say it wraps around your neck.
Yeah.
It wraps around your neck.

453
00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:26.360
You walk around with it.
So,
um,
and then if it,
whenever you need clean water,

454
00:26:26.361 --> 00:26:27.260
you just,
you,

455
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:32.000
you put your face in the ground in the dirt and then you suck clean water out of

456
00:26:32.001 --> 00:26:33.170
it.
But if a,

457
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.010
that what he was going to support was going to be worth like two or three

458
00:26:37.011 --> 00:26:41.480
different water wells.
And it's a really cool idea.
It's a great,
a great thing.

459
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.950
I really,
I really don't want to them.
I think it's awesome.

460
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.170
This is what we're looking at here.
Yeah.

461
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.330
So he has this whole contraption that you have to put your face in the ground

462
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:53.100
right there on LifeStraw.
Oh,
it's called a LifeStraw.
Okay.
No,
no,

463
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:56.710
that's a great marketing.
I agree with that.
You know,
camping,

464
00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.440
doing something like that and you need to clean drink of water,

465
00:26:58.441 --> 00:26:59.330
you don't have it.
Right.

466
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.300
Put your face in the ground and get it so he can just drink through that straw.

467
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.960
That's it.
It's clean water.
What about,
but you have to suck pretty hard.

468
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.130
I mean you really do have to pull,
pull on it real hard to get the,

469
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:14.280
get the water and maybe maybe after you use it a while it gets easier.

470
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.760
I'm sure it does.
That's how in most of those filters are.
But yeah,

471
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:19.710
but at first you're having to really,
you know,

472
00:27:19.711 --> 00:27:21.510
you're turning red in the face and stuff like that.

473
00:27:21.511 --> 00:27:24.720
So real like inflating of really thick balloon or something like that.

474
00:27:24.721 --> 00:27:28.050
But the opposite and I think it's great.
I really do.

475
00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.870
But at the same time to take it in and say to my,

476
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:34.200
I really think of the pygmies as my family,

477
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.750
I'm not going to go in there and just drop those off.

478
00:27:36.751 --> 00:27:39.720
I'd rather give them a water well that they can go to time and time again,

479
00:27:39.721 --> 00:27:41.040
that just fill up as much as they want.

480
00:27:41.041 --> 00:27:44.530
They can drink it from a glass instead of running a face in the ground.
No.

481
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:49.350
Well that definitely,
totally makes sense.
Maybe be good to have both.
Yeah,
it,
it,

482
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.660
yeah,
it could be.
It could be.
At the time though,

483
00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:53.670
it was like even getting it over to Congo,

484
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.390
some people are really gung Ho and I love it.
Like,
please help us support us,

485
00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.730
things like that.
But then,
um,

486
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.030
if you're going to donate and say this is what it's for and then,

487
00:28:03.031 --> 00:28:05.730
and then we have to find a way to get it there,
ship it,
you know,

488
00:28:05.731 --> 00:28:10.620
5,000 of these straws or something like that.
Um,
it's,
it's a,
it's a lot of work.

489
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.590
So you turned them down because you didn't have the ability to ship them there

490
00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:17.010
or just to ship them.
And then,
and then I was trying to just say,
hey,

491
00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:20.260
this is the real solution that we see right now is,

492
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.450
is that that can be in the future.
And right now I'm in the jungle.

493
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.900
It's hard for me to come out.
Getting things in through customs is crazy.

494
00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:31.550
Also seeing 5,000 of those boxed up,
the Congolese,

495
00:28:31.551 --> 00:28:36.240
a government there in the border patrol,
they're absolutely crazy,
man.

496
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:39.420
Um,
there was a $3,000 worth of,

497
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.280
of mattresses donated to this hospital and these people sent it on a truck and

498
00:28:44.281 --> 00:28:46.830
paid for the shipping and everything.
Then whenever they got there,

499
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:51.210
the government wanted $5,000 so that they could bring it into the country.

500
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.170
And they're like,
what do you mean?
So the,

501
00:28:53.171 --> 00:28:57.980
the hospital now has $3,000 of donated mattresses for their,
yeah,

502
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.370
for their beds.
But,

503
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.130
but now they have no way to get it in there because they don't have the funds to

504
00:29:02.131 --> 00:29:06.330
pay $5,000 to the corrupt government officials just to get their beds released

505
00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.590
across the border,

506
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:12.390
all that other stuff that's gotta be insanely frustrating for you trying to make

507
00:29:12.391 --> 00:29:16.530
a change and running time and time again until all this corruption and all these

508
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.820
devious people.
And this,
it sounds like if you go back to the Jamison thing,

509
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:25.590
it's like this long history of horrible things that have been happening in this

510
00:29:25.591 --> 00:29:28.290
area and there's a kind of like a momentum attached to that.

511
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.480
It's almost like this is just the way it is.

512
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:34.530
This is a fucked up part of the world.
Does that accurate?
Yeah,
it's,
it's crazy.

513
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:39.630
It's nuts.
Um,
every single time I've gone across the border,

514
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:44.790
there's been some of problem where they want to arrest me.
They want to,

515
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.860
in my team,
they want to find someone that they can single out,

516
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.410
find something that they can get a bribe for.
Um,
and,
and,

517
00:29:52.411 --> 00:29:55.090
and they just waste so much of your time.
For instance,
we,

518
00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:00.080
we got a truck donated to us,
which was awesome,
so that we could get our,
our,
our,

519
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.500
our PVC or tools,
all that out to the forest.

520
00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.660
And whenever we brought it into the country,

521
00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:06.820
we had all the paperwork saying it's under the university.

522
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.760
It's a tax free basically.
And,
um,

523
00:30:09.761 --> 00:30:12.970
this is a university vehicle is going to be used for humanitarian aid.
Um,

524
00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.900
but then whenever we get to the border,
the head guys,

525
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.530
the absolute head guys of customs,
we're saying,
yeah,

526
00:30:20.531 --> 00:30:24.460
but how's that going to feed my family?
And it's like,
well,
it isn't your job,

527
00:30:24.461 --> 00:30:27.850
a government job and they pay you.
It's not my job to pay you.

528
00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.340
So they locked up our truck for three and a half weeks.

529
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.330
So we were delayed almost a month and our process and everything,

530
00:30:34.331 --> 00:30:35.920
we had laid out strategies,

531
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.260
we're going to be in this field from this day to this day,

532
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.710
this week to this week,
this month.
So they were just waiting for a bribe.
Yeah,

533
00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:45.820
absolutely.
So after three and a half weeks,
how did you resolve it?
Yeah,

534
00:30:45.821 --> 00:30:49.720
they came back to us with,
with a long list of,
uh,

535
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:55.180
of new fees of processing fees and we had to go do this to get it and go do
this,

536
00:30:55.181 --> 00:30:57.440
to get and go do this,
to get it.
Um,

537
00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:02.550
and by that time we just decided that I think we ended up paying like $750 to

538
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:07.450
get our truck released,
but it was going to be,
it was going to be $500 anyways,

539
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:12.400
so I think they got an extra $250.
But you lost three.

540
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:16.830
Yeah.
But they were first asking for for seven or $8,000.
They're looking,

541
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:21.040
they're looking for for 50% of the purchase price of the vehicle.

542
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.940
Oh yeah.
Damn man does it,

543
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:29.030
it's kind of drive you nuts when you're dealing with something that's,
you know,

544
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.210
you're trying to help you.
You're going over there,

545
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.790
you're essentially dedicated your life,

546
00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.810
a huge part of your life to go on over there and helping these people being,

547
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.020
you know,
completely humanitarian and your,
your,
your,

548
00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.500
your actions and then you run into this kind of shit.
It's gotta be really,

549
00:31:44.501 --> 00:31:47.520
really frustrating.
Yeah.
I mean it,
it,
it absolutely is.
It's,

550
00:31:47.521 --> 00:31:50.500
it's different than anything that we experienced here.

551
00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:54.280
Cause that corruption isn't,
I mean,
sure,
there's corrupt stuff that goes on here,

552
00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:56.750
but it's not so open.
So public.
Um,

553
00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.160
I mean by the time we finally paid that $750,

554
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:04.240
I remember grabbing my wallet and,
uh,
and because he was,

555
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:08.230
he was wanting more and I grabbed my wallet and I had like Congolese francs and

556
00:32:08.231 --> 00:32:11.410
my,
my wallet and I just shook it on his desk and he had,

557
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.740
he had other people witnessing this and other people outside.
I could see him.

558
00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.500
And I'm like,
here,
this is all I have.
This is all I have.

559
00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:22.060
You've delayed us one month from giving your people,
um,
your countrymen,
water,

560
00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:26.140
like in their dying from it.
And I think right before that,
um,

561
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.900
the little guy named Bob [inaudible] had died.
And,
uh,

562
00:32:28.901 --> 00:32:33.280
I had been holding them in my hands.
And so,
um,
I'm,
I've,
I've buried,

563
00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.760
you know,
no,
a couple of kids,
but I've seen,

564
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:41.380
I've been to over 10 funerals.
Um,
and so,
uh,

565
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:46.000
I've,
I've,
yeah,
I was holding Babo and you know,
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
They,

566
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:49.850
they,
I just got in the hut and,
um,

567
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.960
and whenever I crawled in,
uh,
you know,
his,
his,

568
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.210
his mother is my mother's sister.

569
00:32:56.211 --> 00:33:00.320
So basically she was my aunt and Baba was my cousin.
So Chad was seek,

570
00:33:00.321 --> 00:33:04.300
who was my mother?
Macho is her sister.
And Baba was much of Sun.

571
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.730
And when you say my mother,
like your adopted mother,
my adopted mother there.

572
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:12.080
And so they just gave you a whole family there.
Yeah,
I love it man.
Wow.

573
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:12.900
I love him.
My,

574
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:17.270
my name in that religious Efeosa which fas means the man who loves us.

575
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.150
And then my new name that,
that everyone's been calling me,

576
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:25.340
especially when I drive up and down the roads there,
um,
is my booty Mongo.
And,

577
00:33:25.341 --> 00:33:27.890
uh,
my booty mung bow means the big,
big me.

578
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:30.980
And so they can just call me the big pygmy.
And,
uh,

579
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.810
the big pig be in the man who loves us.

580
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.800
And so the thing that was tough with Babu had just passed away before we got the

581
00:33:38.961 --> 00:33:43.520
truck,
I think.
And,
um,
in,
and,
and,
and I actually think Bob,

582
00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:48.110
what happened after a girl named little mill happened before and,
um,

583
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.010
and so it was just,
just tough stuff because I'm seeing this,
it's,
it's,

584
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.920
it's really wrecking me,
you know,
seeing kids,
kids go through this,
um,

585
00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.470
or anybody really,
and knowing that we have the tools,

586
00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.380
we have the solution to that problem.
What was that problem?

587
00:34:03.381 --> 00:34:06.650
What were they dying from?
Water.
Water.
Yeah,
just dirty water.

588
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.550
The parasites tapeworms um,
there's other,

589
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.970
there's other kinds of sicknesses that attribute to it,
but most of them,

590
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.571
the little kids,

591
00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:18.770
they run around with these huge bellies and it's just full of tapeworms other

592
00:34:18.771 --> 00:34:21.380
kinds of,
of bacterias and things like that.

593
00:34:21.381 --> 00:34:22.910
And if you can just give them clean water,

594
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:28.750
I think the stat from the United Nations human development report is 85% of

595
00:34:28.851 --> 00:34:32.090
sickness just disappears once you have clean water in your system.

596
00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:35.510
But once you're,
you're constantly getting sick from that.
And not only that,

597
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:39.320
but it's diarrhea whenever you have waterborne illness and drinking dirty water.

598
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.960
Now these people that don't have a lot of food,
um,

599
00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.310
that are either slaves to get their food,
which a whole family can work,
you know,

600
00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:47.451
mother,

601
00:34:47.451 --> 00:34:50.960
father and their two or three children can go work for their master's and they

602
00:34:50.961 --> 00:34:55.370
get a too small bananas at the end of the day and they have to split that within

603
00:34:55.371 --> 00:34:58.820
the whole family.
But now if you have diarrhea added on top of that,

604
00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.840
now you don't absorb any of the nutrients from that banana you just ate.

605
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.570
It just goes straight through you.
Um,
and so it's,

606
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.620
it's real tough to be like me and first we got them land while we were there,

607
00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:10.150
which was,

608
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:14.750
was a huge thing we negotiated and in petitioned and lobbied for,

609
00:35:14.751 --> 00:35:17.590
for them and their rights with,
with the government there,
but also the,

610
00:35:17.591 --> 00:35:22.400
the local slave masters,
the,
the chiefs of that area.
Um,
and said,
you know,

611
00:35:22.401 --> 00:35:25.700
these are the first citizens of Congo.
Why don't they have any land?

612
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.800
Why all their land been stolen from them?

613
00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.190
Why is the land that they're on now all of a sudden legally in the name of

614
00:35:31.191 --> 00:35:32.024
somebody else?

615
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:37.070
And so we're some land that we could get and purchase on behalf of them.
And uh,

616
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.360
the university did a great job in that.
Um,

617
00:35:39.361 --> 00:35:43.890
I was kind of in the background for that for sure because,
um,
just being,
uh,

618
00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:48.030
in an Ngo and nonprofit,
something like that,
uh,
the local government officials,

619
00:35:48.031 --> 00:35:52.110
again,
we'll see dollar signs.
And so if we were going to buy the land,
um,

620
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.150
there's going to be astronomical.
We couldn't have done it.

621
00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:59.380
If the university would have done it,
they would would've been over $250,000.
Um,

622
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.450
but since we came up with an idea and a solution saying,
well,
who can,
who cares?

623
00:36:03.451 --> 00:36:06.210
Who gets the credit?
Like I don't need it and fight for the forgotten his name.

624
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.930
Like it doesn't have to be in the university's name.
What if we just,

625
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.960
what if we're just kind of the caretakers and we handle the documents and the

626
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:18.000
negotiations and seeing that it's legally done and then all parties will get

627
00:36:18.001 --> 00:36:20.190
copies of it.
They'll put their thumbprints all on the,

628
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:25.220
the documents and each chunk of land they have like 10 or 12 thumbprints on it

629
00:36:25.501 --> 00:36:28.320
was signatures and there's a handwritten one and there's a type that one.

630
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.440
And then the government comes out.
Now we're doing gps coordinates of the land,

631
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:35.010
but the land we got was 2,470 acres.

632
00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:37.350
So we've been able to do that in 10 different spots.

633
00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:39.600
So it's one square kilometer in each,

634
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:42.330
each different village that we've tried to now establish.

635
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.750
And now we're putting water wells on those and hoping to start farming projects

636
00:36:45.751 --> 00:36:47.730
on a multi.
That's fantastic.

637
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:52.970
Do you have any concern that with all this added publicity and all this

638
00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:55.410
attention that's in that area,

639
00:36:55.411 --> 00:36:58.440
that the more people will come in and try to exploit that because they know the

640
00:36:58.441 --> 00:37:01.200
resources are in that area now?
I think,

641
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:06.350
I think what's been great for me is being able to kind of dive in as a part of

642
00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:13.340
the university and have,
they're kind of,
they're covering because now I,

643
00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:17.830
they'd say I'm a teacher,
I'm a prat of,
of appropriate technologies.
Um,

644
00:37:17.831 --> 00:37:20.730
and so I'm teaching Congolese how to,
how to yeah.

645
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:25.470
Dig Wells farm and,
uh,
build new homes.
Just different sustainable things.

646
00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:26.460
We'll come back here,
learn it,

647
00:37:26.461 --> 00:37:29.280
and then I'll come and I'll either teach it or I'll bring someone with me that

648
00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:32.790
really can,
you know,
even if I don't know the,
everything about it,

649
00:37:32.791 --> 00:37:37.500
I'll get someone there that,
that will.
Um,
and so the university there is,

650
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:40.680
um,
it's kind of just there.

651
00:37:40.681 --> 00:37:43.710
They're able to really negotiate and show everybody on both sides.
Like,
Hey,

652
00:37:43.711 --> 00:37:46.410
this is in everyone's best interest and would,
which is,

653
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.960
which is something cool because whenever we go in and we drove water wells,

654
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:51.240
we're not just drilling them for my pygmy family.

655
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:53.550
We're drilling them for the people that are pressed him too.

656
00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:57.510
And that way we can show him that the project isn't just for the pygmies and

657
00:37:57.511 --> 00:37:59.850
just going to benefit them.
If you can sell us their land,

658
00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:03.480
which sometimes the land prices that we're buying them for our three years,

659
00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:07.510
five years,
10 years salary for the people that,
that either enslaved them or,

660
00:38:07.511 --> 00:38:10.620
or that own that land.
Um,
and then we come in and we say,

661
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:12.710
we're also going to give you a waterwheel.
Well,

662
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.520
their kids are dying with the same stuff too,

663
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.150
and they've been struggling with diarrhea their whole life or parasites or

664
00:38:18.151 --> 00:38:21.480
whatever it is.
Now we're going to give you guys both water wells in,

665
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.950
when we start our farming project,

666
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:27.420
we're bringing in a agriculturalist to teach both sides better farming
practices.

667
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.630
Oh,
that's great.
Yeah,
that's a beautiful strategy.
Right?

668
00:38:30.631 --> 00:38:34.200
And so that way it doesn't,
nobody gets offended.
It's like,
Hey,
no,
this isn't,

669
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:38.140
this isn't a pygmy cause if it's a pygmy project and then that's not going to be

670
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.070
received well,
but people get jealous and then they'll,
and they're,

671
00:38:42.071 --> 00:38:44.050
they're used to pressing them and why are they getting help?

672
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:48.760
And so we're willing to help everybody out.
Let's,
let's come up together.
Wow.

673
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.570
That's beautiful man.
That's beautiful.
And is there any resistance there?

674
00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:57.540
Because they've been so prejudiced against the pygmies for so long.
Is the,

675
00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:02.020
is there any resistance to the pygmies having equal treatment?
Um,
I,

676
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.280
I'm sure that there,
there is like questions and things like that,

677
00:39:06.281 --> 00:39:08.270
but we haven't seen.
And,
and,

678
00:39:08.271 --> 00:39:11.770
and what we do also is we go in there with the university,
like dean of the,

679
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.070
the um,
department of development and we sit down with them,

680
00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:19.000
we explain everything and it all becomes like agreeable and written down on

681
00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:22.690
paper before we ever take action.
And so that way we can always show them,
hey,

682
00:39:22.691 --> 00:39:26.710
we all agreed to this,
you know,
and,
uh,
so it's,
it's been a great process for me.

683
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.390
Do they all speak the same language,

684
00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:32.080
these people that you're communicating with the pygmies in their oppressors and

685
00:39:32.081 --> 00:39:35.230
what kind of have their own dialects also,
but most people have,

686
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:40.330
the Congo has so many languages.
There's about 200.
Wow.
Yeah.
200 of their,

687
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.670
of their local tribal languages.

688
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.330
Do they share words in common or is it,
some of them do for sure.

689
00:39:46.331 --> 00:39:49.600
Especially ones that border each other.
But then there's always a common thread.

690
00:39:49.601 --> 00:39:53.800
I think there's five national languages of Congo and um,

691
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.360
is French.

692
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.510
So that's like kind of the government language and the language spoken schools

693
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:00.910
and other Swahili and that's on the eastern side.

694
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.600
So that's what I've been trying to learn and I can pick it up pretty good.

695
00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:06.760
But a speaking it,
I'm still kind of far behind,

696
00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:08.800
so always have a translator right beside me.

697
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.900
But they have Lingala and they have a,

698
00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:14.920
it's called Banner Congo or something like that.
So it kind of in each region,

699
00:40:14.921 --> 00:40:16.870
the north,
the south,
east,
west,
all that.

700
00:40:16.871 --> 00:40:20.380
They have their own kind of language that everybody speaks.

701
00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:25.020
And then as a nation everybody speaks French.
Wow.
Um,
so you were,

702
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.280
do you speak French at all?
No,
just what do,
how we'll use,

703
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:31.750
we're using like a program or something like that or books trend you Rosetta

704
00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:34.180
stone.
But really just immersing myself because it's,
it's really hard.

705
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:37.660
Even the French there is,
I mean,
I guess you could,

706
00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:41.320
French will be good for me to learn.
It absolutely would.
Um,

707
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:44.270
the communicate with the government officials for sure.
Um,

708
00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.920
but everybody in the east speaks,
speaks Swahili and my pygmy family,

709
00:40:47.921 --> 00:40:51.400
they speak Swahili,
but it's broken.
And so even like Rosetta stone,

710
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:56.360
it's a hard thing to go on there and learn because that's the proper Tanzania

711
00:40:56.361 --> 00:40:59.590
and Swahili and then can you kind of gets a little worse.

712
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.520
And then there's a break in between Uganda where and you've gone,

713
00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:07.300
it's basically just the military language of Swahili and then you get over to

714
00:41:07.301 --> 00:41:09.690
Congo and so there's a big break between that,

715
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:13.260
that pure proper Tanzanian in Swahili and the,
the,

716
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:16.880
the Swahili is spoken in Congo because they mix in local language and they mix

717
00:41:16.881 --> 00:41:20.140
and French and all that other stem accents.
I'm sure.
Definitely.

718
00:41:20.141 --> 00:41:24.940
So I just tried to immerse myself in there and learn it that way and I'm able to

719
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:27.820
talk a little bit but,
but really just having a translator there is helping me.

720
00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:30.790
It's amazing how many variations there are in languages.
Yeah.

721
00:41:30.791 --> 00:41:34.250
I went to Northern Ireland,
wants for the UFC and spoke

722
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:39.170
<v 2>to people in uh,
in Belfast.
You can't understand a fucking word they're saying,</v>

723
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:43.790
I mean they're speaking English and you'll pick out like one out of every four

724
00:41:43.791 --> 00:41:47.660
or five words that you,
you're pretty sure that's what the word is.

725
00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:48.740
But they're speaking English.

726
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:52.640
There's this fucking guy with the thing with today have,

727
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:56.750
I can tell that guy for him to get off my fucking,
I,
I can get like Whoa,
like,

728
00:41:56.751 --> 00:41:59.480
and they're communicating back and forth to each other like this.

729
00:41:59.481 --> 00:42:02.600
And it sounds like you remember that Cantina scene in Star Wars?

730
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.353
Do you ever seen,

731
00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.620
and they're all like speaking on these crazy languages.
That's what it's like.

732
00:42:09.621 --> 00:42:13.400
It's like being in this like weird star port that they're speaking English,

733
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.970
you know?
So yeah,
I met my best friend there,
been he,
he was,

734
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.830
he used to be a translator for the United Nations.

735
00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.080
So he speaks fluently seven languages,

736
00:42:21.081 --> 00:42:25.440
but he knows more than that and so fluently.
So he just goes around,
we're,
we're,

737
00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.770
we're buddies are side by side all the time and he's helping me out.

738
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.350
You have to like,
if you speak fluently seven languages,

739
00:42:30.351 --> 00:42:32.690
you have to kind of practice those languages all the time.
Right.

740
00:42:32.691 --> 00:42:36.230
To keep him fluent.
I'm pretty sure.
But that's what he was doing.
Where I mean,

741
00:42:36.231 --> 00:42:39.140
yes,
but that's what he was doing with is that the United Nations where the,

742
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.970
the Russians,
because he speaks,
I mean,

743
00:42:40.971 --> 00:42:43.790
he's a Congolese guy that's speaking Russian.
I'm like,
that's crazy.

744
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.200
Whenever we see any Russian soldiers,

745
00:42:45.201 --> 00:42:49.550
he would just go on and in a conversation with them.
English is one of,

746
00:42:49.551 --> 00:42:53.450
is not as worse cause he's,
he's great at it.
Um,
but yeah,

747
00:42:53.451 --> 00:42:56.270
all the other languages he's super fluent in.
It's so fascinating.

748
00:42:56.271 --> 00:42:59.990
It's like that story from the Bible about the Tower of Babel.
You know,

749
00:42:59.991 --> 00:43:04.070
that the idea being that this was all like some sort of a plan to keep people

750
00:43:04.071 --> 00:43:06.140
from being able to communicate with each other.
I mean,

751
00:43:06.141 --> 00:43:09.950
it's probably indicative of like how frustrating it must be to realize that

752
00:43:09.951 --> 00:43:12.520
there are,
I mean,
I don't know how many languages there are worldwide,

753
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:16.370
but I think it's over a thousand,
right?
If there's 200 in Congo,
it's gotta be,

754
00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.410
yeah.
Imagine.
I mean,

755
00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:22.760
I mean how the f until you have some sort of a program that translates an

756
00:43:22.761 --> 00:43:26.780
ordinance still until someone creates a universal language and gets people to

757
00:43:26.781 --> 00:43:31.550
adopt it.
But Shit,
we won't even adopt the metric system.
You know?
I mean,

758
00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.370
when I was in high school,
they tried that shit.
They tried to push the,

759
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.130
someday everyone's going to be on.
And I remember everyone in the class like,

760
00:43:37.131 --> 00:43:39.790
fuck this,
nobody's going to adopt this.
You know,
we,

761
00:43:39.791 --> 00:43:44.690
we lived 15 years learning about inches and yards and we're not into meters.

762
00:43:44.691 --> 00:43:47.000
You know,
we don't really care.
And it's,

763
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:51.920
it seems like it's incredibly frustrated for people to communicate without some

764
00:43:51.921 --> 00:43:55.460
sort of a universal translator,
whether it's a program or something,

765
00:43:55.461 --> 00:43:59.430
but even then without a universal language,
it's,
it's,

766
00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:04.610
it's gonna be really hard for people to relate to each other and to,
to not like,

767
00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:04.920
it's,

768
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:09.860
it's easy to look at someone who's speaking some crazy language like people in

769
00:44:09.861 --> 00:44:14.030
Afghanistan or people in Saudi Arabia and think of them as like,

770
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:18.620
not us,
because they don't,
they don't speak the way we speak.

771
00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:23.510
If we heard someone in Afghanistan speaking total fluent English,

772
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.260
we would think of them way different than if you hear them in some crazy Arabic

773
00:44:27.261 --> 00:44:31.620
language.
W W W we totally don't understand.
Yeah,
yeah.
Without a doubt.

774
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:36.770
<v 1>Language is something that I wish I had a gift at.
Uh,
like I,</v>

775
00:44:36.771 --> 00:44:41.430
I just,
I really wish I could just grasp it and speak it so well,

776
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.800
but I really think just immersion into it as the way that you really start to,

777
00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:48.720
to pick it up.
Cause I,
I found myself just,
you know,

778
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:52.440
able to start learning Swahili and then someone's over to the side and they make

779
00:44:52.441 --> 00:44:55.260
a little joke and I could,
I would be able to start laughing with them.

780
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.100
You understand the jokes?
Yeah.
Sometimes like sometimes for sure.

781
00:44:59.101 --> 00:45:03.540
What's a good Swahili joke?
Good Swahili joke.
Um,

782
00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:08.460
I'm not,
I'm not sure.
It was like walking into a bar.
Yeah.

783
00:45:08.461 --> 00:45:13.230
Well they cost Mizunos have diarrhea.
Ah,

784
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:19.440
like would they call you what?
Mizzou.
That's what guys called tits,

785
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:23.880
isn't it the same thing with zoom.
Google does or something like that.

786
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:27.030
I'm a zoom.
Google is definitely,
they just mean that for white men.

787
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:31.620
That's why Healy was,
was zoom,
Google Muslim girl,
Muslim group.
Is that,
um,

788
00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:36.650
like derogatory,
like how ugly like Hawaiians call?
Uh,
it,

789
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:41.100
it,
I think it is,
but to them it's so,
it's so a,

790
00:45:41.101 --> 00:45:42.360
I embrace it though.

791
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:45.300
I embrace it and I'll say it with them if the kids are saying it and stuff like

792
00:45:45.301 --> 00:45:46.240
that.
Um,

793
00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:50.880
but for them it's just more everybody sticks to their tribe.

794
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:54.990
And I think that's a problem with some of the violence that goes on there.

795
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:55.261
I mean,

796
00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:59.820
a lot of times you'll hear people in Congo seeing that in other parts of Africa,

797
00:45:59.821 --> 00:46:03.750
San,
well,
we weren't the ones that chose the boundaries of our country,
you know,

798
00:46:03.751 --> 00:46:05.760
is the people that colonized and stuff like that.

799
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:10.710
And so we would have been off on her own and in this region because this is our

800
00:46:10.711 --> 00:46:12.830
language and this is our tribe.
And so there,

801
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:15.840
I think that's why there's a lot of tribal conflict and things like that in

802
00:46:15.841 --> 00:46:19.740
different languages.
And so people will,
will pride themselves in their culture,

803
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:24.630
which I,
I love cultures.
It's,
it's great.
Um,
the pygmy culture's awesome.
In fact,

804
00:46:24.631 --> 00:46:27.490
I mean there's,
there's like some great photos in there of,
of,

805
00:46:27.491 --> 00:46:30.420
of hunting and a little boy getting his first hunt,

806
00:46:30.421 --> 00:46:33.840
which was great as named Sam g in the same village that you guys sponsored a

807
00:46:33.841 --> 00:46:37.980
water well for.
Um,
and so I love cultures and this little boy,

808
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:42.250
what did he hunt with?
Is these spear the spear?

809
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:47.340
He got forest antelope.
Oh,
I was there and had just woke up.

810
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.920
And uh,
this is early in the morning.
I don't know if you can tell.

811
00:46:49.921 --> 00:46:54.220
It's kind of like how tall is that little fella?
Uh,
he's,

812
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.640
he's a little dude.
I,
there's another picture of me standing by him,

813
00:46:56.641 --> 00:47:00.210
so you'll see,
but he got it with a spear that's beer that he's holding.

814
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.960
That seems like a heavy spear for a little guy like that.

815
00:47:02.961 --> 00:47:04.620
It's his great grandfather spirits.

816
00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:07.470
So his grandfather took them out hunting while he was on that.
Got It.
Oh,

817
00:47:07.471 --> 00:47:11.810
he's got these and there's the head.
So there's it.

818
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.730
And if you go to the next one,
there's a,
it's called a,

819
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:17.190
I think they call it a Janae or spotted [inaudible].

820
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:20.430
It's almost like a more like a mongoose,

821
00:47:20.431 --> 00:47:21.890
but it's kind of like in the leopard fee.

822
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:25.170
I mean like it'd be like a cross between a mongoose and a leopard or something.

823
00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:28.830
A small leopard.
Cause they're,
they're pretty small in size.
Next picture shot.

824
00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.780
They eat that.
Yeah,
totally delete everything,
man.
Wow.
So,
so you can tell small.

825
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.940
Yeah.
How old is that little dot.
I think he's probably around 12.

826
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:40.540
They don't know their age,
so wow.
They don't know their age.
That's fascinating.

827
00:47:40.541 --> 00:47:42.430
So there's some of the men in the village,
but a few,

828
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:44.550
if you go back to that last one,
you can even see,
uh,

829
00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:48.730
the bellies on the little guys down right there.

830
00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.620
You can see the affected bellies of,

831
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:56.260
of different kinds of parasites and sickness or disease.
That is nuts,
man.

832
00:47:56.290 --> 00:48:00.130
And these people have a clean water.
Well now.
Yeah,
absolutely.

833
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:04.120
Do you have to give them medicine to get rid of that belly or does it go,

834
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:08.290
does it go away?
Just with clean water?
It doesn't go away just with clean water,

835
00:48:08.291 --> 00:48:13.260
but,
but the sickness drops,
um,
about 85%.
But what we do is we have,
um,

836
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:15.390
different nurses and things that,

837
00:48:15.391 --> 00:48:18.010
that are partnered with the university and we send them out and they,

838
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:21.220
the pills are like,
I mean,
a dollar for like 10 of them.

839
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:24.430
And you can give one pill to each of them.
It's not a fun process,
man.

840
00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:29.800
They either vomit or,
or,
or have to,
they have to get the worms out of them.

841
00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:33.880
It's the kill these biological entities inside their body.
So it's poisoned.

842
00:48:33.881 --> 00:48:38.560
Essentially.
I saw the type of poison,
right.
Definitely in the,
and they,
I mean,

843
00:48:38.561 --> 00:48:42.370
I've seen mounds of,
of these,
I mean,
it's mixed with other stuff,

844
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:46.090
but just stumbled upon it and bins like,
oh,
that's because we gave him the pill.

845
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:49.720
Like,
and I'm like,
what is that in there?
And there was tape worms,
all insight,

846
00:48:49.721 --> 00:48:54.640
this mound of,
of,
of feces on one of the trails that were hiking.
Wow.

847
00:48:54.641 --> 00:48:58.910
So,
um,
and how come the adults don't have it?
They have flat stomachs.
Um,

848
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.530
I think as they get older,
I mean,
I'm not 100% sure,

849
00:49:02.531 --> 00:49:04.960
but I think their body just starts learning to fight it better.

850
00:49:04.961 --> 00:49:08.940
And some of them have had the medicine and so they'll,
there'll be smarter and,

851
00:49:08.941 --> 00:49:12.400
and try not to,
to,
to drink dirty water whenever we're just from anywhere.

852
00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:12.790
When these,

853
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:16.720
when these little guys are walking around now they're being taught you have a

854
00:49:16.721 --> 00:49:19.330
clean source of water.
This is where you get your water from.

855
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:22.420
And they can carry little containers or bottles and,
and,

856
00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.960
and take those around with them.
And they do most of their hunting with spears.

857
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:29.640
Uh,
most of bows and arrows I think.
But they'll,
they'll drive them into nets.

858
00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:33.550
And the,
if you keep going down,
there'll be a picture of the net.
So,
um,

859
00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.960
but they had these nets,
Etsy.
Yup.
And they just go and they break,
uh,

860
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:40.600
these little trees that are starting to grow there,
maybe three foot tall.

861
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:44.040
They break them in and they lay a net,
uh,
the top of the net on it.

862
00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:46.720
And then they just kind of weave them in and out of the forest.

863
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.880
And then what they do together is maybe they get leafs,

864
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:52.790
maybe they see an animal and they just drive it into these nets sometimes.
Uh,

865
00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:56.260
like with monkeys and parrots and stuff like that.
They're using their,
um,

866
00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.690
their bows and arrows,
which if you go up one picture that shows the,

867
00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.520
the little boys,
I mean,
even from that age right there,
uh,

868
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:07.900
those little boys are just nailing anything.
I mean,
you give them a target.
Uh,
my,

869
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:12.600
my wife and I would,
uh,
would get passion fruit and we,
what we do is we,

870
00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:17.020
we have through,
there's a rotten one.
If there's an empty one,
um,
we would,

871
00:50:17.021 --> 00:50:21.190
we would roll it to him and these guys could hit the moving like this age right

872
00:50:21.191 --> 00:50:24.280
here.
Uh,
which I don't know.
What do you think?
That's five,
five years old.

873
00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:27.190
They could hit a moving passion fruit target that we're rolling.

874
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:30.400
They could just nail them with their bows and arrows.
Wow.
There's even a,

875
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:34.880
a short video I got of a,
of them nailing a,
uh,
a mouse.

876
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:36.500
That's what it is.
A mouse.

877
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.740
There's a mouse in the village and they wanted to show off to,
to Emily.
Um,

878
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.510
that's my wife.
And,
uh,
she came to visit and it was just,

879
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:46.190
it was just really fun because they,

880
00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:50.150
she wanted to experience their culture and whenever you show them interest in

881
00:50:50.151 --> 00:50:53.380
the culture,
they get really,
really good.
Decided.

882
00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.340
Is this the video?
Yeah,
there's the mouse running.

883
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:59.800
I don't know if you can see it around here and around there,
but it's,

884
00:50:59.801 --> 00:51:04.180
it's definitely alive moving.
And I just said,
hey,
shoot it and uh,

885
00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:09.490
and just nailed it.
It was like a foot away and I'm not that impressed.

886
00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:13.820
But did they eat that mouse?
Yeah,
they'll eat it.
They'll eat it.
And then,
um,

887
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:17.990
they'll even do,
um,
like turtles.
They'll,

888
00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:22.510
they'll go out and they'll make backpacks out of turtles.
Um,
it sounds crazy,

889
00:51:22.511 --> 00:51:25.600
but they'll,
they'll go out and to look for the antelope or something like that.

890
00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:30.580
And then if they come across a turtle,
they'll make out of a,
I don't know,

891
00:51:30.581 --> 00:51:32.140
these little fines,
uh,

892
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:35.170
literally just backpacks where they tied onto the legs of the turtle and they

893
00:51:35.171 --> 00:51:38.530
walk around with it.
And if they find a big thing in meat,
then they,

894
00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:41.710
they let the turtle go.
But if,
if they don't,
if they come back empty handed day,

895
00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:45.850
they're going to come back with the turtle.
And these,
these arrows that they use,

896
00:51:45.851 --> 00:51:48.340
like what,
what did they use for like the,
the,

897
00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:52.730
the feathers for the fledglings and all the feathers or leafs leaving.

898
00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.510
They make a small slit in the back of the,

899
00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:59.350
the Arrow and then they slide in the leaf that that's formed just like a
feather.

900
00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:04.180
And when they,
when they use the tips,
what's the tip?
The tip can be metal.

901
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:08.470
If they find scrap metal somewhere,
they can beat it down and,
and uh,
yeah,

902
00:52:08.471 --> 00:52:10.600
it turned it into little Varage hard.
Yeah.

903
00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:14.020
But then sometimes they have these wicked barbs on them too.
Um,

904
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:17.530
and then what they use most though,
they would use,
they would use a,

905
00:52:17.531 --> 00:52:19.510
the metal on smaller game,

906
00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.670
but on bigger game they use their poison tipped arrows.

907
00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:25.480
So they just have it in wood and they sharpen it down and they kind of do the

908
00:52:25.481 --> 00:52:28.150
spiral at the tip of the Arrow.

909
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:33.390
And then what they do is they take roots and berries and um,

910
00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.710
I think that's,
that's pretty much it.
But they get like a,

911
00:52:35.711 --> 00:52:38.170
basically like poisonous cocktail.
They make an,

912
00:52:38.171 --> 00:52:41.020
it turns black and then they dip the tip of the Arrow right in it.

913
00:52:41.021 --> 00:52:42.880
And that's what they use for,
for something.

914
00:52:42.881 --> 00:52:46.660
They really want to get a monkey or an antelope or anything like that.

915
00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:49.000
And when they do that,
doesn't that poison the meat?

916
00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:55.090
They eat it and I eat it.
So,
um,
I guess it could,

917
00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:58.960
I didn't ever think of that.
Maybe I should be careful.
Well,

918
00:52:58.961 --> 00:53:02.170
I would wonder like how's the poison work and if that's the case,

919
00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:06.130
how do you not ingesting and maybe it is it local is like only the spot where

920
00:53:06.131 --> 00:53:09.970
the Arrow hits.
That doesn't seem to make sense though.
Where the bloodstream,

921
00:53:09.971 --> 00:53:11.890
maybe once you drain the blood out of it,

922
00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:15.460
they shoot it and then they just track it and then once it falls over dead,

923
00:53:15.461 --> 00:53:17.260
they just put it over their shoulders and bring it back.

924
00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:18.460
How long do they have to try?
I like,

925
00:53:18.461 --> 00:53:21.760
how long does it take before the poison kills him?
This will be kind of funny.

926
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:26.780
I can't really,
um,
follow them very well through the forest.
I,

927
00:53:26.781 --> 00:53:30.300
I'm,
I'm just being and clunking around.
I got hiking boots on or whatever,

928
00:53:30.301 --> 00:53:31.770
but they're just fast and quiet.

929
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:36.160
So I've tried to go out on a couple of months with them,
but,
but,
uh,
I,

930
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:39.630
I knew they were just kind of humbly like being nice,

931
00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:41.310
like letting me experience their culture.

932
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.910
But then I realized these guys are quick,
they're quiet and I'm not,

933
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:48.630
and so I better just let them go off on their own and do their thing.

934
00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:52.120
Do they hunt barefoot?
So yeah,
they do everything bare for everything.
Most,

935
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:53.370
most time,
everything barefoot.
They,

936
00:53:53.371 --> 00:53:57.270
if they can find like most of the things that they're wearing on their body is

937
00:53:57.271 --> 00:53:59.030
because they've worked for someone or,
or,

938
00:53:59.031 --> 00:54:02.490
or been a slave for some women that was part of their payment was,
was clothing.

939
00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:06.320
Why clothing or shoes or things like that.
But it's their,

940
00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:11.470
their culture is just to run around barefoot everywhere.
May a tough feat.
It's,

941
00:54:11.471 --> 00:54:15.480
it's,
it's pretty cool to see like just their feet,
the structure of their feet.

942
00:54:15.481 --> 00:54:19.470
They don't have the real high arches and it's not real soft skin,
you know?

943
00:54:19.471 --> 00:54:20.191
But they can just,

944
00:54:20.191 --> 00:54:24.000
they can just book it through the forest and step on stuff that I'm feeling

945
00:54:24.001 --> 00:54:26.100
through my boots.
But they just,
they just keep going.

946
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:29.710
<v 2>Yeah.
Do you ever see that show a dual survivor?
Just like,</v>

947
00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:32.620
I don't think it's on anymore,
but yeah.
Yeah.
That guy is crazy.

948
00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.230
The guy walks around barefoot everywhere.
Everywhere.
Yeah.
He does everything,

949
00:54:35.231 --> 00:54:39.370
Cody,
isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a,
he's a,
an odd character.

950
00:54:39.371 --> 00:54:43.330
Like he has this house that he built that's some sort of a sustainable house.

951
00:54:43.331 --> 00:54:44.680
It's got,
you know,

952
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:48.970
I think in what uses like a sod for the roof or something like that.

953
00:54:48.971 --> 00:54:52.630
And then his whole deal is like surviving with minimal equipment,

954
00:54:52.631 --> 00:54:54.310
but he does everything barefoot.

955
00:54:54.311 --> 00:54:59.170
He runs around barefoot and his feet are like this thick skins.
Disgusting.

956
00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.900
You don't want to give that due to foot massage.
Yeah.

957
00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:04.720
He probably wouldn't fill it.
Yeah.
Well it's like a shoe.

958
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:06.430
I mean he wears a permanent shoe.

959
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:11.560
I guess that's like really what's supposed to happen to people,
you know?
Yeah,

960
00:55:11.561 --> 00:55:14.830
I think so too.
Um,
but it's kind of funny,
like,
you know,
you don't,
you know,

961
00:55:14.831 --> 00:55:17.620
for martial arts,
but like the bottom of your heel,

962
00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:20.890
you could fucking pound on things with your heel,

963
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:26.190
but like that same impact on your Shin would be very painful.

964
00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.710
You know?
It's kind of interesting how that works.
Yeah.

965
00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:31.360
<v 1>Uh,
even on the ultimate fighter West Sims,
when I fought him,</v>

966
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:35.600
I mean it was like a minute and a half finally got him to the ground in and put

967
00:55:35.601 --> 00:55:39.020
them in an arm triangle.
But,
but before that he fractured a,
a smell I liked.

968
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:39.970
It was a small fracture,

969
00:55:39.971 --> 00:55:43.780
hairline fracture in my foot with just a couple of foot stomps.
I mean,

970
00:55:43.781 --> 00:55:46.600
he just did it a couple times.
I was like,
Dang,
I've never,
you know,

971
00:55:46.601 --> 00:55:48.760
we didn't train for that in the,
in the gym and stuff.

972
00:55:48.761 --> 00:55:51.790
So I never felt that before.
But right when he did,
I knew whenever,

973
00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:55.980
whenever the hairline fracture came.
Yeah.
Just being able to stomp with that is

974
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.590
<v 2>yeah.
But yeah,
the heels amazingly powerful,</v>

975
00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:03.730
which is one of the reasons why I've been sort of a proponent for no gloves.

976
00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:08.500
I kind of,
I've been on this kick for like a few months now.
I mean,

977
00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:13.310
I'd always been aware that gloves really protect the hands more than they,
uh,

978
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:16.270
protect,
uh,
the opponent definitely.
You know,

979
00:56:16.271 --> 00:56:19.290
they really protect the guy who's using the gloves more than the guy who,

980
00:56:19.291 --> 00:56:23.260
who you're hitting with.
I think it's kind of unnatural in a way.

981
00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:27.310
And I think it's also unrealistic like wrist wraps as well,

982
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.870
wrist wraps and gloves.

983
00:56:28.871 --> 00:56:33.871
I think those probably contribute more to a poet's getting hurt then.

984
00:56:33.911 --> 00:56:37.060
Then anything sort of like the same argument that a lot of people think that

985
00:56:37.061 --> 00:56:41.110
football would be safer if people knew more helmets.
If you can,

986
00:56:41.111 --> 00:56:44.650
we'll kick somebody in the head with your heel,

987
00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:48.100
which is like one of the most powerful kicks he can throw.
Like go to,

988
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:51.010
it's like Barboza.
Yeah,
Edson Barboza and Terry Edom,

989
00:56:51.011 --> 00:56:55.870
which is what crazy Raisie knock out the first knockout ever in the UFC from a

990
00:56:55.871 --> 00:56:56.590
wheelchair.

991
00:56:56.590 --> 00:57:01.590
But if that is legal like and you could spin and kick someone with the heel,

992
00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:06.430
why do your knuckles have a pad on them?
That seems completely ridiculous to me.

993
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:07.780
It doesn't make any sense.

994
00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:11.920
And it seems also like an unrealistic depiction of martial arts.

995
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:14.920
Of course,
if you want to go that route,
you would say,

996
00:57:14.921 --> 00:57:18.640
well you shouldn't work cops either.
Cause that's kind of unrealistic to yeah,

997
00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:22.870
I like wearing that.
Yeah.
I'm not a big fan of kicking people in the balls.
Yeah.

998
00:57:22.871 --> 00:57:25.270
But even even with the gloves,
being able to hook into it,
you know,

999
00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.100
to it and pool.
I mean that,

1000
00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:31.100
that's a little trick that everyone guys use that for,
to submit guys too.

1001
00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:32.680
I've seen guys get,

1002
00:57:32.681 --> 00:57:37.681
he chokes and get teens where they'll hook their own glove and use it to finish

1003
00:57:37.811 --> 00:57:41.800
a choke because it's like you can get some mad leverage along with like grabbing

1004
00:57:41.801 --> 00:57:44.680
it and that guy's not gonna be able to hand fight it very easy.
Yeah,
no man.

1005
00:57:44.681 --> 00:57:48.010
Once you hook it,
you're allowed to hook your own gloves too,
which is nothing.

1006
00:57:48.011 --> 00:57:51.040
You're allowed to Hook your own.
You're allowed to grab your own shorts,

1007
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:52.720
like say if a guy is trying to,
yeah.

1008
00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:54.790
If you Tris guys trying to get you in a Kimora,

1009
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:58.000
you can grab your own shorts and hold on.
As long as they're not,

1010
00:57:58.450 --> 00:58:03.010
as long as they're not his.
Wow.
Yeah.
It was just kind of squirrely,
you know?

1011
00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:07.890
But that's,
it's a frustrating thing too when you see two guys grapple and,
um,

1012
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:10.540
one guy is trying to take down the other guys grabbing the guy shorts and the

1013
00:58:10.541 --> 00:58:13.150
referee will say stop and they will stop.

1014
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:18.150
But that brief moment where they held on might've been just enough for them to

1015
00:58:18.311 --> 00:58:21.520
scoot their hips out and,
and defend.
Yeah.
You know,

1016
00:58:21.521 --> 00:58:22.930
I think everybody should wear tights too.

1017
00:58:22.931 --> 00:58:26.260
I think everybody should wear like old school Marco who asked Little Bikini

1018
00:58:26.261 --> 00:58:30.790
briefs.
That'd be great.
Dennis Hallman.
Yeah.
Like Dad,
it's all,

1019
00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:34.450
but then it's almost like,
oh,
you almost got fired from the UFC for that man.

1020
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:38.740
I think so.
I think there's almost a slip.
Yeah.
Well apparently he lost a bet.

1021
00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:41.350
So Dennis Hallman came out.
See if you can find a picture of that acts.

1022
00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:42.184
They're hilarious.

1023
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:47.080
Dennis Hallman came out with the smallest bikini briefs and man pathways

1024
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:50.710
probably of all time.
It was pretty ridiculous.

1025
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:57.220
I don't remember man.
I think it has.
Yeah,
there,
there are down there.

1026
00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:02.020
I think training mills a lot.
It was a training task.
I think it is.
Yeah.

1027
00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:05.560
That is what it,
but meanwhile,
why is that?

1028
00:59:05.561 --> 00:59:09.220
Homoerotic like why is everybody upset about that?
But like,
you know,

1029
00:59:09.221 --> 00:59:10.390
if they're longer shorts,

1030
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:14.290
I mean his junk has covered up or we terrified of the upper thigh.

1031
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:17.590
Like what is it?
What is everyone afraid of?
How come you can see his nipples?

1032
00:59:17.591 --> 00:59:21.980
Nobody freaks out.
You know,
and what he freaks out,
the guy's bare chested,

1033
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:25.790
<v 1>but for some reason having little shorts on as offensive.
Yeah.
I don't get it.</v>

1034
00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:29.050
That was even the thing I would do to joke around with guys was where Montes uh,

1035
00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:31.880
that Wayans cause he couldn't look into my eyes serious if I had these,

1036
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:36.050
these leopard a man panties on with,
with sequins and things like that.

1037
00:59:36.051 --> 00:59:37.400
Kept guys from looking into your eyes.

1038
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:39.800
Well they would grant or something like that,
you know,

1039
00:59:39.801 --> 00:59:43.490
they wouldn't like really do the deep stare down,
if that makes sense.

1040
00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:45.860
You made a post like a recently,

1041
00:59:45.861 --> 00:59:49.000
like within the last six months saying that you were considering,
uh,

1042
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:53.420
coming back to finding potentially,
yeah.
I mean I think I should give it a shot.

1043
00:59:53.770 --> 00:59:56.540
Um,
how old are you now?
27.
He's still young.

1044
00:59:56.630 --> 01:00:00.290
I'm a year younger than the youngest dude.
I thought.
So in my 15 fights,

1045
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:03.230
the youngest guy was 28 years old.
Now I think I was 19 or 20.

1046
01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.720
And so,
I mean,

1047
01:00:05.721 --> 01:00:10.721
I think that that the reason I would want to really at least give it my full

1048
01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:14.690
effort,
at least for a season,
at least for a year to see what,
see what I can do.

1049
01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:18.320
See,
I'm not taking,
you know,
big really tough fights,
you know,

1050
01:00:18.321 --> 01:00:21.690
right when I come back.
But to build my way back up,
um,

1051
01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:26.600
because if I could use the platform,
if fighting to,
and the name of,

1052
01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:28.550
of the nonprofit is fight for the forgotten,

1053
01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:31.430
if I could literally fight for the forgotten and,
and,

1054
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:33.770
and fulfill my first promise to give them a voice.

1055
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:38.480
The man I'm passionate about both those are like my two greatest passions,

1056
01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:42.500
you know,
is,
is,
is MMA.
I can't,
I can't stay away from it.
And Congo,

1057
01:00:42.501 --> 01:00:45.680
if I got to the Internet,
it was,
it was,
it was,
yeah,

1058
01:00:45.681 --> 01:00:50.240
it was straight up the Eugene t yeah,
the underground.
It was what I had to check.

1059
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:54.080
The first thing I was on was had to get my MMA fix.
And then,
I mean,

1060
01:00:54.081 --> 01:00:59.030
I'm so passionate about the pygmies and uh,
and seeing just,
just what I can do.

1061
01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:00.170
I mean,
there's even a,
uh,

1062
01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:04.370
an African proverb or Congolese proverb about mosquitoes and it says,

1063
01:01:04.371 --> 01:01:06.620
if you think you're too small to make a difference,

1064
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:08.750
try sleeping in a room with a mosquito,

1065
01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:13.220
is there to try sleeping in a closed room with a mosquito.
And so,
um,

1066
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:17.570
I just think that,
that,
that me and my mind,
like at first when I got there,

1067
01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:21.200
it was like there's no way I can make a difference.
Um,
and then,

1068
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:25.310
and then I met some great people that already were,
had a heart for it.

1069
01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:29.630
And then if I could use fighting as a platform,
um,
I'm passionate about it.

1070
01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.000
If he use a platform to say,
Hey,
from my wind bonus,

1071
01:01:32.001 --> 01:01:33.920
we're going to buy this much more land,

1072
01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:36.080
we're going to drill three more water wells,

1073
01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:40.250
we're going to fund this new farming project.
Um,

1074
01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:44.840
I think if I didn't do it,
I'd be an old man one day wondering what if,

1075
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:46.580
what if I would've tried it?
You know,

1076
01:01:46.581 --> 01:01:48.740
and if I just went to the jungle because I would love,
I mean,

1077
01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.640
I feel like I could be completely content with living in a twig and leaf hut

1078
01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:57.350
for,
I don't know,
maybe the rest of my life,
at least for a while.

1079
01:01:57.410 --> 01:02:01.910
But if I just did that,
then you know that nobody's going to know about it.

1080
01:02:01.911 --> 01:02:06.590
Nobody is going to support it.
Um,
and so if I could use this as a,
as just a tool,

1081
01:02:06.591 --> 01:02:10.370
a platform,
um,
I would have to take it super serious.
There's no way I could just,

1082
01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:13.860
you know,
lackadaisically come back into fighting.
But um,

1083
01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.350
but I've been training at all.

1084
01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:19.530
I'm getting back into it with a team take down and Dallas Fort Worth.
Okay.

1085
01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.520
So you,
are you living out there now?
Yeah,
I am.
So that's where a great spot.

1086
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:28.170
It's a great place to train.
Yeah.
Do that.
I love how Mark Lehman trains just,

1087
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:31.320
he's a genius.
Yeah.
I mean I've,
I've never seen it in a gym.

1088
01:02:31.321 --> 01:02:35.670
Maybe you have out here in Cali,
but we,
we walk into the cage or they do,

1089
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.460
I've only done a few times there,
but that's going to be my gym I think.

1090
01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:43.090
And so whenever,
whenever you walk in,
he's got the,

1091
01:02:43.091 --> 01:02:47.420
the flat screens all around the cage and he's got his,
his Mac and a,

1092
01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:51.430
if he's showing you a move,
he'll show you three,
four,
five fights that he's,

1093
01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.660
that this move has been finished in the UFC or the promotions.

1094
01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:56.880
And I'm so if you doubt them,
he's going to say,
hey,

1095
01:02:56.881 --> 01:03:00.990
pull up to his assistant will say,
hey,
pull this,
this fight up to this,
you know,

1096
01:03:00.991 --> 01:03:04.650
this much into it.
And then he'll start breaking down the fight,

1097
01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:08.880
breaking down the move,
the setup and how to finish.
So I think it's great.
Yeah,

1098
01:03:08.881 --> 01:03:12.720
he's a wizard when it comes to MMA knowledge and Jujitsu knowledge.

1099
01:03:12.721 --> 01:03:14.160
Like he always has been like,

1100
01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:17.940
he's always been like completely engrossed in the world as you Jitsu.

1101
01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:22.530
He was one of those guys like way back in the day that had like all these moves

1102
01:03:22.531 --> 01:03:27.470
categorized and he had like folders and files for basically every mall.

1103
01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:31.860
I'd never even heard of anybody that like sort of broke it down the way he did.

1104
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.750
Yeah.
So that,
that's what I love about that team.

1105
01:03:33.751 --> 01:03:38.751
Whenever I walked in there I was thoroughly impressed because they treat it like

1106
01:03:38.791 --> 01:03:41.670
any other,
like a professional sport.
Yeah.

1107
01:03:41.671 --> 01:03:44.610
You walk in and the water,
the supplements,

1108
01:03:44.611 --> 01:03:46.770
the whatever you need is at your disposal.

1109
01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:48.660
And then whenever you get in there to train,

1110
01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:52.700
you have five full time coaches that are paid,
you know,
just to train you.

1111
01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:56.490
So he had a lot of focus and the,
their,
their training the guys really,
right.

1112
01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.900
I like what they're doing with heavyweights actually with a row shalt,
um,

1113
01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.680
he's training five days a week.

1114
01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:05.280
And what I used to do is always train six days a week and I train two to three

1115
01:04:05.281 --> 01:04:08.280
times a day.
And that's what Brendan would do.
And that's what Shane would do.

1116
01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:12.210
And that's what,
you know,
I think attributed to a lot of our,
our,
our injuries.

1117
01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:13.560
But with Rochelle,

1118
01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.990
they train five days a week and make sure they're getting his cardio up,

1119
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.710
but he can't train like a,
125 pounds or hundred 35 pounder.

1120
01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:23.280
It were heavyweights are taking more of a pounding on their body.

1121
01:04:23.281 --> 01:04:27.120
So you got to find a way to,
to,
to not just train harder but train smarter.

1122
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:30.480
That's interesting.
Um,
is it just because of the,

1123
01:04:30.481 --> 01:04:35.180
the gravity just carrying the extra weight,
the pressure on the joints?
Like,

1124
01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:38.190
why do you think that a heavyweight can only train five days a week?

1125
01:04:38.191 --> 01:04:40.860
Like what is it?
I don't think they can only train five days a week,

1126
01:04:40.861 --> 01:04:44.910
but I think it's a smart move for Roche Shelton and I think it would be a smart

1127
01:04:44.911 --> 01:04:48.180
move for me to do to um,
and maybe other guys would adopted.
I don't know.

1128
01:04:48.181 --> 01:04:51.750
But for me,
whenever you look at the heavyweight division,
I mean,

1129
01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:55.800
they can end the fight at any minute,
you know,
and you look at the one 45,

1130
01:04:55.801 --> 01:04:58.830
one 35 one 25,
the smaller guys,
they're really exciting fights.

1131
01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:02.280
Super talented guys.
Worldclass without a doubt.

1132
01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.900
But sometimes there's just not the same weight and power behind their punches.

1133
01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:10.960
I'm behind their takedowns behind everything.
I mean,
it goes from,
you know,

1134
01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:15.000
255 pounders equal almost one of us,
you know,

1135
01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:17.010
they're a little more than one of us.
And then,

1136
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:21.190
then now you have 500 pounds colliding into the mat whenever you're taking

1137
01:05:21.191 --> 01:05:23.710
someone down or punching.
There's just all this stuff that,

1138
01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.590
that I think you take a lot more of a beating on your body.
Well,

1139
01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:28.840
certainly cardio wise,
it's very different.

1140
01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:30.890
That's what makes Kayne so unique is that he,

1141
01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:35.350
he can keep up a pace that's usually reserved for people that are like one 70,

1142
01:05:35.351 --> 01:05:39.760
he can do at two 40.
He's,
he's so unique in that way.
Right.

1143
01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:42.580
And maybe if on the,
if you're going to train six days,

1144
01:05:42.581 --> 01:05:46.640
it's something that's specifically about recovery or cardio or both.
Um,

1145
01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:51.400
because the way that we were doing it at grudge and that's a worldclass gym.

1146
01:05:51.401 --> 01:05:56.050
I love it.
But,
um,
something I look back and see from assessing just,

1147
01:05:56.051 --> 01:05:59.920
just my opinion as me and we were,
we were,
you know,

1148
01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:04.180
three days a week,
training,
sparring hard and for heavyweight sparring hard,

1149
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:07.270
three days a week,
you're taking your,
you're taking a lot of punishment.

1150
01:06:07.271 --> 01:06:09.970
You're dishing out a lot of punishment and so were,
were,

1151
01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:14.800
you don't even have time on Sunday.
It's not,
it's not enough time to,
to rest him,

1152
01:06:14.801 --> 01:06:17.890
to recuperate and to,
for your body to heal up.
Yeah.

1153
01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:20.800
Especially if you're sparring Shane fucking car.
Well Yeah Dude,
that guy,

1154
01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:24.400
that guy.
It was scary.
It was still still still scary.
Absolutely.

1155
01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:27.760
But whenever he would,
he would throw a hook.
You would,
your body would,

1156
01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:31.300
would quake,
it would stand like a ripple effect through your body.
You know,

1157
01:06:31.301 --> 01:06:36.220
he's a big boy.
Yeah.
Big Ass bones to yeah.
Yeah.
And again,
his issue,

1158
01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:39.440
it was the same issue.
It was cardio.
I mean go to the Brock Lesnar fight me,

1159
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:42.460
he had Brock Lesnar all but out in that first round,

1160
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.610
but the second round came around and he just was spent,

1161
01:06:45.611 --> 01:06:48.660
he just emptied his gas tank in that first round.
And if you,

1162
01:06:48.661 --> 01:06:52.090
if you look at it though,
he,
he was,
I mean if you look at how he's training,

1163
01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.020
he was training six days a week and so somehow that cardio didn't come and even

1164
01:06:56.021 --> 01:07:00.120
training six days a week.
So,
um,
I don't know what the,

1165
01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:01.780
I think maybe it was also that adrenaline dump.

1166
01:07:01.781 --> 01:07:03.850
It think he's going to finish off brush,
all that other stuff.

1167
01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:06.820
Who forgot to three tables talking about how when he was punching him,

1168
01:07:06.821 --> 01:07:10.960
you literally forgot to breathe because he was just figured like let's just

1169
01:07:10.961 --> 01:07:13.030
sprint and this is going to be the end here.

1170
01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.000
It was very close to me and then so I could,

1171
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:19.300
I can understand what his mind frame was as close as you could ever get.
I mean,

1172
01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:22.180
it was like it many people would have stopped that fight.

1173
01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:25.300
Many refs would have stopped that fight.
Yeah,
absolutely.
It's cool they gave,

1174
01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:29.850
I mean it's cool they gave brocket chance to,
to recover.
I mean I,
I,

1175
01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:35.410
I,
I love Carlin and he's a great friend and he's good,
great,
great person.

1176
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.111
But it's,

1177
01:07:36.111 --> 01:07:39.880
it's cool to see whenever a guy can have that time to recover and see during the

1178
01:07:39.881 --> 01:07:43.390
round them recovering and come back and win.
Yeah,
that was an issue this weekend.

1179
01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:47.520
I'm like the Dan Henderson fight in particular,
like that fight was stopped.
Yeah.

1180
01:07:47.521 --> 01:07:50.290
Like fairly quickly.
He got tagged by Gago Musashi.

1181
01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:54.760
And in a way I kind of understand because I think that a referee,

1182
01:07:54.761 --> 01:07:59.761
sometimes we'll look at a guy who was older and judge it slightly differently

1183
01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:03.970
than a guy,
like maybe say who's,
who's younger,
like,
uh,
like frank.

1184
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.670
I always go to this one example,
Frankie Edgar Gray Maynard,

1185
01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:11.320
they could have stopped that fight multiple times and Frankie came on to stop

1186
01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:14.620
gray Maynard in the second fight.
Wow.
You know,
I mean,
it was a,
is an amazing,

1187
01:08:14.621 --> 01:08:15.530
amazing fight.
But

1188
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.100
<v 2>if you go back in and watch that fight,
watch that first round.</v>

1189
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.800
There's so many moments where you say,
like,

1190
01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:24.980
if a guy was quick to pull the trigger,
it could be over.

1191
01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:30.230
And not everybody's Frankie Edgar either like the other one was,
um,
uh,

1192
01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:35.000
this weekend,
uh,
Andy Ogel and uh,
I don't want to mispronounce his name,

1193
01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:39.560
so let me say it right now.
The guy from that was finished,
but from my rack,

1194
01:08:39.561 --> 01:08:44.240
right?
Yeah.
Um,
hold on one second.
I shouldn't miss miss that fight.

1195
01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:49.100
It didn't see it.
Makwan Amr kind of who is a bad motherfucker.
This kid,

1196
01:08:49.101 --> 01:08:49.934
first of all,

1197
01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:54.710
this kid goes into the octagon and does these perfect flips like,

1198
01:08:54.711 --> 01:08:56.720
and you get like right away you can say like,
Whoa,

1199
01:08:56.721 --> 01:08:58.580
this kid is like a serious gymnast.

1200
01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.320
And then hits Andy Yoga with this ridiculous flying knee like a launched across

1201
01:09:03.321 --> 01:09:06.230
the rank tags,
him and his flying knee and then tags them and the number God,

1202
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:08.660
and then the referee stopped the fight.
And I even said,

1203
01:09:08.661 --> 01:09:11.810
I probably shouldn't have said that.
I,
I thought it was a premature stoppage.

1204
01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.820
The referee could see better than I can obviously,

1205
01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:17.270
like whether or not a guy's eyes rolled behind his head,
but you know,

1206
01:09:17.271 --> 01:09:21.040
Andy Yoga was pretty upset and maybe I was going on that,
but the,

1207
01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:23.780
the stoppage in that fight was,

1208
01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.190
it's certainly more understandable,
I think.
Then the Henderson fight,

1209
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:33.300
the Henderson fight was like one shot and he went down and then stomach.
Well,

1210
01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.600
he tagged him mean he was kind of grazing,

1211
01:09:35.601 --> 01:09:37.220
but it was kind of like the temple area,

1212
01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:42.500
which always fucks with your equilibrium.
Yeah.
But this,
uh,
Amir Khan,

1213
01:09:42.501 --> 01:09:46.460
he hit him with this flying knee.
Like he traveled so far.

1214
01:09:46.461 --> 01:09:50.030
Like if you watch the flying knee,
see him,
you could find it.
Jamie is,

1215
01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:54.470
is opening move.
He hits him with this ridiculous flying knee.
I mean,
it was just,

1216
01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.230
he launched himself like 14,

1217
01:09:57.231 --> 01:10:00.740
15 feet across the kid's a freak athlete,
man.

1218
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.550
And I'd heard that about him entering into this fight is a fight.
Eight seconds.

1219
01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.990
Wow.
Yeah.
And it was amazing.
He's a,
he's pretty impressive.

1220
01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:14.390
That's great.
He said what he said about me,

1221
01:10:14.391 --> 01:10:17.340
I thought he,
I thought he was a drunk.
That's what he said about me.

1222
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:23.780
He's a funny dude,
man.
He's got a lot of personality too,
man.
He's very funny.

1223
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:27.080
Very funny.
But find the fight itself.
Don't just pull shit up.

1224
01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:32.750
I think.
I think the thing with a,
you can't look at it without us seeing it.
Yeah.

1225
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:37.820
Why is that?
Oh,
but the audience doesn't see it.
Is that what's going on?
Oh,

1226
01:10:37.821 --> 01:10:41.240
okay.
That's fine.
Um,
but,
uh,

1227
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.780
I think with that Dan Henderson fight,
I think maybe the,

1228
01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:47.630
the angle because I watched a couple of times and I think maybe the angle of the

1229
01:10:47.631 --> 01:10:52.280
ref,
he was kind of maybe behind kind of a massage.
He,
whenever he,
he,
he hit him.

1230
01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:56.180
And then whenever,
whenever Hindou's head kind of hit the back of the cage,

1231
01:10:56.181 --> 01:10:59.210
maybe that,
that scared the ref and prompted him to stop it early.

1232
01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:03.380
I always wonder when you go to new places to whether or not commissions are more

1233
01:11:03.381 --> 01:11:04.910
sensitive,
you know,

1234
01:11:04.911 --> 01:11:09.890
because maybe Sweden has like less sensitive.
Uh,
we're were,

1235
01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:12.740
referees are more sensitive to fighters getting injured.

1236
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.350
We find that in Boston and Boston is stop cuts.

1237
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:20.510
They stop fights on cuts way quicker than other places.
Like Mark [inaudible],

1238
01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.100
who's from Boston told me they've always had issues with that.

1239
01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.200
I can Boston when fighters get cut,

1240
01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:28.590
they'll stop it way quicker than they would say in Vegas.

1241
01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:32.100
Where these all Swedish reps kind of from that area?
No.
Um,

1242
01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:35.910
a lot of the guys were English guys.
Um,
it was,
it was different.

1243
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:37.260
I know in a,

1244
01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:42.150
in Finland they have the brutal MMA that you can headbutts still and in Finland

1245
01:11:42.151 --> 01:11:43.080
stuff,
right?
Isn't that right?

1246
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:46.050
Is that what I mean they at least a couple of years ago and whenever I went to

1247
01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:50.190
golden glory out in Amsterdam and I was training with Allister for a bit,

1248
01:11:50.191 --> 01:11:54.840
but also,
uh,
do you remember John Olive and Emo?
Yeah.
Thank you John.

1249
01:11:54.841 --> 01:11:58.480
All of animal animal who is a,
uh,
Abu Dhabi champion.
Yeah.

1250
01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:03.510
Fantastic grappler.
Absolutely a beast on the ground.
He was like,
I dunno,

1251
01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:06.420
like a spider in his legs and everything was,
were,
were nuts,

1252
01:12:06.421 --> 01:12:11.220
how they could wrap around you.
Um,
but he was from Norway and there MMA,

1253
01:12:11.221 --> 01:12:13.330
they just,
they,
they were very,
very resistant.

1254
01:12:13.331 --> 01:12:15.810
And this was when I was training with him back in like 2008,
I think.

1255
01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.320
But they're very,
very resistant to,
I thought it was a brutal barbaric sport,

1256
01:12:19.321 --> 01:12:22.360
all that.
But then in Finland,
just a couple of countries away,

1257
01:12:22.361 --> 01:12:25.230
he could still head button.
That's where he's getting some of his first fights,

1258
01:12:25.231 --> 01:12:29.790
I think.
Wow.
It was just such a contrast and how they viewed the sport.

1259
01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.470
This is the flying knee wash.
His kid

1260
01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:35.070
kid just flies out.

1261
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:38.623
<v 0>Wow.</v>

1262
01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:44.860
<v 2>I mean it was cool.
It was a quick stop.
But man,
that kid that flying,</v>

1263
01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:47.170
he's an athlete.
Fucking incredible.
Look at that.

1264
01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:50.950
And you only took like three or four steps before he launched in there.

1265
01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:59.080
Wow.
Yeah.
Now ogle tried to ref tackle the referee,
which is always bad.

1266
01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:02.320
I just,
you know,
I get sensitive because Olga was in the cage.

1267
01:13:02.321 --> 01:13:06.550
He was super freaked out and upset.
He thought the fight was stopped too quickly.

1268
01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:11.920
It's weird.
Dang man.
It's hard to say when to stop and when not to.
It's hard.

1269
01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:13.690
You want to give a guy a chance to recover,

1270
01:13:13.691 --> 01:13:17.710
but you also want to save the guy from unnecessary punishment if he can't defend

1271
01:13:17.711 --> 01:13:18.580
himself.
Absolutely.

1272
01:13:18.581 --> 01:13:21.340
They have the fucking hardest job in the world next to fighters.
His referees.

1273
01:13:21.341 --> 01:13:23.340
Yeah.
I mean I wouldn't want to know all the backlash that they get.

1274
01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:26.110
I think it's like fighters,
number one.
Of course.
Referees,
number two,

1275
01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:30.320
judges three for some of the,
I think I'm way down the line.

1276
01:13:30.321 --> 01:13:33.730
It's like Bruce buffers jobs probably harder than mine.
I mean my job is,

1277
01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:37.870
I'm just reacting to things,
you know,
the only time it becomes an issue,

1278
01:13:37.871 --> 01:13:41.560
it's like things like if I'm critical of a stoppage or from critical of judging

1279
01:13:41.561 --> 01:13:46.120
and then it becomes a point of debate.
But I think that the controversy,
you know,

1280
01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:50.050
especially subjective controversy,
whether it's a,
you,
you can agree or disagree,

1281
01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:54.410
I think it's important because it starts the discussion.
Like,
you know,

1282
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.160
what should be legal,
which shouldn't be legal,
what should happen,

1283
01:13:57.161 --> 01:13:58.030
what shouldn't happen.

1284
01:13:58.210 --> 01:14:01.750
Like there's a lot of people that have like some really strong feelings about

1285
01:14:01.751 --> 01:14:05.260
the shape of the gloves right now and the,
that they're contributing to.

1286
01:14:05.261 --> 01:14:09.760
I pokes and that's something I've had some recent conversations with Dana and

1287
01:14:09.761 --> 01:14:13.090
with Lorenzo and they're of opinion.
I think that,
uh,

1288
01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:16.120
the fighters need to be penalized more because they'd gloves been the same for a

1289
01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:20.230
long time.
But back in the day it wasn't nearly as much of an issue.

1290
01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.020
If you go back to like,
you know,

1291
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:26.160
UFC 37 and a half or UFC 40 or UFC,

1292
01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:31.170
you don't see a lot of Ipos but now it's hard to go one fight or one event

1293
01:14:31.751 --> 01:14:35.140
rather without a couple of fights.
Having I poke issues.

1294
01:14:35.141 --> 01:14:40.120
It's super common and I think maybe you can attribute that to a lot of Moy Thai

1295
01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.160
training because a lot of guys are doing this,

1296
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:46.180
which is really common in Muay Thai and step in with knees and you know all

1297
01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:50.230
these guys who do these things with gloves on,
which are,
you know,

1298
01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:53.830
totally fine with a glove on and you're palming the guy's face with a glove on

1299
01:14:53.831 --> 01:14:57.010
it and throwing leg kicks or a knee or elbows behind it.

1300
01:14:57.011 --> 01:15:01.120
But doing those fucking fingers,
man,
fingers just go in the eyes so much.

1301
01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:04.180
It drives me crazy.
Then we see guys like Bisping who's,

1302
01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:08.470
he's got one eye that looks completely different from his other eye now because

1303
01:15:08.471 --> 01:15:09.191
of surgery,

1304
01:15:09.191 --> 01:15:13.150
detached retina surgery and then they have to put oil inside his retina.

1305
01:15:13.151 --> 01:15:16.390
And I don't even know how much he can see out of his right eye.

1306
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:18.320
But when you look at him in the eyes,
he's,

1307
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:22.480
his one eye looks very different than the other guy.
The other eye,
Alan Belcher,

1308
01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:25.780
same thing.
Even Anthony Johnson have problem with that,
right?
Yeah.

1309
01:15:25.781 --> 01:15:26.531
With Kevin Burns,

1310
01:15:26.531 --> 01:15:29.890
he had Kevin Burns poked him in the eye and then in this fight Gustafson

1311
01:15:29.891 --> 01:15:32.830
accidentally poked him and tie it.
They're totally accidental,

1312
01:15:32.831 --> 01:15:35.370
but it's like this thing where guys are doing that.

1313
01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:39.030
Jon Jones is the number one guy as far as,
uh,

1314
01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.670
like the controversy because he's so tall and long.

1315
01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:44.920
That's an excellent strategy to,

1316
01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:47.560
he's almost like doing that cartoon thing where he puts his gun to your head and

1317
01:15:47.561 --> 01:15:49.810
you're swinging because he can't reach him.
Yeah.

1318
01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:54.760
So I wonder if there's a way to cover the fingers.
You know,
I've always wondered,

1319
01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:55.380
I mean,

1320
01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:58.090
this is kind of hypocritical because I think they shouldn't be wearing gloves at

1321
01:15:58.091 --> 01:15:58.570
all,

1322
01:15:58.570 --> 01:16:03.570
but I wonder if there's a way to like put like some sort of a soft leather over

1323
01:16:04.421 --> 01:16:06.790
the tips of the fingers.
Like have the,
you know,

1324
01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:10.990
those old school Everlast boxing club,
those bad glove.
I remember those.

1325
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:14.170
They had the little Barnes had them almost.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1326
01:16:14.171 --> 01:16:16.480
They had the bar inside of him.
I don't know why they had the bar.

1327
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:21.220
Why was the bar there?
I Dunno.
It doesn't make any sense.
But those,
those gloves,

1328
01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:23.350
um,
almost like would be better.

1329
01:16:23.351 --> 01:16:26.470
Like some people think that it would be bad for grappling because the fingers

1330
01:16:26.471 --> 01:16:31.030
would not,
it wouldn't work as individuals,
but you never really do this anyway.

1331
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:34.180
You know,
if you use your thumbs at all,
you kind of use it like this.

1332
01:16:34.181 --> 01:16:37.630
It's very rare that you hook a finger and the thumb together.

1333
01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:40.090
I think the pride gloves,
you weren't really,
they were more,

1334
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:42.220
we have a pair of them around here somewhere.

1335
01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:46.900
We have a pair of him still the pride gloves,
they had far less problems,

1336
01:16:46.901 --> 01:16:51.570
but you know,
cro,
cop and Josh Barnett,
that was an issue.
Um,
I mean it gets it,

1337
01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.400
it happens.
Guys get poked in the eye.
It's almost like,

1338
01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:57.310
it seems like it's inevitable.
But Dana,

1339
01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.850
his opinion is that they should be panelized every time there's an eye poke one

1340
01:17:00.851 --> 01:17:04.630
point,
which yeah,
I mean it's pretty harsh,

1341
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:06.200
but you wouldn't do it.
Yeah.

1342
01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.550
I've never had an in my fights in a row at a problem.
Uh,

1343
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:12.900
the pride gloves or Blue Jamie.
Yeah.

1344
01:17:12.901 --> 01:17:14.150
I never had a problem with poking the guy in the,

1345
01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:17.900
I got poked in the eye once and it absolutely sucks because for the whole round,

1346
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:19.070
my,
my vision was,

1347
01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:22.910
was like it would double and it would turn black and it would just,

1348
01:17:22.911 --> 01:17:27.300
it just jacked with me.
The tie around.
These are the prog drugs.
Um,

1349
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.970
Brian from London real gave me these.
That's awesome.
Thank you Brian.
Um,

1350
01:17:32.050 --> 01:17:35.930
he has of history.
Yeah.
These are a,
nobody fought with these on,

1351
01:17:35.931 --> 01:17:37.910
but these are the lists,
the original pride gloves.

1352
01:17:37.911 --> 01:17:41.750
There's so they're very different and either there's a pronounced curve to them

1353
01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:46.820
that you don't get from the,
uh,
the,
the gloves the UFC uses ever last,

1354
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:49.820
which is now a sponsor of the UFC or,
uh,

1355
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:52.890
I don't know if you'd say sponsor or a partner or they're working together with

1356
01:17:52.891 --> 01:17:55.010
the UFC.
I guess we're going to use the Everlast close.

1357
01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:59.460
Everlast has an excellent MMA glove that is more curved than the,
uh,

1358
01:17:59.470 --> 01:18:03.780
the ones that we use now.
These all sore longer.
They're easy to,
to form to,
well,

1359
01:18:03.810 --> 01:18:05.520
whenever you get those UFC gloves,
you,

1360
01:18:05.521 --> 01:18:07.560
you instantly have to start breaking them in,
you know,

1361
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.080
and so I could see the argument of it making it harder to close your hand

1362
01:18:12.081 --> 01:18:14.480
sometimes.
Cause if they're not broken in like this,

1363
01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:19.400
then it's like these automatically make your hands curve.
Like automatically.

1364
01:18:19.401 --> 01:18:23.390
It's like by default your hand wants to curve.
I would think these would be,

1365
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:26.840
why don't they just go back to fucking pride club?
I don't understand.

1366
01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:29.260
I don't have to go back to this.
This seems like a good glove.
Yeah,

1367
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:33.830
absolutely man.
Yeah,
I dunno.

1368
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:37.550
I just feel like there's a better way.
And I feel like if you do,
you know,

1369
01:18:37.551 --> 01:18:40.310
that's that expression,
like what's the definition of insanity?

1370
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:43.130
Doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result.

1371
01:18:43.131 --> 01:18:46.520
Right now it's just this,
it seems like the gloves that we have now,

1372
01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:49.770
everyone says the same thing.
Every fighter that I've talked to that it,

1373
01:18:49.771 --> 01:18:52.280
it actually,
they make your hands straight now,

1374
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:54.800
especially as your hands fatigue as the rounds go on.

1375
01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.990
They literally make your hands straight now.

1376
01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:02.720
But the Bella tour gloves that they're using that Everlast designed or far more

1377
01:19:02.721 --> 01:19:06.160
curved,
so Everlast has like their own sort of,
um,

1378
01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:09.980
patented technology,
their patented design and uh,

1379
01:19:09.981 --> 01:19:14.390
they're also having less handbrakes to,
uh,
I didn't know that at all.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1380
01:19:14.391 --> 01:19:15.560
Beltour did,

1381
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:19.520
they did some sort of a study on handbrakes before the new gloves and hand after

1382
01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:22.640
the new gloves and they have much less breaks after the new gloves because of

1383
01:19:22.641 --> 01:19:26.480
the shape of it and the support on the top of the glove.

1384
01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:31.670
It lends more support to the metacarpals guess.
Well,
I dunno.

1385
01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.030
Just seem,
but then again,
like I said,
I think they should be bare knuckled.

1386
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:38.660
I really do.
I think if you can hit,
so the Shin,
I was just about to ask you that.

1387
01:19:38.661 --> 01:19:41.240
Do you think you'd ever go back to that?
Not Right.

1388
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:44.960
I think it's too ingrained or to adopt it two part of the culture now.

1389
01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:47.780
I don't know man.
It's a weird thing.
It's like why?

1390
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:52.040
Why is everybody so hung up on like everything's staying the same?
First of all,

1391
01:19:52.041 --> 01:19:55.670
I think cups.
Cups are a huge guy.
Damn issue.

1392
01:19:55.930 --> 01:20:00.020
All right guys get hit with glancing blows to the sac and they go down.

1393
01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.530
I think there's a lot of guys that were really shitty cups.

1394
01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:06.470
Like there's some like you've seen if you're worn the diamond MMA,

1395
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:09.690
I heard them get them when we have him in the box suite.
That's awesome.

1396
01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:12.040
It gives you one had one and it might not fit your fucking,
yeah,

1397
01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:15.960
giant strapping glutes you savage.
But uh,
if they do fit,

1398
01:20:15.961 --> 01:20:19.320
see if you get a larger extra,
probably extra large,
whatever the bigger ones are.

1399
01:20:19.321 --> 01:20:23.100
But diamonds figured out a way to make this compression short with all these

1400
01:20:23.101 --> 01:20:26.550
straps.
And this cop that is like sort of,

1401
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:29.910
it's got a rubberized outside,
but it's hard as fuck around it.

1402
01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:34.740
And the compression shorts keep the glut,
the,
the a cup right over your junk.

1403
01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:39.120
And you could take full blast shots and you're not going to feel good.

1404
01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:43.280
But it feels way better than anything else I've ever used.
Yeah,
I've,

1405
01:20:43.290 --> 01:20:45.810
I've had the same fight.
I got my,
my Ipod,

1406
01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:50.730
I got a groin shot that splintered my cup.
It's splintered my cup.
And,

1407
01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.240
and uh,
I had a little cut,
a little cut from it.

1408
01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:59.580
I got kicking the pubic area,
but it was,
it was brutal and I hated,
hated that.

1409
01:20:59.581 --> 01:21:02.880
And then I to do,
to go to steel cups,
which it's got this in it.
Well,

1410
01:21:02.881 --> 01:21:07.140
the Steel Cup is,
I think probably one of the best,
that tie steel cup.
See that's,

1411
01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:10.170
that's their design.
It's a very good design of a cop,

1412
01:21:10.171 --> 01:21:12.470
but there's nothing too extraordinary about it.
But what's,

1413
01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:17.680
what's really interesting is the way it fits into the compression shorts,
the,

1414
01:21:17.850 --> 01:21:19.860
and this,
they,
they're constantly redesigning it.

1415
01:21:19.861 --> 01:21:23.820
They just had a new updated design.
It just sent me a couple of weeks ago.

1416
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:25.223
But um,

1417
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:30.440
I had a one incident in Jujitsu where I wasn't wearing a cup and I had a lot of

1418
01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:34.170
boy you,
um,
and uh,

1419
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:35.640
since then I went to cups.

1420
01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:40.410
But a lot of guys say that the Steel Tie Cup is one of the best,

1421
01:21:40.411 --> 01:21:43.800
uh,
solutions too.
Cause you could tie that fucker up tight.

1422
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.810
It feels super uncomfortable.

1423
01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:50.130
You know when it goes up your asshole area and the g string style.

1424
01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:54.000
But when it's tied in like really fucking tied in,

1425
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:58.300
that's one of the best ways to uh,
to protect yourself too.
But they,
they'll,

1426
01:21:58.350 --> 01:22:02.760
they outlawed steel cups in Jujitsu matches.
Whoa.
Oh yeah.

1427
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:05.430
Cause stuff like Frank Mir,
right,
with a breaking that up.
Yeah,

1428
01:22:05.431 --> 01:22:06.800
we'll the leverage you,

1429
01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:10.800
I mean it becomes like this insane fulcrum point because it's literally steal

1430
01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.500
and when that steel is pressed against your pelvis,

1431
01:22:13.501 --> 01:22:18.250
I mean that's like this crazy lever.
And if you get an arm there,
you know,
it's,

1432
01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:22.050
it's,
it's really unfair.
It's an unfair lever that doesn't exist in nature.

1433
01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:26.490
It's like the opposite of what nature gives you.
Like I've had a lot of people,

1434
01:22:26.491 --> 01:22:29.250
like you teach them how to do an Armbar,
like ah,
it hurts my balls.
Like,
yeah,

1435
01:22:29.251 --> 01:22:32.760
you got to get used to that.
Like an Armbar will probably hurt your balls,

1436
01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:36.090
but if you weren't a steel cup,
it hurts them way more than it hurts.

1437
01:22:36.091 --> 01:22:40.140
You popped a Tim Sylvia,
his arm and the forearm.
Right?
Well,

1438
01:22:40.141 --> 01:22:43.480
it's just something like,
certainly Frank Mir Yank and we'll for sure know.

1439
01:22:43.481 --> 01:22:47.610
And he's an incredible martial artist.
He's a Stud Jujitsu guy.

1440
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:50.940
The best guys ever.
Whenever you can get into Gira and do that to him,

1441
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:52.350
break his fucking arm.
Yeah.
That's,

1442
01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.200
and that's why he's the only guy in the UFC heavyweight division that's broken

1443
01:22:55.201 --> 01:22:58.410
to people's bones with submissions.
Wow.
You know,
I mean,

1444
01:22:58.411 --> 01:23:01.860
Frank Mir will go down in history is one of the greatest submission guys ever.

1445
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:05.900
For sure.
The Times of grapple with them,
I was like,
wow,
he's amazing.
He's a stud.

1446
01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.830
<v 1>He's a guy,
he's got a lot of fucking miles,
man.
He's,</v>

1447
01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:13.240
he's fought a lot of fucking hard fights.
But um,
those,
uh,
those steel cups,

1448
01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:17.170
like you can't wear them anymore in Jujitsu matches.
So I mean,

1449
01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.470
I wonder how long before people recognize that in MMA and say,

1450
01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:22.720
cause right now you could get away with wearing a steel cup,

1451
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:26.710
but like you ever had someone mount you and they have a steel cup on and like

1452
01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:30.130
compress your on your sternum.
It's brutal.
It's brutal.
Yeah.

1453
01:23:30.131 --> 01:23:33.790
Those are dangerous man.
That in that way.
Well,
Hey,
amen.
Thank you for this one.

1454
01:23:33.810 --> 01:23:36.610
And I'm excited.
I'm excited to give it a give it a whirl.
Yeah,

1455
01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:39.430
those guys are pretty dedicated man.
This diamond and I shouldn't say pretty,

1456
01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:42.610
they're very dedicated.
There's diamond MMA guys.
They've done a lot of,

1457
01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:46.780
they're constantly redesigning that thing too,
but I think that's an issue.

1458
01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:50.440
Like there's guys who were like the standard jock strap with like the little

1459
01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.300
silly cup inside of it.
That's just fine if you're playing softball,
you know.

1460
01:23:55.301 --> 01:24:00.280
But God dammit,
when you're getting kicked the we really need like a,
a better,

1461
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:05.170
a better design would come to my come to that.
Definitely me.
And Yeah.

1462
01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.340
Thank you so much for this.

1463
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:11.260
And I also wanted to thank you man coming in here because the village of the

1464
01:24:11.261 --> 01:24:14.660
Bofi is the village that you guys sponsored and um,
they got a water.
Well,

1465
01:24:14.661 --> 01:24:15.970
so I'm just thankful you're giving me this.

1466
01:24:15.971 --> 01:24:20.020
You sponsored my family getting water.
We even had,
I mean if it's okay,

1467
01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:21.910
I could show you a picture.
Yeah,
please have.

1468
01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:24.500
This is kind of the drilling process right here.
Is that,

1469
01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:28.090
is that something you brought over there?
Yeah,
well the,

1470
01:24:28.091 --> 01:24:32.470
the tripod legs we bought in Uganda and then we,
we hold him over.
Um,
so that's,

1471
01:24:32.471 --> 01:24:34.900
that's our drillers.
They get ready,
they put it on that tripod.

1472
01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:40.000
This is us getting ready in Bobo fee to put the,
uh,
the pump down.
Um,
and so that,

1473
01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.340
those bricks in that circular,
it's a,

1474
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:44.500
the cement well pad that we're getting ready to do.

1475
01:24:44.501 --> 01:24:46.840
But first we got to put the PVC down and put the pump.

1476
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:49.210
How do you find where to drill?

1477
01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:53.440
Do you get one of those dudes that has chicken bone thing?
Cause that shit work?

1478
01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:57.790
No,
I,
I'm not sure if that works but,
but there's,
there's uh,

1479
01:24:57.791 --> 01:25:02.140
some expensive equipment that you can get,
but we,
we really there for the,

1480
01:25:02.290 --> 01:25:06.100
for the things that they're going to do and where they are in the rain forest,

1481
01:25:06.130 --> 01:25:08.350
there's water there,
there's clean water's just under your feet.

1482
01:25:08.351 --> 01:25:10.840
You got to get to it.
And so most people don't know how to get to it.

1483
01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.490
So we show them how to get down there to it.

1484
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:17.410
And so it's once it's below six meters or 20 feet,
um,

1485
01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:21.550
the water force system,
uh,
it has been approved by us,

1486
01:25:21.670 --> 01:25:26.670
a USAID and the UN and all these places saying it's just as safe as,

1487
01:25:27.041 --> 01:25:29.920
as a lot of mechanic,
mechanic,
mechanicalized rigs.

1488
01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.780
And so what they do is they drill it down there.
And,
um,

1489
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:37.960
once you get to a certain depth,
you can put a cement,
um,

1490
01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.910
cement pad that protects it at the top.

1491
01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:44.980
But you also put like a clay sanitary seal up from,
from six meters and above.

1492
01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:48.430
And then that makes it hard place.
Sanitary seal,
clean,
sanitary seal.

1493
01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:51.820
Do you guys make that or does it something you purchased?
Like how does it work?

1494
01:25:51.821 --> 01:25:54.280
Can purchase it.
Um,
did you guys make it?

1495
01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:58.060
What we would do is we'd go find it from a heel falling on a tee shirt.

1496
01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:02.230
There we go.
Yeah.
So that helped me out to over there.
So you,
you,

1497
01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.380
you helped out a lot over there.
Um,

1498
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:08.180
but with the sanitary seal does is one meter of clay.

1499
01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:10.390
It can take a hundred years for,

1500
01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:15.560
for water to get through a one layer,
um,
impermeable,

1501
01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:19.250
impermeable clay.
And so if you can put that down there,

1502
01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:20.900
then it takes a long time.
So any,

1503
01:26:20.901 --> 01:26:23.570
any ground contaminants that are trying to pass through that first you have the

1504
01:26:23.571 --> 01:26:28.130
cement pad that we put on and then you have the clay sanitary seal beyond that,

1505
01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:29.980
and then it's,
it's not going to let the,

1506
01:26:29.981 --> 01:26:34.060
the ground contaminants and other kinds of waterborne disease get down in door

1507
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:37.020
are clean aquifer.
So we find we tried to find a,

1508
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:40.790
a good aquifer that's going to keep refilling.
Um,
that's,
that's fresh water,

1509
01:26:40.791 --> 01:26:45.050
clean water,
we test it,
all that.
And um,
did you have failed wells?

1510
01:26:45.051 --> 01:26:48.770
We tried to make some,
yeah,
we did.
We,
we,
the first,

1511
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:52.670
probably seven or eight we failed because I had like a short training here.

1512
01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:54.680
Then they also sent over a guy that had,

1513
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:58.400
had done 28 water wells in Congo and I was like,
great.

1514
01:26:58.401 --> 01:27:00.620
He's Congolese guy all the way across the country.

1515
01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:04.880
And we flew him out and he had,
he was 28 for 28.
He had never failed a well.

1516
01:27:05.210 --> 01:27:09.650
And then we got out there and we had seven in a row that we failed.
And so,
um,

1517
01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.700
so when you say failed,
like it didn't give you any water or as Badwater well,

1518
01:27:13.701 --> 01:27:16.220
I guess,
I guess,
sorry,
what we should,
what I should have said,

1519
01:27:16.221 --> 01:27:17.360
it was seven holes fail.

1520
01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:20.480
And so what we're doing is we're looking for the water and sometimes you're,

1521
01:27:20.530 --> 01:27:23.720
you're digging and you come across a layer of,

1522
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:27.320
of granite or a layer of our problem with sandstone.

1523
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:30.230
What happened was we'd have these clay are these um,

1524
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:34.970
these augers that have like these clause on it and we'd pull out scoop after

1525
01:27:34.971 --> 01:27:39.020
scoop after scoop and a foot at a time and sometimes get to like a sandstone

1526
01:27:39.021 --> 01:27:41.150
layer.
And if you get to that,
it's hard to advance through.

1527
01:27:41.151 --> 01:27:44.090
And so a lot of times you do need a machine that helps you get through that.

1528
01:27:44.091 --> 01:27:46.010
And so water four has been helping us with that.

1529
01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:50.120
And so normally under that sandstone layer,
there's,
there's fresh,

1530
01:27:50.150 --> 01:27:54.200
like a very good powerful aquifer that's going to give to probably be careful

1531
01:27:54.201 --> 01:27:56.700
about ruining your equipment on these.

1532
01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:00.410
We didn't want to waste our,
our tool.
So we would do is we'd,

1533
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:04.580
we'd pick up and we move cause we can't make those tools yet in Congo.

1534
01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:08.330
So we're bringing them from the states and it's high quality stuff.
Um,

1535
01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:11.180
hopefully one day we do have a metal shop there that we can start trying to

1536
01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:15.080
produce things that we'll,
we'll just blast through,
you know,
softer layers.

1537
01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:18.980
And so you're doing this not just in the,
the pygmy villages,

1538
01:28:18.981 --> 01:28:20.750
but in also these neighboring villages to,

1539
01:28:20.751 --> 01:28:24.620
to try to help these people out so that they don't get angry at the pygmies are

1540
01:28:24.621 --> 01:28:28.970
having this stuff.
Yeah,
absolutely.
So how many of these wells have you guys?
15.

1541
01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:32.900
Wow.
15 water wells.
There's,
each one of them is serving hundreds of people.

1542
01:28:32.901 --> 01:28:37.760
This is both.
This is the GRE.
Uh,
well this is the Joe Rogan experience water.

1543
01:28:37.761 --> 01:28:40.670
Well that's so cool.
Or dancing around at cow happy.

1544
01:28:40.671 --> 01:28:43.910
Those people that's actually saying,
Gee,
on my shoulders,
on that other picture,

1545
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:48.140
the hunter killed those two things.
That's so cool.
See when my shoulders,

1546
01:28:48.141 --> 01:28:51.350
if you go down,
this is a,
the chief's wife.
And uh,

1547
01:28:51.351 --> 01:28:54.830
she took one of our well jewelers sunglasses and she's a,

1548
01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:58.100
she was a second one to punk and uh,
so she loved it.

1549
01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:02.310
So then one more thing that's on top of that blue metal is that metal.

1550
01:29:02.311 --> 01:29:06.060
What is that thing that we're looking at that's pouring into the bucket?
Um,

1551
01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:09.000
the blue is actually just a,
a bucket that's holding our cement.

1552
01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:13.530
So it's like we use it as a form so we could pour the cement inside of it that

1553
01:29:13.531 --> 01:29:16.950
protects the,
the,
the pipes that are coming up from deep in the ground.

1554
01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:19.780
And the pump is a hand unit.
Is that how it works?
Yeah,
it's,

1555
01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:22.980
it's basically like a t handle.
And you,
you grabbed each side,
he pull up,

1556
01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:26.500
pull it down and pull up,
pumped down an old school cartoon dynamite things.
Yeah,

1557
01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:30.780
absolutely.
And every time you go down it sprays out,
I dunno,

1558
01:29:30.810 --> 01:29:34.620
maybe 10 ounces of water.
Wow.
That's amazing.
Yeah.

1559
01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:38.490
So what is the quality of life change for these people now that they have this

1560
01:29:38.491 --> 01:29:42.930
clean water?
I mean,
it must be amazing.
Yeah.
They,
they've,
they've never,

1561
01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:46.140
they've never,
uh,
seen clean water before.

1562
01:29:46.730 --> 01:29:48.680
They've never tasted it except for maybe rainwater,

1563
01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:52.890
but they don't have a way to collect it.
So it's like them going out and,
and uh,

1564
01:29:53.190 --> 01:29:57.690
if you go to the folder saying Badwater how often does it wrong?
The rains,

1565
01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:00.330
it rains quite often,
but they don't,
they don't collect the water.

1566
01:30:00.331 --> 01:30:02.520
It's easier for me to go to where the water sat,

1567
01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:06.570
where the creeks or streams that rose to get their,
their water there.

1568
01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.360
It seems like that would be an awesome supplement as well.

1569
01:30:09.450 --> 01:30:12.600
So that's the water that they usually get.
Yeah,
that,
that actually isn't,

1570
01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:15.960
that's actually a pretty good one.
But I thought it was cool here it was.

1571
01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:20.130
She was using the leaf as a funnel,
but she would scoop it and pour it into the,

1572
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:23.550
into the container.
But yeah,
that's completely dirty contaminated.

1573
01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:24.384
That's where the,

1574
01:30:24.650 --> 01:30:28.870
the antelopes and other animals are going to get water and then they,
you know,

1575
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:30.450
yeah,
absolutely man.

1576
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:35.730
Guardia something that people get from gophers and shit and all these different

1577
01:30:35.731 --> 01:30:40.050
animal beavers.
I had typhoid while I was there.
What is typhoid like?
Um,

1578
01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:43.920
it's,
it's brutal,
but I had it at the same time.

1579
01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.840
That's why they misdiagnosed me with the malaria.

1580
01:30:45.841 --> 01:30:49.470
They thought that I had typhoid because I,
it was,
I had,

1581
01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:53.130
I had gotten typhoid but like a small amount of it.
And then,
um,

1582
01:30:53.131 --> 01:30:56.400
so they started treating me for typhoid and,
um,
but it was,

1583
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:58.820
so since it was mixed with malaria,
I don't know if,

1584
01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:02.160
if that was why malaria was so,
so brutal.
I mean,

1585
01:31:02.161 --> 01:31:04.470
I got it from two different sources.
Obviously had dirty,

1586
01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:08.160
dirty water or someone cooked with dirty water,
um,
and,

1587
01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:13.170
and adjusted the typhoid fever.
Then,
um,
so cooking with dirty water,

1588
01:31:13.171 --> 01:31:15.390
even if you boil the water,
it's still,
uh,

1589
01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.660
he's still get some of those illnesses that you,
you can't,

1590
01:31:18.661 --> 01:31:21.660
if you don't cook it correctly,
right.
If you don't get it really,
really hot.

1591
01:31:21.661 --> 01:31:26.220
And sometimes out here you're just cooking over a fire and just sticks and you

1592
01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:30.420
put on a,
a bowl over it and it's,
uh,
it's,
uh,

1593
01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:32.550
it has to get to that boiling point and stuff.

1594
01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:36.120
And if they don't cook it right or if they add some water to it,
you know,

1595
01:31:36.121 --> 01:31:39.270
a little later to add some more,
you can still get sick from that.

1596
01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:43.170
Did they have metal pots and pans and stainless steel or cast iron?

1597
01:31:43.170 --> 01:31:46.760
Like what are they cooking in?
Yeah,
a lot of times they do get,
um,
the,

1598
01:31:46.770 --> 01:31:49.540
well they would make a tripod.
I wonder if that's,
um,

1599
01:31:49.890 --> 01:31:53.440
in the folder they would make a tripod to smoke the meat.
Um,

1600
01:31:53.450 --> 01:31:58.080
and so they would just use wood in leafs to,
to cook the meat.

1601
01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:02.020
But yeah.
Would get the bargain or get the scraps from their,

1602
01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:05.110
either their slave masters as someone who went and worked for,
they would,
uh,

1603
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:09.760
negotiate and bargain Labor to get some kind of potluck that's discarded and

1604
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.270
yeah,
right there.
That's great.
That's,
that's uh,
but both the village,

1605
01:32:13.271 --> 01:32:15.760
the Jerry village and um,

1606
01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.990
and that's Kinda how they cook it so that when I think we brought with us
though,

1607
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:23.050
and they just cooked it over the fire,
that one we got real hot.

1608
01:32:23.051 --> 01:32:25.750
And normally they don't,
they don't waste wood man.
They don't,
uh,

1609
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:29.680
they just put an x where a cross of a,

1610
01:32:29.681 --> 01:32:31.600
of wood and they just push it in from the sides.

1611
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:34.480
And so basically it's just smoldering.
There's no real flame.

1612
01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:38.170
And so that's how they cook.
It's not even on,
on a real hot flame.

1613
01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:40.390
Wow.

1614
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:45.390
It's so much we take for granted and civilization those heights.

1615
01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:49.620
Ah,
maybe you killed to the folder with my wife.
Um,

1616
01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:54.970
he'll show some of the size of the pygmies and then also the huts.
But um,

1617
01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:58.840
it's,
it's,
it's crazy how they're living in this guys,
but John G,

1618
01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:03.260
but that behind them is,
uh,
is one of our huts that were staying in,
um,

1619
01:33:03.330 --> 01:33:07.570
so their huts,
you know,
chest,
chest height us.
Um,

1620
01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:10.350
and then living there.
It's crazy.
There's,

1621
01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:14.350
there's all sorts of stuff that come in there.
Spiders,
snakes,
um,
uh,

1622
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:18.250
love those too.
A lot of poisonous stuff,
right?
Yeah,
absolutely.

1623
01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:22.530
A crazy story right here in this village was,
was a spider actually.
Uh,

1624
01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.820
Emily had gone in there and this is,
by the way,

1625
01:33:24.821 --> 01:33:29.200
this is her first ever camping trip.
Her first ever time camping.

1626
01:33:29.650 --> 01:33:32.140
She went hard.
That's how you go harder.

1627
01:33:32.170 --> 01:33:34.520
I don't know if they were camping in the Congo.
Wow.

1628
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:38.770
Maybe there's another picture of a hut.
Her and I,
but it's,
it's crazy because,

1629
01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:43.060
yeah,
right there.
Um,
the rain had beat us there.

1630
01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:47.530
So I'm going from the roadside to getting to the actual village can take over an

1631
01:33:47.530 --> 01:33:49.240
hour.
Um,
we can take an hour and a half hiking.

1632
01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:54.160
And so rain had moved in and it just drenched us on her first night ever
camping.

1633
01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:58.800
And then,
uh,
and there was roaches.
Well,
it stopped raining and then you're,

1634
01:33:58.801 --> 01:34:02.200
you're thinking that it's raining,
but it's actually that sprinkling,

1635
01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:06.760
but it's actually the legs of the roaches running on the leafs that freaked her

1636
01:34:06.761 --> 01:34:11.470
out.
Um,
and she had to get up and leave.
And,
uh,
I understood,
you know,

1637
01:34:11.650 --> 01:34:13.450
I walked her out.
It's going to be okay.
She's like,

1638
01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:17.260
because one of the roaches had fallen on her neck and she,

1639
01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:20.950
that's when she kind of lost it.
And I don't know if I can do this,
but,

1640
01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:25.780
but after that,
she embraced it and really fell in love with the people.
Um,

1641
01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:30.060
and then there was another crazy story with this gigantic spider,

1642
01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:33.580
or at least to me when you'll know why I thought it was gigantic in a minute,

1643
01:34:33.970 --> 01:34:37.810
but,
uh,
it was,
it was on her.
What we'd do is we put up a little tent,

1644
01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:41.290
almost like a mosquito net tent inside of the huts so that she could be

1645
01:34:41.291 --> 01:34:43.270
protected from all the mosquitoes and stuff like that.

1646
01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:46.030
But Ben and I would sleep next to that and we,

1647
01:34:46.031 --> 01:34:47.710
we didn't have a mosquito net over us.

1648
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:52.660
And all of a sudden she saw this gigantic spider crawling on the Mesh and she

1649
01:34:52.661 --> 01:34:56.260
freaked out and called for me.
And then it jumped.

1650
01:34:56.470 --> 01:35:00.470
It's like this tranche Isla kind of spider and it jumped onto the leafs and

1651
01:35:00.471 --> 01:35:03.350
that's the wall.
It's just leaves and sticks.
Um,

1652
01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:07.130
and so I grabbed a flip flops trying to kill this tranche,
Ila.

1653
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:13.250
And whenever,
whenever I finally started to hit at it,

1654
01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:16.310
it slipped right behind one of the leafs and disappeared.

1655
01:35:17.150 --> 01:35:20.940
And she's like,
you didn't kill it.
And I'm like,
ah,
yeah,
I think I did.
And Ben,

1656
01:35:21.650 --> 01:35:23.930
Ben's like,
I killed.
Yeah,
he killed it.
He killed it.
And she's like,

1657
01:35:23.931 --> 01:35:28.430
I want to see a lag of body something.
I want to see its guts.
And,
um,

1658
01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:32.480
so anyways,
right after that too,
there's two chicken sleeping beside her,

1659
01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:35.870
her tent in the wall.
She's like,
get these chickens out of here.

1660
01:35:35.871 --> 01:35:37.050
So I grabbed them,
got to know,

1661
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:40.750
but then the next day we woke up and she woke up before me and she was outside.

1662
01:35:40.770 --> 01:35:45.740
The women were kind of painting,
doing this awesome paintings on a bark cloth.

1663
01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:49.790
So it's cloth that is actually just bark.
And so they're out there painting.

1664
01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:54.230
It's bark cloth lying.
What do you mean by clot?
They make like a coffee.

1665
01:35:54.231 --> 01:35:54.651
Used to be,

1666
01:35:54.651 --> 01:35:57.950
there used to be clothing that they would wear like in traditional ceremonies,

1667
01:35:57.951 --> 01:36:02.210
but it'd be cloth that they are bark that they would beat down and it would kind

1668
01:36:02.211 --> 01:36:06.130
of be like these fibers that would stick together and it actually be like a,

1669
01:36:06.131 --> 01:36:09.560
a bark cloth.
Uh,
you know,
I'll,
I'll have Emily bring you some of it.

1670
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:12.120
She's coming out here and we got your knife.
Um,

1671
01:36:12.170 --> 01:36:16.160
because they can bang down these knives into a,

1672
01:36:16.161 --> 01:36:19.010
or banged down these nails into knives.

1673
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:23.780
Super wicked looking and sharp,
but they can make nails into knives.

1674
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:28.310
And so we got you one of those.
And uh,
and it's,
it's nuts.

1675
01:36:28.311 --> 01:36:31.030
The things that could get his nails,
if they can turn them into a knife there,

1676
01:36:31.031 --> 01:36:33.890
they're normally pretty big,
like from like the lumber guys and stuff,

1677
01:36:33.891 --> 01:36:38.660
whatever they're doing,
if they're building a,
uh,
ladders and things like that.
Um,

1678
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.820
and so they,
they can do everything.

1679
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:44.630
And so she was out there watching them paint on this bark cloth.

1680
01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:48.440
I think if you just Google bark cloth,
they'll show it to.
But,
um,
uh,

1681
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:52.970
and then I step out of the hut and Ben standing there and when Ben standing

1682
01:36:52.971 --> 01:36:56.780
there,
he looks at me and uh,
and all of a sudden he goes,
don't move.

1683
01:36:57.350 --> 01:37:02.090
And I said,
my eyes got big.
And I said,
why?
And whenever.
I said,
why?

1684
01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:06.530
All of a sudden I saw that big spider from the night before that Transla it was

1685
01:37:06.531 --> 01:37:07.730
in my,
at the time,

1686
01:37:07.731 --> 01:37:12.731
gigantic chest length beard and its legs are just coming up right on my face

1687
01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:18.500
and,
and then literally just slaps you in the fall.
My Gosh,
it's so hard.

1688
01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.840
Just smacked me.
And,
and the,
the,
the spider fell and,

1689
01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:27.590
um,
Emily starts turning around and been steps on top of the trench line cause he

1690
01:37:27.591 --> 01:37:31.610
doesn't want to freak her out.
She's like,
what just happened?
I said,
oh,
nothing.

1691
01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.460
Nothing happened.
She's like,
what's going on?
And Ben Still,
you know,

1692
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:36.950
moving his foot back and forth,
squashing the thing,
killing it,

1693
01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:41.070
making sure it's dead.
But,
um,
there's crazy stuff out there.
Like I've,

1694
01:37:41.071 --> 01:37:42.140
I've been able to pull out,

1695
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:46.250
I think Emily and I counted five times in one night that I pulled these little

1696
01:37:46.251 --> 01:37:50.300
roaches out of my beard because I guess they think it's like a nest or something

1697
01:37:50.301 --> 01:37:53.870
like that,
that he grown that crazy beard out there,
man.
Well,

1698
01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.700
I didn't take any beard trimmers with the or anything like that,

1699
01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.210
but also I want to see how long it would get in a year.
And,

1700
01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:02.790
and it's kind of an icebreaker for me.
It's Kinda,
it's kinda funny or crazy,

1701
01:38:02.791 --> 01:38:06.840
but for me,
um,
they,
they've never seen something like it.
I,
I,

1702
01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:09.570
I look like an animal to them a lot of times walking through.

1703
01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:12.260
They had these jokes that,
um,
I wouldn't want to,

1704
01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.870
wouldn't want to come across him and a dark forest,
you know,

1705
01:38:14.871 --> 01:38:18.660
and I'm a dark in a dark path and,
uh,
I've come into the village actually,

1706
01:38:18.661 --> 01:38:21.750
but both of you,
that one,
whenever I first walked in,
people grab their kids,

1707
01:38:21.751 --> 01:38:23.120
jumped in their huts or,
or,
or,

1708
01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:26.550
or literally just booked it and disappeared through the forest because they

1709
01:38:26.551 --> 01:38:29.550
didn't never seen anything like you before.
They never seen a white dude.

1710
01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:34.080
I'm never seen someone with light skin and,
um,
white dudes exist.

1711
01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.790
I'm sure.
I'm sure there they did.
Um,
but then never seen it.
Never heard of it.

1712
01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:41.850
They've heard stories.
I mean,
they've been told at times,

1713
01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:46.970
it's almost like sometimes a white guys or the boogeyman or something where,
um,

1714
01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:48.780
you know,
if,
if you don't behave,

1715
01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.660
a white man's going to come get you or come eat you.

1716
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:55.070
Cause I've heard that before.
Yeah.
And so for me to go in there,
they're,

1717
01:38:55.090 --> 01:38:59.460
they're really a timid or scared at first until,
um,

1718
01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:04.440
until I develop a relationship with them.
And,
and as goofy as it is,

1719
01:39:04.770 --> 01:39:07.710
my hair on my head,
my Harry Harry,

1720
01:39:07.711 --> 01:39:11.070
enormously hairy arms and beard and long hair.

1721
01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:13.860
It can be an icebreaker so we can first scare them.

1722
01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:18.030
Then it can be an icebreaker and then it can be a kind of entertainment for
them.

1723
01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:21.030
They braid my hair,
they played with my beard all that.
Well,

1724
01:39:21.031 --> 01:39:24.390
there's some great videos of you that have gone online and people who actually

1725
01:39:24.391 --> 01:39:25.350
tweeted to me,

1726
01:39:25.410 --> 01:39:29.350
not even knowing that I know you have them seeing you for the first time.
Oh,

1727
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:33.330
pygmies touching you and touching your beard and senior white skin for the first

1728
01:39:33.331 --> 01:39:37.170
time.
Yeah,
it's crazy.
Some of the rumors that happened to his,
uh,

1729
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:40.550
there was a neighboring village and he,

1730
01:39:40.770 --> 01:39:45.150
he had sprinted from Bofi back to Baja and um,

1731
01:39:45.610 --> 01:39:47.640
like he was visiting there,
got terrified,

1732
01:39:47.641 --> 01:39:49.770
ran away and basically said that there was a,

1733
01:39:49.771 --> 01:39:53.820
a big white ape that had walked into the village.
And,
uh,

1734
01:39:54.210 --> 01:39:59.020
and basically I was a great white Sasquatch or vanilla gorilla and,
uh,
and he,

1735
01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:03.930
it made them terrified.
And so then he found out that we had been there.

1736
01:40:03.931 --> 01:40:05.640
We'd gotten them land,
we'd dug a,
well,

1737
01:40:05.641 --> 01:40:10.440
we started farming yams and potatoes and beans and corn now there.

1738
01:40:10.441 --> 01:40:14.220
And so it's,
uh,
it's been,
it's been pretty funny.
Another,
another thing,
it was a,

1739
01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:19.680
one of the slave master villages,
um,
had said that I came to,

1740
01:40:19.681 --> 01:40:20.460
uh,

1741
01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:25.460
to leave Mike concept was going on about someone else talking.

1742
01:40:26.610 --> 01:40:27.360
My Real,

1743
01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:31.560
my real a reason of being there was that because I would go and I would walk

1744
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:35.520
with them to,
to the dirty water source.
If you get pulled up the Badwater,

1745
01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.950
I would carry it with them.
Um,

1746
01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:40.410
just to experience how long that they would have to walk.

1747
01:40:40.411 --> 01:40:45.300
Sometimes they were walking five miles,
five miles,
um,
with dirty water,

1748
01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:48.660
dirty water to come back and cook with and give their kids and drink and bathe

1749
01:40:49.170 --> 01:40:51.030
in those,
those,
uh,

1750
01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:55.510
I think our 20 or 40 liters or something like that.

1751
01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:58.000
But they're,
they're like 30,
40 pounds man.

1752
01:40:58.030 --> 01:41:00.100
And in my neck just doing that with them,

1753
01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:03.970
we get so incredibly sore in these,
I mean,
those are,

1754
01:41:04.030 --> 01:41:06.300
are grown women next to me and they're,

1755
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:08.440
they're walking sometimes with two of them.
Um,

1756
01:41:08.770 --> 01:41:11.170
sometimes they're walking with two of those and,
or,
or,
uh,

1757
01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.470
one about half that size,
but the,

1758
01:41:13.471 --> 01:41:16.540
the other people from the other tribes that are bigger and stronger,

1759
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:19.360
they're walking with one on top of their head and one over there back.

1760
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:22.810
And it's just crazy.
And,
and,
and women,
those villages that said,

1761
01:41:22.811 --> 01:41:27.730
what I really come there to do was study,
um,
studied their,
their streams,

1762
01:41:27.731 --> 01:41:31.360
their creeks.
And then I left behind,
uh,
my,

1763
01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:35.860
my half fish,
half woman,
uh,
at and station.
I'm at each,

1764
01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:39.370
each little creek in each little stream that I was going and investigating.
So,

1765
01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:43.390
so basically they're saying that I had,
I had brought in Mermaids to leave,

1766
01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:48.790
to leave at every,
every village.
And I'm like,
where did that come from?
Like,

1767
01:41:48.791 --> 01:41:51.070
where did you guys think I'm coming up with a,

1768
01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:55.000
a mermaid to come bring in and leave here?
And uh,

1769
01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:58.390
they didn't say it was evil or anything,
but they said I was bringing mermaids.

1770
01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:02.410
It's so strange.
It's like you are,
you know,
you're living in the 21st century,

1771
01:42:02.411 --> 01:42:03.550
but it's almost like you're,

1772
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.680
you're going into this land that hasn't changed much in thousands of years and

1773
01:42:08.681 --> 01:42:13.681
they still have the same sort of like mythologies and folklore that you'd expect

1774
01:42:13.991 --> 01:42:17.680
from people that lived before education,
before the Internet,

1775
01:42:17.681 --> 01:42:20.860
before even before books.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean it's,
it's,

1776
01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:25.990
it's like you're going back in time because people don't have cell phones.

1777
01:42:26.530 --> 01:42:30.030
A lot of times we would,
I would do is,
yeah,
I would take,
um,

1778
01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:31.510
we take pictures together,

1779
01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:36.010
but then I'd come in and I would go into town and I brought with me.
Um,

1780
01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:37.870
it's called,
uh,
I think it's called a selfie.

1781
01:42:37.871 --> 01:42:41.680
It's like a little canon printer and a,
I could print off photos that I took.

1782
01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:45.580
So I'd go back and them seeing themselves on my,
my camera for the first time.

1783
01:42:45.581 --> 01:42:48.550
Some of this is their first time seeing themselves.
Well,

1784
01:42:48.551 --> 01:42:52.440
besides being in there like a reflection of water or,
I mean,

1785
01:42:52.450 --> 01:42:55.390
they don't have mirrors.
Whoa.
You don't have cameras don't have any of that.

1786
01:42:55.391 --> 01:42:58.690
So how did they see themselves besides their reflection?
And so,

1787
01:42:58.691 --> 01:42:59.800
but what we would do is,

1788
01:42:59.830 --> 01:43:02.500
I mean there's been other people that have come into some of the villages and

1789
01:43:02.501 --> 01:43:05.900
take pictures and they leave and then they never get to see them.
Um,

1790
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:09.130
but we would go print them and we come back and we'd give them family photos.

1791
01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:12.220
We'd give them like a family portrait and uh,
and so,

1792
01:43:12.250 --> 01:43:15.850
but we would either put it in like almost a ziplock bag or,
or,

1793
01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:19.960
or kind of do one time we did like this laminate kind of stuff on it because in

1794
01:43:19.961 --> 01:43:20.950
their living conditions,

1795
01:43:20.951 --> 01:43:23.830
in their huts with the rain coming through it with their,

1796
01:43:23.831 --> 01:43:28.540
their ground sometimes turning to mud that they're sleeping on.
Um,
you know,

1797
01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:30.970
we wanted to protect the pictures that we're giving them.

1798
01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:34.300
But just something like that,
it's a,
it's a small gift to us,

1799
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:38.920
but to them it just blows their mind that you can take a picture of them a

1800
01:43:38.921 --> 01:43:39.910
moment in time.

1801
01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:43.600
You can go print it and then you can give it back to them and now they can have

1802
01:43:43.601 --> 01:43:46.870
it for forever if they keep it,
keep it right.
That's incredible man.

1803
01:43:47.170 --> 01:43:50.200
Is there any superstition involved in photographs like you heard with like the

1804
01:43:50.201 --> 01:43:54.770
native Americans?
No,
not,
not there now in other places,

1805
01:43:54.771 --> 01:43:59.060
like populated areas and Congo and you'd gone in Rwanda,
um,

1806
01:43:59.130 --> 01:44:03.050
anywhere that there's been conflict that then brings in a lot of reporters and,

1807
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:05.000
and,
and other people,

1808
01:44:05.001 --> 01:44:08.900
like they come and they take pictures and the locals will say,
oh,

1809
01:44:08.901 --> 01:44:11.870
they're coming and taking our pictures and then they're there.

1810
01:44:12.110 --> 01:44:14.770
They're going and making money off of us.
We don't get to see those pictures,

1811
01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:17.210
anything like that.
So you have to be like,

1812
01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:19.360
I'm not going around like a tourist and taking pictures.
Um,

1813
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:21.210
when I get into the village,
you know,

1814
01:44:21.230 --> 01:44:23.420
sometimes I pull it out for entertainment and,
and,

1815
01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:25.730
and show them themselves where they can,
you know,

1816
01:44:25.731 --> 01:44:28.400
on the iPhone where you can actually see yourself on the screen at that time.

1817
01:44:28.401 --> 01:44:31.790
And their eyes just light up and it's like a,
it's like a mirror,
but it's,

1818
01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:36.830
you know,
it's,
it's on a screen and so it's crazy for him.
That is so cool man.

1819
01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:40.340
Because what an amazing journey you've been on,
man.
I mean just,

1820
01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:44.420
I know Loretta Hunt Who's sitting over here to our right to your right,

1821
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:46.310
who you've written a bunch of books,

1822
01:44:46.311 --> 01:44:48.710
Loretta and she's writing a book about you right now.
I,

1823
01:44:48.711 --> 01:44:51.380
I want to read that book man.
Cause I think it's really fascinating,

1824
01:44:51.381 --> 01:44:56.381
but I think a documentary is really what we need to see to like someone needs to

1825
01:44:57.710 --> 01:45:01.160
get out of some bad mother fuckers to go with a camera crew to the Congo to,

1826
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:05.510
yeah.
Well we did something for water four and it's,
it's on Vimeo.
Um,

1827
01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:09.560
but it's called a freedom in the Congo in a,
it's a very,

1828
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:14.450
very well done.
Seven minute documentary of kind of the work we were doing.
Um,

1829
01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:18.560
so yeah,
it's called freedom in the Congo on Vimeo.
And the,

1830
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:21.260
what was so cool is this guy that came to film it,

1831
01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:25.430
his name's Derek Watson and he's done stuff for national geographic and PBS and

1832
01:45:25.670 --> 01:45:29.210
he's done like full documentaries and,
and,
and got a woman named sister Rosemary.

1833
01:45:29.211 --> 01:45:32.740
Those helping girls that were abducted by the LRA and,

1834
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:36.110
and made quote unquote wives of them.
But really they're just sex slaves.

1835
01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:39.170
She would help them out in his documentary,
got hurt and uh,

1836
01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:43.100
and Times Mat Time magazine's top 100 people.
But um,

1837
01:45:44.150 --> 01:45:49.020
but anyways,
he snuck in a a Gopro drone.
Here it is right here.
So it's uh,

1838
01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:52.600
what the forest like slacks.

1839
01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:57.490
<v 3>Yeah.
And that's what I thought,
you know,
living in my American bubble,
you know,</v>

1840
01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:58.750
there's no slaves today.

1841
01:45:59.070 --> 01:46:04.070
You got rid of that in the 18 hundreds slavery in today's age.

1842
01:46:04.890 --> 01:46:07.990
Why,
why should it exist?

1843
01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:22.590
<v 5>My problem when I say my
money,</v>

1844
01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:30.310
<v 4>I see this is all subtitled for folks that are just listening to this freedom in</v>

1845
01:46:30.311 --> 01:46:31.144
the Congo,

1846
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:35.680
check it out on Vimeo slave masters and come up to me and say,

1847
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:40.420
raise your doing with my animals.
What are you here doing with my property?

1848
01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:41.740
I own these people.

1849
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:49.350
<v 5>Be A,
they</v>

1850
01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:51.810
<v 1>just don't get to stay in two bananas.</v>

1851
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:52.743
<v 4>Need to be given</v>

1852
01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:58.870
something small so that they can come back and work the next day so that they're

1853
01:46:58.871 --> 01:47:01.630
hungry enough that they have to come back and work the next day.

1854
01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:13.770
<v 1>Yeah,
let's leave this for people to watch the full thing.
So they don't,
yeah.</v>

1855
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:17.000
One thing on that that we're going to edit,
um,
just just to,

1856
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:19.640
to to know is it says on there,

1857
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:25.400
it says band Bantu on it and,
and yeah,
they are some of the,
the,

1858
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:29.620
the slave masters there.
Um,
it's the banter and the pygmies,
but really it's the,

1859
01:47:29.621 --> 01:47:33.010
the Mokpala.
Um,
and it's,
it's basically the,

1860
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:37.130
the non pygmies in the region that the pygmies live.
So I never,

1861
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:40.400
we don't want to villainize a certain people group.
We,
again,

1862
01:47:40.401 --> 01:47:44.720
we want to work with both sides and we want to be,
we want to add to each.

1863
01:47:44.721 --> 01:47:46.280
We don't want to take away,
we don't want to,

1864
01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:50.150
we don't want to hurt them in the process,
but we want to educate them that,
hey,

1865
01:47:50.151 --> 01:47:55.151
there's were both equals and how can we do this and the best way possible.

1866
01:47:55.490 --> 01:48:00.230
So we're changing that just so that there's no like,
um,
nothing,

1867
01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:02.510
nothing seemed like we're trying to,
to,

1868
01:48:02.511 --> 01:48:04.850
to point them out because they're the biggest people group in,
uh,

1869
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:06.740
in all of Africa.
And they're there,

1870
01:48:06.890 --> 01:48:10.340
most of them live where there aren't even pygmies.
But where there are pygmies,

1871
01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:14.330
most of them,
most of the time the pygmies are being enslaved to these guys.

1872
01:48:14.331 --> 01:48:18.770
Know these,
these pygmy folks.
Do they know that you,
uh,
fought in the UFC?

1873
01:48:18.771 --> 01:48:22.710
Did they understand what the UFC is?
I'm trying to explain it.
They,
they,

1874
01:48:22.711 --> 01:48:25.520
they kind of like wondering how can that be a job?

1875
01:48:25.521 --> 01:48:29.870
Cause they've only seen physical conflict.
Um,
whenever there's a real dispute,

1876
01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:33.770
you know,
and there's,
there's not really martial arts there.
Um,
but,
but they,

1877
01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:37.850
they do kind of wrestle around some.
And,
um,
but it,
it's gotten me out of,

1878
01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:42.350
out of trouble before,
um,
in the Congo.
I had a Topps card and uh,

1879
01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:47.600
and I just kept it with me on me and I tried to show him and it was me just

1880
01:48:47.601 --> 01:48:52.280
blossoming guy hit him in the chin and it was a anyways,
um,

1881
01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.680
yeah,
they're being real corrupt and everything.

1882
01:48:54.681 --> 01:48:57.590
And I showed him it and ended up signing and just giving it to them.

1883
01:48:57.591 --> 01:48:59.720
They let us go and instead of paying any money,

1884
01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:03.420
I'm a baseball card or MMA version of the basement.
Well,

1885
01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:07.310
what they're going to try to still a,
well Dzielawa he's my grandfather.

1886
01:49:07.311 --> 01:49:12.140
He gave me a,
uh,
a pygmy bow and arrow,
a bunch of arrows in a bow.

1887
01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:17.480
And this,
this guy was just saying,
um,
that it was illegal for me to have it.

1888
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:20.600
That,
and I'm like,
it's a gift.
He's like,
no,
no,
no.

1889
01:49:20.601 --> 01:49:23.720
You came here to come and take our artifacts back to your country and make

1890
01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:26.810
thousands of dollars and if you're going to go make those thousands of dollars

1891
01:49:26.811 --> 01:49:29.780
and you have to give me hundreds of dollars,
I'm like,
that's not gonna happen.

1892
01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:32.690
It's not going to happen.
And so he's like trying to pull it out of my hand.

1893
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:34.790
I said,
what if I give you this?
And just gave him the,

1894
01:49:35.210 --> 01:49:39.080
gave him the UFC Dobbs card and talk to them and played around with them.

1895
01:49:39.081 --> 01:49:40.280
And you know,
if you just,

1896
01:49:40.370 --> 01:49:42.830
sometimes when they're asking you to give them something,

1897
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:47.440
Matt actually taught it to me,
the guy in the video,
um,
from water for he,
if they,

1898
01:49:47.441 --> 01:49:49.420
if they ask for you to give them something,

1899
01:49:49.570 --> 01:49:52.720
somebody just got to give them anything and they'll let you go.

1900
01:49:52.721 --> 01:49:57.700
It can be a bottle of water that can be,
um,
a passion.
Fruit can be a banana.
Um,

1901
01:49:57.730 --> 01:49:59.690
one time it was a,
it was a guy said,

1902
01:49:59.691 --> 01:50:01.480
you've got to give me something or I'm not going to let you go.

1903
01:50:01.690 --> 01:50:05.950
So just wrap them up in a big bear hug afterwards.
I said,
there,
I gave you a hug.

1904
01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:09.910
And uh,
he was,
he was laughing,
you know,
and,
and in between us,
you know,

1905
01:50:09.911 --> 01:50:12.620
that he's got,
he's got a machine gun and so we're,
whoa.

1906
01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:16.360
And so we're bear hugged to do with a machine gun.
Well,

1907
01:50:16.361 --> 01:50:18.490
he wasn't holding onto it and like pointing it at me or anything.

1908
01:50:18.491 --> 01:50:22.270
They just always have them around them.
That's still in.
Matt had done that,

1909
01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:26.350
that basically that same thing.
Um,
and I think Togo,

1910
01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:31.000
um,
where,
where he was doing water wells all,
all throughout there,

1911
01:50:31.001 --> 01:50:32.770
he's done hundreds there.
Um,
but yeah,

1912
01:50:32.771 --> 01:50:36.490
it's just sometimes you got to find a way to,
to,

1913
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:40.840
to make them laugh or to make them like you were to,
to,
to try to find a way to,

1914
01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:42.880
to,
to,
to get the job done.

1915
01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:46.200
Did they speak English when you're communicating with these people?
Um,

1916
01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.960
some of them are and some of them are pretty educated.

1917
01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:54.790
It's crazy how I think it's harder for us in our culture to learn languages

1918
01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:59.020
because we don't grow up learning several languages at once.
But they're,

1919
01:50:59.021 --> 01:51:02.080
they're growing up learning four,
five,
six languages at one time.

1920
01:51:02.530 --> 01:51:05.260
And so some of them,
yeah,
they speak English very fluently.

1921
01:51:05.290 --> 01:51:06.940
And are they learning this from a school?

1922
01:51:06.941 --> 01:51:10.210
Are they learning this from school or a lot of times the military are learning

1923
01:51:10.211 --> 01:51:13.570
it from,
um,
their,
their jobs,
their work.

1924
01:51:13.571 --> 01:51:17.950
If there's humanitarian organizations that,
that are,
are speaking English and,

1925
01:51:17.951 --> 01:51:20.200
and different things like that.
Wow.
Yeah.

1926
01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:24.310
What is the end game for you here?
I mean,
you're,

1927
01:51:24.330 --> 01:51:28.240
you're obviously improving their lives dramatically by creating these wells and

1928
01:51:28.241 --> 01:51:32.080
bringing the medicine.
Well,
what do you eventually hope to do?

1929
01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:38.230
Well,
that's a,
that's a big question,
but I'll,
I'll try to simplify it.

1930
01:51:38.290 --> 01:51:42.760
I just want them to know that they're loved,
um,
that,
that,

1931
01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:47.650
um,
they're not forgotten.
Um,
and that,
um,

1932
01:51:47.950 --> 01:51:51.580
this is a lifelong thing for me.
There's no way.
I mean,

1933
01:51:51.581 --> 01:51:52.780
it doesn't matter what's going on.

1934
01:51:52.781 --> 01:51:55.860
I'm going to be going there in my entire life and what I,

1935
01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:59.290
what I hope is just to add,
add to their life.
Like for me,

1936
01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:04.200
whenever I sit back and I say,
okay,
what does a perfect world looked like?
Um,

1937
01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:09.210
and,
and how can I try to,
to take action to see that,

1938
01:52:09.211 --> 01:52:13.190
that the good comes into the world instead of the bad.
So the evil,
so the,
the,

1939
01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:15.820
the kids dying of,
of,
of dirty water,
you know,

1940
01:52:15.821 --> 01:52:18.490
what can I do as a person too,

1941
01:52:19.450 --> 01:52:22.570
to see that that is alleviated at least a little bit,

1942
01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:27.330
even just for one person if I can do that.
And so for me and my,
my,

1943
01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:30.700
my pygmy family,
like I don't want to see that same kind of suffering them.

1944
01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:34.660
We've actually seen him set free now and we've seen them get clean water and

1945
01:52:34.661 --> 01:52:38.110
seeing them have food and that's hopefully just the beginning of,

1946
01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:40.840
of different things that will be a lifelong way to,

1947
01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:44.410
to sustain them and in the people in that region.

1948
01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:49.970
<v 2>When,
when you're there and you,
you,
you hang out with these people,</v>

1949
01:52:49.971 --> 01:52:53.590
especially when they know that you've done,
you know,
the UFC and they,

1950
01:52:53.591 --> 01:52:58.160
they understand that you like participate in professional conflict as it were.

1951
01:52:58.490 --> 01:53:01.440
Do you teach them things?
Do you ever like have a class there?

1952
01:53:02.110 --> 01:53:03.940
<v 1>I've,
I've shown a few of them,
uh,</v>

1953
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:09.230
about maybe 10 or 15 of the men one time.
Just some little,
little wrestling.

1954
01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:12.440
I was teaching them a,
an arm drag,
um,

1955
01:53:12.441 --> 01:53:15.440
just because I didn't want people falling down and getting hurt or something

1956
01:53:15.441 --> 01:53:19.250
like that.
So seeing some in the arm drag throw by,
um,

1957
01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:23.150
a little bit of a double leg,
but how to set them down easy.
Um,

1958
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:27.520
so it's fun.
And then they really grabbed onto it,
um,

1959
01:53:28.290 --> 01:53:31.250
in guiding bolt by Wanda,
by wanting to just,

1960
01:53:31.251 --> 01:53:34.040
he loved it and he would go around and he would be grabbing on to everybody.

1961
01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:35.600
I'm dragging him the arm dragging up,

1962
01:53:35.601 --> 01:53:38.810
jumping on their back and teach them how to take the back.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1963
01:53:38.811 --> 01:53:41.780
From [inaudible] arm,
Jackson road by,
from a throw by,
not,

1964
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:45.230
not on the ground grappling,
but I would,
uh,
yeah,

1965
01:53:45.530 --> 01:53:48.440
he would get behind them and that was just his natural reaction was to be a

1966
01:53:48.441 --> 01:53:53.020
spider monkey.
Just jump on their back.
I'm Marcello Garcia style back on them.

1967
01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:57.950
Yeah.
That's awesome.
What about striking?
Do you teach may striking?
No,

1968
01:53:57.951 --> 01:54:01.610
I haven't done that man.
I think,
I think for me now,

1969
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:04.660
it hasn't been a big thing showing them Marshall,

1970
01:54:04.661 --> 01:54:06.740
I had some my big passion I'd love for him too,

1971
01:54:06.741 --> 01:54:09.860
but it's just kind of hard being in the jungle and the forest.

1972
01:54:09.861 --> 01:54:13.970
There's trees everywhere.
There's stumps everywhere.
There's,
it's hard to get a,

1973
01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:15.560
a nice space to,
to grapple.

1974
01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:18.870
<v 2>Yeah.
I would imagine that would be,
especially for take downs,
right?
Yeah.</v>

1975
01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:23.940
Fall down.
Landed a log up your ass when you are planning.
I mean if you,

1976
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:27.270
if you committed to this plan of fighting again or was it still something that

1977
01:54:27.271 --> 01:54:28.104
you have in your head?

1978
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:34.450
<v 1>Haven't having to un like announced it or formally made a plan with anybody yet.</v>

1979
01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:39.140
But,
um,
for me,
my family,
my wife and in the teeth take down,

1980
01:54:39.141 --> 01:54:42.170
guys know that I'm gonna make a real,
real,
real stab at it.

1981
01:54:42.590 --> 01:54:46.040
So you'd definitely going to do it.
I'm going to do it.
So when you do that,

1982
01:54:46.230 --> 01:54:49.230
<v 2>how much time will you spend here and how much time we spend there?</v>

1983
01:54:49.231 --> 01:54:51.270
And how much time do you spend here and there?
Right now?

1984
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:56.590
<v 1>Yeah.
Well,
I've been going since 2011 and,
um,
I've taken,
you know,</v>

1985
01:54:56.591 --> 01:55:01.050
month long trips there until this last one,
which was a one year trip.
Um,

1986
01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:02.920
and if I go back into fighting,

1987
01:55:03.250 --> 01:55:06.490
it would only allow me to probably to go there one,

1988
01:55:06.670 --> 01:55:09.740
two or Max three times a year,
um,

1989
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:12.700
for anywhere from two to four weeks at a time.

1990
01:55:13.150 --> 01:55:17.830
So I would love to train hard to fight hard.
I'll never have,

1991
01:55:17.890 --> 01:55:18.970
I know one thing's for sure.

1992
01:55:18.971 --> 01:55:22.210
I'll never have more motivation to be the dude to go in there to get my hand

1993
01:55:22.211 --> 01:55:26.770
raised,
not just for me but,
but,
but for starting my family with my wife,

1994
01:55:26.771 --> 01:55:30.370
but also for the family there in Congo.
That more's going to be added to,

1995
01:55:30.430 --> 01:55:33.820
to them into,
to,
to alleviate what's going on there.

1996
01:55:34.190 --> 01:55:37.880
<v 2>Now will you released by the UFC or did you just stop fighting?
Like what,</v>

1997
01:55:37.881 --> 01:55:38.480
what happened?

1998
01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:38.691
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1999
01:55:38.691 --> 01:55:42.620
I was released and then I fought and I won three fights and that stepped away.

2000
01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:45.630
Um,
I was,
I,
I'm sure there was,
uh,

2001
01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:48.300
an open door to go back organization.

2002
01:55:48.301 --> 01:55:52.550
Did you want win three fights with a ring of fire?
Okay.
Um,

2003
01:55:52.590 --> 01:55:54.690
so you were in Denver and then,

2004
01:55:54.691 --> 01:55:58.510
and then I fought in Vegas once for another promotion.
Thought uh,
do the,

2005
01:55:58.511 --> 01:56:02.820
I think it was six and now at the time and uh,
and stopped him.
And then,
uh,

2006
01:56:03.930 --> 01:56:06.580
yeah,
for me though,
I know that it would be a,

2007
01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:10.460
it wouldn't be a step right back into that level of the UFC.
Right.

2008
01:56:10.490 --> 01:56:13.950
Not right away.
I'd have to work my way back up to that.
Um,

2009
01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:17.850
but you know what though,
if the right opponent and stuff like that comes along,

2010
01:56:17.851 --> 01:56:21.660
but,
but for me,
I,
I want to train hard but smart,

2011
01:56:21.661 --> 01:56:25.890
be strategic about the matchups.
Um,
I mean me,
I'm,

2012
01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:27.440
I'm a competitor.
Whenever I,

2013
01:56:27.650 --> 01:56:30.760
I was wrestling at Kenny Monday as my high school coach,
Olympic gold medalist,

2014
01:56:30.761 --> 01:56:34.440
can Kendall cross Olympic gold medalist,
then I went to Olympic training center.

2015
01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:38.790
So something,
I think if you ask Brendan or anyone that's trained with me,

2016
01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:38.951
they'll,

2017
01:56:38.951 --> 01:56:43.951
they'll say that I'm a competitor and then my harder or spirit is a spirit of a

2018
01:56:43.981 --> 01:56:48.480
fighter harness.
Mondays at team take down.
That's something that is,
is,

2019
01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:52.580
you know,
is a light bulb was amazed that they let him go with the black zillion.

2020
01:56:52.590 --> 01:56:56.460
So I was like,
are you crazy?
What a wealth of knowledge that guy has.

2021
01:56:56.461 --> 01:56:57.294
And it comes to,
I mean,

2022
01:56:57.450 --> 01:57:00.210
I guess it was a personality conflict or something like that,
but man,

2023
01:57:00.211 --> 01:57:04.590
what a great coach.
That guy is in a great wrestler.
Yeah.
With me high school.

2024
01:57:04.591 --> 01:57:07.350
And then ever since then,
and then even now,
whenever I stepped away,

2025
01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:12.480
he fully 100% supported everything and said that,
uh,
he loves what I'm doing,

2026
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:15.590
but,
but what's so great about coach monies,

2027
01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:20.600
he really will invest into people in and really teach them slick stuff that

2028
01:57:20.611 --> 01:57:24.510
you're not going to find from a,
from a high school or college program.

2029
01:57:24.690 --> 01:57:26.460
Like this is a Olympic level stuff that,

2030
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:29.790
that's coming from all over the world and it's the little things that matter.

2031
01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:33.390
And so he's able to teach us those things and he's great man.
Yeah.

2032
01:57:33.391 --> 01:57:35.730
I thought he was a great addition to a team take down.

2033
01:57:35.731 --> 01:57:38.490
I saw him when he was training and working with Johny Hendricks and the rematch

2034
01:57:38.491 --> 01:57:41.910
with Robbie Lawler.
What's going on right now with Johny Hendricks?
So you uh,

2035
01:57:41.930 --> 01:57:45.210
you training with him,
you,
you're there with him and I've watched him train.

2036
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:48.270
I mean I haven't really stepped in there yet.
I think for me right now,

2037
01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:50.880
I mean I'm,
I'm out of shape,
I'm out of shape and,

2038
01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:54.930
and I want to come back and my problem was that I would,
I would,
uh,

2039
01:57:55.170 --> 01:57:57.690
I would come back too soon and then a injuries would happen.

2040
01:57:57.691 --> 01:58:00.870
So I'm going to get my core and all that back before I step in there with those

2041
01:58:00.871 --> 01:58:05.850
guys.
What do you weigh right now to 82 82 80 right now.

2042
01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:08.130
Wow.
Yeah.
And so I'll have to get back down.

2043
01:58:08.131 --> 01:58:12.930
I'll probably be around two 55 round fight time to 50.
Um,
that's,

2044
01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:15.570
that's me coming back from,
from Congo,

2045
01:58:15.571 --> 01:58:18.430
having no food coming back and have him all the food.
It might've screaming.

2046
01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:22.220
Cue Baby.
Yeah.
You live in Dallas?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
My grandpa owns a,

2047
01:58:22.221 --> 01:58:27.180
a several barbecue restaurants have Texas barbecue is something special,
man.

2048
01:58:27.330 --> 01:58:31.620
Yeah.
Wow.
That's a,
you're living in an incredible life man.
You know,

2049
01:58:31.690 --> 01:58:34.830
I think it'd be really fascinating if you did come back and what a story that

2050
01:58:34.831 --> 01:58:35.461
would be and how,

2051
01:58:35.461 --> 01:58:40.020
I mean it would generate an incredible amount of press and an incredible amount

2052
01:58:40.021 --> 01:58:43.690
of attention towards what you're trying to do in the Congo.
Well,
that,
that's,

2053
01:58:43.691 --> 01:58:47.020
I'm mean,
that's humbling to hear because I mean,

2054
01:58:47.021 --> 01:58:51.850
I respect your opinion so much of being in the fight game for so long.
Um,
I,

2055
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.940
I want to be realistic about it and say like right now I'm,

2056
01:58:55.130 --> 01:58:58.790
I'm not looking at the,
the world champion level,
you know,

2057
01:58:58.860 --> 01:59:00.570
I'm not aiming at that right now,
but,

2058
01:59:00.571 --> 01:59:03.420
but that could be a future goal once I get back into it,
get,

2059
01:59:03.421 --> 01:59:08.200
get in shape and really start,
start,
start just knocking some dudes down.

2060
01:59:08.230 --> 01:59:11.470
Do you know how crazy it would be if you got to the point where you're fighting

2061
01:59:11.471 --> 01:59:14.970
for the title?
Do you know how bananas that would be?
That would be nuts.

2062
01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:20.040
What mean you want to talk about the most incredible PR campaign ever?

2063
01:59:20.140 --> 01:59:20.471
I mean,

2064
01:59:20.471 --> 01:59:22.900
you want to talk about some someone that you could really get behind and root

2065
01:59:22.901 --> 01:59:25.690
for Jesus Christ.
You'd have the whole world rooting for you.

2066
01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:32.050
God Damn Rocky moving.
I'm getting goosebumps.
Well,
it'd be crazy,
man.

2067
01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:35.650
Yeah.
If you could really get into like top shape.
Yeah,
that's the thing.

2068
01:59:36.900 --> 01:59:39.010
I would love that.
That would be the perfect world.
That's the thing.

2069
01:59:39.011 --> 01:59:44.011
Like I feel like I feel like in my heart that that's one of my deepest desires

2070
01:59:44.501 --> 01:59:49.501
is to fight and contend for the highest possible good in every circumstance.

2071
01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:53.740
Like it doesn't matter if it's there or here,
whatever it is.

2072
01:59:53.741 --> 01:59:56.990
Whenever I'm meeting somebody like like what can I do to,
to,

2073
01:59:57.020 --> 02:00:00.520
to add to the lives of another and if I can do that through fighting something

2074
02:00:00.521 --> 02:00:04.410
that I'm very passionate about.
I mean I think,
yeah,
I mean it's humbling the,

2075
02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:08.470
that goes through my mind.
I try to be realistic,
try to,
but,
but at the same time,

2076
02:00:09.010 --> 02:00:12.310
I'm a big dreamer and I think that if,
if I could do,

2077
02:00:12.370 --> 02:00:17.020
I mean that would be obviously the,
the,
the,
the cat's pajamas.
If I could,

2078
02:00:17.021 --> 02:00:21.580
if I could be the champion Pajama pants with,
imagine if you won the title.

2079
02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:23.160
I mean,
that would be unbelievable.

2080
02:00:23.230 --> 02:00:27.330
Obviously that's going to take some superhuman dedication to,

2081
02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:31.660
to hit that level at that level without it.
So,
um,
but yeah,
that,
that's,

2082
02:00:31.690 --> 02:00:35.710
that's what's so motivating about me getting back into it as I see a huge

2083
02:00:35.711 --> 02:00:39.490
opportunity to,
to,
to fulfill that first promise.

2084
02:00:39.491 --> 02:00:42.480
I gave him me and I was standing at the grave of Andy Bo,

2085
02:00:42.850 --> 02:00:46.730
and that held him in my hands and had had his blood on me and I had,
I had,

2086
02:00:47.310 --> 02:00:51.400
I had buried him.
And,
uh,
and it was so tough,
so hard.

2087
02:00:51.401 --> 02:00:53.620
And then one of the chiefs came to me and said,

2088
02:00:53.621 --> 02:00:57.730
nobody knows about what's happening to us.
Nobody knows about the suffering.

2089
02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:01.720
And he said,
I know you can't promise us water,
land,
any of that stuff,

2090
02:01:01.721 --> 02:01:05.410
but can you,
can you,
can you tell people,
can you,
can you,
can you at least,

2091
02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:09.010
you know,
give us a voice.
And so that's whenever I,
I made that promise.

2092
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:10.840
And so me going back into fighting,

2093
02:01:10.841 --> 02:01:15.610
it'd be extremely emotional for me to get back into it,
to get back in shape,

2094
02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:18.800
to go back in there,
to,
to,
to knock some dudes out there.

2095
02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:21.630
They're going to have to,
they're going to have to put me away.
Um,

2096
02:01:21.690 --> 02:01:25.000
really like really put me away for me not to,
to,

2097
02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:28.840
to do everything in my power to win that fight.
He's had a ridiculous jam.

2098
02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:32.860
That was like one of your biggest size huts.
You take a tremendous shot.

2099
02:01:33.340 --> 02:01:36.550
Is that always been the case?
I,
the people would always joke saying,

2100
02:01:36.551 --> 02:01:40.300
I have some fucking viking head.
Yeah,
we'll even a heavyweight.

2101
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:44.540
<v 2>My head's normally like twice the size and everyone else.
So it's an easy target,</v>

2102
02:01:44.541 --> 02:01:46.520
but,
but it's,
but it,
but it takes a beating.

2103
02:01:46.670 --> 02:01:51.350
Was it a tough watching a fellow viking go down this weekend when he's tough,

2104
02:01:51.351 --> 02:01:56.300
was like him afterwards.
Like even with Anthony saying that,
you know,
he's crying.

2105
02:01:56.301 --> 02:02:01.000
I can't even celebrate.
That was tough.
Well,
he's so loved there man.
I mean,

2106
02:02:01.001 --> 02:02:05.000
that's a,
that he literally is carrying the entire country on his back there.

2107
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:08.000
I mean,
there's a tremendous amount of pressure involved in that.

2108
02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:11.470
A tremendous amount of love too.
They,
they fucking love Gustafson me.

2109
02:02:11.471 --> 02:02:15.500
And they were cheering for him after he lost.
No,
but it's like in America,

2110
02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:20.900
I mean,
I don't want to shit on America,
but man,
when people lose in America,

2111
02:02:20.901 --> 02:02:23.430
everybody fucking clears out of the arena right away,
you know?

2112
02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:26.690
And nobody cleared out after he lost.
They stuck around and they wait.
I mean,

2113
02:02:26.691 --> 02:02:29.390
you're talking about an arena filled with 26,000 people to,

2114
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:33.500
it's a long fucking commute.
It's zero degrees outside.
It's cold as fuck.

2115
02:02:33.501 --> 02:02:35.660
And they all stuck around and they were,

2116
02:02:35.661 --> 02:02:39.530
they were chanting out his name after he lost.
Wow.
I didn't know that.

2117
02:02:39.590 --> 02:02:42.110
I knew that it was,
it was a deafening silence when he lost.

2118
02:02:42.430 --> 02:02:44.300
I could just start crying.
If I started thinking about it,

2119
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:47.600
I could have started crying.
Then,
you know,
watching him,
it was pretty intense,

2120
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:51.370
but I was so blown away by rumble too.
It's like,
yeah,

2121
02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:52.770
it was just like this combination of,

2122
02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:54.920
I mean that's often how it is when you watch fights.

2123
02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:57.590
It's like there's a combination of moments like,

2124
02:02:57.710 --> 02:03:02.210
like I'm a big fan of John Jones,
but I'm also a big fan of Daniel Cormier.

2125
02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:07.100
I love Daniel.
I love both those guys as human beings as well as as fighters.

2126
02:03:07.670 --> 02:03:11.660
So after John Jones trounce Daniel like part of me was like,
man,

2127
02:03:11.661 --> 02:03:14.720
I feel sorry for Daniel,
but other part of me and was like,
God Damn Dan,

2128
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:18.680
Jon Jones is a bad motherfucker.
It's like there's this weird sort of,
you know,

2129
02:03:18.681 --> 02:03:22.070
you,
you,
you revel in the moment for the guy who won the also,

2130
02:03:22.071 --> 02:03:25.160
you got to look at like a guy like Gustafson and go,
wow,
it's,
it's hard.

2131
02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:26.630
Hard for him.
It's got to be hard.

2132
02:03:26.631 --> 02:03:29.690
It's really cool about hearing that about the Swedish fans though.
I mean,
that's,

2133
02:03:29.691 --> 02:03:32.450
that's a reason why I love the pride.
Who Was it?

2134
02:03:32.451 --> 02:03:37.240
The fans are so educated and they would sit there,
you know,
quiet and polite and,

2135
02:03:37.241 --> 02:03:40.910
and uh,
and then whenever they would appreciate even the moves of grappling,

2136
02:03:40.911 --> 02:03:44.450
you know,
passing,
passing,
full guard to half guard and they would,
they would,

2137
02:03:44.630 --> 02:03:47.350
they would clap,
you know,
that's,
that's something that here you,

2138
02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:50.160
and you're starting to see that more now.
You know,

2139
02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:53.710
people understand positions like a,
someone to move to a mount,

2140
02:03:53.730 --> 02:03:56.210
you'll hear like a big cheer or like throughout the audience are,

2141
02:03:56.211 --> 02:04:00.740
people understand.
But yeah,
Japan,
it's a very,
very different environment.
There's,

2142
02:04:00.741 --> 02:04:03.770
it's incredibly quiet while the fights are going on.
Yeah.

2143
02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:07.100
And then there's a cheer when there's some sort of a transition or someone does

2144
02:04:07.101 --> 02:04:09.890
something good.
Yeah.
And they also,

2145
02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:13.610
they don't put as much of an emphasis on winning as they do.

2146
02:04:13.611 --> 02:04:16.280
As much as you fought your hardest.

2147
02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:20.330
And there's always gonna be people that beat you.
Like you could,

2148
02:04:20.570 --> 02:04:24.350
you could train your hardest and you run into somebody who's just far better

2149
02:04:24.351 --> 02:04:26.540
than you.
And there's just nothing you can do about it.

2150
02:04:26.541 --> 02:04:29.350
That guy's always going to be,
you know,
there's certain guys like,

2151
02:04:30.230 --> 02:04:32.810
like perfect example,
Stephan Bonner,
when he fought Anderson Silva,

2152
02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:36.050
you can fight your hardest man.
You're not going to be an Anderson Silva.

2153
02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:40.000
You know,
you just,
you as he's better,
he's just better,
you know,
he's just,

2154
02:04:40.230 --> 02:04:45.030
he trains just as hard.
He's probably just as smart,
if not smarter,

2155
02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:49.890
knows way more can move way better snow.
But in Japan,

2156
02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:52.140
in Japan,
when a guy would fight like that,

2157
02:04:52.350 --> 02:04:55.650
they would still appreciate your warriors.
This was going to say,

2158
02:04:55.651 --> 02:04:58.620
it's like that Samurai kind of spirit,
you know,
and um,
America,

2159
02:04:58.621 --> 02:05:01.650
we just like [inaudible].
Yeah,
we like winners.
When you lose,

2160
02:05:01.651 --> 02:05:03.660
people will get on your fucking Facebook page.

2161
02:05:03.661 --> 02:05:06.720
So they'll get on your Twitter page.
I mean,
I've read some,
you know,

2162
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:08.010
I don't want to call them fans,

2163
02:05:08.070 --> 02:05:12.150
just douche bags that torment people after the lose.

2164
02:05:12.151 --> 02:05:15.930
And I've read some of the tweets and it's just fucking appalling.

2165
02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:21.080
It's appalling that these anonymous shitheads who go on these guys pages after

2166
02:05:22.441 --> 02:05:23.970
they spent,
you know,

2167
02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:29.000
eight weeks plus camps every day preparing for this moment.

2168
02:05:30.090 --> 02:05:30.923
And then they get,

2169
02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:35.180
they get trounced and then people just go off on them and they make memes about

2170
02:05:35.181 --> 02:05:37.970
him and mock him.
And you know,

2171
02:05:38.210 --> 02:05:41.730
that's a very unfortunate aspect of our culture that,

2172
02:05:41.950 --> 02:05:46.170
that they put so much emphasis on,
on the winner only.

2173
02:05:46.590 --> 02:05:48.420
But it's,
on the other hand,

2174
02:05:48.421 --> 02:05:51.690
it's like that cruelty and that intense pressure.

2175
02:05:51.691 --> 02:05:55.020
It's also why the baddest motherfuckers come out of that culture.

2176
02:05:55.290 --> 02:05:59.380
It's like people that can withstand that.
And I mean it's,
there's a union,

2177
02:05:59.410 --> 02:06:03.450
the Yang and the Yin is harder.
And the Yang,
it's harder.
It's,
it's weird.

2178
02:06:03.451 --> 02:06:06.720
You know,
there's,
I don't think it's the right way to be.

2179
02:06:06.721 --> 02:06:10.620
I certainly don't think there's enough respect paid to the people that lose in,

2180
02:06:10.650 --> 02:06:15.120
in MMA,
in America.
I think I appreciate the Japanese version of it better.

2181
02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:17.940
I don't like when bonuses either.
I mean,
uh,

2182
02:06:18.010 --> 02:06:20.400
I don't know that the UFC probably doesn't like to hear this,
but I think,

2183
02:06:20.830 --> 02:06:23.790
I think a guy should be paid a certain amount to fight.

2184
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:26.370
And I know the guys are going to fight.
They're fucking hardest.

2185
02:06:26.371 --> 02:06:30.210
I mean they're not,
they're not fighting harder because they get a win bonus.

2186
02:06:30.211 --> 02:06:33.120
They're trying to survive.
I mean you could say that,

2187
02:06:33.330 --> 02:06:37.440
I mean you could explain that more than anybody,
but you're trying to win.

2188
02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:42.360
It's a win bonus.
Like the fact that you can make 50% more if you win,

2189
02:06:42.361 --> 02:06:46.800
then you do.
If you lose,
like it's Kinda,
it's Kinda,
yeah,
it's Kinda crazy.

2190
02:06:46.801 --> 02:06:49.240
Cause once you get to a certain level at least yes.
You know,

2191
02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:51.390
once you get to a certain level,
I mean,

2192
02:06:51.391 --> 02:06:56.040
I don't think that it does make you fight harder afterwards.
It sucks more.

2193
02:06:56.190 --> 02:06:57.810
Yes.
It sucks because now you can't,

2194
02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:00.660
you can't pay the bills that you were hoping to and things like that.

2195
02:07:00.810 --> 02:07:03.870
Well Tyron Woodley had a really good statement recently.

2196
02:07:03.871 --> 02:07:07.200
We was talking about how people are always saying,
uh,
you know,

2197
02:07:07.201 --> 02:07:09.150
don't leave it in the hands of the judges.
He's like,

2198
02:07:09.151 --> 02:07:11.550
do you fucking think we're trying to move it in the hands of the judges,

2199
02:07:12.010 --> 02:07:15.190
you know,
they're fighting the best guys in the goddamn world.
There's,

2200
02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:19.530
it's like you do what you can do.
And if you do more than that,

2201
02:07:19.531 --> 02:07:23.850
like if you do something stupid or you do something illogical or you do

2202
02:07:23.851 --> 02:07:27.390
something reckless,
you can get knocked the fuck out.
I mean that,
that's,

2203
02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:32.640
you have to f I'm a big Fan of guys fighting intelligently,
you know?
And when,

2204
02:07:32.641 --> 02:07:37.510
when people fight intelligently,
sometimes it's not the most entertaining fight,

2205
02:07:37.511 --> 02:07:39.440
but that is the fight that you have to,

2206
02:07:39.730 --> 02:07:42.890
that's the way you have to perform in order to,

2207
02:07:42.970 --> 02:07:47.170
to use your skills to the best of your ability.
You know,

2208
02:07:47.171 --> 02:07:48.700
and people don't understand that.

2209
02:07:48.701 --> 02:07:51.940
And this idea that like they're trying to leave it in the hands of the judges.

2210
02:07:52.090 --> 02:07:54.700
I mean,
occasionally you'll see a guy fight safe,
you know,

2211
02:07:54.701 --> 02:07:56.990
you see a guy that goofy fight,
um,

2212
02:07:57.540 --> 02:08:01.810
or the goofy inning Nate Kore versus who was it where he's walked in?
Oh yeah,

2213
02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:03.480
you welcome download Starnes yeah,

2214
02:08:03.490 --> 02:08:05.300
I'm sure they wouldn't want to paid him the same amount.

2215
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:08.290
I'm sure they were happy that they paid him 50% yes.
That's,

2216
02:08:08.350 --> 02:08:10.460
that's the worst example of all times.

2217
02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:14.350
And I don't know what was wrong with Caleb Starnes in that fight,
but yeah,

2218
02:08:14.351 --> 02:08:19.270
that's uh,
I mean,
those memes exist for that will haunt that dude forever,

2219
02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:21.610
you know?
Yeah.
Without a doubt.
But I think,
yeah,

2220
02:08:21.611 --> 02:08:23.990
once you get to a certain level and they're in,

2221
02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.250
and if you're a real competitor that does have the eye on the top prize,

2222
02:08:27.770 --> 02:08:29.770
then then you're going to fight your heart out every single time.

2223
02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:33.360
I'm glad Woodley said that.
That's a very important point.
That's,
I don't mind.

2224
02:08:33.850 --> 02:08:36.190
That's great.
Yeah.
I don't like that.
Leave it.

2225
02:08:36.250 --> 02:08:40.930
Don't leave it in the hands of the judges,
you know?
Oh,
you know,
it's just,

2226
02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:46.120
it's,
and then the,
the judge Stahnke too is a real issue.
Like in Boston,

2227
02:08:46.121 --> 02:08:51.121
there was a few retaught hall hall hard decisions where people just want what

2228
02:08:51.970 --> 02:08:53.920
and people just turned around and we'll looking at each other.

2229
02:08:54.100 --> 02:08:56.710
I love watching a decision when a decision is bad.

2230
02:08:56.711 --> 02:08:59.170
I always turn towards the crowd cause I like,

2231
02:08:59.171 --> 02:09:02.290
I like watching people look at each other like what the fuck?

2232
02:09:02.530 --> 02:09:05.980
Cause you'll see like head turns where people like turn to their friends.

2233
02:09:05.981 --> 02:09:08.490
Like what the fuck just happened?
How did the APP,
yeah,

2234
02:09:08.530 --> 02:09:11.710
there's some bad fucking judging man.
There's some really,

2235
02:09:11.711 --> 02:09:15.880
really bad judging and it didn't help that it was in Boston where the white guys

2236
02:09:15.881 --> 02:09:19.780
were getting the good judges,
the good call,
you know,

2237
02:09:19.781 --> 02:09:24.020
cause Boston where I'm from.
No,
exactly known for uh,

2238
02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:29.290
the least racist place on the planet.
You know?
Yeah.

2239
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:33.220
I don't want to sound sexist at all,
but one of my fights on the,
oops,

2240
02:09:34.770 --> 02:09:38.260
whenever you say I don't want to,
sorry.
On,
on the ultimate fighter,

2241
02:09:38.410 --> 02:09:40.450
when I fought a big country,
um,

2242
02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:43.450
two of the three judges we had were,

2243
02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:47.980
were women and one had gray hair and the other had her two kids that were

2244
02:09:47.981 --> 02:09:52.750
running around running around at the,
the ultimate fighter like Jim.

2245
02:09:53.060 --> 02:09:53.360
And,

2246
02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:56.860
and so she was worried about her kids while we were warming up for the fight.

2247
02:09:57.220 --> 02:10:00.160
And then,
and then I'm not saying that affected the decision.
Um,

2248
02:10:00.161 --> 02:10:03.220
it could have gone a third round.
Uh,
I definitely believe that,
but,

2249
02:10:03.630 --> 02:10:06.880
but at the same time,
like it was just nuts to me that I'm like,
Whoa,

2250
02:10:06.910 --> 02:10:10.060
how are these,
the judges in Vegas?
Not that I mean,

2251
02:10:10.090 --> 02:10:15.070
but I think that judges should at least have had of trained or fought before.

2252
02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:18.490
We're really had to have gone through some,
some deep,
um,

2253
02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:22.420
training to become a judge.
You,
there's no way you understand it any other way?

2254
02:10:22.421 --> 02:10:25.600
I don't,
I don't,
especially the ground game,
you know,
there's a judge,

2255
02:10:25.601 --> 02:10:26.620
I don't want to say his name,

2256
02:10:26.621 --> 02:10:30.190
but he told me that he was watching a fight once and there was a woman who was

2257
02:10:30.191 --> 02:10:34.250
also judging and the guy was going for a Kamora and the woman said,

2258
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:38.810
what's he doing?
Oh my gosh.
She said to him,
what's he doing?
What's he doing?

2259
02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:43.250
Like,
God damn it.
See,
see,
for my fight it was nuts because I'm like this woman,

2260
02:10:43.251 --> 02:10:44.630
I don't know that she's ever,
I mean,

2261
02:10:44.690 --> 02:10:48.380
maybe she had really watched MMA and studied it,
but she's got gray hair.

2262
02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:51.170
It's not normally into to her,
you know,

2263
02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:54.170
element and then her time zone or whatever.
But uh,

2264
02:10:54.530 --> 02:10:56.750
but then also the other lady that brought her kids there,
I'm like,

2265
02:10:56.751 --> 02:10:59.030
do they know what these moves are that we're doing?

2266
02:10:59.031 --> 02:11:01.450
Like do they know the names of them?
Do they know the setups?

2267
02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:04.790
Do they know the diff defenses?
Do they know what's going on during the fight?

2268
02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:07.220
While that,
while that human chess match is going on,

2269
02:11:07.221 --> 02:11:09.510
do they know what the fighters are thinking?
Doing,
how,

2270
02:11:09.511 --> 02:11:12.530
how they're making it happen?
And if they don't,
they shouldn't be judging.

2271
02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:16.370
There's no way they should be judging.
I mean,
there's so many fans of MMA,

2272
02:11:16.371 --> 02:11:18.650
and I've said this many times,
I've even said this on broadcasts,

2273
02:11:18.651 --> 02:11:23.651
there's so many incredibly knowledgeable fans of MMA that if they held open

2274
02:11:23.931 --> 02:11:25.880
casting calls for new judges,

2275
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:30.650
you would get incredibly qualified people who have either trained their whole

2276
02:11:30.651 --> 02:11:34.370
lives or competed multiple times that enjoy the sport,

2277
02:11:34.371 --> 02:11:38.150
love the sport like you,
if you decided to never like Ricardo Almeda,

2278
02:11:38.330 --> 02:11:41.570
he's a judge in New Jersey.
That's great.
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

2279
02:11:41.571 --> 02:11:45.700
He judges in New Jersey Guy,
I would trust fucking without a doubt.
There were,

2280
02:11:45.701 --> 02:11:46.760
or even if it was a girl,

2281
02:11:46.761 --> 02:11:49.920
if it was one of the women that had fought for a shrine before,
push like,
uh,

2282
02:11:50.210 --> 02:11:53.750
a rose or Rhonda or someone like that.
Like I could trust their judgment.
Yeah.

2283
02:11:53.751 --> 02:11:55.830
And I think you should be like,
God,

2284
02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:58.940
you've got to have some grasp on your experience because grappling seems to be

2285
02:11:58.941 --> 02:11:59.900
the most confusing.

2286
02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:03.920
Seemed like if someone like is hitting the other guy more and the other guy gets

2287
02:12:03.921 --> 02:12:07.040
stunned,
it's Kinda obvious all that guy's winning the fight.

2288
02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:12.080
But if you're watching like say a guy who's like really slick on the ground,

2289
02:12:12.081 --> 02:12:14.770
like a,
you know,
you know,
fill in the blanks.
Some,
some,

2290
02:12:14.810 --> 02:12:18.500
some guy who's got a nasty guard and he's putting this guy and all sorts of bad

2291
02:12:18.501 --> 02:12:23.480
positions.
But the other guys on top,
like sometimes,
you know,
people,
uh,

2292
02:12:24.350 --> 02:12:27.770
like uh,
Charles Olivera preference example,
we fudge Jeremy Stephens.

2293
02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:30.890
I mean he was catching Jeremy Stevens and all kinds of shit,

2294
02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:35.150
but Jeremy's a beast and he kept falling out of it.
But from my money,

2295
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:39.620
he's winning the exchanges.
I mean he,
he had like threatened with armbars,

2296
02:12:39.650 --> 02:12:41.690
he's threatening with all this sort of shit off of his back.

2297
02:12:41.900 --> 02:12:44.210
If you don't know what the fuck is going on and you're watching that,

2298
02:12:44.211 --> 02:12:47.210
I think if you got on top swimming,
exactly.
You might be inclined to think that.

2299
02:12:47.211 --> 02:12:51.170
And I think with a person who's trained you,
you,
you,

2300
02:12:51.171 --> 02:12:55.100
you understand it way better.
And I just think it's unfair,
like it just deeply,

2301
02:12:55.101 --> 02:12:55.671
deeply,

2302
02:12:55.671 --> 02:12:59.780
deeply unfair for professional fighter who's taking eight weeks out of his life

2303
02:12:59.781 --> 02:13:04.640
and,
and just every morning and got up sore.
And did his road work and you know,

2304
02:13:04.641 --> 02:13:08.450
hitting the pads and sparring and doing constant drills and strength and

2305
02:13:08.451 --> 02:13:10.820
conditioning.
You're jumping over hurdles,
you doing all this fucking shit.

2306
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:13.460
You want to puke blood you're throwing up.
And then some,

2307
02:13:13.870 --> 02:13:17.720
a whole who doesn't know shit about what they're talking about gives the other

2308
02:13:17.721 --> 02:13:21.220
person,
they just,
they just go left or right,
you know,
own,

2309
02:13:21.230 --> 02:13:24.830
pick this guy and it's a lot more than that eight weeks of training to that all

2310
02:13:24.831 --> 02:13:27.800
goes into it.
All of the stuff that ever came before it and all your heart,

2311
02:13:27.801 --> 02:13:30.790
all your soul and all that.
And then what is,
I was going to ask,

2312
02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:32.130
what does even the process

2313
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:34.170
<v 1>to become a judge?
Because I don't even know what that is.</v>

2314
02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:37.430
<v 2>Well,
depends on the athletic commission.
Okay.
I mean the,
the,</v>

2315
02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:38.990
the local athletic commissions,

2316
02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:42.890
there's a lot of local athletic commissions where they do a better job then the

2317
02:13:42.891 --> 02:13:46.010
bigger athletic commissions really because the people that are involved are

2318
02:13:46.011 --> 02:13:48.650
dedicated,
mixed martial artists in Boston.

2319
02:13:48.651 --> 02:13:51.410
I know Joe Esposito was a part of the,

2320
02:13:51.590 --> 02:13:54.950
the commission and Joe Esposito was with my first karate instructor.
I mean,

2321
02:13:54.951 --> 02:13:56.750
he's the guy who was a lifelong martial artist,

2322
02:13:56.751 --> 02:14:00.260
so he is a very credible source of martial arts knowledge.

2323
02:14:00.330 --> 02:14:02.150
He's been involved as whole life.

2324
02:14:02.151 --> 02:14:05.810
Whereas you've got people in Nevada that came from boxing,

2325
02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:09.680
they were boxing judges,
and then someone said,
uh,
you know,

2326
02:14:09.681 --> 02:14:12.030
we need judges for MMA.
You know,
we'll just take,

2327
02:14:12.060 --> 02:14:13.820
take these boxing people and you know,

2328
02:14:13.821 --> 02:14:17.930
we'll use them to judge MMA fights and it's fucking crazy.

2329
02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:20.060
It's really crazy.
Well,
you know,

2330
02:14:20.061 --> 02:14:23.930
you've got people that don't understand how much a leg kick hurts and they don't

2331
02:14:23.931 --> 02:14:25.460
think that that's anything.
You know,

2332
02:14:25.461 --> 02:14:30.100
you've got people that they have no idea what's going on when you're watching in

2333
02:14:30.101 --> 02:14:33.110
fighting up against the cage,
if have no idea,
you know,

2334
02:14:33.111 --> 02:14:35.450
who's getting the better of those exchanges?
They just don't know.

2335
02:14:35.451 --> 02:14:38.060
They just see bodies moving,
you know,
and they just,

2336
02:14:38.090 --> 02:14:41.990
they don't see guys reversing positions back and forth and they really don't

2337
02:14:41.991 --> 02:14:44.080
understand what's happening.
It's a,

2338
02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:49.490
it's a real shame because the sport is growing in such,
it's such a huge way.

2339
02:14:49.491 --> 02:14:52.340
I mean it's,
it's exploding all over the world and leaps and bounds,

2340
02:14:52.341 --> 02:14:55.160
but then you're hampered by these bad judge calls,

2341
02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:59.380
<v 1>you know?
Yeah.
It's terrible.
I know that it's robbed.</v>

2342
02:14:59.381 --> 02:15:03.370
A lot of people have of not just,
um,
you know,
their,
their passion,

2343
02:15:03.371 --> 02:15:07.600
their hopes to win the fight,
but even that 50% one bonus,
that's disgusting.

2344
02:15:07.970 --> 02:15:10.510
So they're actually taking money out of people's pockets.
I should have,

2345
02:15:10.630 --> 02:15:11.463
should've won the fight.

2346
02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:14.980
<v 2>If you decide and you have decided,
I guess to go and do this,</v>

2347
02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:16.380
what's your timetable?

2348
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:19.030
How much time are you going to spend training before you get in there?

2349
02:15:19.670 --> 02:15:23.960
<v 1>I think,
I think I need at least,
um,
maybe before my first fight,</v>

2350
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:28.760
maybe around six months of,
actually once I'm in shape,
then training,
um,

2351
02:15:29.380 --> 02:15:31.430
at which I'll be getting in shape on training,
but,

2352
02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:34.820
but actually before I start taking some of the bigger,
tougher fights,
maybe it's,

2353
02:15:35.450 --> 02:15:37.520
maybe it's a year,
maybe it's longer than that.

2354
02:15:37.550 --> 02:15:41.420
It's not something that I'm going to do in the next month or two months or three

2355
02:15:41.421 --> 02:15:45.120
months.
It's,
it's gotta be a,
a process of really getting my lungs back,

2356
02:15:45.121 --> 02:15:48.620
get my core,
you know,
um,
tightened up.
So it prevents injuries,

2357
02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:51.720
getting the timing back of the striking,
you know,
and,

2358
02:15:51.721 --> 02:15:54.470
and timing back of you and the transitions on the ground,

2359
02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:57.290
that chain wrestling or,
or just flowing and grappling.

2360
02:15:57.380 --> 02:15:59.300
So you starting that process right now,

2361
02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:04.960
so you've already like tightened up your diet and started to train harder and

2362
02:16:05.031 --> 02:16:08.040
started that.
You just slowly ramping it up?
We got begun to one,

2363
02:16:08.050 --> 02:16:08.940
one thing that I'm,

2364
02:16:08.941 --> 02:16:13.010
I'm getting done before I really maybe start sparring before I start.

2365
02:16:13.550 --> 02:16:17.240
Um,
yeah,
before I start sparring,
things like that.
As I'm getting my knee checked,

2366
02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:21.140
checked,
I got an Mri done and so a doctor says it could be,
I mean,

2367
02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:24.180
Mri like scope can be three days down,
but I,

2368
02:16:24.181 --> 02:16:27.710
I might get some scope to either before or after my first fight back,

2369
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:30.100
three days down.
What do you mean?
When someone's,
Oh,

2370
02:16:30.101 --> 02:16:33.220
even Loretta's husband was down for for only three days after getting his

2371
02:16:33.221 --> 02:16:37.230
meniscus scoped.
Three days.
Listen,
I've had my meniscus scoped a couple of times.

2372
02:16:37.330 --> 02:16:39.970
It's more than than,
than the,
that I know.
It can be two weeks,
three weeks,

2373
02:16:39.971 --> 02:16:42.940
six weeks.
You of be all that.
You want to make sure that you don't,

2374
02:16:42.970 --> 02:16:46.540
there's a lot of guys that have had knee operations and then got in too soon or

2375
02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:48.840
done more damage.
Brutal.
You're,

2376
02:16:48.850 --> 02:16:52.150
you're dealing with pain and inflammation and cutting away soft tissue.

2377
02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:55.330
It's not nearly as big a deal as like ligaments,

2378
02:16:55.630 --> 02:17:00.570
but it's so important with knee injuries,
especially to do the Rehab.
Just do,

2379
02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:05.530
do the full rehab,
you know,
you'll listen to,
I mean,
I'm sure if you get it done,

2380
02:17:05.531 --> 02:17:09.070
you'll get it done at a reputable place and you'll talk to a really good doctor.

2381
02:17:09.071 --> 02:17:13.030
I know it's the Denver Broncos and he doc talking to perfect.
Great Guy.

2382
02:17:13.150 --> 02:17:16.330
What's their prognosis as far as how long he first,

2383
02:17:16.331 --> 02:17:19.840
first Mri we sent his office,
um,
we think lost,

2384
02:17:19.870 --> 02:17:22.240
but I sent another one out and he's lost it.
Yeah,

2385
02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:25.690
well it got lost in the mail or something,
but we sent it in.
Uh,

2386
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:28.450
the second one he's looking at though,
I went in for an exam,

2387
02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:29.950
he started moving my knee around.

2388
02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:32.650
He said it feels like there's something with my knee meniscus and whenever I

2389
02:17:32.651 --> 02:17:33.820
move it around it cracks a lot.

2390
02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:37.370
But I don't know that it's going to be something that keeps me out from,

2391
02:17:37.410 --> 02:17:40.900
from the first fight.
Maybe it's something I do right after.
Um,
but,

2392
02:17:41.350 --> 02:17:44.070
but I think it'd be good probably to get it done before getting them.
Yeah.

2393
02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:46.090
Get it done before so I can train.
Right.

2394
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:49.090
That's what fuck cane up and the rematch with where the fight with very doom,

2395
02:17:49.140 --> 02:17:52.450
it's really nice because he blew his meniscus out earlier and then you know,

2396
02:17:52.451 --> 02:17:55.240
sort of rest and rehabbed and then tried to go back again without getting the

2397
02:17:55.241 --> 02:17:59.260
operation and then wound up having to get an operation in the same knee injury

2398
02:17:59.261 --> 02:18:02.860
that he had when the first fight with junior dos Santos.
Right.
For me,

2399
02:18:02.861 --> 02:18:05.410
before I want to actually hard spar.

2400
02:18:05.530 --> 02:18:09.990
I know it might sound kind of goofy to,
to some,
but I think there's,

2401
02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.350
there's truth to it.
Uh,
my,

2402
02:18:11.410 --> 02:18:14.410
my wife was a swimmer in high school and so getting into swimming,

2403
02:18:14.411 --> 02:18:18.190
something that's low impact but also that's going to be be great on my lungs.

2404
02:18:18.191 --> 02:18:21.940
Cardio,
you don't even notice that you're sweating,
you know.
Um,
so swimming,

2405
02:18:21.941 --> 02:18:23.170
we would do that at the Olympic training center.

2406
02:18:23.171 --> 02:18:25.780
We'd play underwater hockey and 12 foot deep.

2407
02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:30.580
We'd go down and just have teams have to score a goal in the swimming's.

2408
02:18:30.581 --> 02:18:31.414
Not goofy at all.

2409
02:18:31.550 --> 02:18:36.550
Went swimming and yoga is what I'm going to get into hard just to get me back my

2410
02:18:36.641 --> 02:18:39.430
body back in shape in a way that,

2411
02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:43.210
that my core starts to catch up and develop before I go in there and get put in

2412
02:18:43.211 --> 02:18:46.480
these funky position sparring or picking a guy up.

2413
02:18:46.481 --> 02:18:48.610
And that's been one of my problems.

2414
02:18:48.611 --> 02:18:51.550
And sometimes I'm slamming a guy or something and that's when I get hurt cause

2415
02:18:51.551 --> 02:18:55.420
it came back from an it back injury and then I slam and then I rehurt that I can

2416
02:18:55.490 --> 02:18:58.450
and I should have,
should rehabbed it better,
should have,
uh,

2417
02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:01.590
should have taken the time to really build my core backup.
And I'm so,

2418
02:19:01.610 --> 02:19:04.660
so that's going to be not my focus on be doing everything else,
but,

2419
02:19:04.661 --> 02:19:08.020
but that's going to be a priority of mine at the beginning is swimming and yoga.

2420
02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:11.650
Well listen dude,
we're behind you 100% and a your website.

2421
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:13.150
Let's put it out there one more time.

2422
02:19:13.330 --> 02:19:18.190
Fight for the fight for the forgotten.org.com.
Dot Com.
Yeah.
And then,

2423
02:19:18.191 --> 02:19:23.191
and then water for.org so water four.org fight for the forgotten.com and there's

2424
02:19:23.411 --> 02:19:27.900
a donate button on there.
So please,
uh,
whatever you can do folks,
uh,

2425
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:28.580
donate.

2426
02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:31.100
<v 2>This is a beautiful cause.
I think what you're doing is awesome.</v>

2427
02:19:31.101 --> 02:19:34.430
It's so inspirational and a,
you're just an awesome guy,
man.

2428
02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:38.540
Just happy to give you a platform to let people know what you're doing.

2429
02:19:39.010 --> 02:19:42.740
I can't thank you enough for,
for what you've done for,
for even,
I mean,

2430
02:19:42.741 --> 02:19:44.920
I know you don't want even when he,
even when perhaps,

2431
02:19:44.930 --> 02:19:48.890
but whenever you did the bitcoin and then whatever came in,
you matched it.

2432
02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:53.920
I mean that,
that funded a well plus plus more fun.
