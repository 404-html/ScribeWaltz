<v Speaker 1>part of strangers that every gets there.</v>

7
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.723
<v Speaker 1>The big concern in Los Angeles has </v>
<v Speaker 1>always been according to a firefighter </v>

8
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:23.024
<v Speaker 1>that I've talked to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once that the right wind catches a fire </v>

9
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>and it takes it all the way through Los </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles,</v>

10
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>down to the coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not quite that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't go through Hollywood.</v>

12
00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:34.304
<v Speaker 1>It didn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think one day it's going to happen </v>

13
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:37.790
<v Speaker 1>and with the right when they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be able to stop it,</v>

14
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>but she's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.693
<v Speaker 1>this was pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is about as bad as I've ever seen </v>

16
00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:43.160
<v Speaker 1>in happen all in one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 1>It was extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Driving down the road to get here.</v>

18
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:50.471
<v Speaker 1>Just these huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just huge pillowy.</v>

19
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just,</v>

20
00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:55.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains and I thought it was a strange</v>

21
00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:58.460
<v Speaker 1>cloud formation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just smoke smoke.</v>

22
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a giant gray mountain in </v>

23
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

24
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.670
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insane how bad it's gotten.</v>

25
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.100
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had it happen three,</v>

26
00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:07.934
<v Speaker 1>this is the third time I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>evacuated since I've moved here 20 plus </v>

27
00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

28
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets her off.</v>

29
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.503
<v Speaker 1>But this is the roughest have ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie and I were doing the podcast </v>

30
00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:17.444
<v Speaker 1>yesterday and when it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had like five text messages from </v>

31
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:23.600
<v Speaker 1>friends that live in my neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying how bad it was.</v>

32
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:27.080
<v Speaker 1>And then when we got home the wind was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just crazy and it was just,</v>

33
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:28.760
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's humbling,</v>

34
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

35
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.133
<v Speaker 1>it's super unfortunate for all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are losing their homes and </v>

36
00:01:34.941 --> 00:01:38.240
<v Speaker 1>losing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're losing their property.</v>

37
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:42.140
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is this is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nature.</v>

38
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.840
<v Speaker 1>This is just something that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't avoid it.</v>

39
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:45.674
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets dry like this and I don't know </v>

40
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:48.674
<v Speaker 1>what started it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it wasn't a cigarette because </v>

41
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.420
<v Speaker 1>that's the big concisely so many moron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So throwing cigarettes.</v>

42
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a weather thing that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

43
00:01:57.081 --> 00:01:57.914
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is literally things like cigarettes </v>

44
00:01:59.001 --> 00:01:59.834
<v Speaker 1>and unfortunately a lot of the times it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means the weather certainly accentuates </v>

45
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:08.600
<v Speaker 1>it because it's dry and windy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is fire season.</v>

46
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.813
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

85
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a love hate relationship.</v>

86
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.673
<v Speaker 1>Certainly the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is the population is </v>

87
00:03:39.321 --> 00:03:43.550
<v Speaker 1>just so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more than 20 million people.</v>

88
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Plus who knows people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:46.574
<v Speaker 1>how many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really don't have no idea how many </v>

90
00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:48.830
<v Speaker 1>people have snuck in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

91
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.230
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a chaotic place.</v>

92
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>There's no public transport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just hit me that.</v>

93
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no trains,</v>

94
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.830
<v Speaker 1>there's no infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

95
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.883
<v Speaker 1>everyone's driving these huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has an escalator or a tesla or </v>

96
00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:01.191
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:01.191 --> 00:04:03.380
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a strange place.</v>

98
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.750
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highways are massive.</v>

99
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.501
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have five,</v>

100
00:04:06.501 --> 00:04:07.334
<v Speaker 1>six lanes on each side and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>jammed solid where nothing's moving </v>

101
00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can see it from there,</v>

102
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.063
<v Speaker 1>really we realized how preposterous it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is when you're flying into lax and you </v>

103
00:04:16.671 --> 00:04:17.441
<v Speaker 1>see the four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

104
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:22.441
<v Speaker 1>five highway and the distance and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all stopped for as long as you could see</v>

105
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.893
<v Speaker 1>miles one way miles the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just complete parking lot and just </v>

106
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.653
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>

108
00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:33.164
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the entertainment industry </v>

109
00:04:34.251 --> 00:04:38.330
<v Speaker 1>draws people in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

110
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's better to be in England to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the rain a little bit,</v>

111
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.923
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>

114
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 2>very nice like when the rain clears and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's sort of glistens and that's</v>

115

<v Speaker 2>I paint and I do a lot of street </v>

119
00:04:58.271 --> 00:04:59.130
<v Speaker 2>photography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those,</v>

120
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've already got into instagram recently</v>

121
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 2>and I've just been putting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting that stuff on there,</v>

122
00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:05.890
<v Speaker 2>which I don't know how interesting it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

123
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Generally a nice place to put that kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of stuff.</v>

124
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.273
<v Speaker 2>I paint like these big portraits and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they just ended up sitting around my </v>

125
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to buy it.</v>

126
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:15.820
<v Speaker 2>No one's to buy a giant picture of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>

127
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:18.820
<v Speaker 2>so they don't really sell them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they just sit around.</v>

128
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 2>So actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

129
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 2>putting them on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least that's not my mother.</v>

130
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Just for clarity is your stuff is really</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

131
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.820
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are these.</v>

132
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a caricature is Tom waits once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>

133
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.943
<v Speaker 1>It's surprisingly good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you think someone is really good </v>

134
00:05:34.191 --> 00:05:35.024
<v Speaker 1>at something like magic and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's about as good as he's </v>

135
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.280
<v Speaker 1>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get it.</v>

136
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he's going to be that good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at something else,</v>

137
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.150
<v Speaker 1>but you are literally flicking through </v>
<v Speaker 1>my instagram.</v>

138
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

139
00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:46.860
<v Speaker 1>you're really good art artist.</v>

140
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you done this your whole life?</v>

141
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

142
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much like as a,</v>

143
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 2>as a kid I used to draw and paint a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>and always faces like I'm no good else,</v>

144
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 2>but a faces has always been my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I should do like cut these kind of,</v>

145
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>characatures and now I paint more,</v>

146
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 2>sort of straight pictures I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's nice if you do something that's</v>

147
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:09.330
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 2>public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nice to do something that's private</v>

149
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.120
<v Speaker 2>and it's that thing of something bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>than yourself to throw yourself into and</v>

150
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 2>dilute yourself in and it's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks of,</v>

152
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just being in my studio is just as </v>

153
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 2>lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great thing.</v>

154
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you find that stuff like that clears </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind for your other work?</v>

155
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the sheer contrast,</v>

156
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of my favorite parts of the year</v>

157
00:06:34.421 --> 00:06:35.254
<v Speaker 2>is touring and I get to do the shows in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the evening and then the days are free </v>

158
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:40.180
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in London,</v>

159
00:06:40.181 --> 00:06:42.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm in some other cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so no one can.</v>

160
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.650
<v Speaker 2>No one can like get me in for a meeting </v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything.</v>

161
00:06:44.651 --> 00:06:47.230
<v Speaker 2>I just had the days free and I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>write.</v>

162
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I had a book on happiness that I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I wrote while I was on tour and it</v>

163
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:54.220
<v Speaker 2>was just this amazing routine of just </v>
<v Speaker 2>finding a coffee shop,</v>

164
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.560
<v Speaker 2>spending the day writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then if that does get a bit,</v>

165
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit boring or a bit sad or something.</v>

166
00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:02.314
<v Speaker 2>If it's not quite coming together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've Dang you then get to go out and </v>

167
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:05.224
<v Speaker 2>be this amazingly charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well rehearsed version of yourself on </v>

168
00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:08.231
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

169
00:07:08.231 --> 00:07:09.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full of adrenaline and lovely.</v>

170
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.290
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an amazing routine.</v>

171
00:07:11.291 --> 00:07:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I think that's my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite thing.</v>

172
00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:14.860
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the painting and all that.</v>

173
00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Photography is an interesting one </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you,</v>

174
00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:17.194
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find yourself on the one hand kind </v>

175
00:07:19.451 --> 00:07:22.150
<v Speaker 2>of slightly because I do street </v>
<v Speaker 2>photography so it's kind of,</v>

176
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out taking pictures of candid moments I </v>

177
00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:26.854
<v Speaker 2>guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your,</v>

178
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.923
<v Speaker 2>you're a step out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also very open and engaged </v>

179
00:07:30.461 --> 00:07:32.980
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that feels like a really prime state</v>

180
00:07:32.981 --> 00:07:33.814
<v Speaker 2>that's very kind of porous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lovely state to be in and having been </v>

181
00:07:37.361 --> 00:07:38.194
<v Speaker 2>used to keeping my head down out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>public because I realize I'm not known </v>

182
00:07:40.451 --> 00:07:41.980
<v Speaker 2>here at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the UK I a bit.</v>

183
00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:45.250
<v Speaker 2>So if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was out in public or generally kind</v>

184
00:07:45.251 --> 00:07:49.180
<v Speaker 2>of naturally kind of hunker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunker down and now it's the opposite.</v>

185
00:07:49.181 --> 00:07:52.620
<v Speaker 2>It's totally changed that relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's good.</v>

186
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just photography,</v>

187
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:59.370
<v Speaker 2>just being out there and taking pictures</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you having to be mindful and open and</v>

188
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.100
<v Speaker 2>alert and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

189
00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:06.100
<v Speaker 2>because I'm probably a little bit shy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So having that little step back thing as</v>

190
00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:06.934
<v Speaker 2>well because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

191
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.860
<v Speaker 2>taking pictures is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is uh,</v>

192
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.933
<v Speaker 2>I found that really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really great state and it's a lovely </v>

193
00:08:13.031 --> 00:08:14.010
<v Speaker 2>contrast to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

194
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 2>the shows and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

195
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.733
<v Speaker 2>the rest of it</v>

196
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:21.570
<v Speaker 1>or you always shy or did you become more</v>
<v Speaker 1>shy because of becoming really famous?</v>

197
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.150
<v Speaker 2>I was always,</v>

198
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not always.</v>

199
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.820
<v Speaker 2>I think I grew quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

200
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.450
<v Speaker 2>that's probably quite insecure to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very charming and very,</v>

201
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:34.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

202
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.330
<v Speaker 2>quite bright and quite like socially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

203
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was all good.</v>

204
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:41.540
<v Speaker 2>But I think like inside I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

205
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.553
<v Speaker 2>I was very intimidated by the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sporty kids you would have terrified me </v>

206
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.760
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

207
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.450
<v Speaker 2>as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

208
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.560
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fled,</v>

209
00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:52.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids like kids,</v>

210
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.603
<v Speaker 2>just sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not use that because I really </v>

211
00:08:54.771 --> 00:08:56.890
<v Speaker 2>didn't fit in with any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

212
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.193
<v Speaker 2>and so when I first started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started my career as a hypnotist and </v>

213
00:09:01.811 --> 00:09:02.644
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this guy performing at university </v>

214
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:05.304
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

215
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 2>I just thought I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do that.</v>

216
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

217
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize at the time all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxes that it was,</v>

218
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>performing that sort of,</v>

219
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>need for affirmation and love and center</v>

220
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 2>of attention and also the control aspect</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

221
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of um,</v>

222
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

223
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.340
<v Speaker 2>the control aspect and also the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that,</v>

224
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.183
<v Speaker 2>particularly the sort of guys that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>respond well to hypnosis and come up on </v>

225
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 2>stage and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and respond well to it,</v>

226
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 2>tell it to be exactly the kind of guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would really intimidated me before.</v>

227
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.370
<v Speaker 2>So that was at an unconscious level and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope I've grown out of that now.</v>

228
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.870
<v Speaker 2>Main Labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

229
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 2>It takes a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes a lot of boxes.</v>

230
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:45.670
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I started in the Em's.</v>

231
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.553
<v Speaker 2>Definitely driven by insecurity because </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie's any sort of magic which sort of </v>

232
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 2>followed me on from the hypnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're basically,</v>

233
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.273
<v Speaker 2>it is the quickest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most fraudulent route of impressing </v>

234
00:09:56.671 --> 00:09:57.504
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the subtext is only look at my </v>

235
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.213
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not that interesting after </v>

236
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:02.850
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've tried to,</v>

237
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I've,</v>

238
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 2>as I've grown up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to move into a different area</v>

239
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.690
<v Speaker 2>and one that's a little more resonant </v>
<v Speaker 2>than just showing off.</v>

240
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.140
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating that you started out </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing hypnosis,</v>

241
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:16.170
<v Speaker 2>shows that a comedy show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it was sort of,</v>

242
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would mainly performance like uh,</v>

243
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.633
<v Speaker 2>colleges and I do a demonstration and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then have questions and questions and </v>

244
00:10:24.721 --> 00:10:27.330
<v Speaker 2>answers afterwards and I wasn't making </v>
<v Speaker 2>people look stupid.</v>

245
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Speaker 2>It was an entertainment show and I guess</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of funny,</v>

246
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:31.920
<v Speaker 2>but it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

247
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a really interesting thing and</v>

248
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.013
<v Speaker 2>the trouble with doing on stage is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it gets mixed up with people </v>

249
00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:40.650
<v Speaker 2>just kind of playing along and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

250
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.690
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you take that out of it,</v>

251
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.620
<v Speaker 2>it's just a really interesting area and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done this stuff for,</v>

252
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years back home and I'm not,</v>

253
00:10:47.611 --> 00:10:49.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't think of myself as a hypnotist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was just kind of where I,</v>

254
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 2>where I started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the suggestion based techniques.</v>

255
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:54.834
<v Speaker 2>So that is something I continued with </v>
<v Speaker 2>and brought into different areas and I </v>

256
00:10:58.681 --> 00:11:00.210
<v Speaker 2>still don't fully understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

257
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:01.044
<v Speaker 2>now you can have a quiet climates inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's head and know what they're </v>

258
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:06.780
<v Speaker 2>experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I used to do in the,</v>

259
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.150
<v Speaker 2>what I used to do these like stage </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypnosis shows.</v>

260
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.983
<v Speaker 2>The last thing I did was to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd tell these people on stage that I </v>

261
00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 2>was invisible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

262
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:15.420
<v Speaker 2>And I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd float something through the air,</v>

263
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.670
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this bottle I've got here is,</v>

264
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.370
<v Speaker 2>it's normally something bigger like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chair and they'd be freaking out,</v>

265
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.650
<v Speaker 2>running off stage and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But afterwards,</v>

266
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:25.490
<v Speaker 2>when I'd had this kind of q and a I </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

267
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Speaker 2>I'd ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was your,</v>

268
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:29.220
<v Speaker 2>what was your actual experience like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

269
00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:30.680
<v Speaker 2>the show's over and I'll be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we,</v>

270
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.623
<v Speaker 2>what you're experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'd get some people that would </v>

271
00:11:32.881 --> 00:11:34.640
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

272
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.050
<v Speaker 2>you were obviously just floating that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were just holding it,</v>

273
00:11:37.051 --> 00:11:37.884
<v Speaker 2>but I kind of felt like I had to play </v>
<v Speaker 2>along and then you'd get this </v>

274
00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:41.430
<v Speaker 2>interesting area in the middle of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like,</v>

275
00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:43.770
<v Speaker 2>well I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now when I think that yes,</v>

276
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:44.604
<v Speaker 2>of course it was you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was and I sort of knew it was </v>

277
00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I am emotionally just completely.</v>

278
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:49.763
<v Speaker 2>I could only experience it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying floating bottle or whatever </v>

279
00:11:52.591 --> 00:11:54.670
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a bit like an actor,</v>

280
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:56.140
<v Speaker 2>like getting caught up in a role I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess.</v>

281
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:56.974
<v Speaker 2>Like they know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know they're onstage and it's a </v>

282
00:11:57.881 --> 00:11:59.740
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless emotionally committed.</v>

283
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.980
<v Speaker 2>And at the other extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that would not accept that it was</v>

284
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 2>me floating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

285
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:05.980
<v Speaker 2>they that must have been on a wire or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

286
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:06.814
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way that I could drop you </v>

287
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:10.390
<v Speaker 2>back at the picture in my memory of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

288
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.740
<v Speaker 2>So how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you,</v>

289
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.030
<v Speaker 2>how do you judge what that experience is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's and,</v>

290
00:12:14.031 --> 00:12:16.090
<v Speaker 2>and all those people that are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

291
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:16.924
<v Speaker 2>you are really invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they just saying that because they </v>

292
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:19.840
<v Speaker 2>want to be like the best subjects in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

293
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.793
<v Speaker 2>in that group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

294
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.090
<v Speaker 2>how do you tease it all apart?</v>

295
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 2>It's that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that that must be a real issue,</v>

296
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:26.344
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people that just want to please you </v>

297
00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:28.474
<v Speaker 2>and are playing along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can you tell if you were fighting </v>

298
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:32.261
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

299
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:33.094
<v Speaker 2>I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>

300
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 2>The way I use it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of,</v>

301
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.050
<v Speaker 2>I use it quite sort of subtly in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

302
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:39.603
<v Speaker 2>I don't like overtly hypnotize people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that means it can mean one of two </v>

303
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:47.730
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It either means it just,</v>

304
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:48.813
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested people playing along </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm not just trying to create </v>

305
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:51.694
<v Speaker 2>the effect of someone hypnotized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to genuinely be responding to </v>

306
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:55.300
<v Speaker 2>this thing in order for the next bit to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

307
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.230
<v Speaker 2>in which case I have to filter out </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody playing lumbered,</v>

308
00:12:58.231 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 2>but occasionally,</v>

309
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:02.410
<v Speaker 2>occasionally it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of the time,</v>

310
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:05.030
<v Speaker 2>like I'll get people up on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll shake their hand and they're,</v>

311
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.580
<v Speaker 2>there's a rapid handshake induction that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guidance just falls to the floor.</v>

312
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.633
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are times that that matters </v>

313
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:16.030
<v Speaker 2>and they have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has to be really honest response.</v>

314
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.253
<v Speaker 2>Other times I can tell they're sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>half into it and they're just a bit </v>

315
00:13:18.911 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 2>intimidated and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the 2000 people looking,</v>

316
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:22.444
<v Speaker 2>that might look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of might look like the same </v>

317
00:13:23.231 --> 00:13:25.300
<v Speaker 2>thing and then it won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does exactly.</v>

318
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The handshake induction,</v>

319
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:27.400
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

320
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

321
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.573
<v Speaker 2>I take no responsibility for explaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>this to your tens of millions of </v>

322
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:34.443
<v Speaker 2>listeners and viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

323
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.111
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

324
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

325
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.620
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're interrupting a,</v>

326
00:13:38.621 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 2>an automatic process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

327
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:40.894
<v Speaker 2>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the key to it was made popular </v>

328
00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:44.434
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

329
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 2>made popular by I guess Richard Bandler </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the guy behind nlp and so on.</v>

330
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he kind of created this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

331
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:54.030
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps perhaps Erickson did before </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

332
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:54.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

333
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.140
<v Speaker 2>you take an automatic process and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>interrupted in the middle.</v>

334
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:00.850
<v Speaker 2>So like when you're shaking hands with </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

335
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.600
<v Speaker 2>it's such a familiar process that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you start,</v>

336
00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:05.381
<v Speaker 2>you're not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

337
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:06.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to grip this person's hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

338
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm going to move my hand up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>down with them a few times.</v>

339
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Then I'll take my hand to what you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of do it automatically.</v>

340
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:16.950
<v Speaker 2>And there's something about interrupting</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that Leaves People Really</v>

341
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.090
<v Speaker 2>flummoxed and bewildered because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

342
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.250
<v Speaker 2>really caught off guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you imagine somebody comes up to</v>

343
00:14:23.251 --> 00:14:26.310
<v Speaker 2>you in the street and says it's not half</v>
<v Speaker 2>past seven,</v>

344
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your reaction isn't to go,</v>

345
00:14:28.651 --> 00:14:28.980
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

346
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.310
<v Speaker 2>I know it's 20 past nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your reaction is,</v>

347
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.110
<v Speaker 2>is a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think you've missed something,</v>

348
00:14:34.111 --> 00:14:36.060
<v Speaker 2>like you're trying to make sense of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a strange,</v>

349
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda put you on the back foot.</v>

350
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:39.953
<v Speaker 2>And at that point if you to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've got somebody who's fairly </v>

351
00:14:41.851 --> 00:14:44.160
<v Speaker 2>suggestible and people coming up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>

352
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.220
<v Speaker 2>it's such an odd moment for them anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're naturally wrote,</v>

353
00:14:46.221 --> 00:14:51.221
<v Speaker 2>suggestible that a clear instruction to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep or whatever you want give them,</v>

354
00:14:51.351 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 2>tends to be taken very deeply and very </v>
<v Speaker 2>often than you'll see on shake hands.</v>

355
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:56.174
<v Speaker 2>And I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll break the pattern of the </v>

356
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.713
<v Speaker 2>handshakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

357
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:58.623
<v Speaker 2>I'll often take their hand and lifted up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to their face and say sleep and show </v>

358
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:03.434
<v Speaker 2>them their hand like that and they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep and well it's not sleep that it's </v>

359
00:15:06.141 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 2>a kind of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like.</v>

360
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll do anything from eyes closed.</v>

361
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Head drops down to just drop like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a dead weight on the floor,</v>

362
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.343
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I found is most interesting </v>

363
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:16.544
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like applying this in slightly </v>

364
00:15:19.671 --> 00:15:24.671
<v Speaker 2>more useful everyday situations was as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like a self defense technique.</v>

365
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:26.174
<v Speaker 2>I was walking a between so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>must have been like 20 or something and </v>

366
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.463
<v Speaker 2>I was at a magic convention and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking from one hotel to another and </v>

367
00:15:35.871 --> 00:15:40.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm dressing like a three piece velvet </v>
<v Speaker 2>suit as skinny British law,</v>

368
00:15:40.451 --> 00:15:41.490
<v Speaker 2>but might as well have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

369
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.790
<v Speaker 2>punched me in the throat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tattooed across my face.</v>

370
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.983
<v Speaker 2>And this guy comes up and it's like he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk and he's about three in the </v>

371
00:15:47.331 --> 00:15:49.580
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drunk aggressive is with his girlfriend,</v>

372
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.030
<v Speaker 2>clearly looking for a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

373
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 2>he sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he comes up to me and he says,</v>

374
00:15:55.491 --> 00:15:56.071
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

375
00:15:56.071 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 2>what do you fucking looking at when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at?</v>

376
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:02.330
<v Speaker 2>And because I'd spoken about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to deal with this sort of thing,</v>

377
00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:04.040
<v Speaker 2>but it never found myself in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

378
00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:06.800
<v Speaker 2>I kind of had it all mentally rehearsed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said to him,</v>

379
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.480
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wall outside,</v>

380
00:16:08.481 --> 00:16:13.481
<v Speaker 2>my house isn't four foot high and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess there's an equivalent to this with</v>

381
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.940
<v Speaker 2>sort of adrenaline dump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called and in martial arts,</v>

382
00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:18.710
<v Speaker 2>but there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just like,</v>

383
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.190
<v Speaker 2>he's got all this adrenaline and then a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing like that for me,</v>

384
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:24.320
<v Speaker 2>which is just out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it makes sense.</v>

385
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:26.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking gibberish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense,</v>

386
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:28.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's just out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now suddenly he's thinking,</v>

387
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.890
<v Speaker 2>I've what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've missed something.</v>

388
00:16:30.891 --> 00:16:33.800
<v Speaker 2>So now he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was sort of went what?</v>

389
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.000
<v Speaker 2>And I said his girlfriend walked off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

390
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 2>the wall outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my house isn't for,</v>

391
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:39.980
<v Speaker 2>for high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent some time in Spain,</v>

392
00:16:39.981 --> 00:16:40.814
<v Speaker 2>the walls that were very high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the ones here that </v>

393
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.310
<v Speaker 2>they're tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're nothing.</v>

394
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.600
<v Speaker 2>And then he just sort of broke down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sort of at war,</v>

395
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.370
<v Speaker 2>ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

396
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.440
<v Speaker 2>started crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

397
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:50.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't quite crying,</v>

398
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:51.704
<v Speaker 2>but it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like all the adrenaline and </v>

399
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.953
<v Speaker 2>everything just just flooded out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he sat down and I ended up sitting </v>

400
00:16:58.131 --> 00:16:59.270
<v Speaker 2>next to him on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

401
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.870
<v Speaker 2>on the road side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking him,</v>

402
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what was the plan was I was going to </v>

403
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:06.630
<v Speaker 2>try and stick his feet to the floor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lay out.</v>

404
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.480
<v Speaker 2>His whole family just kind of collapsed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sat down.</v>

405
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.190
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was because I knew it would be like</v>

406
00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.660
<v Speaker 2>this highly suggestible state and either</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

407
00:17:14.661 --> 00:17:17.480
<v Speaker 2>the moment of aggression and passed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I ended up,</v>

408
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.373
<v Speaker 2>ended up weirdly sitting with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking him what had happened that </v>

409
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:21.404
<v Speaker 2>evening and his girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she'd bottled somebody or </v>

410
00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:23.760
<v Speaker 2>something horrible had happened.</v>

411
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.400
<v Speaker 2>So we'd got out with all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression,</v>

412
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.360
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good one,</v>

413
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:27.400
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just have like,</v>

414
00:17:27.401 --> 00:17:28.234
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be just a song lyric or just </v>

415
00:17:29.631 --> 00:17:30.464
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some weird kind of thing that you can </v>

416
00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:34.850
<v Speaker 2>just go into in those situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

417
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:35.930
<v Speaker 2>if someone's running at you with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>knife,</v>

418
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:38.180
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you just,</v>

419
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.043
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of strangely taking control </v>

420
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.043
<v Speaker 2>of a situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise what you're going to do if </v>

421
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:43.760
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you looking at?</v>

422
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.583
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you can answer that </v>

423
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:47.624
<v Speaker 2>without being on the back foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it just kind of nicely kind of </v>

424
00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:52.370
<v Speaker 2>inverts the situation and puts them on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bank vault,</v>

425
00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:53.191
<v Speaker 2>which anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it worked.</v>

426
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:55.560
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of fun.</v>

427
00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there like a process required to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypnotize someone?</v>

428
00:18:00.461 --> 00:18:02.420
<v Speaker 1>You could just do it that way and saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't.</v>

429
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Just talk them through some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>program that makes them think their foot</v>

430
00:18:05.441 --> 00:18:06.370
<v Speaker 1>is stuck to the floor.</v>

431
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.640
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

432
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.750
<v Speaker 2>it will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depends on the moment I had.</v>

433
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.340
<v Speaker 2>I used to hypnotize people in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my room when I was a student.</v>

434
00:18:15.341 --> 00:18:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was the guy that did hypnosis,</v>

435
00:18:17.291 --> 00:18:20.650
<v Speaker 2>what are people coming regularly coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>to to try it out?</v>

436
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.450
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I this,</v>

437
00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.483
<v Speaker 2>this one time I used to leave people </v>
<v Speaker 2>with like if they were responsive to it </v>

438
00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.350
<v Speaker 2>and this was like I was really early </v>
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

439
00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:30.184
<v Speaker 2>it was like 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half an hour of relaxing somebody and </v>

440
00:18:31.901 --> 00:18:32.734
<v Speaker 2>maybe suggesting that their hands were </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting lightened floating or heavy and </v>

441
00:18:35.441 --> 00:18:36.490
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't lift them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So kind of,</v>

442
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of basic stuff.</v>

443
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.333
<v Speaker 2>But I would leave them if they were very</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggestible with the instruction that </v>

444
00:18:41.681 --> 00:18:43.060
<v Speaker 2>when you come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I click my fingers,</v>

445
00:18:43.061 --> 00:18:45.240
<v Speaker 2>you'll get back into the sleep state and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

446
00:18:45.241 --> 00:18:46.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of get conditioned to that.</v>

447
00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.610
<v Speaker 2>It'll often work even like a week later </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this guy came and uh,</v>

448
00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I thought I'd seen him before.</v>

449
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.430
<v Speaker 2>I thought he'd been on the previous </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

450
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.980
<v Speaker 2>So he sat down and I go look at me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>

451
00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.990
<v Speaker 2>click my fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he went out,</v>

452
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.070
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

453
00:19:00.071 --> 00:19:03.670
<v Speaker 2>And then we did whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe perhaps you wanted to stop smoking</v>

454
00:19:03.671 --> 00:19:06.250
<v Speaker 2>or his hands floating in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it wasn't at the end of it,</v>

455
00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.280
<v Speaker 2>I realized in talking to him that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't met him before,</v>

456
00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.291
<v Speaker 2>so then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

457
00:19:11.291 --> 00:19:13.030
<v Speaker 2>how did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did,</v>

458
00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:13.893
<v Speaker 2>why did you respond to me clicking my </v>
<v Speaker 2>fingers because I don't have magic </v>

459
00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:16.954
<v Speaker 2>fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing like anything going on </v>

460
00:19:18.581 --> 00:19:20.080
<v Speaker 2>here other than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realized it was just that.</v>

461
00:19:20.081 --> 00:19:20.914
<v Speaker 2>It was just that moment of my kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence with it and the fact </v>

462
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.903
<v Speaker 2>fortuitously that he was also very </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggestible and put those two things </v>

463
00:19:28.061 --> 00:19:29.530
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what made it work.</v>

464
00:19:29.531 --> 00:19:30.364
<v Speaker 2>It was just that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that psychological moment for him that </v>

465
00:19:33.671 --> 00:19:34.504
<v Speaker 2>was more important than the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 20 minute script that I'd been </v>

466
00:19:37.031 --> 00:19:41.130
<v Speaker 2>learning and using up to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was kind of a seminal seminal.</v>

467
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

468
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Confidence in that he had already been </v>
<v Speaker 1>under.</v>

469
00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't question it because I really,</v>

470
00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.290
<v Speaker 2>I believe that he had and it just kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

471
00:19:47.291 --> 00:19:49.660
<v Speaker 2>it just sort of happened and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

472
00:19:49.661 --> 00:19:52.750
<v Speaker 2>If he hadn't been a suggestible type and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably wouldn't have worked,</v>

473
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.000
<v Speaker 2>but luckily he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of really,</v>

474
00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.253
<v Speaker 2>really changed the way that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I thought about hypnosis and also </v>

475
00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:01.800
<v Speaker 2>started this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

476
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.570
<v Speaker 2>this realization that ultimately my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kind of toolkit with what I do is,</v>

477
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.310
<v Speaker 2>is the stories that people are telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves that's,</v>

478
00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.840
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really all there is.</v>

479
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:14.703
<v Speaker 2>Even a magician showing you a card trick</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just getting you to tell yourself a </v>

480
00:20:17.141 --> 00:20:18.550
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>edit,</v>

481
00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.270
<v Speaker 2>edit this event in such a way that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

482
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:22.901
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

483
00:20:22.901 --> 00:20:24.450
<v Speaker 2>I picked a card and then it disappeared </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>

484
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.440
<v Speaker 2>it was in my pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never went near me.</v>

485
00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:27.190
<v Speaker 2>And you it out.</v>

486
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:28.023
<v Speaker 2>All the bits that don't seem important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when he complimented you on your </v>

487
00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:31.443
<v Speaker 2>jacket earlier on in the day and may </v>
<v Speaker 2>have stuck a card in there or the bit </v>

488
00:20:34.241 --> 00:20:36.160
<v Speaker 2>where he took the car back for a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

489
00:20:36.161 --> 00:20:36.994
<v Speaker 2>Because you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

490
00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:37.893
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being sold a story with a </v>

491
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.630
<v Speaker 2>particular sort of edit points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

492
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.800
<v Speaker 2>to me that's interesting because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what life is,</v>

493
00:20:44.801 --> 00:20:46.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have this infinite data source coming</v>

494
00:20:46.631 --> 00:20:48.760
<v Speaker 2>at us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can,</v>

495
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.240
<v Speaker 2>we just have to kind of reduce it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>store is to make to make sense.</v>

496
00:20:52.241 --> 00:20:53.074
<v Speaker 2>I think stripping aside all the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vaudeville and tacky associations of </v>

497
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.740
<v Speaker 2>hypnotists and magicians and solid think</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something.</v>

498
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:01.180
<v Speaker 2>There's something interesting at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart of it.</v>

499
00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:06.181
<v Speaker 2>I think that that our storytelling </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity is endlessly fascinating to me.</v>

500
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating in that regard,</v>

501
00:21:10.381 --> 00:21:13.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's also fascinating that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be like some cheat code,</v>

502
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.690
<v Speaker 1>the human mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a,</v>

503
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.613
<v Speaker 1>there's a way you can like lock into </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an admin panel and all of a sudden </v>

504
00:21:20.881 --> 00:21:21.714
<v Speaker 1>you're doing things like telling people </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't really don't want to be </v>

505
00:21:24.091 --> 00:21:24.924
<v Speaker 1>smoking or putting them into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypnotic mindset by just snapping your </v>

506
00:21:28.351 --> 00:21:29.430
<v Speaker 1>fingers and sang sleep.</v>

507
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.570
<v Speaker 2>It's odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>

508
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.460
<v Speaker 2>I think it looks like that and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem because it looks it.</v>

509
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:36.563
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You so often see it when performers are </v>

510
00:21:38.601 --> 00:21:41.870
<v Speaker 2>doing it and they're often going for </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of theatrical effect.</v>

511
00:21:41.871 --> 00:21:42.704
<v Speaker 2>If you go and look at it like a clinical</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment where hypnosis are being </v>

512
00:21:45.951 --> 00:21:47.840
<v Speaker 2>investigated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't like that at all.</v>

513
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:52.340
<v Speaker 2>It's much more a kind of boring in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wiser,</v>

514
00:21:52.341 --> 00:21:52.611
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

515
00:21:52.611 --> 00:21:55.100
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't have any theater attached to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>as much more on,</v>

516
00:21:55.101 --> 00:21:55.934
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of intuitively understandable had </v>

517
00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.780
<v Speaker 2>been hypnotized yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible.</v>

518
00:21:59.781 --> 00:22:01.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm a really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bad subject.</v>

519
00:22:01.371 --> 00:22:06.371
<v Speaker 2>I had one experience where I only one </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in like a workshop thing that</v>

520
00:22:06.921 --> 00:22:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>

521
00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.680
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

522
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.410
<v Speaker 2>a pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person that wasn't giving the workshop</v>

523
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.740
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sat with,</v>

524
00:22:14.741 --> 00:22:15.061
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

525
00:22:15.061 --> 00:22:16.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the exercise was,</v>

526
00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:17.060
<v Speaker 2>it really worked for me.</v>

527
00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.810
<v Speaker 2>It might work for others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're split into pairs and uh,</v>

528
00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.900
<v Speaker 2>the idea is you start to describe a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scene.</v>

529
00:22:23.901 --> 00:22:25.130
<v Speaker 2>So you sat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sat with this woman,</v>

530
00:22:25.131 --> 00:22:25.964
<v Speaker 2>you close your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start to describe a scene and you </v>

531
00:22:28.071 --> 00:22:29.810
<v Speaker 2>get back and forth adding details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

532
00:22:29.811 --> 00:22:32.210
<v Speaker 2>So she says I become laying on a beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

533
00:22:32.211 --> 00:22:33.680
<v Speaker 2>so I just imagine that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

534
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.930
<v Speaker 2>now I'm going to beach and I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

535
00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.650
<v Speaker 2>I can feel the warmth of the sun on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

536
00:22:39.651 --> 00:22:42.380
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just kind of like imagining it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and joining in with the story.</v>

537
00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.310
<v Speaker 2>And then I just remember somebody going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

538
00:22:46.311 --> 00:22:47.000
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>time out,</v>

539
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.060
<v Speaker 2>time for lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

540
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.013
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been on a behind beat on a beach </v>

541
00:22:50.511 --> 00:22:51.920
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd completely just,</v>

542
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:53.563
<v Speaker 2>I'd been there like a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was completely real at some point it </v>

543
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:56.783
<v Speaker 2>tipped into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only experience I've had of </v>

544
00:22:58.251 --> 00:22:58.790
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

545
00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't respond to it.</v>

546
00:23:00.551 --> 00:23:03.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just suggestibility.</v>

547
00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:08.430
<v Speaker 2>It's something about a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we get it when you know,</v>

548
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.303
<v Speaker 2>we get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a doctor gives us a placebo and we </v>

549
00:23:10.371 --> 00:23:13.100
<v Speaker 2>respond to that because this authority </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure is giving us that or,</v>

550
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.113
<v Speaker 2>or the way we absorb a opinions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that we admire and experts that </v>

551
00:23:18.141 --> 00:23:18.974
<v Speaker 2>we admire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How we just more easily take those on </v>

552
00:23:20.341 --> 00:23:21.174
<v Speaker 2>board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unquestioningly this is all the same </v>

553
00:23:22.071 --> 00:23:23.300
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just suggestion.</v>

554
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:28.910
<v Speaker 2>The trouble is most of the time it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>done through the world of the performing</v>

555
00:23:28.911 --> 00:23:29.744
<v Speaker 2>hypnotists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't.</v>

556
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:30.663
<v Speaker 2>It isn't giving really a very clear and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fair view of what was going on because </v>

557
00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:38.000
<v Speaker 2>it's so theatrical and so often you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

558
00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.970
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're relishing and things like I click</v>

559
00:23:40.971 --> 00:23:43.550
<v Speaker 2>my fingers and this guy went to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not really,</v>

560
00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.073
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

561
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.710
<v Speaker 2>what are they doing?</v>

562
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.543
<v Speaker 2>Their Qa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

563
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:47.863
<v Speaker 2>I think just kind of responding because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've just asked them to and they know </v>

564
00:23:50.001 --> 00:23:50.834
<v Speaker 2>that when you click their fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to go to sleep is </v>

565
00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:53.624
<v Speaker 2>there's a real range of possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences that you might look like a </v>

566
00:23:57.231 --> 00:23:58.400
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean it is.</v>

567
00:23:58.401 --> 00:23:59.234
<v Speaker 2>They might just be just complying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to do some of this stuff on </v>

568
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:06.650
<v Speaker 2>stage without using the hypnosis to show</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's.</v>

569
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.513
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens under Moses that can't be done </v>

570
00:24:08.841 --> 00:24:13.160
<v Speaker 2>without a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was having this discussion with my</v>

571
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:18.161
<v Speaker 2>friend Andy who directs and my stage </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows with me and I was saying like that</v>

572
00:24:18.651 --> 00:24:19.281
<v Speaker 2>thing of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

573
00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:23.000
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a hypnotist get somewhere to eat an</v>

574
00:24:23.001 --> 00:24:24.230
<v Speaker 2>onion and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

575
00:24:24.231 --> 00:24:25.064
<v Speaker 2>this is a classic hypnotic stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gives them a raw onion and says it's a </v>

576
00:24:26.931 --> 00:24:27.980
<v Speaker 2>delicious juicy apple.</v>

577
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Now we sit and enjoy it and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody munching into an onion and like</v>

578
00:24:32.481 --> 00:24:34.550
<v Speaker 2>having no problem eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

579
00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:35.384
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that feels like if you're just </v>

580
00:24:36.951 --> 00:24:39.620
<v Speaker 2>going to pull it off without hypnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would that just happened anyway?</v>

581
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:41.860
<v Speaker 2>And Andy said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet I bet you can use it anyway.</v>

582
00:24:41.861 --> 00:24:43.940
<v Speaker 2>And he went to my fridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took out an onion,</v>

583
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.880
<v Speaker 2>took a big bite of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was fine because he's so.</v>

584
00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:48.290
<v Speaker 2>He's proving a point there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

585
00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:49.124
<v Speaker 2>So he's in a different mental state than</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody going got a day to take a bite </v>

586
00:24:52.551 --> 00:24:55.610
<v Speaker 2>of that onion when suddenly you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're preempting the,</v>

587
00:24:55.611 --> 00:24:56.444
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the disgust and all the reasons not to </v>

588
00:24:58.281 --> 00:25:00.020
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that he was just going,</v>

589
00:25:00.021 --> 00:25:01.640
<v Speaker 2>I bet you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And trying to prove a point.</v>

590
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did it and it was fine.</v>

591
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.630
<v Speaker 2>So that was a different mental state and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it worked.</v>

592
00:25:05.631 --> 00:25:08.120
<v Speaker 2>So that wasn't hypnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the end result still,</v>

593
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:09.283
<v Speaker 2>if you do that onstage and pretended to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypnotize somebody first it would look </v>

594
00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:15.070
<v Speaker 2>like you've done something amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>

595
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:15.740
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

596
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.573
<v Speaker 2>it's to me it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that story that someone's </v>

597
00:25:19.131 --> 00:25:21.200
<v Speaker 2>telling themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did it taste like?</v>

598
00:25:21.201 --> 00:25:23.050
<v Speaker 2>An onion to him or did it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

599
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.230
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have.</v>

600
00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:24.751
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

601
00:25:24.751 --> 00:25:25.011
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

602
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:26.160
<v Speaker 2>It would have tasted like an onion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

603
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.940
<v Speaker 2>There was no suggestion of female that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are hypnotized.</v>

604
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:32.120
<v Speaker 2>Does it tastes like an apple to them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

605
00:25:32.121 --> 00:25:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a monument.</v>

606
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Invisible one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they seeing?</v>

607
00:25:34.821 --> 00:25:36.790
<v Speaker 2>I think for some of them it will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

608
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.230
<v Speaker 2>taste and pain and things like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>discomfort.</v>

609
00:25:39.231 --> 00:25:40.064
<v Speaker 2>It's all very subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the end result of doing this thing </v>

610
00:25:42.981 --> 00:25:46.610
<v Speaker 2>that looks like it couldn't happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>without some magical process.</v>

611
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:47.443
<v Speaker 2>That's the key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And none of these things really demand </v>

612
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:50.714
<v Speaker 2>that met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when even when you look at people </v>

613
00:25:51.261 --> 00:25:52.094
<v Speaker 2>being I'm undergoing surgery through </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypnosis and being wide awake and being </v>

614
00:25:56.841 --> 00:25:57.890
<v Speaker 2>cut open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think,</v>

615
00:25:57.891 --> 00:25:58.724
<v Speaker 2>well that must be evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hypnosis is some special thing </v>

616
00:26:02.121 --> 00:26:05.060
<v Speaker 2>because that couldn't happen otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course it can,</v>

617
00:26:05.061 --> 00:26:05.894
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the layer of skin that feels pain is </v>

618
00:26:06.741 --> 00:26:09.980
<v Speaker 2>actually sort of quite thin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once you get through that,</v>

619
00:26:09.981 --> 00:26:11.660
<v Speaker 2>when you're moving organs around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

620
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.520
<v Speaker 2>that's not a painful process anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus very fully tend to use a bit,</v>

621
00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.373
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of like a local anesthetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway just to numb the very top layer </v>

622
00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:20.421
<v Speaker 2>of skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

623
00:26:20.421 --> 00:26:23.100
<v Speaker 2>what looks amazing very often isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

624
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.310
<v Speaker 2>it's an endlessly rich and bizarre area </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

625
00:26:28.311 --> 00:26:29.320
<v Speaker 2>And I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

626
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.153
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really think of myself as a </v>

627
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.580
<v Speaker 2>participant that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that process,</v>

628
00:26:34.581 --> 00:26:35.940
<v Speaker 2>that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

629
00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:41.860
<v Speaker 2>ability for people to get into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>space where they could have that kind of</v>

630
00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:43.710
<v Speaker 2>experience is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

631
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.730
<v Speaker 2>is something I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

632
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I'll always find interesting.</v>

633
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.000
<v Speaker 2>One of the recent stage shows I did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called miracle.</v>

634
00:26:51.001 --> 00:26:51.834
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm faith healing in the second </v>

635
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 2>half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So using exactly the same idea.</v>

636
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.070
<v Speaker 2>And I've got an audience that are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

637
00:26:58.071 --> 00:26:59.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't believe in that.</v>

638
00:26:59.011 --> 00:26:59.590
<v Speaker 2>And I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

639
00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in this either,</v>

640
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:04.620
<v Speaker 2>but will you just kind of go with me or </v>
<v Speaker 2>at least at the start,</v>

641
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:07.290
<v Speaker 2>because the results are a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

642
00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:08.124
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

643
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I just started doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

644
00:27:11.011 --> 00:27:11.844
<v Speaker 2>I'm fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really knowing if it was going to </v>

645
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:14.490
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

646
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:15.324
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get some adrenaline going and I </v>

647
00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.400
<v Speaker 2>know could see the techniques that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>charlatan faith healers we're using.</v>

648
00:27:20.401 --> 00:27:22.230
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

649
00:27:22.231 --> 00:27:22.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just,</v>

650
00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:23.670
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that.</v>

651
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:24.563
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

652
00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.060
<v Speaker 2>the adrenaline kills pains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think get some adrenaline going.</v>

653
00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:28.430
<v Speaker 2>There's bound to be people that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

654
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I had a pain in my back and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone.</v>

655
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.080
<v Speaker 2>But the actual results,</v>
<v Speaker 2>admittedly with small percentages of the</v>

656
00:27:34.081 --> 00:27:34.651
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

657
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:35.484
<v Speaker 2>not everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people that were coming up and </v>

658
00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:40.860
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this problem and now it's gone.</v>

659
00:27:40.861 --> 00:27:42.900
<v Speaker 2>And they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a woman that had a,</v>

660
00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.410
<v Speaker 2>she'd been paralyzed on one side of her </v>
<v Speaker 2>body since a kid.</v>

661
00:27:46.411 --> 00:27:47.244
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in her forties now she's in floods of </v>

662
00:27:48.061 --> 00:27:50.640
<v Speaker 2>tears going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't move my arm.</v>

663
00:27:50.641 --> 00:27:51.474
<v Speaker 2>And this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a skeptical audience like me </v>

664
00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:56.100
<v Speaker 2>that know that there's kind of playing </v>
<v Speaker 2>along with something.</v>

665
00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:57.660
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonetheless,</v>

666
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:58.710
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small percentage,</v>

667
00:27:58.711 --> 00:27:59.101
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

668
00:27:59.101 --> 00:28:00.150
<v Speaker 2>not everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but having,</v>

669
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:03.270
<v Speaker 2>having these kinds of experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

670
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.350
<v Speaker 2>So that's less of a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 2>component of suffering,</v>

671
00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:07.220
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

672
00:28:07.221 --> 00:28:10.040
<v Speaker 2>which was really eye doing that show </v>
<v Speaker 2>night after night after night.</v>

673
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:11.323
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faith healing has got to be a form of </v>

674
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:14.750
<v Speaker 2>hypnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

675
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

676
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.770
<v Speaker 2>It's the same world is playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both were,</v>

677
00:28:18.771 --> 00:28:22.600
<v Speaker 2>they both joined by is the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggestibility and uh,</v>

678
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.150
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes those healings,</v>

679
00:28:26.151 --> 00:28:26.984
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

680
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:28.520
<v Speaker 2>if you take an x ray before and </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards,</v>

681
00:28:28.521 --> 00:28:29.354
<v Speaker 2>nothing's changing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in as much as a lot can depend on </v>

682
00:28:31.971 --> 00:28:33.650
<v Speaker 2>this psychological component,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can,</v>

683
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.823
<v Speaker 2>can really make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives the percentages are getting </v>

684
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.750
<v Speaker 2>smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 3000 people in the audience,</v>

685
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:39.703
<v Speaker 2>300 people come up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 people come up on stage and I'm </v>

686
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.610
<v Speaker 2>involving them in the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but getting even smaller.</v>

687
00:28:46.611 --> 00:28:48.770
<v Speaker 2>There are people that like a year later </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're getting in touch and say,</v>

688
00:28:48.771 --> 00:28:51.130
<v Speaker 2>just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing did actually clear,</v>

689
00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:51.973
<v Speaker 2>like it hasn't come back because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it would only last for 10 </v>

690
00:28:53.781 --> 00:28:54.614
<v Speaker 2>minutes while they're on stage and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why you don't tell people to </v>

691
00:28:56.841 --> 00:28:58.220
<v Speaker 2>throw the pills away and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

692
00:28:58.221 --> 00:29:01.550
<v Speaker 2>But we're in probably like that half a </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent now,</v>

693
00:29:01.551 --> 00:29:03.350
<v Speaker 2>which is always going to be kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty extraordinary.</v>

694
00:29:03.351 --> 00:29:05.150
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

695
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.790
<v Speaker 2>it was like a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real thing.</v>

696
00:29:07.791 --> 00:29:08.624
<v Speaker 2>So when it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had 200 people and one of them </v>

697
00:29:11.031 --> 00:29:15.080
<v Speaker 2>actually cured from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is immensely bizarre.</v>

698
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.470
<v Speaker 2>It's immensely bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

699
00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:17.660
<v Speaker 2>it's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

700
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.353
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this bad shoulder for a long time </v>

701
00:29:22.281 --> 00:29:23.114
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

702
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.640
<v Speaker 2>I got really used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I put a jacket on,</v>

703
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:28.760
<v Speaker 2>kind of putting this in my left arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting it in,</v>

704
00:29:28.761 --> 00:29:29.594
<v Speaker 2>like letting my left arm go dead and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then using my right arm to pull the </v>

705
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:34.070
<v Speaker 2>thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now I don't know how much I really</v>

706
00:29:34.071 --> 00:29:36.710
<v Speaker 2>need to do that anymore or whether I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing it out of habit.</v>

707
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.320
<v Speaker 2>But if somebody got me up on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

708
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:40.303
<v Speaker 2>your left shoulder is healed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's now and kind of made me feel a bit </v>

709
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:44.290
<v Speaker 2>now go on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try it,</v>

710
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.460
<v Speaker 2>try and move your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move your arm.</v>

711
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:46.443
<v Speaker 2>I think in the surprise of it and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheer kind of just snapping out of that </v>

712
00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:53.560
<v Speaker 2>habit of being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my dead arm,</v>

713
00:29:53.561 --> 00:29:54.394
<v Speaker 2>I probably would be very surprised that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I could actually move it as much as I </v>

714
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

715
00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.271
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

716
00:29:58.271 --> 00:30:00.460
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like when you break it down,</v>

717
00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:01.780
<v Speaker 2>it's like not that amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you,</v>

718
00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.180
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see the,</v>

719
00:30:04.181 --> 00:30:05.014
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more kind of extreme and exciting </v>

720
00:30:08.051 --> 00:30:09.540
<v Speaker 2>ends at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

721
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.473
<v Speaker 2>it is mind blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you've realized how these </v>

722
00:30:11.621 --> 00:30:12.454
<v Speaker 2>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you start to go mad yourself and </v>

723
00:30:14.231 --> 00:30:14.681
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

724
00:30:14.681 --> 00:30:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I've got this special gift I could pack </v>
<v Speaker 2>out stadia doing like,</v>

725
00:30:19.121 --> 00:30:20.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did think of one point,</v>

726
00:30:20.231 --> 00:30:22.810
<v Speaker 2>why don't I do like a secular healing </v>
<v Speaker 2>show?</v>

727
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:23.441
<v Speaker 2>I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

728
00:30:23.441 --> 00:30:24.730
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

729
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.593
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work in everybody and it may </v>

730
00:30:26.351 --> 00:30:27.184
<v Speaker 2>only work for 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it certainly works in some meaning </v>

731
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:32.320
<v Speaker 2>of the word anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do that,</v>

732
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:35.470
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can start to go mad.</v>

733
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the processes of the mind,</v>

734
00:30:37.181 --> 00:30:40.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea of the placebo effect is</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>

735
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.240
<v Speaker 1>The idea that your mind has some ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't tap into consciously,</v>

736
00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.250
<v Speaker 1>but you can in some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>subconscious sense.</v>

737
00:30:48.251 --> 00:30:49.084
<v Speaker 1>Someone gives you something and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're convinced that it's doing </v>

738
00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:55.570
<v Speaker 1>something positive and it actually will </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some benefit to you of real,</v>

739
00:30:55.571 --> 00:30:56.404
<v Speaker 1>tangible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>measurable benefit and it doesn't seem </v>

740
00:30:59.381 --> 00:31:02.140
<v Speaker 1>to make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no mechanism that we can trace.</v>

741
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:03.110
<v Speaker 2>There's no mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

742
00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:03.983
<v Speaker 2>it's what I found works really well is </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done a few shows on placebo is for </v>

743
00:31:07.701 --> 00:31:08.534
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found the key is the person gets to </v>

744
00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:12.950
<v Speaker 2>absolve any responsibility for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>change themselves.</v>

745
00:31:12.951 --> 00:31:13.784
<v Speaker 2>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done a couple of things where this </v>

746
00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.230
<v Speaker 2>new show I have on Netflix now called </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice.</v>

747
00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.660
<v Speaker 2>A guy thinks he's got a micro chip </v>
<v Speaker 2>implanted in him,</v>

748
00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.810
<v Speaker 2>which is doing all the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

749
00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.773
<v Speaker 2>another show I've done is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a placebo injections they were </v>

750
00:31:25.941 --> 00:31:28.430
<v Speaker 2>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they fill the drug is doing the work,</v>

751
00:31:28.431 --> 00:31:29.264
<v Speaker 2>but the key is they don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't think they're doing any work </v>

752
00:31:32.631 --> 00:31:33.464
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing is taking care of that for </v>

753
00:31:35.481 --> 00:31:36.314
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really powerful because </v>

754
00:31:37.911 --> 00:31:38.744
<v Speaker 2>suddenly it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that thing of I don't have to do </v>

755
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.160
<v Speaker 2>the person thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to make this happen myself.</v>

756
00:31:46.161 --> 00:31:47.330
<v Speaker 2>There is no onus on me.</v>

757
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to do any anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

758
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.790
<v Speaker 2>this magic formula is somehow doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is hugely powerful.</v>

759
00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:55.131
<v Speaker 2>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

760
00:31:55.131 --> 00:31:55.721
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

761
00:31:55.721 --> 00:31:57.230
<v Speaker 2>that's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a big,</v>

762
00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.370
<v Speaker 2>big part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why a lot of the.</v>

763
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.820
<v Speaker 2>When we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we did the placebo program,</v>

764
00:32:01.821 --> 00:32:06.821
<v Speaker 2>we created this whole like I'm fake a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmacological building.</v>

765
00:32:07.221 --> 00:32:08.054
<v Speaker 2>We had a building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just fitted out with actors and </v>

766
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:10.783
<v Speaker 2>equipment and stuff to just create this </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment that was going to be </v>

767
00:32:13.071 --> 00:32:15.180
<v Speaker 2>convincing before the injections were </v>
<v Speaker 2>even given.</v>

768
00:32:15.181 --> 00:32:16.014
<v Speaker 2>And these people that had various like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fears or problems or things that would </v>

769
00:32:19.881 --> 00:32:24.100
<v Speaker 2>be just going to just investigate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see how well the placebo worked and uh,</v>

770
00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.061
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it did.</v>

771
00:32:26.061 --> 00:32:27.170
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's a helpful thing.</v>

772
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just something in you making it,</v>

773
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.750
<v Speaker 1>making it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

774
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Almost like a subconscious optimism or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

775
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

776
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.963
<v Speaker 1>I've wondered if that sort of mindset </v>
<v Speaker 1>that allows you to experience a </v>

777
00:32:42.411 --> 00:32:43.244
<v Speaker 1>beneficial result of a placebo if that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some way transfers over to everyday </v>

778
00:32:49.611 --> 00:32:50.444
<v Speaker 1>life events if having this may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfounded sense of optimism or this a </v>

779
00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.440
<v Speaker 1>bizarrely positive outlook or this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

780
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:02.743
<v Speaker 1>almost undo confidence actually can have</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a beneficial tangible </v>

781
00:33:07.671 --> 00:33:12.110
<v Speaker 1>result in the real world in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual events that take place.</v>

782
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:13.363
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's because of the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with other human beings that </v>

783
00:33:16.431 --> 00:33:19.330
<v Speaker 1>they are being influenced by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive attitude,</v>

784
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.580
<v Speaker 1>attitude and energy and the confidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and enthusiasm.</v>

785
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:23.683
<v Speaker 1>And then therefore things go smoother or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's really some sort of a </v>

786
00:33:27.471 --> 00:33:31.010
<v Speaker 1>factor of the way you interchange with </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality itself.</v>

787
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.490
<v Speaker 1>And that your attitude actually has an </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on events.</v>

788
00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:36.723
<v Speaker 2>I think it gets vastly overrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big advocate of strategic </v>

789
00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:40.694
<v Speaker 2>pessimism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the the problem with that kind </v>

790
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:47.230
<v Speaker 2>of the problem with unwavering </v>
<v Speaker 2>self-belief,</v>

791
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.060
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that it just doesn't.</v>

792
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:53.090
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't quite map into how life </v>
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>

793
00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:55.160
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Greeks had this down,</v>

794
00:33:55.161 --> 00:33:59.030
<v Speaker 2>so if you imagine a kind of a graph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got your,</v>

795
00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:00.123
<v Speaker 2>your y axis going up here of your aims </v>
<v Speaker 2>and things you want to achieve and then </v>

796
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:07.520
<v Speaker 2>your x axis is just what they used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>call fortune stuff.</v>

797
00:34:07.521 --> 00:34:10.310
<v Speaker 2>That life throws back at you that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no control over,</v>

798
00:34:10.311 --> 00:34:11.144
<v Speaker 2>no control at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we are told a lot nowadays that you </v>

799
00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:17.540
<v Speaker 2>just set your goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in yourself,</v>

800
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:22.370
<v Speaker 2>visualize this as if we can crank up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the line that we're living.</v>

801
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.533
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right up in line with our goals and our </v>

802
00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:27.440
<v Speaker 2>aims and so on.</v>

803
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.280
<v Speaker 2>The reality is there's always life like </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing back.</v>

804
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.750
<v Speaker 2>So actually what we lead is an x equals </v>
<v Speaker 2>y line.</v>

805
00:34:35.751 --> 00:34:38.540
<v Speaker 2>That that's a kind of more realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think appraisal of what our life is.</v>

806
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.553
<v Speaker 2>So actually kind of sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think making peace with that which </v>

807
00:34:43.011 --> 00:34:43.844
<v Speaker 2>allows for all the optimism you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also makes peace with the fact that </v>

808
00:34:48.561 --> 00:34:51.200
<v Speaker 2>at some point that might let you down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

809
00:34:51.201 --> 00:34:52.034
<v Speaker 2>you can spend your life climbing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ladder and then realize you had it </v>

810
00:34:54.521 --> 00:34:57.920
<v Speaker 2>against the wrong wall to quote Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Campbell,</v>

811
00:34:57.921 --> 00:34:58.754
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can set goals that they may just be </v>

812
00:35:01.131 --> 00:35:02.990
<v Speaker 2>the wrong goals and you may achieve </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

813
00:35:02.991 --> 00:35:03.824
<v Speaker 2>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

814
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:04.760
<v Speaker 2>now what I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

815
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.460
<v Speaker 2>a friend who um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

816
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:08.803
<v Speaker 2>spend a long time building up a company </v>
<v Speaker 2>and selling it and it'd been driven to </v>

817
00:35:11.811 --> 00:35:14.990
<v Speaker 2>do this all his life because he liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to sort of achieve,</v>

818
00:35:14.991 --> 00:35:15.980
<v Speaker 2>to feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

819
00:35:15.981 --> 00:35:19.850
<v Speaker 2>that he was a kind of really worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that was,</v>

820
00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:22.950
<v Speaker 2>he was all about achievement and then he</v>
<v Speaker 2>sells the company,</v>

821
00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:23.963
<v Speaker 2>achieves that dream and then he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what to do with his life because </v>

822
00:35:25.941 --> 00:35:27.500
<v Speaker 2>that urge was still there.</v>

823
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Now it had nowhere to go and actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up in therapy because of it.</v>

824
00:35:30.231 --> 00:35:33.560
<v Speaker 2>It was such a strangely a counter </v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitive thing.</v>

825
00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:34.910
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

826
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.833
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about changing the world for the </v>

827
00:35:38.941 --> 00:35:40.920
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think we have to make mental space</v>

828
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:43.100
<v Speaker 2>for the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

829
00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.830
<v Speaker 2>like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Freud credit psychoanalysis,</v>

830
00:35:46.831 --> 00:35:48.390
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't trying to make people happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he called it,</v>

831
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:52.050
<v Speaker 2>he called it restoring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>restoring natural unhappiness.</v>

832
00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.313
<v Speaker 2>My life is basically going to be unhappy</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes and he was trying to get rid </v>

833
00:35:56.371 --> 00:36:00.000
<v Speaker 2>of unnatural unhappiness as he saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it sort of neurotic unhappiness and</v>

834
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:05.001
<v Speaker 2>restore a kind of an easy relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>to life and fortune.</v>

835
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.480
<v Speaker 2>So to me that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the case.</v>

836
00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm always a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a bit skeptical of the kind of,</v>

837
00:36:08.891 --> 00:36:11.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just unwavering positivity.</v>

838
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

839
00:36:12.661 --> 00:36:13.800
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

840
00:36:13.801 --> 00:36:17.280
<v Speaker 2>I think that unwavering positivities </v>
<v Speaker 2>usually delusional.</v>

841
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a certain amount of positivity at </v>

842
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:22.771
<v Speaker 2>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

843
00:36:22.771 --> 00:36:23.720
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A certain amount,</v>

844
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:27.780
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of the dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the faith healers,</v>

845
00:36:27.781 --> 00:36:28.614
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the faith healing thing of you go </v>

846
00:36:29.971 --> 00:36:31.410
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't take your pills,</v>

847
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:35.340
<v Speaker 2>and if this condition returns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which it's going to,</v>

848
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.940
<v Speaker 2>it's your own fault because you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have enough faith right now that's quite</v>

849
00:36:38.941 --> 00:36:43.410
<v Speaker 2>a toxic cycle of self blame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same cycle that you get</v>

850
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:44.790
<v Speaker 2>when you read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the secret,</v>

851
00:36:44.791 --> 00:36:46.800
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>says quite explicitly,</v>

852
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.930
<v Speaker 2>if these great things don't come your </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

853
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:52.020
<v Speaker 2>it's because your self believer wavered </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a second.</v>

854
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:54.540
<v Speaker 2>You only have yourself to blame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's very explicit about that.</v>

855
00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

856
00:36:55.821 --> 00:36:56.780
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's it,</v>

857
00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:00.270
<v Speaker 2>it's great if you can put it in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain context.</v>

858
00:37:00.271 --> 00:37:01.920
<v Speaker 2>If not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sadly can be a recipe,</v>

859
00:37:01.921 --> 00:37:02.754
<v Speaker 2>I think for anxiety and just a feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>of failure that you don't understand </v>

860
00:37:06.391 --> 00:37:07.224
<v Speaker 2>where it's come from.</v>

861
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.333
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was trying to get at was I wonder </v>

862
00:37:09.931 --> 00:37:13.230
<v Speaker 2>if it's a component in a much larger </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>

863
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Not that it's the one thing like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>key,</v>

864
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.333
<v Speaker 2>like the real problem with the secret is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you're taking all these </v>

865
00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:23.100
<v Speaker 2>people that are already successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've achieved a certain result,</v>

866
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:26.010
<v Speaker 2>and then you're asking them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you achieve that result?</v>

867
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought positive and I just really put</v>

868
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:31.200
<v Speaker 2>my mind to it and I dreamt on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all have this in common.</v>

869
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

870
00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.320
<v Speaker 2>who also thought positive bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>losers.</v>

871
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:38.430
<v Speaker 2>They tried and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got hit in the head by asteroids or</v>

872
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.310
<v Speaker 2>car accidents or the world turned bad on</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

873
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:43.230
<v Speaker 2>That actually can happen too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

874
00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.060
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using,</v>

875
00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:47.870
<v Speaker 2>you have a biased focus group executive </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

876
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.531
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

877
00:37:48.531 --> 00:37:49.301
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

878
00:37:49.301 --> 00:37:50.134
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of setting a goal fixating on </v>

879
00:37:52.681 --> 00:37:53.514
<v Speaker 2>it and ignoring all the haters and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignoring all the people that will bring </v>

880
00:37:55.591 --> 00:38:00.591
<v Speaker 2>you down is a perfect recipe for failure</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as it's a common anecdotal,</v>

881
00:38:00.891 --> 00:38:02.130
<v Speaker 2>a story of success.</v>

882
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:02.993
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that is if you just </v>

883
00:38:04.111 --> 00:38:04.944
<v Speaker 2>focus on the one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about human beings I think is </v>

884
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:08.303
<v Speaker 2>that we really do need other people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>input and interaction and the idea that </v>

885
00:38:12.241 --> 00:38:13.074
<v Speaker 2>you're going to work in a vacuum and </v>
<v Speaker 2>create this great masterpiece without </v>

886
00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:18.180
<v Speaker 2>any interaction with other human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>as doesn't really.</v>

887
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.073
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't because life is active and </v>

888
00:38:21.421 --> 00:38:26.100
<v Speaker 2>messy and ambiguous and ambivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And W I think the trouble is we get hung</v>

889
00:38:26.101 --> 00:38:29.640
<v Speaker 2>up on nouns like happiness or meaning or</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the self,</v>

890
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:30.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think,</v>

891
00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:32.370
<v Speaker 2>I think actually these things are verbs </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

892
00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:34.830
<v Speaker 2>Webby we sell as a verb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

893
00:38:34.831 --> 00:38:35.664
<v Speaker 2>maybe something that happens dynamically</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the relationships that were maybe </v>

894
00:38:38.191 --> 00:38:39.024
<v Speaker 2>ourself is something that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>extends out into the world and is kind </v>

895
00:38:42.191 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 2>of fluid in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And happiness maybe is.</v>

896
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's an activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning is maybe an activity,</v>

897
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:49.750
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w we reduce these things to nouns.</v>

898
00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Like they're really neat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easy,</v>

899
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:54.700
<v Speaker 2>isolated things and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really not.</v>

900
00:38:54.701 --> 00:38:58.090
<v Speaker 2>So I can in a lot of the TV shows that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

901
00:38:58.091 --> 00:38:58.924
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting people through like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformative process and they're </v>

902
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.140
<v Speaker 2>reacting to kind of really extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>

903
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.920
<v Speaker 2>And I always had people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

904
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:09.893
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do that love already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but think it's all fate because I would </v>

905
00:39:11.531 --> 00:39:12.364
<v Speaker 2>never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're viewing themselves as this </v>

906
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.063
<v Speaker 2>isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just this sort of individual </v>

907
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.093
<v Speaker 2>kind of separated from everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watching that and thinking how they </v>

908
00:39:20.321 --> 00:39:22.000
<v Speaker 2>behave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're not doing is thinking.</v>

909
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:27.190
<v Speaker 2>And if I were in that situation with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same pressures and then that's,</v>

910
00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.790
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing that that does changes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were not there for two,</v>

911
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.310
<v Speaker 2>300 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've had this idea that we are,</v>

912
00:39:33.311 --> 00:39:38.311
<v Speaker 2>these kind of all goes back to like not </v>
<v Speaker 2>being influenced by kings and priests.</v>

913
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Like it was John Locke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>

914
00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.240
<v Speaker 2>the beginnings of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that idea that,</v>

915
00:39:46.241 --> 00:39:46.500
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

916
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:46.961
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

917
00:39:46.961 --> 00:39:47.741
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should not,</v>

918
00:39:47.741 --> 00:39:48.574
<v Speaker 2>we should have this kind of personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority and it's drifted into a </v>

919
00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:52.953
<v Speaker 2>through can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's drifted into a really </v>

920
00:39:54.131 --> 00:39:57.490
<v Speaker 2>unrealistic and unfair sense of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolated beyond we're not.</v>

921
00:39:57.491 --> 00:40:00.370
<v Speaker 2>We're clearly social creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

922
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.050
<v Speaker 2>there's a show on Netflix called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>push,</v>

923
00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I did,</v>

924
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:08.401
<v Speaker 2>which was to see whether,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you create this environment of social</v>

925
00:40:08.591 --> 00:40:10.120
<v Speaker 2>compliance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a big party,</v>

926
00:40:10.121 --> 00:40:11.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one guy and it doesn't know that</v>

927
00:40:11.741 --> 00:40:13.900
<v Speaker 2>this is being filmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is part of a TV show.</v>

928
00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else is an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the plot was to see,</v>

929
00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:18.003
<v Speaker 2>could you get him to murder somebody to </v>
<v Speaker 2>push someone off the roof to the death </v>

930
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.560
<v Speaker 2>as far as he's concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it doesn't.</v>

931
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.630
<v Speaker 2>No one really dies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

932
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.970
<v Speaker 2>And it just starts where he kind of gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>roped into helping out at this event.</v>

933
00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.340
<v Speaker 2>And it's a big high stakes event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's in,</v>

934
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

935
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Tuxedos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't get the memo for the dress</v>

936
00:40:34.121 --> 00:40:34.954
<v Speaker 2>codes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We already comes in feeling a bit and </v>

937
00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:37.443
<v Speaker 2>then he gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets roped into helping out and like </v>

938
00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.340
<v Speaker 2>the first thing is asked to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>label,</v>

939
00:40:42.341 --> 00:40:43.174
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat filled sausage roll snacks as </v>

940
00:40:46.511 --> 00:40:47.440
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

941
00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:48.274
<v Speaker 2>Because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vegetarian ones haven't been </v>

942
00:40:48.911 --> 00:40:49.744
<v Speaker 2>delivered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just like a little kind of foot </v>

943
00:40:51.041 --> 00:40:53.740
<v Speaker 2>in the door thing and it just builds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it builds.</v>

944
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:54.993
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

945
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:56.403
<v Speaker 2>it gets to this point when he's on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>roof having been through this really </v>

946
00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:01.443
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary and sort of hilarious and </v>

947
00:41:03.161 --> 00:41:04.810
<v Speaker 2>massively anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>juicing journeys,</v>

948
00:41:04.811 --> 00:41:05.644
<v Speaker 2>a lot of emotions you go through and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch it and then faced with this </v>

949
00:41:08.561 --> 00:41:10.540
<v Speaker 2>massive pressure to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill this guy.</v>

950
00:41:10.541 --> 00:41:11.374
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to spoil the ending because </v>

951
00:41:12.401 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 2>it's a stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

952
00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.693
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

953
00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.840
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

954
00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:17.674
<v Speaker 2>how your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how your sense of like the story you </v>

955
00:41:21.791 --> 00:41:23.350
<v Speaker 2>tell yourself about who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

956
00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:24.184
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>

957
00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.760
<v Speaker 2>isn't real casual about the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>shipping,</v>

958
00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:29.170
<v Speaker 2>about net are the sacrifice because </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything you want.</v>

959
00:41:29.171 --> 00:41:30.820
<v Speaker 2>But can I ask you one question about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

960
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 2>What I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you feel</v>

961
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.843
<v Speaker 1>a certain sense of moral confusion when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to talk someone into </v>

962
00:41:43.341 --> 00:41:45.980
<v Speaker 1>potentially and you realize that if this</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a show,</v>

963
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.353
<v Speaker 1>if similar or maybe even more powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressures were in play and this guy was </v>

964
00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:53.294
<v Speaker 1>suggestible and he found himself in very</v>
<v Speaker 1>unusual circumstances where it seemed </v>

965
00:41:56.451 --> 00:41:59.380
<v Speaker 1>like a good idea to kill this person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>

966
00:41:59.381 --> 00:42:02.350
<v Speaker 1>you're introducing this thought and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

967
00:42:02.351 --> 00:42:07.351
<v Speaker 1>this scenario into a person's mind that </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps could go cradle to the grave and</v>

968
00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.320
<v Speaker 1>never have that.</v>

969
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:10.930
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of the opposite,</v>

970
00:42:10.931 --> 00:42:11.764
<v Speaker 2>what it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just hard to about giving away the </v>

971
00:42:14.531 --> 00:42:15.364
<v Speaker 2>ending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

972
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:20.260
<v Speaker 2>what it does is actually mentally </v>
<v Speaker 2>rehearse somebody.</v>

973
00:42:20.261 --> 00:42:21.094
<v Speaker 2>What this guy took away from it is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge that if he was ever in a </v>

974
00:42:25.331 --> 00:42:26.164
<v Speaker 2>situation again where there was anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that nature of compliance that he </v>

975
00:42:29.471 --> 00:42:30.304
<v Speaker 2>now has the tools to just like stand up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it because you need that kind of </v>

976
00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.493
<v Speaker 2>promotional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And likewise for viewers hopefully </v>

977
00:42:36.281 --> 00:42:37.930
<v Speaker 2>watching it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of the idea.</v>

978
00:42:37.931 --> 00:42:39.970
<v Speaker 2>You're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all emotionally rehearsing it with</v>

979
00:42:39.971 --> 00:42:40.804
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

980
00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:44.140
<v Speaker 2>and unless you've been trained in staff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know it like that,</v>

981
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:48.490
<v Speaker 2>you need like an emotional experience of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to know when that thing happens,</v>

982
00:42:48.491 --> 00:42:50.890
<v Speaker 2>to just have the resources to understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can be manipulated.</v>

983
00:42:50.891 --> 00:42:52.130
<v Speaker 2>These are very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although it does,</v>

984
00:42:52.131 --> 00:42:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I realize it doesn't sound like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that showed the purchase.</v>

985
00:42:54.311 --> 00:42:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like the darkest of all the</v>

986
00:42:55.811 --> 00:42:56.644
<v Speaker 2>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are,</v>

987
00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.760
<v Speaker 2>they are there for like a good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like a,</v>

988
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:03.250
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason for doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody that comes away,</v>

989
00:43:03.251 --> 00:43:04.180
<v Speaker 2>it was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

990
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:05.050
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

991
00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:07.600
<v Speaker 2>that was a great thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Best thing I've ever done.</v>

992
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:10.900
<v Speaker 2>You know these even though the journeys </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves but do look very dark.</v>

993
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Well he sounds like the guy who had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive outlook on it sounds like</v>

994
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:18.960
<v Speaker 2>it can learn from their mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

995
00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:23.910
<v Speaker 2>But there's some people that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>confronted with some new situation like,</v>

996
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:24.773
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really was going to push that guy off </v>

997
00:43:26.371 --> 00:43:28.230
<v Speaker 2>the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is me.</v>

998
00:43:28.231 --> 00:43:29.064
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't think that was me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I know now I know that I'm capable </v>

999
00:43:32.251 --> 00:43:33.084
<v Speaker 2>of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I get manipulated to the point like </v>

1000
00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:35.663
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they have a lot of like real </v>

1001
00:43:37.981 --> 00:43:39.290
<v Speaker 2>confusion and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1002
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:40.124
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps a lack of faith in </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and their ability to make a </v>

1003
00:43:42.641 --> 00:43:43.620
<v Speaker 2>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Kinda,</v>

1004
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:47.340
<v Speaker 2>that's Kinda my job to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the framing and that,</v>

1005
00:43:47.341 --> 00:43:48.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of,</v>

1006
00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:48.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1007
00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:51.160
<v Speaker 2>I get these ethical questions that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth asking.</v>

1008
00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.113
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately my concern with these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done a lot of these shows where </v>

1009
00:43:55.501 --> 00:43:59.490
<v Speaker 2>people are put through these dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>journeys to reach a valuable point,</v>

1010
00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.710
<v Speaker 2>much more valuable than perhaps the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the porch,</v>

1011
00:44:01.711 --> 00:44:03.780
<v Speaker 2>which is quite dog.</v>

1012
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:04.830
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1013
00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:05.663
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my only real concern is their </v>

1014
00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:08.753
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the guy that has just done this new </v>

1015
00:44:10.921 --> 00:44:11.611
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1016
00:44:11.611 --> 00:44:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I said to him before I came out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>started talking about the show,</v>

1017
00:44:13.621 --> 00:44:14.454
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want me to say about your </v>

1018
00:44:15.301 --> 00:44:16.140
<v Speaker 2>experience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you said,</v>

1019
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:18.570
<v Speaker 2>aside from having my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the best thing I've ever done.</v>

1020
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:21.150
<v Speaker 2>But I know other people watching the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show will say,</v>

1021
00:44:21.151 --> 00:44:23.880
<v Speaker 2>how can you now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you justify that you're manipulating</v>

1022
00:44:23.881 --> 00:44:26.580
<v Speaker 2>somebody and why did you just want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill you at the end of it?</v>

1023
00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:27.643
<v Speaker 2>And that the reality is it's just this </v>
<v Speaker 2>one guy's experience I care about and </v>

1024
00:44:31.801 --> 00:44:32.634
<v Speaker 2>that's something that I can manage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>create and make sure that he's left in </v>

1025
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:36.774
<v Speaker 2>the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also these are people I just like </v>

1026
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.600
<v Speaker 2>we'll remain friends with for the rest </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my life.</v>

1027
00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:41.400
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done the TV show.</v>

1028
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goodbye.</v>

1029
00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:44.190
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a genuine,</v>

1030
00:44:44.191 --> 00:44:45.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimate bond.</v>

1031
00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:46.711
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all,</v>

1032
00:44:46.711 --> 00:44:47.544
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all end up falling in love with me </v>

1033
00:44:49.051 --> 00:44:52.050
<v Speaker 2>and the production team falling in love </v>
<v Speaker 2>with these people because you're putting</v>

1034
00:44:52.051 --> 00:44:53.940
<v Speaker 2>them through this like 10 month </v>
<v Speaker 2>projects.</v>

1035
00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Half was a little different with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice because he,</v>

1036
00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:58.243
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thought he was taking part in one </v>

1037
00:44:59.251 --> 00:45:00.084
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a documentary when actually </v>

1038
00:45:00.901 --> 00:45:02.130
<v Speaker 2>there was this whole other thing going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

1039
00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.330
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of the time they have no idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>how long was pushed for it.</v>

1040
00:45:05.331 --> 00:45:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Like push was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that was only like,</v>

1041
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:07.973
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like one evening of actual </v>

1042
00:45:10.411 --> 00:45:11.660
<v Speaker 2>filming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

1043
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.740
<v Speaker 2>because it was just one light real time </v>
<v Speaker 2>event,</v>

1044
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:16.100
<v Speaker 2>but the preparation for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1045
00:45:16.101 --> 00:45:16.950
<v Speaker 2>it goes back a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>

1046
00:45:16.951 --> 00:45:17.784
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest one was I did a show called </v>

1047
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.750
<v Speaker 2>apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't on Netflix.</v>

1048
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:22.583
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you go down the rabbit hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be somewhere on youtube where we </v>

1049
00:45:25.531 --> 00:45:27.090
<v Speaker 2>ended the world for somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

1050
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.870
<v Speaker 2>we took control of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a news feed,</v>

1051
00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:35.640
<v Speaker 2>a TV we filmed like special editions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tv shows,</v>

1052
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.300
<v Speaker 2>new shows that watched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fed them into a drip by drip,</v>

1053
00:45:39.301 --> 00:45:40.134
<v Speaker 2>created the idea of the world was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to wait and there's going to be this </v>

1054
00:45:41.311 --> 00:45:42.144
<v Speaker 2>meteor strike even I could be out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cafe and the radio in the cafe because </v>

1055
00:45:44.551 --> 00:45:47.580
<v Speaker 2>we'd know we'd be in that cafe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a radio playing with Djs that he</v>

1056
00:45:47.581 --> 00:45:50.490
<v Speaker 2>knows that we're talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that is supposed to happen.</v>

1057
00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:51.913
<v Speaker 2>And then we stage it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We staged this pyrotechnic end of the </v>

1058
00:45:54.601 --> 00:45:55.434
<v Speaker 2>world thing and this kind of a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled enough environment we could </v>

1059
00:45:59.041 --> 00:46:01.170
<v Speaker 2>get them into where we could stay to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that convincingly.</v>

1060
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:02.243
<v Speaker 2>And then he wakes up in the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>episode to episode thing in this post </v>

1061
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.680
<v Speaker 2>apocalyptic seemingly like weeks later </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a hospital,</v>

1062
00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:12.210
<v Speaker 2>like everyone's gone.</v>

1063
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:13.940
<v Speaker 2>The places abandoned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1064
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some infection spreads.</v>

1065
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:17.813
<v Speaker 2>So there is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the plot and he then lives </v>

1066
00:46:19.261 --> 00:46:20.094
<v Speaker 2>through the plot of the wizard of Oz to </v>
<v Speaker 2>find his way back home and the point of </v>

1067
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:23.184
<v Speaker 2>it was this stoic idea of valuing what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have because this was somebody who </v>

1068
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.000
<v Speaker 2>by all reports was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1069
00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>selfish,</v>

1070
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.970
<v Speaker 2>took advantage of his parents who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>living with never had a proper job.</v>

1071
00:46:32.971 --> 00:46:35.520
<v Speaker 2>It was just kinda like needed to value </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he had said.</v>

1072
00:46:35.521 --> 00:46:36.610
<v Speaker 2>The stoics would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1073
00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:37.523
<v Speaker 2>just rehearsed taking everything away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you returned to the stuff you </v>

1074
00:46:40.331 --> 00:46:41.164
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you valued that rather than just always </v>

1075
00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:44.220
<v Speaker 2>desiring more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was that idea,</v>

1076
00:46:44.221 --> 00:46:46.920
<v Speaker 2>kind of writ large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take everything away and the world.</v>

1077
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:47.783
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he was transformed by it really </v>

1078
00:46:49.711 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 2>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're still in touch with this person.</v>

1079
00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:51.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1080
00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so is this,</v>

1081
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:56.550
<v Speaker 2>this is a permanent shift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>permanent shifts.</v>

1082
00:46:56.551 --> 00:46:59.760
<v Speaker 2>He ended up being a teacher in a special</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs school that has kind of worked his</v>

1083
00:46:59.761 --> 00:47:01.110
<v Speaker 2>way up through and is now like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1084
00:47:01.111 --> 00:47:02.530
<v Speaker 2>he's getting married and it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1085
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:04.680
<v Speaker 2>it's lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1086
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:06.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that I can take credit for all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

1087
00:47:06.481 --> 00:47:08.280
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was definitely a big part of that.</v>

1088
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:09.143
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>near death experiences are often </v>

1089
00:47:10.171 --> 00:47:14.670
<v Speaker 2>incredibly beneficial to people make big</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant shifts in their attitude and their</v>

1090
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:15.833
<v Speaker 2>perception of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realize that time is finite and </v>

1091
00:47:18.541 --> 00:47:19.374
<v Speaker 2>then it could have been taken away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and they feel like they have a new </v>

1092
00:47:20.851 --> 00:47:22.260
<v Speaker 2>lease on life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1093
00:47:22.261 --> 00:47:24.900
<v Speaker 2>you really can become a totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>different person after something like,</v>

1094
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:26.263
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's happened with this guy </v>

1095
00:47:27.301 --> 00:47:28.200
<v Speaker 2>fills in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1096
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:31.210
<v Speaker 2>in this new show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also the first,</v>

1097
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.520
<v Speaker 2>like brand new thing I've done for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Netflix.</v>

1098
00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.020
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of other shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what is it called?</v>

1099
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.960
<v Speaker 2>It's called sacrifice sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the plot is,</v>

1100
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.810
<v Speaker 2>I take this Guy Phil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is,</v>

1101
00:47:40.811 --> 00:47:42.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an American guy,</v>

1102
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:44.980
<v Speaker 2>his father's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father's British British links,</v>

1103
00:47:44.981 --> 00:47:47.590
<v Speaker 2>but he's an American guy living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida,</v>

1104
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Cocoa Beach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida,</v>

1105
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.760
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a right wing guy,</v>

1106
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:52.893
<v Speaker 2>strong views against immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I using these covert psychological </v>

1107
00:47:58.451 --> 00:47:59.284
<v Speaker 2>techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try and get him to the point where he </v>

1108
00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:02.824
<v Speaker 2>will willingly lay down his life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>take a bullet for an illegal Mexican </v>

1109
00:48:06.731 --> 00:48:09.950
<v Speaker 2>immigrant already somebody believes is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1110
00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.470
<v Speaker 2>it's an actor because it's the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1111
00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:13.330
<v Speaker 2>whole thing with actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1112
00:48:13.331 --> 00:48:17.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he went through this journey,</v>

1113
00:48:17.831 --> 00:48:20.350
<v Speaker 2>which is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a political story at all.</v>

1114
00:48:20.351 --> 00:48:22.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it kind of resonates,</v>

1115
00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:24.820
<v Speaker 2>but it was ultimately a story about </v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion and,</v>

1116
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.250
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and humanity.</v>

1117
00:48:27.251 --> 00:48:30.130
<v Speaker 2>And there's ultimately a very human </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment that either he found himself in.</v>

1118
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1119
00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:35.740
<v Speaker 2>the guys like made a huge difference to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1120
00:48:35.741 --> 00:48:36.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1121
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:37.610
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

1122
00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.150
<v Speaker 2>I got done a giveaway exactly how it </v>
<v Speaker 2>turns out.</v>

1123
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.760
<v Speaker 2>The process take it was about 10 months </v>
<v Speaker 2>there for him.</v>

1124
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:45.130
<v Speaker 2>For him it was like maybe three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four months.</v>

1125
00:48:45.131 --> 00:48:46.750
<v Speaker 2>It was like the beginning block of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1126
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:51.540
<v Speaker 2>But there's like two levels to make any </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows you've got to write the I,</v>

1127
00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:52.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is the plot of the show and </v>

1128
00:48:53.351 --> 00:48:55.030
<v Speaker 2>finding that and make that happen for </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1129
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.550
<v Speaker 2>But you've also got to create this whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing has,</v>

1130
00:48:57.551 --> 00:48:58.384
<v Speaker 2>it's like the Truman show it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're creating a fiction for somebody </v>

1131
00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:04.030
<v Speaker 2>that has to be completely convincing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole other level of,</v>

1132
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.370
<v Speaker 2>of kind of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus,</v>

1133
00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:07.204
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotTa make sure this guy is robust </v>

1134
00:49:07.931 --> 00:49:09.100
<v Speaker 2>enough to go through something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1135
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:12.160
<v Speaker 2>So there's a whole vetting procedure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has to happen without him realizing</v>

1136
00:49:12.161 --> 00:49:14.170
<v Speaker 2>what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great way of putting it.</v>

1137
00:49:14.171 --> 00:49:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Robust bus psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1138
00:49:16.661 --> 00:49:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:20.920
<v Speaker 2>That is a crazy amount of preparation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and production work.</v>

1140
00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:21.601
<v Speaker 2>Is He?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1141
00:49:21.601 --> 00:49:22.141
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1142
00:49:22.141 --> 00:49:22.974
<v Speaker 2>it's huge in the apocalypse show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like one moment when we had to </v>

1143
00:49:25.271 --> 00:49:26.104
<v Speaker 2>just make this guys because there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that there's electrical </v>

1144
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:31.060
<v Speaker 2>interference with the meteors just had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make his TV pop off in his room,</v>

1145
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:33.760
<v Speaker 2>like just sort of cut out and to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1146
00:49:33.761 --> 00:49:35.770
<v Speaker 2>there were two guys out in his garden </v>
<v Speaker 2>shed.</v>

1147
00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:37.173
<v Speaker 2>I'm waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had to be there all day because I </v>

1148
00:49:39.011 --> 00:49:39.844
<v Speaker 2>couldn't come in and out of the garden </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you might see them pulling a </v>

1149
00:49:41.981 --> 00:49:42.814
<v Speaker 2>cable at this moment to make the TV go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they couldn't leave because he </v>

1150
00:49:45.551 --> 00:49:46.384
<v Speaker 2>might see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they had to spend the night in this </v>

1151
00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:51.160
<v Speaker 2>garden shed and this is like after three</v>
<v Speaker 2>months of not having a day off as well.</v>

1152
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:54.190
<v Speaker 2>So that's like a nothing moment than </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal ever remember from the show.</v>

1153
00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:57.820
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge amount of huge amount of work.</v>

1154
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:58.900
<v Speaker 2>I always get people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1155
00:49:58.901 --> 00:50:00.190
<v Speaker 2>it's all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't really done it.</v>

1156
00:50:00.191 --> 00:50:01.024
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just that they won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe you should actually go to all </v>

1157
00:50:02.831 --> 00:50:05.700
<v Speaker 2>that trouble for the paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

1158
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:06.563
<v Speaker 2>if you did that to a naturally paranoid </v>
<v Speaker 2>person or person with a touch of </v>

1159
00:50:10.061 --> 00:50:13.510
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why they have to be vetted very</v>

1160
00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:14.344
<v Speaker 2>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very carefully at any point during the </v>

1161
00:50:15.911 --> 00:50:17.680
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course we can like stop it,</v>

1162
00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:18.400
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1163
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I can put that would suck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it?</v>

1164
00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:20.883
<v Speaker 2>That would 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they see a guy starting to question </v>

1165
00:50:24.491 --> 00:50:27.070
<v Speaker 2>reality and look at clouds in an odd </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1166
00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>

1167
00:50:28.881 --> 00:50:30.380
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's slipping away.</v>

1168
00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1169
00:50:32.001 --> 00:50:32.720
<v Speaker 2>that's never happened.</v>

1170
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.460
<v Speaker 2>It's always been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always been hugely.</v>

1171
00:50:34.461 --> 00:50:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is an amazing process though.</v>

1172
00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:38.443
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how much prep work is </v>

1173
00:50:40.671 --> 00:50:41.504
<v Speaker 2>involved in something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just set up the radio where they walk </v>

1174
00:50:44.961 --> 00:50:47.900
<v Speaker 2>into a place to different news </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast.</v>

1175
00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

1176
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:49.363
<v Speaker 2>that's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Tab most terrifying was the for him </v>

1177
00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:52.183
<v Speaker 2>was the kind of end of the world moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we had this fake fake radio </v>

1178
00:50:55.641 --> 00:50:56.474
<v Speaker 2>broadcast from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the BBC and it was just so </v>

1179
00:50:57.951 --> 00:51:00.250
<v Speaker 2>convincing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just magic blood go cold.</v>

1180
00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.300
<v Speaker 2>More of worlds type stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in this,</v>

1181
00:51:02.301 --> 00:51:04.940
<v Speaker 2>like in this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sacrifice,</v>

1182
00:51:04.941 --> 00:51:08.150
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a amazing pivotal moment in it when</v>

1183
00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:08.984
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1184
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:10.183
<v Speaker 2>we do this staring tests which was </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed by New York psychology </v>

1185
00:51:13.641 --> 00:51:15.250
<v Speaker 2>professor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is you just,</v>

1186
00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.213
<v Speaker 2>you might have come across it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just stare silently into someone's </v>

1187
00:51:18.141 --> 00:51:18.974
<v Speaker 2>eyes for four minutes and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the most amazing thing because </v>

1188
00:51:23.421 --> 00:51:24.254
<v Speaker 2>obviously the first thing is you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>listed of awkwardness and this kind of </v>

1189
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.983
<v Speaker 2>giggling and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that tends to stop and then </v>

1190
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:31.724
<v Speaker 2>you're just facing a human being and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you've sort of somehow broken </v>

1191
00:51:36.741 --> 00:51:38.120
<v Speaker 2>through all the kind of crap.</v>

1192
00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:39.493
<v Speaker 2>And then you just see like a person </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like living and struggling like </v>

1193
00:51:43.761 --> 00:51:46.700
<v Speaker 2>you are and someone with a private life </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like,</v>

1194
00:51:46.701 --> 00:51:47.800
<v Speaker 2>that's a big thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1195
00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:48.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1196
00:51:48.131 --> 00:51:51.720
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we go through life seeing people general</v>

1197
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:53.030
<v Speaker 2>generally at their best light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1198
00:51:53.031 --> 00:51:55.460
<v Speaker 2>generally people will present their best</v>
<v Speaker 2>version of themselves to you.</v>

1199
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:56.413
<v Speaker 2>If you have a couple over for dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll tend to see that couple at their </v>

1200
00:51:58.491 --> 00:51:59.324
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had this skewed idea of how </v>

1201
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.350
<v Speaker 2>together other people or how impressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people are,</v>

1202
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.410
<v Speaker 2>how great other couples are compared to </v>
<v Speaker 2>how you are with your partner.</v>

1203
00:52:06.411 --> 00:52:07.244
<v Speaker 2>And we missed that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we know for us we have this big </v>

1204
00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:13.400
<v Speaker 2>clumsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassing,</v>

1205
00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:14.443
<v Speaker 2>lumbering giant of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a private life that's just following </v>

1206
00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:19.200
<v Speaker 2>us around and it's particularly now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1207
00:52:19.201 --> 00:52:21.990
<v Speaker 2>with instagram and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are branding themselves.</v>

1208
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.980
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like,</v>

1209
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.833
<v Speaker 2>it's so unfair in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between how you perceive </v>

1210
00:52:28.041 --> 00:52:29.540
<v Speaker 2>yourself and how you perceive everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

1211
00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so again,</v>

1212
00:52:31.611 --> 00:52:34.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the store is that we'd kind of a</v>

1213
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:36.260
<v Speaker 2>living out so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1214
00:52:36.261 --> 00:52:40.280
<v Speaker 2>it takes like four minutes of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre staring thing to kind of reach a</v>

1215
00:52:40.281 --> 00:52:41.114
<v Speaker 2>moment of just suddenly I think hitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>a point of just seeing another human </v>

1216
00:52:44.301 --> 00:52:45.650
<v Speaker 2>being and everything that comes with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1217
00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:47.780
<v Speaker 2>And it was a big moment for this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>phil going through it.</v>

1218
00:52:47.781 --> 00:52:48.614
<v Speaker 2>It was a really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tried a couple of things then that </v>

1219
00:52:49.791 --> 00:52:51.710
<v Speaker 2>you see in the shoulder don't work out </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite well.</v>

1220
00:52:51.711 --> 00:52:52.544
<v Speaker 2>And then um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then this a really emotional moment </v>

1221
00:52:56.601 --> 00:52:59.870
<v Speaker 2>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just has this big change.</v>

1222
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's think also just being able to do a </v>

1223
00:53:03.711 --> 00:53:04.544
<v Speaker 2>TV show that really like changes </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody quite aside from how popular </v>

1224
00:53:08.931 --> 00:53:11.270
<v Speaker 2>the show is or how well it works as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>show or who watches it,</v>

1225
00:53:11.271 --> 00:53:11.600
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1226
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.810
<v Speaker 2>Just to actually feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1227
00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:16.033
<v Speaker 2>at some point in my life I've done it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive thing just for one person with </v>

1228
00:53:20.181 --> 00:53:21.260
<v Speaker 2>TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>

1229
00:53:21.261 --> 00:53:23.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally kind of a pretty.</v>

1230
00:53:23.301 --> 00:53:24.134
<v Speaker 2>I'm more authentic kind of medium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to be able to just do something </v>

1231
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.720
<v Speaker 2>meaningful as you know is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is good.</v>

1232
00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to,</v>

1233
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.320
<v Speaker 2>it sounds amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't just sound good.</v>

1234
00:53:34.321 --> 00:53:35.154
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like quite a work of art that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've managed to figure out a way to </v>

1235
00:53:39.151 --> 00:53:39.984
<v Speaker 2>coordinate all these moving parts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trick someone into accepting a bunch of </v>

1236
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:50.280
<v Speaker 2>different versions of reality that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're presenting to get these results.</v>

1237
00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.130
<v Speaker 2>It said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1238
00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:52.580
<v Speaker 2>I've got a big production crew that </v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

1239
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:53.371
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not all of me.</v>

1240
00:53:53.371 --> 00:53:55.190
<v Speaker 2>I've got to write the thing and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>

1241
00:53:55.191 --> 00:53:56.520
<v Speaker 2>And so on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

1242
00:53:56.521 --> 00:53:58.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the we kind of worked on over the years.</v>

1243
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:59.783
<v Speaker 2>We had small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like little things that involved a </v>

1244
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.390
<v Speaker 2>involve those kinds of plots that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the first show I did,</v>

1245
00:54:06.391 --> 00:54:11.391
<v Speaker 2>like that was taking a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not as we fill in sacrifice and she's</v>

1246
00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.620
<v Speaker 2>bringing out someone's here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1247
00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:17.513
<v Speaker 2>That's really what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of the story you're seeing </v>

1248
00:54:19.321 --> 00:54:22.180
<v Speaker 2>somebody go through a big change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bringing out the hero and the um,</v>

1249
00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.290
<v Speaker 2>the first show he did like that involve </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy who at the end of this,</v>

1250
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:29.100
<v Speaker 2>his own journey had been through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finds himself on an airplane,</v>

1251
00:54:29.101 --> 00:54:31.360
<v Speaker 2>is terrified of flying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

1252
00:54:31.361 --> 00:54:32.194
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we created this situation where you had </v>

1253
00:54:32.941 --> 00:54:34.740
<v Speaker 2>to be on a flight and you didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything to do with us.</v>

1254
00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:35.603
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's an actor in the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got hidden cameras throughout the </v>

1255
00:54:38.941 --> 00:54:39.810
<v Speaker 2>plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's this,</v>

1256
00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:43.890
<v Speaker 2>there is a medical emergency and will </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody land the plane?</v>

1257
00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:47.400
<v Speaker 2>Someone needs to step up and do it.</v>

1258
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called here at 30,000</v>

1259
00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:52.164
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1260
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.823
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to talk through the edit because </v>

1261
00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:56.490
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a spoiler,</v>

1262
00:54:56.491 --> 00:54:57.324
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1263
00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:58.500
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does it right.</v>

1264
00:54:58.501 --> 00:55:00.540
<v Speaker 2>He rises up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has this moment.</v>

1265
00:55:00.541 --> 00:55:04.020
<v Speaker 2>He goes to the cockpit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he is highly suggestible.</v>

1266
00:55:04.021 --> 00:55:04.854
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've used him because he is suggestible </v>

1267
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:06.893
<v Speaker 2>so I know that I can put them to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a vertical was by clicking my </v>

1268
00:55:08.881 --> 00:55:09.331
<v Speaker 2>fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1269
00:55:09.331 --> 00:55:10.164
<v Speaker 2>He's conditioned to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I step out before he ended the </v>

1270
00:55:12.241 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 2>cockpit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click my fingers,</v>

1271
00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:15.024
<v Speaker 2>he sort of zonked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got very conditioned to this </v>

1272
00:55:16.531 --> 00:55:18.390
<v Speaker 2>throughout the process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick him in a wheelchair,</v>

1273
00:55:18.391 --> 00:55:22.290
<v Speaker 2>we land the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wakes up in a,</v>

1274
00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:26.470
<v Speaker 2>about to walk into one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>convincing simulators that they use for,</v>

1275
00:55:26.471 --> 00:55:27.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for pilot training,</v>

1276
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:30.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's kind of a night flight.</v>

1277
00:55:30.451 --> 00:55:31.284
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found out that was the most </v>

1278
00:55:31.711 --> 00:55:33.360
<v Speaker 2>convincing thing was to have it when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dark.</v>

1279
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.840
<v Speaker 2>So he now goes in believing is in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cockpit of a real plane,</v>

1280
00:55:36.841 --> 00:55:37.770
<v Speaker 2>30 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,000</v>

1281
00:55:37.771 --> 00:55:38.604
<v Speaker 2>feet up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got the guy on ground control who </v>

1282
00:55:40.591 --> 00:55:40.910
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1283
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:41.743
<v Speaker 2>Internet obviously is everybody is </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking him down getting into that on </v>

1284
00:55:44.591 --> 00:55:48.030
<v Speaker 2>the plane and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just amazing.</v>

1285
00:55:48.031 --> 00:55:50.700
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy as in his mind,</v>

1286
00:55:50.701 --> 00:55:51.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is landing,</v>

1287
00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:52.573
<v Speaker 2>was playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saving the lives of 300 people and that </v>

1288
00:55:54.331 --> 00:55:59.190
<v Speaker 2>he steps out and then the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>revealed to him and it's so emotional.</v>

1289
00:55:59.191 --> 00:56:00.390
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1290
00:56:00.391 --> 00:56:01.224
<v Speaker 2>the gaming means that Michael Douglas </v>
<v Speaker 2>Philomena has always been a point of </v>

1291
00:56:04.591 --> 00:56:05.770
<v Speaker 2>reference for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he comes out,</v>

1292
00:56:05.771 --> 00:56:08.670
<v Speaker 2>there's like a big party of everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been on his journey,</v>

1293
00:56:08.671 --> 00:56:10.290
<v Speaker 2>all these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these actors that have been,</v>

1294
00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking it in this direction.</v>

1295
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:13.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was amazing.</v>

1296
00:56:13.861 --> 00:56:14.520
<v Speaker 2>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1297
00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.353
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the years kind of work with these </v>

1298
00:56:16.891 --> 00:56:17.724
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1299
00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:18.923
<v Speaker 2>these plots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kind of immersive Truman show </v>

1300
00:56:21.541 --> 00:56:25.660
<v Speaker 2>style a plots while at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing stage shows.</v>

1301
00:56:25.661 --> 00:56:27.370
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do a live show every year as well,</v>

1302
00:56:27.371 --> 00:56:28.204
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of a bit more like an old </v>
<v Speaker 2>fashioned sort of magic mind reading </v>

1303
00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:33.220
<v Speaker 2>kind of kind of show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1304
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:35.710
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah they are,</v>

1305
00:56:35.711 --> 00:56:36.431
<v Speaker 2>they are these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1306
00:56:36.431 --> 00:56:37.264
<v Speaker 2>these extraordinary journeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I just do like maybe one a year </v>

1307
00:56:38.681 --> 00:56:39.340
<v Speaker 2>because they take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1308
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:39.810
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1309
00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:42.180
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like not only does it take </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much time,</v>

1310
00:56:42.181 --> 00:56:43.014
<v Speaker 1>but it also really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you rely so heavily on the </v>

1311
00:56:44.341 --> 00:56:46.920
<v Speaker 1>improvisational abilities of all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

1312
00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Their ability to adjust an act normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to be convincing.</v>

1313
00:56:51.541 --> 00:56:52.374
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to follow the plot and not deviate </v>

1314
00:56:54.091 --> 00:56:55.430
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the LAS,</v>

1315
00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.980
<v Speaker 2>because we used for sacrifice worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so good.</v>

1316
00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:58.853
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like in your blood or </v>

1317
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:01.520
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1318
00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:02.363
<v Speaker 2>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like big at the end that </v>

1319
00:57:04.771 --> 00:57:07.550
<v Speaker 2>like big sort of aggressive racist biker</v>
<v Speaker 2>characters that we use.</v>

1320
00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1321
00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:11.623
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just a hilarious thing of like they </v>

1322
00:57:13.111 --> 00:57:13.944
<v Speaker 2>are because they were bikers as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they are big like Harry intimidating </v>

1323
00:57:16.231 --> 00:57:17.064
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time they want to know </v>

1324
00:57:17.641 --> 00:57:19.860
<v Speaker 2>about the motivation and whether they </v>
<v Speaker 2>did a right listening.</v>

1325
00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Got Artists bombed audio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Odd combination.</v>

1326
00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:24.413
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1327
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:28.380
<v Speaker 1>What a fantastic idea for a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so uniquely original.</v>

1328
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:29.543
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just seems like there's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much work involved in something like </v>

1329
00:57:35.251 --> 00:57:37.440
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must obsess over that.</v>

1330
00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:41.280
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the process is I come up with an idea.</v>

1331
00:57:41.281 --> 00:57:44.250
<v Speaker 2>So like let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is normally we normally sit,</v>

1332
00:57:44.251 --> 00:57:46.050
<v Speaker 2>I sit with a couple of guys that are at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shows with.</v>

1333
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:47.263
<v Speaker 2>We normally drive themselves mad </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking of ideas and then one of us </v>

1334
00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:52.860
<v Speaker 2>normally me goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1335
00:57:52.861 --> 00:57:53.694
<v Speaker 2>can't we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just end the world and it zombies </v>

1336
00:57:55.201 --> 00:57:56.034
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's a safe someone we can get someone </v>

1337
00:57:58.591 --> 00:58:00.060
<v Speaker 2>to push up off a building or with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1338
00:58:00.061 --> 00:58:00.894
<v Speaker 2>because I'd done the push,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to kind of do the opposite of </v>

1339
00:58:03.031 --> 00:58:04.500
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that we saving a life and much</v>

1340
00:58:04.501 --> 00:58:06.080
<v Speaker 2>more redemptive story than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the.</v>

1341
00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:08.143
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is the first thing and I try</v>
<v Speaker 2>and combine a really strong dramatic </v>

1342
00:58:11.551 --> 00:58:14.610
<v Speaker 2>hook with a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a good reason for doing it.</v>

1343
00:58:14.611 --> 00:58:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you're just making like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial,</v>

1344
00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:19.320
<v Speaker 2>shocking thing for the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which languages?</v>

1345
00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:21.620
<v Speaker 2>No interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a,</v>

1346
00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:22.613
<v Speaker 2>well that's a beautiful perspective to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you actually want to benefit </v>

1347
00:58:25.741 --> 00:58:28.710
<v Speaker 2>someone through this crazy prank you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing on them.</v>

1348
00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:29.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1349
00:58:29.371 --> 00:58:30.001
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1350
00:58:30.001 --> 00:58:31.910
<v Speaker 2>It would just be a crazy horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

1351
00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.253
<v Speaker 2>there is like part of the enjoyment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the show I guess is a little bit of </v>

1352
00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:37.440
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a little bit,</v>

1353
00:58:37.441 --> 00:58:38.380
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's uh,</v>

1354
00:58:39.090 --> 00:58:39.923
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1355
00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:40.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1356
00:58:40.761 --> 00:58:41.594
<v Speaker 2>the shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they have a lot of heart and a </v>

1357
00:58:43.921 --> 00:58:44.754
<v Speaker 2>lot of them</v>

1358
00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:46.903
<v Speaker 1>thought you were intended to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to these people is what </v>

1359
00:58:50.331 --> 00:58:52.460
<v Speaker 1>transforms that you have empathy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>these folks.</v>

1360
00:58:52.461 --> 00:58:53.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

1361
00:58:53.191 --> 00:58:54.024
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you truly care that that alone makes </v>

1362
00:58:56.331 --> 00:58:59.240
<v Speaker 1>everything else better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes the whole,</v>

1363
00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:00.403
<v Speaker 1>if the whole thing is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm smarter than these dummies and I'm </v>

1364
00:59:02.211 --> 00:59:04.940
<v Speaker 1>just going to trick them and we've had </v>
<v Speaker 1>that show before many,</v>

1365
00:59:04.941 --> 00:59:05.774
<v Speaker 1>many times and make people feel terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's cringe inducing when you watch </v>

1366
00:59:09.501 --> 00:59:13.160
<v Speaker 1>it and you can't look away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you are doing this.</v>

1367
00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:14.653
<v Speaker 1>And the end result is actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits their perspective and actually </v>

1368
00:59:18.681 --> 00:59:21.260
<v Speaker 1>might change their life for the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's extraordinary.</v>

1369
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

1370
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:22.671
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

1371
00:59:22.671 --> 00:59:23.630
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the hope.</v>

1372
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.753
<v Speaker 2>The way that I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that I changed them is through </v>

1373
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:28.310
<v Speaker 2>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1374
00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a technique I've used a lot over</v>

1375
00:59:30.321 --> 00:59:31.154
<v Speaker 2>the years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you kind of take the emotional </v>

1376
00:59:33.561 --> 00:59:36.870
<v Speaker 2>state you want the person to have at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end a,</v>

1377
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:40.280
<v Speaker 2>break it down into components and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>attach each one of those to a,</v>

1378
00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:41.600
<v Speaker 2>to a trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy,</v>

1379
00:59:41.601 --> 00:59:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Phil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1380
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:44.800
<v Speaker 2>in sacrifice is using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1381
00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:50.090
<v Speaker 2>I can app which he thinks is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to this.</v>

1382
00:59:50.091 --> 00:59:50.924
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the microchip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't him because he thinks he </v>

1383
00:59:52.881 --> 00:59:53.714
<v Speaker 2>thinks we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really do like cut him open and </v>

1384
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:56.481
<v Speaker 2>seemingly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1385
00:59:56.481 --> 00:59:57.200
<v Speaker 2>we just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1386
00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.610
<v Speaker 2>it's a placebo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't really put it in.</v>

1387
00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:00.530
<v Speaker 2>But now you do cut them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1388
01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:03.170
<v Speaker 2>We caught him and stitch it back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1389
01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:03.900
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1390
01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it needs that.</v>

1391
01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Don't need stitches for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a small car,</v>

1392
01:00:06.961 --> 01:00:09.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's a scaffold going in normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1393
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:15.190
<v Speaker 2>so he thinks he's using this app which </v>
<v Speaker 2>is kind of helping motivate him but what</v>

1394
01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:17.180
<v Speaker 2>it's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's attached.</v>

1395
01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.073
<v Speaker 2>It's giving him this sound like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>little jingle that gets attached to all </v>

1396
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:25.670
<v Speaker 2>those feelings of motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means that when he finds himself</v>

1397
01:00:25.671 --> 01:00:30.470
<v Speaker 2>in this kind of final scene where he has</v>
<v Speaker 2>this choice to step in and save a life,</v>

1398
01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:33.790
<v Speaker 2>that we can have the same jingle on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>radio that plays and you know,</v>

1399
01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.460
<v Speaker 2>it's like that thing of you hear a song </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're breaking up with someone and</v>

1400
01:00:37.461 --> 01:00:38.294
<v Speaker 2>it's a horrible period of your life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then five years later you hear the same </v>

1401
01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:44.290
<v Speaker 2>solid and it just brings it all back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That process or obviously like you know,</v>

1402
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.930
<v Speaker 2>advertising as the big example of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the premise behind something like the</v>

1403
01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:48.764
<v Speaker 2>Manchurian candidate that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>way they can snap and then you go back </v>

1404
01:00:52.161 --> 01:00:52.994
<v Speaker 2>to the state of mind.</v>

1405
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:55.940
<v Speaker 2>That's more kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess overtly hypnotic.</v>

1406
01:00:55.941 --> 01:00:57.700
<v Speaker 2>That's like a post hypnotic suggestion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't,</v>

1407
01:00:57.710 --> 01:01:00.620
<v Speaker 2>this is more gentle because he needed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make the decision himself.</v>

1408
01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:01.533
<v Speaker 2>The idea was not that it'd be some kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of hypnotized robot if that would even </v>

1409
01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:05.540
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

1410
01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:05.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1411
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:08.930
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is about creating a trigger.</v>

1412
01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:09.843
<v Speaker 2>Those feelings of empathy are important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the shows about empathy and a </v>

1413
01:01:12.011 --> 01:01:16.490
<v Speaker 2>lot of the show is about the desire to </v>
<v Speaker 2>act and then he's,</v>

1414
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.430
<v Speaker 2>he finds himself in this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is extreme.</v>

1415
01:01:20.431 --> 01:01:21.264
<v Speaker 2>He has no idea at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's anything to do with the filmings </v>

1416
01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.770
<v Speaker 2>finished that will happen in England as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as the concerned is gone back home.</v>

1417
01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:26.613
<v Speaker 2>We had time to forget all about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then ends up stranded in this situation </v>

1418
01:01:29.841 --> 01:01:31.380
<v Speaker 2>where it all happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1419
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:33.230
<v Speaker 2>and then I trigger these things off.</v>

1420
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:36.080
<v Speaker 2>So I'm giving him this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological nudge and then it's,</v>

1421
01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:37.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1422
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.561
<v Speaker 2>what will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will he,</v>

1423
01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:40.240
<v Speaker 2>will he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will he rise up and take it like that,</v>

1424
01:01:40.241 --> 01:01:41.870
<v Speaker 2>the guy landing the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like what,</v>

1425
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:43.460
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what ultimately,</v>

1426
01:01:43.461 --> 01:01:45.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that guy's decision and it's also,</v>

1427
01:01:45.961 --> 01:01:50.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a story about stepping out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the kind of,</v>

1428
01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:52.440
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1429
01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.273
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1430
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:56.910
<v Speaker 2>I guess the show resonates politically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a political show that the,</v>

1431
01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:58.553
<v Speaker 2>there's like there were political </v>
<v Speaker 2>narratives we get constrained by and we </v>

1432
01:02:01.221 --> 01:02:04.810
<v Speaker 2>forget that attitude to the dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the sides that you know,</v>

1433
01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.940
<v Speaker 2>where humanity emerges and will we find </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

1434
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:08.803
<v Speaker 2>So this is also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess a story about a guy coming out </v>

1435
01:02:11.151 --> 01:02:11.984
<v Speaker 2>of his particular sociopolitical </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative and just finding something </v>

1436
01:02:17.061 --> 01:02:20.280
<v Speaker 2>that ultimately is just a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a human quality,</v>

1437
01:02:20.281 --> 01:02:21.180
<v Speaker 2>kindness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion.</v>

1438
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.950
<v Speaker 2>And these are not political qualities.</v>

1439
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:24.450
<v Speaker 2>Although they ended up getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicized,</v>

1440
01:02:24.451 --> 01:02:25.800
<v Speaker 2>but they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

1441
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I think there are a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna Watch this and want that to happen</v>

1442
01:02:29.221 --> 01:02:30.054
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I need some sort of a </v>

1443
01:02:30.961 --> 01:02:35.961
<v Speaker 2>transformative prank played on me to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people do.</v>

1444
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:40.020
<v Speaker 2>We do get caught and ruts right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we do get stuck on momentum.</v>

1445
01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:43.500
<v Speaker 2>We get stuck following the same patterns</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again.</v>

1446
01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:48.501
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to change your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing that makes us so great</v>

1447
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.553
<v Speaker 2>at evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our ability to adapt is the same thing </v>

1448
01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:54.030
<v Speaker 2>that just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ties us down.</v>

1449
01:02:54.031 --> 01:02:54.864
<v Speaker 2>So like all through life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from an early age like we merged in </v>

1450
01:02:57.031 --> 01:02:57.864
<v Speaker 2>this world and we're very quickly given </v>
<v Speaker 2>messages about what our relationship </v>

1451
01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.530
<v Speaker 2>with that ship to that world is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what people are like,</v>

1452
01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:05.640
<v Speaker 2>this is what they want from you.</v>

1453
01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.310
<v Speaker 2>You are not powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is powerful,</v>

1454
01:03:08.311 --> 01:03:09.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that that is,</v>

1455
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:13.320
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be skewed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said that I love this,</v>

1456
01:03:13.321 --> 01:03:17.460
<v Speaker 2>that the greatest burden a child has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bear is the unlived life of its parents.</v>

1457
01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:18.623
<v Speaker 2>Such a great thing to your starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>point is this skewed story and then you </v>

1458
01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:27.410
<v Speaker 2>just go through life looking for things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just fit and recreate that.</v>

1459
01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Those patents because they feel so </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable.</v>

1460
01:03:29.371 --> 01:03:30.204
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're what you learned about love from </v>

1461
01:03:32.491 --> 01:03:33.324
<v Speaker 2>your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've start to bring to your adult </v>

1462
01:03:35.461 --> 01:03:38.970
<v Speaker 2>relationships and project all that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a,</v>

1463
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.380
<v Speaker 2>on your partner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think about,</v>

1464
01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:41.214
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1465
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.983
<v Speaker 2>if you've had a nice loving upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are getting a ridiculously skewed </v>

1466
01:03:47.371 --> 01:03:48.204
<v Speaker 2>version of what love means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we know as adults how difficult it </v>

1467
01:03:50.161 --> 01:03:52.170
<v Speaker 2>is raising kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never saw that as kids.</v>

1468
01:03:52.171 --> 01:03:54.780
<v Speaker 2>We never saw our parents going off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming at each other.</v>

1469
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:58.270
<v Speaker 2>The next room wants to be going to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just have this sort of impossibly uh,</v>

1470
01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.021
<v Speaker 2>hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1471
01:03:59.021 --> 01:04:00.930
<v Speaker 2>if we've had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a happy one,</v>

1472
01:04:00.931 --> 01:04:02.820
<v Speaker 2>we'd get this impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1473
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.010
<v Speaker 2>template of what love is and should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we just dumped that on the poor</v>

1474
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.710
<v Speaker 2>adult partners which nobody can live up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1475
01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.633
<v Speaker 2>So our ability to adapt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to internalize stories about who we are </v>

1476
01:04:14.821 --> 01:04:18.680
<v Speaker 2>and then like mistake that for reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>is just a,</v>

1477
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:24.910
<v Speaker 2>is just what makes living just difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>and complex.</v>

1478
01:04:24.931 --> 01:04:25.764
<v Speaker 2>And also the narratives that come </v>
<v Speaker 2>through fiction narratives from films </v>

1479
01:04:29.401 --> 01:04:34.401
<v Speaker 2>and books and songs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The versions of romance and.</v>

1480
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly with that.</v>

1481
01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea that I'm done.</v>

1482
01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:44.120
<v Speaker 2>If you never landed Bhutan is a British </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosopher and writer and he said,</v>

1483
01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:44.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to bed twice a week with your </v>

1484
01:04:46.651 --> 01:04:49.360
<v Speaker 2>partner thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1485
01:04:49.361 --> 01:04:51.990
<v Speaker 2>the fuck am I doing with this person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's normal.</v>

1486
01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:54.330
<v Speaker 2>That's a normal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like.</v>

1487
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:57.200
<v Speaker 2>To me that's more useful information </v>
<v Speaker 2>than you know,</v>

1488
01:04:57.330 --> 01:05:00.690
<v Speaker 2>how to make your relationship perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These things aren't perfect and again,</v>

1489
01:05:00.691 --> 01:05:01.524
<v Speaker 2>living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living with the understanding that you </v>

1490
01:05:03.061 --> 01:05:04.670
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is devoted.</v>

1491
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:07.170
<v Speaker 2>What about three times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three times a week.</v>

1492
01:05:07.171 --> 01:05:08.670
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably pretty normal as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1493
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:12.240
<v Speaker 2>In general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the number where you should start</v>

1494
01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:14.940
<v Speaker 2>to read?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five.</v>

1495
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Two good nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have two good nights though.</v>

1496
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Five nights a hell of a two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the best.</v>

1497
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

1498
01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:23.493
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

1499
01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:24.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the.</v>

1500
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:28.210
<v Speaker 1>The narratives that we get from fiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're very confusing to people,</v>

1501
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.340
<v Speaker 1>particularly people that are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>romantic,</v>

1502
01:05:30.341 --> 01:05:31.174
<v Speaker 1>they have these ideas that their life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be like one of their favorite </v>

1503
01:05:33.881 --> 01:05:35.890
<v Speaker 1>films and that that's what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for.</v>

1504
01:05:35.891 --> 01:05:39.910
<v Speaker 1>They're holding out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding out for when the music plays in,</v>

1505
01:05:39.911 --> 01:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>the closeup is there and</v>

1506
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:44.450
<v Speaker 2>and those stories stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going back to this guy mandible.</v>

1507
01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.433
<v Speaker 2>Tony wrote a lovely book on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those fit the trouble with those films </v>

1508
01:05:47.281 --> 01:05:48.114
<v Speaker 2>that those stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stopped when the people fall in </v>

1509
01:05:49.591 --> 01:05:51.250
<v Speaker 2>love and get together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>

1510
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:52.343
<v Speaker 2>That's when it starts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when the tough stuff starts that </v>

1511
01:05:53.821 --> 01:05:54.654
<v Speaker 2>we could do with some good strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>fictional frameworks to sort of absorb </v>

1512
01:05:59.281 --> 01:06:00.600
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when the tufts stop.</v>

1513
01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:03.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's like death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing,</v>

1514
01:06:03.091 --> 01:06:03.781
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no.</v>

1515
01:06:03.781 --> 01:06:04.614
<v Speaker 2>We've kind of lost touch with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural narratives around death that </v>

1516
01:06:07.921 --> 01:06:09.720
<v Speaker 2>gave it some meetings and now when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

1517
01:06:09.721 --> 01:06:10.554
<v Speaker 2>it's just as absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scary thing that we don't know what to </v>

1518
01:06:13.261 --> 01:06:14.094
<v Speaker 2>do with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only narrative we have that we have </v>

1519
01:06:15.691 --> 01:06:16.321
<v Speaker 2>absorbed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

1520
01:06:16.321 --> 01:06:19.110
<v Speaker 2>is that of the brave battle at someone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>

1521
01:06:19.111 --> 01:06:19.944
<v Speaker 2>which is so unhelpful for the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in that situation makes everyone </v>

1522
01:06:22.081 --> 01:06:22.914
<v Speaker 2>else made me feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just adds like eventual failure and </v>

1523
01:06:25.831 --> 01:06:28.440
<v Speaker 2>letting everyone else down to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>person's burdens.</v>

1524
01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:30.030
<v Speaker 2>It was what they should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they should.</v>

1525
01:06:30.031 --> 01:06:33.120
<v Speaker 2>What we should feel in that at that time</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you know,</v>

1526
01:06:33.121 --> 01:06:36.060
<v Speaker 2>that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is when we can bring out if we have</v>

1527
01:06:36.061 --> 01:06:39.310
<v Speaker 2>the opportunity to bring our stories to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of ending,</v>

1528
01:06:39.311 --> 01:06:40.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you watch,</v>

1529
01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:40.933
<v Speaker 2>if you watch a film or read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that final scene makes sense of </v>

1530
01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:46.080
<v Speaker 2>everything that's happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't happen in live.</v>

1531
01:06:46.081 --> 01:06:46.914
<v Speaker 2>It is kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we should be like author of our </v>

1532
01:06:51.451 --> 01:06:55.560
<v Speaker 2>stories more than at any point before </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

1533
01:06:55.561 --> 01:06:56.760
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we have the opportunity,</v>

1534
01:06:56.790 --> 01:07:00.680
<v Speaker 2>what happens is the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We become like cameos in this story,</v>

1535
01:07:00.681 --> 01:07:02.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main characters or our loved ones or</v>

1536
01:07:02.431 --> 01:07:05.610
<v Speaker 2>the doctors or people making all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions and we kind of get sidelined.</v>

1537
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:10.910
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fictional or mythical storage,</v>

1538
01:07:11.081 --> 01:07:11.914
<v Speaker 2>just these things that just give us a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of where our experience fits into </v>

1539
01:07:14.581 --> 01:07:15.780
<v Speaker 2>a wider sense of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>

1540
01:07:15.781 --> 01:07:16.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

1541
01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:19.920
<v Speaker 2>we've kind of lost touch with that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last couple of hundred years and there's</v>

1542
01:07:19.921 --> 01:07:22.050
<v Speaker 2>a lot of good stuff that's come with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because we've embraced,</v>

1543
01:07:22.051 --> 01:07:22.884
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science and knowledge at the expense of </v>

1544
01:07:24.631 --> 01:07:25.770
<v Speaker 2>superstition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

1545
01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:26.970
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1546
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.800
<v Speaker 2>we've kind of lost touch of something so</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've lost a little bit of touch with</v>

1547
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.713
<v Speaker 1>nature and the natural laws of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in dying and I think we as human </v>

1548
01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:39.154
<v Speaker 1>beings today are probably more alienated</v>
<v Speaker 1>from particularly the death of farm </v>

1549
01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:47.440
<v Speaker 1>animals and things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where,</v>

1550
01:07:47.441 --> 01:07:50.470
<v Speaker 1>where our food comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like actually seeing death.</v>

1551
01:07:50.471 --> 01:07:52.930
<v Speaker 1>Even if your dog is sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bring him to the vet,</v>

1552
01:07:52.931 --> 01:07:54.760
<v Speaker 1>the vet puts them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1553
01:07:54.761 --> 01:07:55.594
<v Speaker 1>all these things that people probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced firsthand for hundreds and </v>

1554
01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:00.093
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly like raising animals and </v>

1555
01:08:02.141 --> 01:08:05.560
<v Speaker 1>that is done is just completely removed </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the equation.</v>

1556
01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Those folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1557
01:08:07.211 --> 01:08:08.044
<v Speaker 2>That sort of embodied dialog or that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue with ecology with nature is </v>

1558
01:08:12.821 --> 01:08:17.821
<v Speaker 2>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like view of like what,</v>

1559
01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:22.240
<v Speaker 2>what the kind of indigenous peoples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1560
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:23.480
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like dad,</v>

1561
01:08:23.481 --> 01:08:24.314
<v Speaker 2>you have to shame and our view of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Shaman is is so skewed by our kind </v>

1562
01:08:26.901 --> 01:08:28.760
<v Speaker 2>of western mode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1563
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:29.983
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tapping into is not like it isn't </v>

1564
01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.070
<v Speaker 2>the supernatural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not sort of the,</v>

1565
01:08:35.071 --> 01:08:36.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not really the mode what you have</v>

1566
01:08:36.921 --> 01:08:38.770
<v Speaker 2>and you still have it in these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1567
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:41.420
<v Speaker 2>indigenous peoples that sort of say live</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1568
01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:43.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rural Asia and so on that were,</v>

1569
01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:44.744
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1570
01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:48.950
<v Speaker 2>these ways of living is still going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what's,</v>

1571
01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:51.350
<v Speaker 2>what's clear is it's not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supernatural,</v>

1572
01:08:51.351 --> 01:08:52.610
<v Speaker 2>it isn't the spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1573
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:57.280
<v Speaker 2>it's all about a really easy </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the natural world.</v>

1574
01:08:57.281 --> 01:08:58.114
<v Speaker 2>So an example of this is a great book </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the spell of the sensuous by </v>

1575
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.020
<v Speaker 2>David Abrams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who actually was a magician originally.</v>

1576
01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.360
<v Speaker 2>He went out and lived amongst his people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he eats,</v>

1577
01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.130
<v Speaker 2>he talks about this and he said there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>

1578
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:10.100
<v Speaker 2>he was staying in this compound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shamans compound.</v>

1579
01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.910
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1580
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:15.860
<v Speaker 2>the shamans wife would bring him some </v>
<v Speaker 2>fruit every morning,</v>

1581
01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:17.053
<v Speaker 2>but you also had these little like </v>
<v Speaker 2>banana leaves with Rice in and she </v>

1582
01:09:19.551 --> 01:09:20.384
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was going off and doing something </v>

1583
01:09:20.961 --> 01:09:21.794
<v Speaker 2>else with those and he asked where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were going and should all those for the </v>

1584
01:09:23.931 --> 01:09:25.070
<v Speaker 2>spirits of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1585
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:26.263
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she'd come back and without </v>

1586
01:09:28.611 --> 01:09:30.980
<v Speaker 2>them we were just wondering kind of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>that meant and what he was doing.</v>

1587
01:09:30.981 --> 01:09:33.690
<v Speaker 2>So one day he just kind of followed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched.</v>

1588
01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:34.533
<v Speaker 2>Gentry was placing these little pockets </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these little things of rice out </v>

1589
01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:37.964
<v Speaker 2>around the perimeter of this compound </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was watching it and from a </v>

1590
01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:45.950
<v Speaker 2>distance and he saw the rice start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>move and yet a moment of like,</v>

1591
01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:47.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the spirit,</v>

1592
01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:48.530
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

1593
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:50.810
<v Speaker 2>And then the rise moved along the ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've,</v>

1594
01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.673
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's aunts,</v>

1595
01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.750
<v Speaker 2>it's aunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what she's actually doing,</v>

1596
01:09:53.751 --> 01:09:57.170
<v Speaker 2>she's putting out rice for the ants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then he had the thought of,</v>

1597
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't spirits,</v>

1598
01:09:58.251 --> 01:09:59.084
<v Speaker 2>it's just ants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you realize now of course the </v>

1599
01:10:00.771 --> 01:10:02.840
<v Speaker 2>ants kind of are the spirits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1600
01:10:02.841 --> 01:10:07.130
<v Speaker 2>So this is a house where food is </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared or they have a lot of,</v>

1601
01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:08.063
<v Speaker 2>of big events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And an ant infestation would be just </v>

1602
01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:11.763
<v Speaker 2>disastrous for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the spirit of the offering to the </v>

1603
01:10:14.691 --> 01:10:17.450
<v Speaker 2>spirits of the house is a kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue with the answer is going to,</v>

1604
01:10:17.451 --> 01:10:19.970
<v Speaker 2>if we were going to put this rice out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you just,</v>

1605
01:10:19.971 --> 01:10:21.980
<v Speaker 2>if you just have the rise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we do this every day,</v>

1606
01:10:21.981 --> 01:10:23.410
<v Speaker 2>will you leave us alone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1607
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:28.280
<v Speaker 2>and then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

1608
01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.173
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of that it's quite simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue and I sort of this lovely kind </v>

1609
01:10:33.291 --> 01:10:37.940
<v Speaker 2>of embodied relationship with nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>that of course we're so far from here.</v>

1610
01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:38.953
<v Speaker 2>So interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do tend to pack a lot of ideas into </v>

1611
01:10:41.001 --> 01:10:41.370
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1612
01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:42.203
<v Speaker 2>the supernatural even like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious and depth psychology and so </v>

1613
01:10:45.411 --> 01:10:47.720
<v Speaker 2>much I'm a big fan of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can take all this,</v>

1614
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:50.600
<v Speaker 2>the unknown stuff and shove it into </v>
<v Speaker 2>these kinds of bottomless pits.</v>

1615
01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Whereas actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interestingly,</v>

1616
01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:55.010
<v Speaker 2>if you trace it back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like it just wasn't like that.</v>

1617
01:10:55.011 --> 01:10:55.960
<v Speaker 2>It was this very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1618
01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.333
<v Speaker 2>well it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what they're doing is </v>

1619
01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:04.430
<v Speaker 2>particularly with Sherman Sherman is </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on psychedelic drugs.</v>

1620
01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.633
<v Speaker 2>They're an Iowaska church and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving people dimethyltryptamine like </v>

1621
01:11:09.741 --> 01:11:13.040
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are dealing with the supernatural.</v>

1622
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:14.460
<v Speaker 2>A very bizarre</v>

1623
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:15.533
<v Speaker 1>and intense transformative experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're putting people through and </v>

1624
01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 1>there's different like that term Shaman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>

1625
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:29.780
<v Speaker 1>it kind of was very rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rare to be discussed up until about</v>

1626
01:11:30.451 --> 01:11:31.284
<v Speaker 1>maybe 20 plus years ago and it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's been some sort of a </v>

1627
01:11:34.111 --> 01:11:38.970
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic revolution over the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of decades and it's almost become</v>

1628
01:11:38.971 --> 01:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>a little bit too popular here were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people are profiting from it or</v>

1629
01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:43.464
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're opportunists and they're their </v>

1630
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:49.260
<v Speaker 1>labeling themselves as shaman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the term that they use in Peru,</v>

1631
01:11:49.261 --> 01:11:51.210
<v Speaker 1>they call them plastic Shazam and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>

1632
01:11:51.211 --> 01:11:52.044
<v Speaker 1>they're setting up shop and putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>together this Iowasca brew and having </v>

1633
01:11:55.081 --> 01:11:57.900
<v Speaker 1>all these Americans come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly in and Europeans are looking for,</v>

1634
01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>air quote,</v>

1635
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:04.400
<v Speaker 1>spiritual experience and these are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily pure shaman and the greatest</v>

1636
01:12:05.371 --> 01:12:07.200
<v Speaker 1>sense of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different.</v>

1637
01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:09.600
<v Speaker 1>This is what we think of when we think </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Shaman today.</v>

1638
01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.910
<v Speaker 1>We think of someone who conducts a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic ritual.</v>

1639
01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I know very little of you know,</v>

1640
01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:16.680
<v Speaker 1>you've had any experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited if I put,</v>

1641
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:17.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real real coffee with DECAF and how </v>

1642
01:12:20.011 --> 01:12:21.750
<v Speaker 1>come?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why haven't you tried something?</v>

1643
01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psilocybin.</v>

1644
01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1645
01:12:24.211 --> 01:12:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I never even smoked a cigarette or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1646
01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:26.910
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1647
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:27.743
<v Speaker 1>it's a real magicians thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like a pendulum like that </v>

1648
01:12:31.231 --> 01:12:31.921
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1649
01:12:31.921 --> 01:12:32.754
<v Speaker 1>it's very common instead of A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a new robotic control </v>

1650
01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:38.310
<v Speaker 1>thing during that period where if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do it,</v>

1651
01:12:38.311 --> 01:12:39.690
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be doing it then and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1652
01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:41.813
<v Speaker 1>and then that kind of time policies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it just ends up being something that </v>

1653
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:48.360
<v Speaker 1>gets missed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of magicians don't drink.</v>

1654
01:12:48.361 --> 01:12:49.194
<v Speaker 1>Don't smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penn had the strangest response when I </v>

1655
01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:53.370
<v Speaker 1>asked him about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1656
01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:55.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we figured out everything we can</v>

1657
01:12:55.891 --> 01:12:56.970
<v Speaker 1>from those things already.</v>

1658
01:12:57.810 --> 01:12:59.290
<v Speaker 1>But you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1659
01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.360
<v Speaker 1>You haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1660
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:02.203
<v Speaker 1>you've learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've learned everything we can learn </v>

1661
01:13:04.141 --> 01:13:07.220
<v Speaker 1>from these psychedelic trips was with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his perception was you.</v>

1662
01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's amended that since </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

1663
01:13:09.121 --> 01:13:11.220
<v Speaker 1>This was over a decade ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had this conversation,</v>

1664
01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:15.060
<v Speaker 1>but that thought process is fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me because,</v>

1665
01:13:15.061 --> 01:13:15.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1666
01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:16.503
<v Speaker 1>you mean you're talking about like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformative experience that you've </v>

1667
01:13:18.331 --> 01:13:21.300
<v Speaker 1>put through people through with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows set and setting them up these,</v>

1668
01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:22.493
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think the world is different and </v>

1669
01:13:23.371 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 1>changed and then they changed because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1670
01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're missing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1671
01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.440
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1672
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:31.223
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the experience of transcendence </v>

1673
01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:33.640
<v Speaker 2>that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1674
01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:34.503
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religions originally gave people that </v>

1675
01:13:37.101 --> 01:13:37.934
<v Speaker 2>there was a time in history where were a</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion was being born and it was </v>

1676
01:13:42.981 --> 01:13:43.814
<v Speaker 2>giving people of phenomenal logical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>embodied experience of the transcendent </v>

1677
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:49.640
<v Speaker 2>whatever that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that meant.</v>

1678
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:52.640
<v Speaker 2>And then time moves on and then that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of moves out of living memory.</v>

1679
01:13:52.641 --> 01:13:55.380
<v Speaker 2>And so you kind of have to need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>recreate it,</v>

1680
01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.433
<v Speaker 2>recreated feelings through practices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's practices start to </v>

1681
01:13:59.901 --> 01:14:03.320
<v Speaker 2>becoming a rituals and dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by this point you're creating a sort</v>

1682
01:14:03.321 --> 01:14:08.090
<v Speaker 2>of recreating a belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the sort of the embodied experiences</v>

1683
01:14:08.091 --> 01:14:10.040
<v Speaker 2>sort of kind of faded into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>

1684
01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:11.173
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1685
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.213
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

1686
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:13.173
<v Speaker 2>I'm an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that I could see that what you're </v>

1687
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:19.450
<v Speaker 2>left with thousands of years later is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is quite easy to knock down.</v>

1688
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of poke fun of.</v>

1689
01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:24.280
<v Speaker 2>But actually it's at some level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

1690
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:25.173
<v Speaker 2>it is not doing a very good job of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing back to the original </v>

1691
01:14:29.051 --> 01:14:31.060
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the importance of transcendence.</v>

1692
01:14:31.061 --> 01:14:31.894
<v Speaker 2>Now you can diy spiritualize that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have to be about anything </v>

1693
01:14:33.701 --> 01:14:34.534
<v Speaker 2>overtly spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like finding something bigger than </v>

1694
01:14:37.481 --> 01:14:41.800
<v Speaker 2>yourself in life and throwing yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>into that thing is how we find meaning,</v>

1695
01:14:41.801 --> 01:14:42.634
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning trump's happiness or anything </v>

1696
01:14:43.511 --> 01:14:46.060
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that might be through your kids.</v>

1697
01:14:46.061 --> 01:14:48.880
<v Speaker 2>And I guess this is why people generally</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

1698
01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:50.950
<v Speaker 2>we have kids at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1699
01:14:50.951 --> 01:14:53.640
<v Speaker 2>our ego gets to sort of step down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1700
01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:55.480
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1701
01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.570
<v Speaker 2>that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if what we,</v>

1702
01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:58.653
<v Speaker 2>what we do instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess hence the interest in these </v>

1703
01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:04.450
<v Speaker 2>dodgy Shamans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just put it in all the wrong places,</v>

1704
01:15:04.451 --> 01:15:05.081
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fame,</v>

1705
01:15:05.081 --> 01:15:07.810
<v Speaker 2>and so on that don't supply it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do not supply those feelings.</v>

1706
01:15:07.810 --> 01:15:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Transcendence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think they will because we think,</v>

1707
01:15:09.761 --> 01:15:10.594
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rich and glamorous life will lift us up </v>

1708
01:15:12.281 --> 01:15:15.680
<v Speaker 2>and out of our boring everyday lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course you know,</v>

1709
01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.260
<v Speaker 2>they don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something.</v>

1710
01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:20.860
<v Speaker 2>There's something about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to the mysterious that even</v>

1711
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.900
<v Speaker 2>even me as an atheist and the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1712
01:15:22.901 --> 01:15:24.430
<v Speaker 2>I kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important.</v>

1713
01:15:24.431 --> 01:15:25.264
<v Speaker 2>We have to have that somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone realize that needs to be some </v>

1714
01:15:27.581 --> 01:15:30.760
<v Speaker 2>kind of space for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't need to be anything.</v>

1715
01:15:30.810 --> 01:15:31.643
<v Speaker 2>I'm spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just is a kind of a respect for and </v>

1716
01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:39.130
<v Speaker 2>understanding that serving something </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger than yourself,</v>

1717
01:15:39.131 --> 01:15:41.540
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is and whoever knows is is</v>

1718
01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:44.740
<v Speaker 2>a important part of being human.</v>

1719
01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That keeps coming back to you.</v>

1720
01:15:46.231 --> 01:15:49.590
<v Speaker 1>This recognition of your work as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's bigger than yourself.</v>

1721
01:15:49.591 --> 01:15:50.424
<v Speaker 1>You pour yourself into this and through </v>
<v Speaker 1>that experience you somehow transcend </v>

1722
01:15:54.690 --> 01:15:55.950
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something comes out of it,</v>

1723
01:15:55.951 --> 01:15:56.361
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1724
01:15:56.361 --> 01:15:59.640
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you grow with the creation of this thing</v>

1725
01:15:59.641 --> 01:16:03.180
<v Speaker 1>in some way and while it's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're about as alive as you can be.</v>

1726
01:16:03.181 --> 01:16:04.014
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1727
01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm,</v>

1728
01:16:05.331 --> 01:16:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy if my breath is decent at four</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the afternoon.</v>

1729
01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:10.813
<v Speaker 2>I have very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very low ambitions with the business </v>

1730
01:16:13.081 --> 01:16:13.870
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

1731
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:15.780
<v Speaker 2>But it's for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly for the guys going through it,</v>

1732
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:16.623
<v Speaker 2>other people going through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope it gives them a profound and </v>

1733
01:16:22.931 --> 01:16:26.860
<v Speaker 2>transformative experience for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1734
01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:28.803
<v Speaker 2>I get very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get kind of a bit low if I'm not </v>

1735
01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:34.650
<v Speaker 2>actively engaged in something creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

1736
01:16:34.651 --> 01:16:35.860
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is important for me,</v>

1737
01:16:35.861 --> 01:16:36.281
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1738
01:16:36.281 --> 01:16:37.114
<v Speaker 2>the painting or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are all things that you were </v>

1739
01:16:38.531 --> 01:16:39.070
<v Speaker 2>referring to</v>

1740
01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:42.160
<v Speaker 1>to the painting and the exact same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something bigger than yourself.</v>

1741
01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1742
01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.193
<v Speaker 1>That's projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something to occupy your mind and your </v>

1743
01:16:46.871 --> 01:16:49.630
<v Speaker 1>spirit and your creative juices.</v>

1744
01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1745
01:16:50.610 --> 01:16:51.930
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a really.</v>

1746
01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a vital part of your life.</v>

1747
01:16:56.641 --> 01:16:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Making sense of some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1748
01:16:58.351 --> 01:17:00.930
<v Speaker 2>the people sadly that throw themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>off buildings.</v>

1749
01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're unhappy.</v>

1750
01:17:02.131 --> 01:17:04.620
<v Speaker 2>It's that they've normally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no meaning has gone that,</v>

1751
01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:05.670
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the real,</v>

1752
01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:06.563
<v Speaker 2>that's the real killer is lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning and we find meaning through </v>

1753
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:12.620
<v Speaker 2>throwing ourselves into something bigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>and recognizing that.</v>

1754
01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:13.483
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe the reason why this sort </v>

1755
01:17:14.961 --> 01:17:15.794
<v Speaker 2>of work on myth and so on is he's sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of feeling like it's coming back into </v>

1756
01:17:19.911 --> 01:17:20.744
<v Speaker 2>the back into the dialogue now is bs </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's something that's something </v>

1757
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:27.560
<v Speaker 2>kind of real brackets fictional to kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1758
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:28.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1759
01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:29.890
<v Speaker 2>to hang onto these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is important.</v>

1760
01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:30.733
<v Speaker 2>They are the I think are articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that's needs to be recognized </v>

1761
01:17:34.451 --> 01:17:38.600
<v Speaker 2>and somehow honored within within life.</v>

1762
01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:39.573
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Tyson furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a British heavyweight boxer who's </v>

1763
01:17:43.031 --> 01:17:47.260
<v Speaker 1>the lineal heavyweight champion and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>went through severe depression.</v>

1764
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:52.180
<v Speaker 1>He won the title from Vladimir Klitschko</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had held it for many,</v>

1765
01:17:52.181 --> 01:17:53.014
<v Speaker 1>many years and beat him and then felt </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he accomplished his goals and just </v>

1766
01:17:58.211 --> 01:18:01.300
<v Speaker 1>went into a real bad funk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gained a ton of weight,</v>

1767
01:18:01.301 --> 01:18:02.134
<v Speaker 1>started drinking every night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying on and got suicidal and was </v>

1768
01:18:05.621 --> 01:18:06.454
<v Speaker 1>thinking about driving his Ferrari into </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bridge and then decided that he was </v>

1769
01:18:11.621 --> 01:18:14.590
<v Speaker 1>going to make another run at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight championship.</v>

1770
01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:15.453
<v Speaker 1>And so through all this depression and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicidal thoughts and all these </v>

1771
01:18:18.341 --> 01:18:22.450
<v Speaker 1>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what turned him around was goal setting.</v>

1772
01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:27.340
<v Speaker 1>The idea that he had something to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards and something to live for,</v>

1773
01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:31.500
<v Speaker 1>and then getting in shape and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing himself to be on this path,</v>

1774
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:33.370
<v Speaker 1>try to achieve that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1775
01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:35.800
<v Speaker 1>and then what happened if it takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

1776
01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:36.850
<v Speaker 1>didn't December first.</v>

1777
01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:38.830
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't happened yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rematch hasn't happened yet,</v>

1778
01:18:38.831 --> 01:18:41.500
<v Speaker 1>but he's lost more than a hundred and 60</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

1779
01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:43.053
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's slim and he looks fantastic and </v>

1780
01:18:44.831 --> 01:18:48.610
<v Speaker 1>healthy and he was really fat and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>large and very,</v>

1781
01:18:48.611 --> 01:18:49.444
<v Speaker 1>very depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now he's really happy and no </v>

1782
01:18:52.151 --> 01:18:52.984
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the craziest thing about it </v>

1783
01:18:54.431 --> 01:18:57.880
<v Speaker 1>is we're always searching for some pill </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to fix,</v>

1784
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.510
<v Speaker 1>fix whatever weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funky path the mind is on.</v>

1785
01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:04.600
<v Speaker 1>But for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he found was that goal setting,</v>

1786
01:19:04.930 --> 01:19:05.763
<v Speaker 1>like having something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>striving towards working towards this </v>

1787
01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:11.080
<v Speaker 1>danger is though what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

1788
01:19:11.081 --> 01:19:13.060
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the danger because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he said.</v>

1789
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1790
01:19:14.141 --> 01:19:15.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you win?</v>

1791
01:19:15.570 --> 01:19:16.403
<v Speaker 1>What if you win the title?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you fight deontay wilder and </v>

1792
01:19:18.341 --> 01:19:21.200
<v Speaker 1>December first and you beat him and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>become the championship?</v>

1793
01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll balloon back up to 400 pounds</v>

1794
01:19:24.161 --> 01:19:28.330
<v Speaker 1>again and get depressed and I don't say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because I'm worried that he's being</v>

1795
01:19:28.331 --> 01:19:30.970
<v Speaker 1>honest because he has been down that </v>
<v Speaker 1>road before.</v>

1796
01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:32.163
<v Speaker 1>But it's fascinating that he achieved </v>
<v Speaker 1>real happiness from attempting to work </v>

1797
01:19:39.581 --> 01:19:40.414
<v Speaker 1>towards these goals and building towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>these goals and having this vision in </v>

1798
01:19:43.691 --> 01:19:47.340
<v Speaker 1>his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a real thing happening.</v>

1799
01:19:47.341 --> 01:19:47.420
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1800
01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:48.253
<v Speaker 2>with Christianity that kind of exploded </v>
<v Speaker 2>a relatively new idea onto the seat and </v>

1801
01:19:51.551 --> 01:19:54.030
<v Speaker 2>a couple of thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which to bear in mind.</v>

1802
01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:56.990
<v Speaker 2>So prior to Christianity you kind of had</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stoics,</v>

1803
01:19:56.991 --> 01:19:58.620
<v Speaker 2>like for 500 years they were the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1804
01:19:58.630 --> 01:20:03.630
<v Speaker 2>the hugely popular philosophical school </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're all about bear in mind,</v>

1805
01:20:04.711 --> 01:20:06.360
<v Speaker 2>they're also the first election from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>east.</v>

1806
01:20:06.361 --> 01:20:07.194
<v Speaker 2>So there's a kind of ideas around like </v>
<v Speaker 2>non attachment and mindfulness that was </v>

1807
01:20:10.621 --> 01:20:14.100
<v Speaker 2>sort of differently expressed in a much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more western rational way.</v>

1808
01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:14.934
<v Speaker 2>But they kind of reflect some of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas that were going on in Buddhism at </v>

1809
01:20:17.581 --> 01:20:18.414
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea of happiness was very much </v>

1810
01:20:21.181 --> 01:20:22.014
<v Speaker 2>about your relationship to the current </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment and your emotional state in the </v>

1811
01:20:25.930 --> 01:20:26.763
<v Speaker 2>in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then also stepping back from her </v>

1812
01:20:28.861 --> 01:20:29.694
<v Speaker 2>whole life and it said you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really judge anyone is happy until </v>

1813
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:33.750
<v Speaker 2>they're on their deathbed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what is,</v>

1814
01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:34.613
<v Speaker 2>what is the story that emerged and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened with Christianity is for the </v>

1815
01:20:39.391 --> 01:20:44.391
<v Speaker 2>first time there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this new message that no,</v>

1816
01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:45.563
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you suffer now and your reward will </v>

1817
01:20:48.101 --> 01:20:49.090
<v Speaker 2>happen in the future.</v>

1818
01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.280
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing idea,</v>

1819
01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:54.990
<v Speaker 2>particularly if you're suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>

1820
01:20:54.991 --> 01:20:57.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a time when there was hellenic walls and</v>

1821
01:20:57.931 --> 01:20:59.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a time of great suffering.</v>

1822
01:20:59.281 --> 01:21:00.114
<v Speaker 2>So an amazingly powerful message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like that idea of you can take that </v>

1823
01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:06.893
<v Speaker 2>sort of spiritual ladder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that idea of sort of climbing towards </v>

1824
01:21:10.351 --> 01:21:11.184
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of this shimmering golden haze of </v>

1825
01:21:13.801 --> 01:21:15.270
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a reward heaven,</v>

1826
01:21:15.271 --> 01:21:18.450
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is off in the distance </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's now the corporate ladder.</v>

1827
01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That idea that,</v>

1828
01:21:19.621 --> 01:21:21.630
<v Speaker 2>that mode has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has stayed with us.</v>

1829
01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:22.890
<v Speaker 2>We now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in England,</v>

1830
01:21:22.891 --> 01:21:23.724
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not familiar enough with the school </v>

1831
01:21:25.031 --> 01:21:27.540
<v Speaker 2>structure here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in England when you're 16,</v>

1832
01:21:27.541 --> 01:21:30.060
<v Speaker 2>you're choosing your a levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1833
01:21:30.061 --> 01:21:30.894
<v Speaker 2>Which is what you finished school with </v>
<v Speaker 2>to then decide what you're going to </v>

1834
01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:34.493
<v Speaker 2>major in at university in order to then </v>
<v Speaker 2>what job you're going to get at the end </v>

1835
01:21:38.130 --> 01:21:38.963
<v Speaker 2>of that to what promotion you could get </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what you're going to work your way </v>

1836
01:21:41.101 --> 01:21:41.670
<v Speaker 2>up to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1837
01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:44.840
<v Speaker 2>what is that moment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that point that it's that,</v>

1838
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:45.391
<v Speaker 2>that end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1839
01:21:45.391 --> 01:21:47.430
<v Speaker 2>we're so we are so fixated</v>

1840
01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.010
<v Speaker 2>on what's coming and I know this is in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way it's sort of like,</v>

1841
01:21:52.011 --> 01:21:52.844
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is familiar in terms of the </v>

1842
01:21:53.631 --> 01:21:54.464
<v Speaker 2>importance of mindfulness and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also ties in with like a fear of </v>

1843
01:21:56.781 --> 01:21:58.400
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

1844
01:21:58.401 --> 01:21:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Death is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

1845
01:21:59.451 --> 01:22:00.284
<v Speaker 2>Unpacking why deaths frightening because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to be there when it </v>

1846
01:22:02.031 --> 01:22:04.910
<v Speaker 2>happens and all those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to be that it's frightening</v>

1847
01:22:04.911 --> 01:22:08.280
<v Speaker 2>because our projects will end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1848
01:22:08.281 --> 01:22:08.900
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1849
01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:12.170
<v Speaker 2>whether it's your kids or grandkids that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't see grow up or what.</v>

1850
01:22:12.171 --> 01:22:13.004
<v Speaker 2>There's always something that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to an end and the the antidote to </v>

1851
01:22:16.611 --> 01:22:21.010
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be just just reappraising </v>
<v Speaker 2>that constant fixation on the end.</v>

1852
01:22:21.011 --> 01:22:22.550
<v Speaker 2>So I'm on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the future,</v>

1853
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.960
<v Speaker 2>so that's why I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1854
01:22:23.961 --> 01:22:24.794
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1855
01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:25.990
<v Speaker 2>I hear that and god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

1856
01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:26.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how amazing he is.</v>

1857
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:28.123
<v Speaker 2>Found that now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't help but think and then one </v>

1858
01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.100
<v Speaker 2>and then what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1859
01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:37.750
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't agree more about this idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>working towards something when you're in</v>

1860
01:22:37.751 --> 01:22:39.140
<v Speaker 1>school that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1861
01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:40.013
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're almost trying to reach an end </v>

1862
01:22:41.771 --> 01:22:43.450
<v Speaker 1>that never comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

1863
01:22:43.451 --> 01:22:44.284
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're building for something and also </v>

1864
01:22:46.001 --> 01:22:50.080
<v Speaker 1>the pressure that they put on children </v>
<v Speaker 1>to start that off at age 14,</v>

1865
01:22:50.081 --> 01:22:51.430
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>

1866
01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:54.670
<v Speaker 1>and to pick what you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing for the rest of your life and this</v>

1867
01:22:54.671 --> 01:22:57.520
<v Speaker 1>idea that one day you're going to air </v>
<v Speaker 1>quotes,</v>

1868
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:59.890
<v Speaker 1>make it and then you're going to make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

1869
01:23:00.650 --> 01:23:03.290
<v Speaker 2>But if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like inferior in that situation</v>

1870
01:23:03.291 --> 01:23:04.124
<v Speaker 2>now or that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This friend of mine I said built up the </v>

1871
01:23:05.501 --> 01:23:06.334
<v Speaker 2>company and then sold it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was depressed and had to go into </v>

1872
01:23:08.051 --> 01:23:11.200
<v Speaker 2>depression at that that need the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has been driving it,</v>

1873
01:23:11.201 --> 01:23:12.034
<v Speaker 2>that's still there and that needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone to go and it's like you're much </v>

1874
01:23:14.111 --> 01:23:17.630
<v Speaker 2>better off having something unfulfilled </v>
<v Speaker 2>that at least is taken care of that need</v>

1875
01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:18.473
<v Speaker 2>so you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He needs something that's going to be </v>

1876
01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.270
<v Speaker 2>perpetually a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1877
01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:24.200
<v Speaker 1>rewarding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but patch stimulating,</v>

1878
01:23:24.201 --> 01:23:25.034
<v Speaker 1>stimulating the human mind needs to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in puzzles and and projects and </v>

1879
01:23:30.921 --> 01:23:31.754
<v Speaker 1>creative endeavors and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different requirements that the mind </v>

1880
01:23:34.941 --> 01:23:35.774
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that mirror requirements that </v>

1881
01:23:37.641 --> 01:23:40.250
<v Speaker 1>the body has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think of the body having requirements</v>

1882
01:23:40.251 --> 01:23:43.040
<v Speaker 1>like you need some daily exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need good food.</v>

1883
01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:48.230
<v Speaker 1>I think you need some mental exercise </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you need knowledge.</v>

1884
01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.510
<v Speaker 1>You need information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need wisdom.</v>

1885
01:23:50.511 --> 01:23:51.344
<v Speaker 1>You need that to to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need inspiration and inspiration </v>

1886
01:23:54.591 --> 01:23:55.424
<v Speaker 1>like when we're talking about all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things that you can do to </v>

1887
01:23:58.161 --> 01:23:58.994
<v Speaker 1>someone as a hypnotist or that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do to someone when you're putting </v>

1888
01:24:02.841 --> 01:24:03.674
<v Speaker 1>together these shows and changing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective on things through these </v>

1889
01:24:06.381 --> 01:24:09.510
<v Speaker 1>transformative events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1890
01:24:09.930 --> 01:24:10.763
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a type of fuel for the mind and </v>

1891
01:24:14.210 --> 01:24:16.400
<v Speaker 1>inspiration is a type of fuel for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount,</v>

1892
01:24:16.401 --> 01:24:18.890
<v Speaker 1>a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fuel for the mind,</v>

1893
01:24:18.891 --> 01:24:19.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1894
01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:24.620
<v Speaker 1>even sometimes people mean this fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>food culture that we live and we like it</v>

1895
01:24:24.621 --> 01:24:28.460
<v Speaker 1>in a little tiny meme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little inspirational meme on someone's</v>

1896
01:24:28.461 --> 01:24:30.000
<v Speaker 1>instagram page says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1897
01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like,</v>

1898
01:24:31.251 --> 01:24:34.510
<v Speaker 1>that it makes me feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you a little bit of a,</v>

1899
01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some nutrition for your mind,</v>

1900
01:24:38.210 --> 01:24:42.560
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's squaring that with how</v>

1901
01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:46.053
<v Speaker 2>that life is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually really ambiguous and </v>

1902
01:24:48.221 --> 01:24:51.340
<v Speaker 2>complex and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to me is the,</v>

1903
01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:52.653
<v Speaker 2>that's the big thing to become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think more conscious of what you'd </v>

1904
01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:57.820
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the best we can really aim</v>

1905
01:24:57.821 --> 01:24:58.654
<v Speaker 2>for us to become more conscious of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things that beset us because the </v>

1906
01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.620
<v Speaker 2>stop around conscious of is the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that owns us.</v>

1907
01:25:05.690 --> 01:25:06.523
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the stuff that we're unwilling to </v>

1908
01:25:07.991 --> 01:25:08.824
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1909
01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:13.860
<v Speaker 2>That's the stuff that comes back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bites us in the background constantly.</v>

1910
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:15.430
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1911
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:20.510
<v Speaker 2>The model of I'm psycho psycho analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it as he talks about the god,</v>

1912
01:25:21.921 --> 01:25:23.440
<v Speaker 2>so he was very interesting talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1913
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:24.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1914
01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:27.760
<v Speaker 2>the Greek model of the gods because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't necessarily like worship the gods</v>

1915
01:25:27.761 --> 01:25:31.930
<v Speaker 2>and believed that they were like real </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitive in the way that we might talk</v>

1916
01:25:31.931 --> 01:25:32.980
<v Speaker 2>about God now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

1917
01:25:33.130 --> 01:25:35.440
<v Speaker 2>what they were doing was honoring these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

1918
01:25:35.441 --> 01:25:38.710
<v Speaker 2>sort of like clusters of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1919
01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.980
<v Speaker 2>like the god of Eros,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1920
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:43.720
<v Speaker 2>so that's you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you honor Eros because it's important to</v>

1921
01:25:44.050 --> 01:25:45.970
<v Speaker 2>honor the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the erotic urge.</v>

1922
01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:48.730
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't honor that,</v>

1923
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:50.220
<v Speaker 2>it's going to come back and get you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1924
01:25:50.221 --> 01:25:51.054
<v Speaker 2>the homophobic televangelists that gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught in bed with some guy and at some </v>

1925
01:25:55.091 --> 01:25:56.800
<v Speaker 2>massive scandal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will come back and bite you.</v>

1926
01:25:56.801 --> 01:25:58.300
<v Speaker 2>If you just want to bury something in </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1927
01:25:58.750 --> 01:26:00.400
<v Speaker 2>it will come back and bite you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I liked that,</v>

1928
01:26:00.401 --> 01:26:00.850
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1929
01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:01.683
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1930
01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:02.860
<v Speaker 2>it just means that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1931
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:03.703
<v Speaker 2>life is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ambivalent and complex and I think </v>

1932
01:26:06.801 --> 01:26:07.634
<v Speaker 2>the best we can do is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is try and be conscious of that and not </v>

1933
01:26:12.861 --> 01:26:16.700
<v Speaker 2>be constantly reducing things to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so easy packages.</v>

1934
01:26:16.701 --> 01:26:17.534
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how else do you navigate forward </v>

1935
01:26:18.981 --> 01:26:19.814
<v Speaker 2>without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without reducing things to an easy </v>

1936
01:26:20.811 --> 01:26:21.644
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only way you can make sense </v>

1937
01:26:22.701 --> 01:26:24.980
<v Speaker 2>and move forward is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to have an easy story.</v>

1938
01:26:24.981 --> 01:26:25.814
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1939
01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:29.160
<v Speaker 2>that's like a whole lifetimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1940
01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:30.770
<v Speaker 2>preoccupation there.</v>

1941
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is all messy.</v>

1942
01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:34.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do love to similar things down to a </v>

1943
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.790
<v Speaker 2>nice tasty little easily digestible </v>
<v Speaker 2>package,</v>

1944
01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:43.920
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is when you open that </v>
<v Speaker 2>package there,</v>

1945
01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:45.093
<v Speaker 2>every package is intensely complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like every single situation has all </v>

1946
01:26:48.771 --> 01:26:52.400
<v Speaker 2>these different interacting factors that</v>
<v Speaker 2>led to that situation taking place.</v>

1947
01:26:52.401 --> 01:26:55.670
<v Speaker 2>And if you take them all into </v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration and really dwell on it,</v>

1948
01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:58.640
<v Speaker 2>like you just get paralysis by analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1949
01:26:58.641 --> 01:27:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1950
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:04.010
<v Speaker 2>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1951
01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:05.413
<v Speaker 2>But a consciousness is awareness is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the most weekend we could aim </v>

1952
01:27:09.371 --> 01:27:10.400
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in our own lives.</v>

1953
01:27:10.401 --> 01:27:10.911
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only.</v>

1954
01:27:10.911 --> 01:27:12.470
<v Speaker 2>You can only sort your own life out </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1955
01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:17.540
<v Speaker 2>It probably also plays into hypnotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggestibility in my own work,</v>

1956
01:27:17.541 --> 01:27:19.220
<v Speaker 2>in terms of suggestibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we are,</v>

1957
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:20.323
<v Speaker 2>we're looking for direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially that the simple </v>

1958
01:27:22.251 --> 01:27:27.251
<v Speaker 2>message that easy message was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we just kind of kind of wired to grab</v>

1959
01:27:27.381 --> 01:27:29.150
<v Speaker 2>hold of that and absorb it.</v>

1960
01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.433
<v Speaker 2>Just kind of want to hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a director of somebody giving </v>

1961
01:27:31.971 --> 01:27:32.804
<v Speaker 2>you something you know you can hang onto</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're just kind of confused as </v>

1962
01:27:36.261 --> 01:27:37.094
<v Speaker 2>sort of essentially I guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what suggestibility is your essentially </v>

1963
01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:44.270
<v Speaker 2>confused and looking for an answer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>at that moment someone is giving you the</v>

1964
01:27:44.271 --> 01:27:46.700
<v Speaker 2>answer in the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

1965
01:27:46.701 --> 01:27:50.870
<v Speaker 2>there's no clear scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what hypnosis is.</v>

1966
01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:51.973
<v Speaker 2>It's not like there's like you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly show like this is what's </v>

1967
01:27:55.341 --> 01:27:57.920
<v Speaker 2>happening and that's how it works and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why it works.</v>

1968
01:27:57.921 --> 01:27:58.754
<v Speaker 2>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's an easy answer to </v>

1969
01:28:00.261 --> 01:28:01.580
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is like a said,</v>

1970
01:28:01.581 --> 01:28:02.414
<v Speaker 2>forget the hypnotist and the performers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a hole that big body of </v>

1971
01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:07.213
<v Speaker 2>clinical work investigating it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's clearly a thing yet suggestibility </v>

1972
01:28:11.361 --> 01:28:13.850
<v Speaker 2>is part of the human experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as to what it is.</v>

1973
01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:16.790
<v Speaker 2>Well that's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is kind of the question because you</v>

1974
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:19.100
<v Speaker 2>can't ever quite climb inside a person's</v>
<v Speaker 2>head and.</v>

1975
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:22.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like I,</v>

1976
01:28:22.791 --> 01:28:23.624
<v Speaker 2>in one of the shows I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a show where it took you Sirhan </v>

1977
01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Sirhan who assassinated Bobby Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he said he was hypnotized by the CIA.</v>

1978
01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:35.930
<v Speaker 2>So it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his story right now as a whole.</v>

1979
01:28:35.931 --> 01:28:37.550
<v Speaker 2>He sets out how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1980
01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:40.160
<v Speaker 2>how that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we took that said,</v>

1981
01:28:40.161 --> 01:28:40.760
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

1982
01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:41.593
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's set up a and assassinations </v>

1983
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:45.890
<v Speaker 2>whether or not is it plausible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1984
01:28:45.891 --> 01:28:47.800
<v Speaker 2>is if you take some of the tiniest </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>

1985
01:28:47.930 --> 01:28:48.763
<v Speaker 2>do you believe that we did it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got a guy and the show starts with a </v>

1986
01:28:52.371 --> 01:28:54.420
<v Speaker 2>big audience of people that are up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking part.</v>

1987
01:28:54.450 --> 01:28:56.300
<v Speaker 2>I find the most suggestible person in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience.</v>

1988
01:28:56.990 --> 01:29:00.980
<v Speaker 2>And by the end of it he finds himself in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a packed theater.</v>

1989
01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no it doesn't.</v>

1990
01:29:03.361 --> 01:29:04.021
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's being filmed.</v>

1991
01:29:04.021 --> 01:29:07.920
<v Speaker 2>He's got what he thinks is a real gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he thinks is a thing that is going</v>

1992
01:29:07.921 --> 01:29:10.050
<v Speaker 2>to carry with them in a bit of filming </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to do later.</v>

1993
01:29:10.051 --> 01:29:10.884
<v Speaker 2>But he has a real gun on him and we set </v>
<v Speaker 2>off these little triggers in the same </v>

1994
01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:15.090
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So has a hand said happened to him,</v>

1995
01:29:15.091 --> 01:29:15.924
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a girl with a Polka dot </v>

1996
01:29:16.531 --> 01:29:17.640
<v Speaker 2>dress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1997
01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:18.503
<v Speaker 2>there's a sound that he hears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we had a someone's ringtone next </v>

1998
01:29:20.101 --> 01:29:20.934
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The little triggers that they had </v>

1999
01:29:21.691 --> 01:29:25.700
<v Speaker 2>apparently implanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you do?</v>

2000
01:29:25.770 --> 01:29:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Would that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has no idea.</v>

2001
01:29:27.211 --> 01:29:30.000
<v Speaker 2>This is being filmed as know as part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the show isn't a packed theater.</v>

2002
01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:32.130
<v Speaker 2>We've got Stephen Fry on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2003
01:29:32.131 --> 01:29:32.964
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the guy that's going to get </v>

2004
01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:34.460
<v Speaker 2>assassinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's on it.</v>

2005
01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:35.670
<v Speaker 2>He's wearing scrubs and everything.</v>

2006
01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:38.670
<v Speaker 2>He knows that he may get assassinated at</v>
<v Speaker 2>some point during the show.</v>

2007
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Will the guy do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he does it right.</v>

2008
01:29:42.151 --> 01:29:43.620
<v Speaker 2>He stands up and does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fires.</v>

2009
01:29:43.621 --> 01:29:46.840
<v Speaker 2>What is a real gun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A weird,</v>

2010
01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:49.350
<v Speaker 2>weird thing of expecting pandemonium </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the audience.</v>

2011
01:29:49.351 --> 01:29:51.560
<v Speaker 2>And there's that weird normalcy bias </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kicks him enough.</v>

2012
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:54.330
<v Speaker 2>I just sat there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this part of the show?</v>

2013
01:29:54.331 --> 01:29:56.610
<v Speaker 2>We had all these crowd control people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like nothing happened,</v>

2014
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:58.140
<v Speaker 2>but he did it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2015
01:29:58.141 --> 01:29:59.670
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he shoots it.</v>

2016
01:29:59.671 --> 01:30:00.504
<v Speaker 2>But that was good as I mentioned that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because at the beginning of it we're </v>

2017
01:30:02.761 --> 01:30:04.260
<v Speaker 2>doing these tests with a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2018
01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:05.213
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people in the room and sort of </v>

2019
01:30:06.481 --> 01:30:09.180
<v Speaker 2>looking at what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is going on with it Moses.</v>

2020
01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.193
<v Speaker 2>So we had this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had an ice bath and I hypnotize him </v>

2021
01:30:14.911 --> 01:30:15.744
<v Speaker 2>and told him under hypnosis he'd be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come to begin the ice bath and you </v>

2022
01:30:17.611 --> 01:30:19.920
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't feel the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the temperature.</v>

2023
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:23.430
<v Speaker 2>And I had no idea if you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's a real test.</v>

2024
01:30:23.431 --> 01:30:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Like if he's just sort of playing along </v>
<v Speaker 2>at some level,</v>

2025
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:27.833
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna get an ice bath like </v>

2026
01:30:29.461 --> 01:30:30.294
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's even if there's some kind </v>

2027
01:30:32.611 --> 01:30:33.444
<v Speaker 2>of physiological state you can tap into </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make that possible that some people </v>

2028
01:30:36.121 --> 01:30:40.290
<v Speaker 2>with training can do as a first time </v>
<v Speaker 2>just step in and do it.</v>

2029
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:41.850
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna he's not gonna be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2030
01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:43.710
<v Speaker 2>And I had these two clinical hypnotist </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

2031
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:46.740
<v Speaker 2>They hate actually might made a bet on </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you do it.</v>

2032
01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:48.180
<v Speaker 2>They thought he wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

2033
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.790
<v Speaker 2>And he did do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it really kind of,</v>

2034
01:30:52.110 --> 01:30:52.943
<v Speaker 2>sort of three me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was comfortable being in this ice </v>

2035
01:30:54.961 --> 01:30:55.794
<v Speaker 2>bath and see the temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had him kind of linked up to a </v>

2036
01:30:58.800 --> 01:30:59.970
<v Speaker 2>thermograph thing.</v>

2037
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.700
<v Speaker 2>We had to pull him out if he was at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain temperature.</v>

2038
01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:04.530
<v Speaker 2>I think if it got to whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>

2039
01:31:04.531 --> 01:31:06.300
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means we had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had to take him out.</v>

2040
01:31:06.810 --> 01:31:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2041
01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:10.950
<v Speaker 2>and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was extraordinary.</v>

2042
01:31:10.951 --> 01:31:13.830
<v Speaker 2>So although I think of it in very </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral terms,</v>

2043
01:31:13.831 --> 01:31:15.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't think of it as any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>

2044
01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:17.400
<v Speaker 2>We had state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's like,</v>

2045
01:31:17.401 --> 01:31:18.090
<v Speaker 2>well then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>

2046
01:31:18.090 --> 01:31:21.410
<v Speaker 2>what was going on with that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>

2047
01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:22.393
<v Speaker 2>it's a physiological possibility that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do that because somebody can do it </v>

2048
01:31:24.841 --> 01:31:25.674
<v Speaker 2>through lots of training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it just kind of with this guy </v>

2049
01:31:27.331 --> 01:31:30.060
<v Speaker 2>cut to the chase and he was able to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

2050
01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:32.640
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know what the next guy do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2051
01:31:32.970 --> 01:31:33.721
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2052
01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:36.830
<v Speaker 2>What about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ethical</v>

2053
01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:41.960
<v Speaker 1>complications that are involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a guy literally performed murder?</v>

2054
01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:43.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't,</v>

2055
01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:46.020
<v Speaker 1>he's not actually do because it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>actor.</v>

2056
01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:49.140
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know that he's not performing</v>

2057
01:31:49.141 --> 01:31:49.974
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks he's a murderer and then you </v>

2058
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:56.260
<v Speaker 1>put it on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2059
01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.900
<v Speaker 1>You have a murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2060
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 1>he's a murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a,</v>

2061
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:04.840
<v Speaker 2>there's a good kid that's a show where </v>
<v Speaker 2>he is being like completely conditioned,</v>

2062
01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:06.130
<v Speaker 2>but that's terrifying</v>

2063
01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:07.273
<v Speaker 1>that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is possible and they'd be to this </v>

2064
01:32:09.081 --> 01:32:11.330
<v Speaker 1>person that has never experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that before.</v>

2065
01:32:11.331 --> 01:32:12.164
<v Speaker 1>Finds out that it's possible for him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he actually squeezes the trigger </v>

2066
01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.110
<v Speaker 1>and watch a Stephen Fry fall to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

2067
01:32:18.111 --> 01:32:20.390
<v Speaker 1>The squibs go off and he thinks he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>

2068
01:32:20.570 --> 01:32:21.403
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you follow the logic that the FBI is </v>

2069
01:32:25.011 --> 01:32:25.844
<v Speaker 1>used because the FBI has used similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>logic to talk some pretty mentally </v>

2070
01:32:30.771 --> 01:32:31.604
<v Speaker 1>challenged people into detonating fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>bumps that were purchased from the FBI </v>

2071
01:32:36.231 --> 01:32:37.064
<v Speaker 1>and those people are in jail for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a thing that happened in </v>

2072
01:32:39.981 --> 01:32:40.814
<v Speaker 1>Dallas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a young man who was very </v>

2073
01:32:43.131 --> 01:32:43.964
<v Speaker 1>suggestible and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had some serious psychological </v>

2074
01:32:47.241 --> 01:32:48.074
<v Speaker 1>problems probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was a radical and he wanted to </v>

2075
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:52.423
<v Speaker 1>become some sort of a terrorist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was al Qaeda or isis or </v>

2076
01:32:55.641 --> 01:32:56.474
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the FBI infiltrated this guy his </v>

2077
01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:00.733
<v Speaker 1>life and set him up and got him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever organization was with the </v>

2078
01:33:05.370 --> 01:33:06.203
<v Speaker 1>CIA or FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they or they organize some sort of an </v>

2079
01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:13.760
<v Speaker 1>artificial bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got this bump to him,</v>

2080
01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:14.893
<v Speaker 1>had him set up the bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then gave him this ability to </v>

2081
01:33:18.621 --> 01:33:19.454
<v Speaker 1>detonate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes to detonate it and then they </v>

2082
01:33:21.381 --> 01:33:23.330
<v Speaker 1>arrest him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was no bomb.</v>

2083
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:26.510
<v Speaker 1>The bomb didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They talked him into doing it</v>

2084
01:33:26.530 --> 01:33:28.350
<v Speaker 2>and they genuinely invested in many </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuinely good,</v>

2085
01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:31.990
<v Speaker 1>genuine jail for live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They talked him into doing it.</v>

2086
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:36.340
<v Speaker 1>They provided him with the bond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bumper didn't exist.</v>

2087
01:33:36.341 --> 01:33:40.300
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a real bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't going to kill anybody and they</v>

2088
01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:45.310
<v Speaker 1>took this person and essentially did a </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of what you did.</v>

2089
01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:46.720
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't funny.</v>

2090
01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:50.490
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't for a television show,</v>

2091
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:54.630
<v Speaker 2>but through the same intent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through this guys are different intent.</v>

2092
01:33:54.631 --> 01:33:55.750
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he might.</v>

2093
01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:58.320
<v Speaker 2>For him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intent was to kill</v>

2094
01:33:58.810 --> 01:34:03.370
<v Speaker 1>and the intent to kill Stephen Fry or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the intent to kill innocent people.</v>

2095
01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:05.740
<v Speaker 1>He was going to get with his bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>

2096
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:07.263
<v Speaker 1>There were both talked into doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No real evidence that this guy would </v>

2097
01:34:09.731 --> 01:34:12.940
<v Speaker 1>have ever done it without the FBI or CIA</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whoever the fuck else it was.</v>

2098
01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>

2099
01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:15.293
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that had ended with them stepping in </v>

2100
01:34:16.281 --> 01:34:17.420
<v Speaker 2>and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2101
01:34:17.421 --> 01:34:19.280
<v Speaker 2>we're going to stop you here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was an experiment.</v>

2102
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been conditioned to do this.</v>

2103
01:34:20.991 --> 01:34:21.824
<v Speaker 2>We wanted to see if you would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have done it and now he is a very </v>

2104
01:34:23.961 --> 01:34:26.150
<v Speaker 2>careful and delicate dad thing to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure you're okay.</v>

2105
01:34:26.151 --> 01:34:26.984
<v Speaker 2>That would be a different story and </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow the ends would then it would be </v>

2106
01:34:29.241 --> 01:34:33.860
<v Speaker 2>like a maybe even a fascinating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable thing to do if,</v>

2107
01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:37.640
<v Speaker 2>if the guy was fine at the end of it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy with it and it wasn't in jail,</v>

2108
01:34:38.370 --> 01:34:39.203
<v Speaker 2>well that's kind of more of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're in here and I'm not making a </v>

2109
01:34:42.771 --> 01:34:45.530
<v Speaker 2>judgment on what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what you're doing is awesome,</v>

2110
01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:46.960
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fair.</v>

2111
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:51.990
<v Speaker 2>I think what they did is kind of fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and not just fucked up but crazy that</v>

2112
01:34:52.041 --> 01:34:55.220
<v Speaker 2>this is a waste of resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2113
01:34:55.221 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this person on that path.</v>

2114
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:58.813
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they recognized it and they stepped </v>

2115
01:35:00.141 --> 01:35:00.531
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

2116
01:35:00.531 --> 01:35:01.364
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is going to do something and </v>

2117
01:35:02.781 --> 01:35:05.750
<v Speaker 1>we're going to help him because we need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get this guy off the streets,</v>

2118
01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:09.830
<v Speaker 1>so let's show that he's capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>detonating a bomb and killing a bunch of</v>

2119
01:35:09.831 --> 01:35:12.500
<v Speaker 1>civilians and will provide him with </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever he needs.</v>

2120
01:35:12.501 --> 01:35:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll get them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they did it that way.</v>

2121
01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:15.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really.</v>

2122
01:35:15.681 --> 01:35:16.514
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I wasn't there when all this </v>

2123
01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:20.720
<v Speaker 1>was going down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems eerily parallel.</v>

2124
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:23.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2125
01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:24.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

2126
01:35:24.650 --> 01:35:25.483
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my concern is I guess what makes </v>

2127
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:29.600
<v Speaker 2>hopefully what makes this shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>compelling,</v>

2128
01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:30.473
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of implications beyond a </v>

2129
01:35:33.351 --> 01:35:35.690
<v Speaker 2>controlled thing with one guy who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

2130
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.823
<v Speaker 1>Also it opens the door to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility that this has been done in </v>

2131
01:35:39.021 --> 01:35:42.290
<v Speaker 1>the past was Manchurian candidate </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

2132
01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:43.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2133
01:35:43.671 --> 01:35:44.504
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I perspective you must think it's </v>

2134
01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:48.590
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2135
01:35:49.450 --> 01:35:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I often making that show I sort of felt,</v>

2136
01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:53.120
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that work,</v>

2137
01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.810
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean that his story is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2138
01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:58.510
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really necessarily have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>relate to that at all,</v>

2139
01:35:58.511 --> 01:35:59.344
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2140
01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:01.240
<v Speaker 1>But you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of,</v>

2141
01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:03.430
<v Speaker 1>it kind of works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It worked,</v>

2142
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:04.423
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you write a book about </v>

2143
01:36:08.111 --> 01:36:08.944
<v Speaker 1>happiness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a book about happiness because </v>

2144
01:36:10.601 --> 01:36:11.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2145
01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:13.210
<v Speaker 2>that makes it really resonated with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2146
01:36:13.211 --> 01:36:14.710
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2147
01:36:15.010 --> 01:36:17.650
<v Speaker 2>I studied law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was supposed to be a lawyer and I uh,</v>

2148
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:21.520
<v Speaker 2>graduated and I kind of was living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bristol,</v>

2149
01:36:21.521 --> 01:36:22.354
<v Speaker 2>this lovely city in England and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>making my living as a magician because </v>

2150
01:36:24.851 --> 01:36:25.684
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't the hobby that I had started</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was just kind of thinking what I </v>

2151
01:36:29.171 --> 01:36:32.320
<v Speaker 2>need to some point with this grow into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

2152
01:36:32.321 --> 01:36:33.154
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know that my priorities are just </v>

2153
01:36:34.541 --> 01:36:37.060
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my life.</v>

2154
01:36:37.061 --> 01:36:40.720
<v Speaker 2>My Dad used to feel like this is good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's in the right place and this</v>

2155
01:36:40.721 --> 01:36:44.130
<v Speaker 2>is kind of an enjoyable and worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 2>pastime and,</v>

2156
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:47.500
<v Speaker 2>or worthwhile existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I never really thought beyond that.</v>

2157
01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:49.720
<v Speaker 2>So I've never had any kind of ambition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genuinely have any,</v>

2158
01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:51.190
<v Speaker 2>any salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why,</v>

2159
01:36:51.191 --> 01:36:52.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really,</v>

2160
01:36:52.391 --> 01:36:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a whole goal setting thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly.</v>

2161
01:36:54.370 --> 01:36:55.203
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the trouble with thinking like that </v>

2162
01:36:57.101 --> 01:36:57.934
<v Speaker 2>as you grow up and become successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>with what you do is you start to feel </v>

2163
01:37:01.661 --> 01:37:02.494
<v Speaker 2>like a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everyone else is a grownup and </v>

2164
01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:04.953
<v Speaker 2>you're the kid and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and slightly embarrassed that you don't </v>

2165
01:37:07.451 --> 01:37:10.420
<v Speaker 2>seem to care enough about the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody else cares about.</v>

2166
01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:13.020
<v Speaker 2>The businessy things and the viewing </v>
<v Speaker 2>figures into this,</v>

2167
01:37:13.021 --> 01:37:13.854
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my interest was genuinely am I enjoying </v>

2168
01:37:15.881 --> 01:37:16.714
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing and is it worthwhile?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I read the stoics and although </v>

2169
01:37:18.251 --> 01:37:21.130
<v Speaker 2>that's not like the central message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a big part of their,</v>

2170
01:37:21.131 --> 01:37:22.090
<v Speaker 2>what they write about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2171
01:37:22.091 --> 01:37:22.924
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not trying to control things that are </v>

2172
01:37:25.591 --> 01:37:26.424
<v Speaker 2>out of your control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not attaching yourself to things that </v>

2173
01:37:27.941 --> 01:37:31.510
<v Speaker 2>leave you kind of emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable.</v>

2174
01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2175
01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.500
<v Speaker 2>just your relationship with the present </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment and so on.</v>

2176
01:37:35.501 --> 01:37:37.120
<v Speaker 2>And it really resonated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

2177
01:37:37.150 --> 01:37:39.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read it,</v>

2178
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I read a lot and it took me off into </v>
<v Speaker 2>other directions that I started writing.</v>

2179
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:46.870
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote this book on happiness after</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took me three years to write it while</v>

2180
01:37:46.871 --> 01:37:50.200
<v Speaker 2>I was on tour for three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But blocks of blocks of writing,</v>

2181
01:37:50.201 --> 01:37:52.970
<v Speaker 2>not like three solid years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also,</v>

2182
01:37:52.971 --> 01:37:56.580
<v Speaker 2>that meant by the end of it I kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>had and changed and felt differently and</v>

2183
01:37:56.581 --> 01:37:57.414
<v Speaker 2>I think for anyone that knows about </v>
<v Speaker 2>stoicism and it's so immensely valuable </v>

2184
01:38:00.781 --> 01:38:05.340
<v Speaker 2>resource in terms of if what you want is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sense of feeling centered in a kind of</v>

2185
01:38:05.341 --> 01:38:08.220
<v Speaker 2>emotional robustness in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2186
01:38:08.221 --> 01:38:10.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you suffer from anxiety and so it's,</v>

2187
01:38:10.631 --> 01:38:12.120
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's phenomenal.</v>

2188
01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:13.133
<v Speaker 2>I think there where it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's slightly doesn't deliver is </v>

2189
01:38:16.381 --> 01:38:18.870
<v Speaker 2>the importance of anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about avoiding anxiety.</v>

2190
01:38:18.871 --> 01:38:21.390
<v Speaker 2>That their image of happiness was a sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of tranquility.</v>

2191
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Avoiding disturbance that actually cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbance is really important.</v>

2192
01:38:25.261 --> 01:38:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Anxiety's important in life because how </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you change?</v>

2193
01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:28.193
<v Speaker 2>How do you grow other than a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless some anxiety triggers that you </v>

2194
01:38:34.221 --> 01:38:35.850
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lets you know that something's wrong.</v>

2195
01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:38.250
<v Speaker 2>If we just look for security all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2196
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:39.840
<v Speaker 2>And I say this because I know I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2197
01:38:39.841 --> 01:38:43.050
<v Speaker 2>like this is my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my problem is that I'm too.</v>

2198
01:38:43.530 --> 01:38:46.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm very good at avoiding stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good at avoiding anxiety.</v>

2199
01:38:46.741 --> 01:38:47.640
<v Speaker 2>But the danger is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2200
01:38:47.641 --> 01:38:49.020
<v Speaker 2>am I going to grow or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2201
01:38:49.021 --> 01:38:51.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to just be too </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable.</v>

2202
01:38:51.241 --> 01:38:51.631
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2203
01:38:51.631 --> 01:38:54.000
<v Speaker 2>there's not necessarily a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2204
01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:55.351
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2205
01:38:55.351 --> 01:38:56.400
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the end of the book I was,</v>

2206
01:38:56.401 --> 01:38:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I kind of could feel the edges of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stoicism in terms of,</v>

2207
01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:04.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the importance of anxiety in a,</v>

2208
01:39:04.650 --> 01:39:06.930
<v Speaker 2>not just living to comfortably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a.</v>

2209
01:39:07.050 --> 01:39:07.871
<v Speaker 2>and that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2210
01:39:07.871 --> 01:39:08.704
<v Speaker 2>they were movers and shakers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there are people that changed the </v>

2211
01:39:09.961 --> 01:39:10.560
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2212
01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Marcus Aurelius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest philosopher,</v>

2213
01:39:14.010 --> 01:39:17.730
<v Speaker 2>king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an emperor most powerful man or ever was</v>

2214
01:39:17.731 --> 01:39:19.210
<v Speaker 2>probably ruled the earth and was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2215
01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:20.910
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2216
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:23.310
<v Speaker 2>one of the great stoics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're not like,</v>

2217
01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:24.173
<v Speaker 2>it's not a recipe for complacency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you can often sound like when you </v>

2218
01:39:26.221 --> 01:39:28.740
<v Speaker 2>talk about this kind of tranquility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>non attachment.</v>

2219
01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:29.903
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2220
01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:31.261
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2221
01:39:31.261 --> 01:39:31.800
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2222
01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:34.530
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very robust kind of language.</v>

2223
01:39:34.531 --> 01:39:38.940
<v Speaker 2>They talk about being like a rock where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the waves and lashing against you and I,</v>

2224
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:42.450
<v Speaker 2>I prefer the image of sort of don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you know Martha Nussbaum,</v>

2225
01:39:42.451 --> 01:39:45.870
<v Speaker 2>who's an American philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he writes a lot about these things,</v>

2226
01:39:45.871 --> 01:39:48.150
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she talks about being more porous,</v>

2227
01:39:48.151 --> 01:39:51.270
<v Speaker 2>like a rock that the waves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water can move through.</v>

2228
01:39:51.271 --> 01:39:53.070
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a more helpful image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a,</v>

2229
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:56.760
<v Speaker 2>that's a good way I think of stepping </v>
<v Speaker 2>out into life is if you can have a,</v>

2230
01:39:57.470 --> 01:40:00.000
<v Speaker 2>a sort of a robustness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

2231
01:40:00.001 --> 01:40:03.900
<v Speaker 2>that kind of uneasy porous relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>with what's going on that gives you that</v>

2232
01:40:03.901 --> 01:40:04.734
<v Speaker 2>easier relationship to fate and fortune </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all those things that they used to </v>

2233
01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:13.020
<v Speaker 2>honor and recognize so much more than we</v>
<v Speaker 2>do now because we don't read tragedy.</v>

2234
01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:16.170
<v Speaker 2>So we don't think in terms of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2235
01:40:16.171 --> 01:40:17.010
<v Speaker 2>It's all just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2236
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:20.880
<v Speaker 2>pride and Hubris now that they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>lessons about back then and uh,</v>

2237
01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:21.714
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2238
01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:22.891
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's a really.</v>

2239
01:40:22.891 --> 01:40:23.790
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good,</v>

2240
01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:25.500
<v Speaker 2>that's a good starting point for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote,</v>

2241
01:40:25.630 --> 01:40:26.463
<v Speaker 2>I wrote this book happy it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually just become available in </v>

2242
01:40:28.891 --> 01:40:30.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the US on Amazon.</v>

2243
01:40:30.541 --> 01:40:32.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you find it any bookshops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

2244
01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.353
<v Speaker 2>because of the like I'm to hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a broadway show next year and </v>

2245
01:40:36.781 --> 01:40:38.400
<v Speaker 2>these netflix specials and things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2246
01:40:38.401 --> 01:40:39.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it,</v>

2247
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:40.860
<v Speaker 2>it is now available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2248
01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.920
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ironically,</v>

2249
01:40:43.921 --> 01:40:46.470
<v Speaker 2>the moment I finished writing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was out giving talks on happiness,</v>

2250
01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.880
<v Speaker 2>feeling oddly sad and I couldn't work </v>
<v Speaker 2>out why.</v>

2251
01:40:48.881 --> 01:40:49.714
<v Speaker 2>And it was because this amazing three </v>
<v Speaker 2>years writing project had ended and I </v>

2252
01:40:52.201 --> 01:40:52.830
<v Speaker 2>realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2253
01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:53.663
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The importance of some kind of creative </v>

2254
01:40:56.291 --> 01:40:59.140
<v Speaker 2>pursuit or something that brings you out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of yourself is so important.</v>

2255
01:40:59.230 --> 01:40:59.960
<v Speaker 2>That's fast.</v>

2256
01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:00.793
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that in the embracing of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety of the difficulty of the task </v>

2257
01:41:05.831 --> 01:41:07.010
<v Speaker 1>and finding upon it</v>

2258
01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:09.350
<v Speaker 2>completion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you feel sad.</v>

2259
01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:11.570
<v Speaker 2>That oddly a oddly sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2260
01:41:11.630 --> 01:41:14.230
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of proof of concept that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2261
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:15.223
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with what you're saying is like in this </v>

2262
01:41:16.850 --> 01:41:17.683
<v Speaker 1>theme that you keep saying over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>again that putting yourself into </v>

2263
01:41:20.751 --> 01:41:22.250
<v Speaker 1>something bigger than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2264
01:41:22.670 --> 01:41:27.670
<v Speaker 1>something that you're attempting to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>through and that through this difficulty</v>

2265
01:41:27.741 --> 01:41:29.870
<v Speaker 1>and all the struggle and trying to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>this something you,</v>

2266
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:30.743
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gained some sort of intangible </v>

2267
01:41:32.421 --> 01:41:33.254
<v Speaker 1>benefit from them.</v>

2268
01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:36.110
<v Speaker 2>You feel like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you seem like you're some of the.</v>

2269
01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:37.233
<v Speaker 2>Seeks out those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You seem like you've always immersed </v>

2270
01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:43.570
<v Speaker 2>yourself fully and things that would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would do that.</v>

2271
01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a firm believer in the importance of</v>

2272
01:41:46.861 --> 01:41:48.870
<v Speaker 1>difficult tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2273
01:41:48.871 --> 01:41:49.704
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think seeking comfort is one of the </v>

2274
01:41:51.451 --> 01:41:55.200
<v Speaker 1>worst things a person can do in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieving overall happiness.</v>

2275
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:56.423
<v Speaker 1>I think overall happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it comes through this amazing </v>

2276
01:41:59.401 --> 01:42:04.401
<v Speaker 1>sense of wonder and the unknown and </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities and working towards things</v>

2277
01:42:07.111 --> 01:42:10.830
<v Speaker 1>with this embracing of having no idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the,</v>

2278
01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:11.753
<v Speaker 1>what the result is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No idea where this is going to go and </v>

2279
01:42:14.191 --> 01:42:16.530
<v Speaker 1>being genuinely nervous about it every </v>
<v Speaker 1>step of the way.</v>

2280
01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:18.880
<v Speaker 2>And do you find that there's normally </v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

2281
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:19.783
<v Speaker 2>having the language for something means </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it doesn't come naturally because </v>

2282
01:42:23.231 --> 01:42:24.064
<v Speaker 2>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that came entirely naturally are the </v>

2283
01:42:25.031 --> 01:42:26.560
<v Speaker 2>things I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they completely just,</v>

2284
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:27.783
<v Speaker 2>I'd always been like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't have the language because </v>

2285
01:42:28.691 --> 01:42:29.524
<v Speaker 2>they'd just be entirely unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you found this is stuff that you've </v>

2286
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:36.110
<v Speaker 2>found and then learn to articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because it does not,</v>

2287
01:42:36.370 --> 01:42:37.203
<v Speaker 2>it's not an easy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an not an intuitive thing that </v>

2288
01:42:39.371 --> 01:42:42.430
<v Speaker 2>maybe life is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is essentially difficult.</v>

2289
01:42:42.570 --> 01:42:46.030
<v Speaker 2>And these lovely happy moments we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>are wonderful,</v>

2290
01:42:46.031 --> 01:42:50.260
<v Speaker 2>but they're not the kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not the central force of life,</v>

2291
01:42:50.261 --> 01:42:51.730
<v Speaker 2>which is that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is difficult.</v>

2292
01:42:51.731 --> 01:42:53.610
<v Speaker 2>I not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you want to philosophy of life,</v>

2293
01:42:53.611 --> 01:42:56.860
<v Speaker 2>it has to work in those has to work at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the difficult moments,</v>

2294
01:42:56.861 --> 01:42:58.000
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it's not really.</v>

2295
01:42:58.001 --> 01:42:59.410
<v Speaker 2>It's not really going to support you.</v>

2296
01:42:59.470 --> 01:43:00.303
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also the attitude in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>you embrace those difficult moments and </v>

2297
01:43:02.891 --> 01:43:04.510
<v Speaker 1>how you approach them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2298
01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:05.344
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you relish them and understand that </v>

2299
01:43:07.481 --> 01:43:08.314
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be some genuine benefit</v>
<v Speaker 1>from getting through these and whether </v>

2300
01:43:12.311 --> 01:43:15.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a physical thing or a mental thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a creative thing,</v>

2301
01:43:15.581 --> 01:43:16.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as difficult,</v>

2302
01:43:17.250 --> 01:43:22.250
<v Speaker 1>like just embrace this massive struggle </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and enjoy this.</v>

2303
01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Just the puzzle of it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2304
01:43:25.341 --> 01:43:25.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2305
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:26.803
<v Speaker 1>the majesty of the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when you get through it on the </v>

2306
01:43:29.321 --> 01:43:31.930
<v Speaker 1>other end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a different level of happiness.</v>

2307
01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.090
<v Speaker 1>He had this powerful earned</v>

2308
01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:36.430
<v Speaker 2>because she's grown and grown and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

2309
01:43:36.431 --> 01:43:38.480
<v Speaker 2>you've moved forward and you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

2310
01:43:38.770 --> 01:43:39.603
<v Speaker 2>you don't cross the road on your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>without having to let go of your </v>

2311
01:43:41.881 --> 01:43:44.290
<v Speaker 2>mother's hand at some point something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2312
01:43:44.291 --> 01:43:46.710
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the death and resurrection,</v>

2313
01:43:46.711 --> 01:43:47.544
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why these myths do have some </v>

2314
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:50.380
<v Speaker 2>resonance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2315
01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:53.750
<v Speaker 2>something has die before something new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before something you can grow.</v>

2316
01:43:53.751 --> 01:43:54.584
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something has to be let go of in order </v>

2317
01:43:56.391 --> 01:43:58.340
<v Speaker 2>to step forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going to grow,</v>

2318
01:43:58.341 --> 01:43:59.174
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has to be anxiety and disturbance </v>

2319
01:44:01.881 --> 01:44:05.750
<v Speaker 2>and some kind of some sort of death in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the metaphorical sense.</v>

2320
01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's tough.</v>

2321
01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:08.510
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't come easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2322
01:44:08.530 --> 01:44:09.363
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't come easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's also what's beautiful about </v>

2323
01:44:11.081 --> 01:44:12.130
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it just came easily,</v>

2324
01:44:12.131 --> 01:44:13.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would be appreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2325
01:44:14.250 --> 01:44:15.083
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be doing it and there's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this resistance to even engage in it in </v>

2326
01:44:17.621 --> 01:44:18.391
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2327
01:44:18.391 --> 01:44:20.350
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to write the first word of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

2328
01:44:20.690 --> 01:44:21.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first word.</v>

2329
01:44:21.911 --> 01:44:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you just sit in there or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything you're trying to do,</v>

2330
01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:26.920
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first step of a 10 mile run.</v>

2331
01:44:27.190 --> 01:44:28.840
<v Speaker 1>All those things are the most difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2332
01:44:28.841 --> 01:44:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Once you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you're going,</v>

2333
01:44:29.921 --> 01:44:32.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not nearly as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting going.</v>

2334
01:44:32.351 --> 01:44:33.184
<v Speaker 1>There's something about overcoming all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this anticipation and all the weirdness </v>

2335
01:44:37.661 --> 01:44:38.770
<v Speaker 1>of it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2336
01:44:38.771 --> 01:44:41.770
<v Speaker 1>and then once you do it and you realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it,</v>

2337
01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:44.470
<v Speaker 1>it enriches you in all your future </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts.</v>

2338
01:44:44.890 --> 01:44:45.723
<v Speaker 1>So something like you deciding to run a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon would help you decide to write </v>

2339
01:44:49.661 --> 01:44:50.494
<v Speaker 1>a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all these different things are </v>

2340
01:44:51.641 --> 01:44:53.620
<v Speaker 1>interconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The poet,</v>

2341
01:44:53.670 --> 01:44:56.230
<v Speaker 1>a real random area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real cut talks about him</v>

2342
01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:59.120
<v Speaker 2>was loved this image of like some people</v>
<v Speaker 2>live in a big room,</v>

2343
01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:00.553
<v Speaker 2>some people live in a small room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some people just like just pace up and </v>

2344
01:45:02.331 --> 01:45:04.490
<v Speaker 2>down by the window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of write that.</v>

2345
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:05.833
<v Speaker 2>Although I do a lot with my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think instinctively I'm the guy </v>

2346
01:45:08.031 --> 01:45:09.920
<v Speaker 2>that's just sort of pacing up and down </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the window.</v>

2347
01:45:10.450 --> 01:45:15.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm instinctively how so in that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little shy and I kind of.</v>

2348
01:45:15.651 --> 01:45:18.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm very good at avoiding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think you're smart.</v>

2349
01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:20.500
<v Speaker 2>To avoid</v>

2350
01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:23.860
<v Speaker 1>no shy is a lot of it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2351
01:45:23.861 --> 01:45:24.694
<v Speaker 1>the interaction between human beings is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so who knows what the fuck's going to </v>

2352
01:45:28.061 --> 01:45:28.900
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2353
01:45:28.901 --> 01:45:29.341
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2354
01:45:29.341 --> 01:45:31.120
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive you.</v>

2355
01:45:31.121 --> 01:45:31.954
<v Speaker 1>There's potential bad feelings that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could come with that is there's all </v>

2356
01:45:35.441 --> 01:45:36.274
<v Speaker 1>sorts of weird social anxiety and social</v>
<v Speaker 1>cues that you have to read and the </v>

2357
01:45:38.921 --> 01:45:40.840
<v Speaker 1>complications of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you get it right.</v>

2358
01:45:41.050 --> 01:45:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to get it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to be too rude,</v>

2359
01:45:43.001 --> 01:45:45.090
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be too forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to be too shy.</v>

2360
01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Ramped up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>

2361
01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the case with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

2362
01:45:51.971 --> 01:45:52.804
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason for shyness is there's a </v>

2363
01:45:54.701 --> 01:45:57.140
<v Speaker 1>terrible feeling when you're rejected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2364
01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:00.690
<v Speaker 1>the meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who doesn't enjoy the way you've</v>

2365
01:46:00.691 --> 01:46:01.524
<v Speaker 1>presented yourself as an awful feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will haunt you for hours if not </v>

2366
01:46:04.871 --> 01:46:05.704
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three in the morning I've had </v>

2367
01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:08.373
<v Speaker 1>interactions with people and then two </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks later I'll be putting gas in my </v>

2368
01:46:11.411 --> 01:46:12.244
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go,</v>

2369
01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:15.190
<v Speaker 1>what did I say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did I say it like that?</v>

2370
01:46:15.191 --> 01:46:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

2371
01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:16.713
<v Speaker 1>Like that's all of that is there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why people have some sort of a </v>

2372
01:46:21.881 --> 01:46:23.560
<v Speaker 1>weird anxiety about interactions.</v>

2373
01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:24.653
<v Speaker 2>Also the stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why that the difficulty is so </v>

2374
01:46:27.591 --> 01:46:31.220
<v Speaker 2>worth embracing because if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can,</v>

2375
01:46:31.730 --> 01:46:32.563
<v Speaker 2>if you can embrace it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where there is a kind of oddly </v>

2376
01:46:36.231 --> 01:46:38.930
<v Speaker 2>sublime space because that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2377
01:46:38.931 --> 01:46:39.764
<v Speaker 2>that's the real stuff of life and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that actually binds everyone </v>

2378
01:46:42.141 --> 01:46:44.360
<v Speaker 2>together and that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2379
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:46.630
<v Speaker 2>the happy moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2380
01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:48.500
<v Speaker 2>they might just be happy because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2381
01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:52.030
<v Speaker 2>she's great and wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you might just,</v>

2382
01:46:52.110 --> 01:46:54.030
<v Speaker 2>you just haven't got all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got all the information at that point,</v>

2383
01:46:54.031 --> 01:46:55.440
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of what's going on.</v>

2384
01:46:55.441 --> 01:46:57.410
<v Speaker 2>So those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we,</v>

2385
01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:00.060
<v Speaker 2>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're embroiled in the difficulty,</v>

2386
01:47:00.061 --> 01:47:00.894
<v Speaker 2>I think that's when we're most human and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't necessarily make it any </v>

2387
01:47:03.181 --> 01:47:05.850
<v Speaker 2>easier by its nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a real value to that.</v>

2388
01:47:05.851 --> 01:47:06.684
<v Speaker 2>There's a level of growth and a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of just a voice somewhere in the </v>

2389
01:47:13.231 --> 01:47:17.360
<v Speaker 2>background that these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or just as a note of this,</v>

2390
01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:19.710
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what binds everyone together.</v>

2391
01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:21.600
<v Speaker 2>And I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

2392
01:47:21.630 --> 01:47:25.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a better type of happiness,</v>

2393
01:47:25.111 --> 01:47:26.370
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't come easy.</v>

2394
01:47:26.371 --> 01:47:30.090
<v Speaker 2>But I think life is about growing up is </v>
<v Speaker 2>about tolerating ambiguity,</v>

2395
01:47:30.091 --> 01:47:33.960
<v Speaker 2>isn't it more than more than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we're infants we scream and someone</v>

2396
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:36.900
<v Speaker 2>comes in and gives us the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes us feel good.</v>

2397
01:47:37.230 --> 01:47:38.063
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a British and a child </v>

2398
01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:45.120
<v Speaker 2>psychologist called a Donald Winnicott,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's sort of,</v>

2399
01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:47.640
<v Speaker 2>kind of appeared after Freud and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>

2400
01:47:47.641 --> 01:47:48.474
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of people felt so guilty</v>
<v Speaker 2>and terrible after Freud was damaging </v>

2401
01:47:52.621 --> 01:47:54.360
<v Speaker 2>the kids and he had this great message </v>
<v Speaker 2>of light.</v>

2402
01:47:54.361 --> 01:47:55.194
<v Speaker 2>You've actually what the mother or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>principal caregiver needs to be as good </v>

2403
01:47:58.951 --> 01:47:59.784
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What she actually needs to do is to </v>

2404
01:48:00.541 --> 01:48:03.300
<v Speaker 2>gently let down her infant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2405
01:48:03.570 --> 01:48:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2406
01:48:05.730 --> 01:48:06.563
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just grow up thinking that every </v>

2407
01:48:09.511 --> 01:48:10.344
<v Speaker 2>time you screamed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to give you what you </v>

2408
01:48:11.011 --> 01:48:11.250
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

2409
01:48:11.250 --> 01:48:13.950
<v Speaker 2>If you make enough fuss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just get what you want.</v>

2410
01:48:14.370 --> 01:48:19.370
<v Speaker 2>That's not a very healthy way of growing</v>
<v Speaker 2>up into adult life or becoming a leader.</v>

2411
01:48:20.010 --> 01:48:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so instead what the,</v>

2412
01:48:23.130 --> 01:48:25.260
<v Speaker 2>what your mother caregiver needs to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to,</v>

2413
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:27.960
<v Speaker 2>is to let you down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that needs to disillusion.</v>

2414
01:48:27.961 --> 01:48:30.450
<v Speaker 2>You need to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I scream and I won't get those</v>

2415
01:48:30.451 --> 01:48:31.560
<v Speaker 2>things and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>

2416
01:48:31.561 --> 01:48:32.730
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2417
01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:35.010
<v Speaker 2>so likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2418
01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:36.293
<v Speaker 2>in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like living with disillusionment is </v>

2419
01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:39.780
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2420
01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:41.670
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

2421
01:48:41.671 --> 01:48:43.230
<v Speaker 2>That's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we don't have that,</v>

2422
01:48:43.231 --> 01:48:47.220
<v Speaker 2>if we live out this sort of fantasy that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we owed,</v>

2423
01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:50.010
<v Speaker 2>we're owed something should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why load,</v>

2424
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.903
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the secret that I did at </v>

2425
01:48:51.690 --> 01:48:56.390
<v Speaker 2>universities arranging itself around our</v>
<v Speaker 2>banal hocking wishes or,</v>

2426
01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:59.400
<v Speaker 2>and it's always like actresses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

2427
01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:02.520
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that she sort of says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2428
01:49:02.521 --> 01:49:04.540
<v Speaker 2>this all goes back to Plato.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2429
01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:06.653
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't have been any any further </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the idea of a wandering all these </v>

2430
01:49:11.911 --> 01:49:13.130
<v Speaker 2>kinds of material gains.</v>

2431
01:49:13.370 --> 01:49:17.750
<v Speaker 1>So it's fascinating how this subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>repeats itself in some sort of a strange</v>

2432
01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:18.613
<v Speaker 1>intermittent cycle where people start </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about manifesting things with </v>

2433
01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:25.580
<v Speaker 1>your mind and put it in La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's a thing.</v>

2434
01:49:25.610 --> 01:49:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's recently,</v>

2435
01:49:26.781 --> 01:49:29.890
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be working its way back </v>
<v Speaker 1>around again where it was.</v>

2436
01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:34.400
<v Speaker 1>It was outside of the conversation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a long time.</v>

2437
01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:35.234
<v Speaker 1>But now it seems to be coming back again</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are always looking for </v>

2438
01:49:37.521 --> 01:49:40.280
<v Speaker 1>reasons why certain people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

2439
01:49:40.650 --> 01:49:42.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big one is this,</v>

2440
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:47.470
<v Speaker 1>this idea that people can manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>things with their mind and you know,</v>

2441
01:49:47.471 --> 01:49:48.304
<v Speaker 1>when it comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again discussing this with people who </v>

2442
01:49:50.701 --> 01:49:51.534
<v Speaker 1>have become successful and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for a reason as to why they're </v>

2443
01:49:54.641 --> 01:49:55.420
<v Speaker 1>successful</v>

2444
01:49:55.420 --> 01:50:00.420
<v Speaker 2>and it's very hard to accredit luck </v>
<v Speaker 2>would show it's in their success.</v>

2445
01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:04.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's an element analysis,</v>

2446
01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:06.880
<v Speaker 2>the whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the secret thing</v>

2447
01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:08.303
<v Speaker 1>and element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of positive thinking is an </v>

2448
01:50:11.281 --> 01:50:13.650
<v Speaker 1>element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these things are elements,</v>

2449
01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:16.410
<v Speaker 1>but they're all combined with </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance,</v>

2450
01:50:16.411 --> 01:50:17.670
<v Speaker 1>luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics,</v>

2451
01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:22.320
<v Speaker 1>cultural interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way human beings,</v>

2452
01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:25.530
<v Speaker 1>they're just the time of the year you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were born.</v>

2453
01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:28.170
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different factors.</v>

2454
01:50:28.171 --> 01:50:30.280
<v Speaker 1>There's so many things that can lead to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2455
01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:32.890
<v Speaker 1>and also where you're born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you do where,</v>

2456
01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:33.813
<v Speaker 1>where are you living?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all these things have a huge </v>

2457
01:50:36.091 --> 01:50:39.900
<v Speaker 1>factor in your success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try being a entrepreneur in Ethiopia.</v>

2458
01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different experience than being,</v>

2459
01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:42.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2460
01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:45.780
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tech startup guy in San Francisco.</v>

2461
01:50:45.781 --> 01:50:46.614
<v Speaker 1>It's clearly one of them has an </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage and there's a lot of those </v>

2462
01:50:50.431 --> 01:50:52.200
<v Speaker 1>things that play into each other and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2463
01:50:52.201 --> 01:50:53.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2464
01:50:53.071 --> 01:50:53.904
<v Speaker 1>the guy in Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just wasn't thinking about it the </v>

2465
01:50:55.861 --> 01:50:56.694
<v Speaker 1>right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>

2466
01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:57.593
<v Speaker 1>he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't make a wish board and put his </v>

2467
01:50:59.821 --> 01:51:01.110
<v Speaker 1>pictures of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2468
01:51:01.470 --> 01:51:03.640
<v Speaker 1>his house was Ferrari in front of it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2469
01:51:03.690 --> 01:51:05.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck is trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2470
01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:07.710
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the infant's urge.</v>

2471
01:51:07.770 --> 01:51:08.603
<v Speaker 2>It's screaming into the and the universe</v>
<v Speaker 2>will provide if there's some way that </v>

2472
01:51:12.571 --> 01:51:13.404
<v Speaker 2>the universe doesn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that should be our starting point of </v>

2473
01:51:16.230 --> 01:51:18.540
<v Speaker 2>living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but surely the universe doesn't care.</v>

2474
01:51:18.690 --> 01:51:21.570
<v Speaker 1>What's the perspective enhancer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The universe in,</v>

2475
01:51:21.610 --> 01:51:23.770
<v Speaker 1>in and of itself is a prospective </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancer minutes.</v>

2476
01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:26.850
<v Speaker 1>If you can go somewhere in the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's no light pollution and see</v>

2477
01:51:26.851 --> 01:51:29.340
<v Speaker 1>the Milky Way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get this.</v>

2478
01:51:29.550 --> 01:51:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2479
01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a lot bigger than I'm thinking.</v>

2480
01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:35.213
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of the real problems </v>

2481
01:51:36.271 --> 01:51:41.271
<v Speaker 1>that we have with our society with </v>
<v Speaker 1>electrical lights that sort of blind out</v>

2482
01:51:41.491 --> 01:51:42.324
<v Speaker 1>the stars.</v>

2483
01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:46.410
<v Speaker 2>We don't get humbled that the book I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned spell of the sensuous.</v>

2484
01:51:46.411 --> 01:51:47.330
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David Abrams,</v>

2485
01:51:47.331 --> 01:51:51.510
<v Speaker 2>who was out living in rural East Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he described at the very beginning,</v>

2486
01:51:51.511 --> 01:51:52.344
<v Speaker 2>this amazing image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was living in this hot and it was </v>

2487
01:51:54.601 --> 01:51:56.280
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wakes up in the middle of the night.</v>

2488
01:51:56.281 --> 01:51:57.114
<v Speaker 2>There's any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of,</v>

2489
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:58.103
<v Speaker 2>I guess being there for a night or two </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's in this patty field which has </v>

2490
01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:05.310
<v Speaker 2>become drenched with water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with rain.</v>

2491
01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:11.420
<v Speaker 2>He steps out and you have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible star filled clear sky,</v>

2492
01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:17.730
<v Speaker 2>which is reflected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pitch black apart from that,</v>

2493
01:52:17.731 --> 01:52:19.170
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a star filled sky.</v>

2494
01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:20.153
<v Speaker 2>It's reflected perfect like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a mirror in this drenched enormous </v>

2495
01:52:23.311 --> 01:52:27.300
<v Speaker 2>battlefield that is this fireflies </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere in between.</v>

2496
01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Flying around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2497
01:52:28.711 --> 01:52:32.880
<v Speaker 2>These little little specks of light and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had no sense of like what was up,</v>

2498
01:52:32.881 --> 01:52:35.160
<v Speaker 2>what was down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which had totally disoriented.</v>

2499
01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:37.470
<v Speaker 2>This feeling of just falling through </v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

2500
01:52:37.471 --> 01:52:39.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a great opening to the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2501
01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:42.720
<v Speaker 2>We don't get a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't get along.</v>

2502
01:52:43.210 --> 01:52:45.010
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We missed that part.</v>

2503
01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Galactic part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really do.</v>

2504
01:52:48.110 --> 01:52:48.943
<v Speaker 1>It's so unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I'm out in the country and I </v>

2505
01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:52.040
<v Speaker 1>look up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it.</v>

2506
01:52:52.041 --> 01:52:53.280
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2507
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I was in Utah a couple of months ago and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2508
01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:01.460
<v Speaker 1>we were way in the mountains and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no light,</v>

2509
01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:03.080
<v Speaker 1>just nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you look up.</v>

2510
01:53:03.081 --> 01:53:08.081
<v Speaker 1>It's just Phil Stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every inch of the sky had stars on it.</v>

2511
01:53:08.770 --> 01:53:10.010
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2512
01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:15.580
<v Speaker 1>It's so humbling and I think it's such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful image for human beings and it's</v>

2513
01:53:16.161 --> 01:53:16.994
<v Speaker 1>inspired so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much pondering throughout human </v>

2514
01:53:20.511 --> 01:53:21.344
<v Speaker 1>history and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much philosophy and so much so much </v>

2515
01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:30.220
<v Speaker 1>of the way people interpret our position</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the universe is based on this image,</v>

2516
01:53:30.921 --> 01:53:31.754
<v Speaker 1>this undeniable image of the cosmos that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so magnificent and yet in our </v>

2517
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:43.760
<v Speaker 1>amazing technological society that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>created,</v>

2518
01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:47.180
<v Speaker 1>we have a side effect and that side </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect is light pollution.</v>

2519
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:52.280
<v Speaker 1>That light pollution has shut off one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most magnificent inspirations that's</v>

2520
01:53:52.281 --> 01:53:55.670
<v Speaker 1>available in the natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's available to us every night.</v>

2521
01:53:56.240 --> 01:53:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we block it out with fucking seven slash</v>

2522
01:53:58.911 --> 01:53:59.900
<v Speaker 1>11 lights and</v>

2523
01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:03.420
<v Speaker 2>and that in touch with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just,</v>

2524
01:54:03.450 --> 01:54:04.283
<v Speaker 2>not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the wider sense of the that the </v>

2525
01:54:07.950 --> 01:54:10.680
<v Speaker 2>mystery that is represented by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2526
01:54:10.681 --> 01:54:12.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know everything I'd done </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I know.</v>

2527
01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Then sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we have?</v>

2528
01:54:14.821 --> 01:54:19.380
<v Speaker 2>We have people like me have magicians </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing tricks and psychic mediums.</v>

2529
01:54:19.381 --> 01:54:21.810
<v Speaker 2>We're tending to connect with the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like our,</v>

2530
01:54:21.930 --> 01:54:26.490
<v Speaker 2>our tawdry onset to the providing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of mystery there.</v>

2531
01:54:26.491 --> 01:54:28.350
<v Speaker 2>Just hustlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's horrendous.</v>

2532
01:54:28.351 --> 01:54:33.180
<v Speaker 2>I sat in a studio audience wants and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching a psychic.</v>

2533
01:54:33.210 --> 01:54:35.910
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those TV filmed ones where</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2534
01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.990
<v Speaker 2>where there's an audience was just like </v>
<v Speaker 2>said before filming starts.</v>

2535
01:54:39.991 --> 01:54:42.270
<v Speaker 2>He came out and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so is there anybody here that's hoping,</v>

2536
01:54:42.271 --> 01:54:43.104
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping that someone's going to come </v>

2537
01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:46.710
<v Speaker 2>through and all these hands go up and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>just asked people,</v>

2538
01:54:46.730 --> 01:54:49.140
<v Speaker 2>so what are you hoping will come </v>
<v Speaker 2>through?</v>

2539
01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they look like?</v>

2540
01:54:50.041 --> 01:54:50.874
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'll let you know if they come </v>

2541
01:54:52.201 --> 01:54:53.190
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything I can ask?</v>

2542
01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:54.053
<v Speaker 2>Any bit of information they could give </v>
<v Speaker 2>me that nobody could possibly know that </v>

2543
01:54:55.981 --> 01:54:57.600
<v Speaker 2>will prove to you it's them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2544
01:54:57.601 --> 01:54:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2545
01:54:58.320 --> 01:54:59.940
<v Speaker 2>he drowned and he was wearing a red </v>
<v Speaker 2>sweater.</v>

2546
01:54:59.941 --> 01:55:00.774
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'll let you know if he comes </v>

2547
01:55:01.291 --> 01:55:02.124
<v Speaker 2>through and then they start filming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he just says all those things to them </v>

2548
01:55:03.991 --> 01:55:04.824
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about the reason why that stuff </v>

2549
01:55:06.811 --> 01:55:09.930
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like people do believe it is that the</v>

2550
01:55:09.931 --> 01:55:10.764
<v Speaker 2>lie is so ugly that it's so much easier </v>
<v Speaker 2>to believe something amazing must be </v>

2551
01:55:15.481 --> 01:55:17.460
<v Speaker 2>going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then just is it,</v>

2552
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.340
<v Speaker 2>is it just that ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>empathetic ally?</v>

2553
01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:21.800
<v Speaker 2>It's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was such a,</v>

2554
01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:24.540
<v Speaker 2>it was such a horrible experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many of them them.</v>

2555
01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:25.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have a television shows </v>

2556
01:55:27.730 --> 01:55:28.563
<v Speaker 1>where there was a medium television show</v>
<v Speaker 1>where this woman was connecting people </v>

2557
01:55:32.091 --> 01:55:35.000
<v Speaker 1>with their dead relatives and it was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake.</v>

2558
01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:35.970
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2559
01:55:35.970 --> 01:55:39.800
<v Speaker 1>the questions were shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so poorly thought out.</v>

2560
01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:43.860
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just a lie was a live vitally </v>
<v Speaker 1>moron.</v>

2561
01:55:44.490 --> 01:55:45.600
<v Speaker 2>That's a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the it.</v>

2562
01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

2563
01:55:46.591 --> 01:55:47.424
<v Speaker 2>I in one of my shows I had um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got like 50 people up on stage had </v>

2564
01:55:50.521 --> 01:55:51.354
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an audience thing set up on stage </v>

2565
01:55:52.501 --> 01:55:53.334
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing medium shit with them and </v>

2566
01:55:55.290 --> 01:55:58.140
<v Speaker 2>providing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like very accurate information.</v>

2567
01:55:58.141 --> 01:55:59.880
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

2568
01:55:59.881 --> 01:56:00.714
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm lying,</v>

2569
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:01.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll,</v>

2570
01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:04.440
<v Speaker 2>your grandmother's telling me what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not telling me anything.</v>

2571
01:56:04.441 --> 01:56:05.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm making this up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you understand?</v>

2572
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.980
<v Speaker 2>And then after the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's got to be.</v>

2573
01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:09.580
<v Speaker 2>It was an interesting kind of like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2574
01:56:09.610 --> 01:56:10.081
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2575
01:56:10.081 --> 01:56:10.914
<v Speaker 2>And then afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the first night of doing </v>

2576
01:56:13.141 --> 01:56:13.974
<v Speaker 2>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went out the stage door and I was </v>

2577
01:56:15.151 --> 01:56:18.030
<v Speaker 2>talking to people there and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl who'd seen the show and she said,</v>

2578
01:56:18.031 --> 01:56:18.864
<v Speaker 2>will you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2579
01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:22.500
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if you could put me in touch </v>
<v Speaker 2>with my dead grandmother?</v>

2580
01:56:22.501 --> 01:56:23.100
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

2581
01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:23.933
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope you understand from what I've </v>

2582
01:56:25.381 --> 01:56:27.600
<v Speaker 2>just done that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really doing it.</v>

2583
01:56:27.601 --> 01:56:29.430
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of the point she had on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I understand,</v>

2584
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:30.743
<v Speaker 2>I know you can't Redo it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but would you be able to put me into </v>

2585
01:56:32.330 --> 01:56:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Jesus' eyes an amazing capacity for just</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of dissonance?</v>

2586
01:56:38.010 --> 01:56:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how cults work,</v>

2587
01:56:39.301 --> 01:56:40.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2588
01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:44.220
<v Speaker 1>that's the only way they can work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you get Ahold of the manuscript and</v>

2589
01:56:44.221 --> 01:56:46.590
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read whatever it was,</v>

2590
01:56:46.591 --> 01:56:49.200
<v Speaker 1>whether it's mormonism and Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 1>Campbell,</v>

2591
01:56:49.201 --> 01:56:50.034
<v Speaker 1>the 14 year old boy who found golden </v>
<v Speaker 1>tablets that contain the last work of </v>

2592
01:56:53.071 --> 01:56:53.904
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only he could read with his magic seers </v>

2593
01:56:56.161 --> 01:56:57.170
<v Speaker 1>stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

2594
01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:58.320
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2595
01:56:59.370 --> 01:57:03.900
<v Speaker 1>if you have any critical thinking left </v>
<v Speaker 1>in you at all at that point,</v>

2596
01:57:03.930 --> 01:57:05.430
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put the book down and go,</v>

2597
01:57:05.431 --> 01:57:09.210
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing with my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people don't want that.</v>

2598
01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:10.770
<v Speaker 1>They want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want the,</v>

2599
01:57:11.010 --> 01:57:11.843
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe is so open ended and the </v>

2600
01:57:13.891 --> 01:57:14.724
<v Speaker 1>possibility of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your existence expiring at any moment </v>

2601
01:57:18.721 --> 01:57:19.554
<v Speaker 1>and you just vanishing into nothingness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this consciousness which is </v>

2602
01:57:22.171 --> 01:57:25.500
<v Speaker 1>literally stopping the lights go black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>

2603
01:57:25.501 --> 01:57:30.501
<v Speaker 1>It's so terrifying to us that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would prefer some nonsensical,</v>

2604
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:35.220
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic version of something but </v>
<v Speaker 1>rigid.</v>

2605
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:38.850
<v Speaker 1>So we know how to follow it and a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of other people follow it as well.</v>

2606
01:57:38.970 --> 01:57:39.803
<v Speaker 1>And we have this community of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fall away and we gain comfort in </v>

2607
01:57:41.941 --> 01:57:43.170
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some very,</v>

2608
01:57:43.171 --> 01:57:44.130
<v Speaker 1>very strange way.</v>

2609
01:57:44.730 --> 01:57:45.563
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2610
01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:48.180
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of an for me and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected,</v>

2611
01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:49.513
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2612
01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:54.990
<v Speaker 2>comfort that comes with this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meaninglessness of it,</v>

2613
01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:57.960
<v Speaker 2>which I've sort of recently kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>found that,</v>

2614
01:57:58.290 --> 01:57:59.123
<v Speaker 2>that all of the people in your life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that like people that you </v>

2615
01:58:01.861 --> 01:58:05.010
<v Speaker 2>work with and see a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that like annoy you and end up being</v>

2616
01:58:05.011 --> 01:58:08.610
<v Speaker 2>like a cock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a constant source of niggling irritation</v>

2617
01:58:08.611 --> 01:58:09.444
<v Speaker 2>like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2618
01:58:09.450 --> 01:58:10.283
<v Speaker 2>we have people like that or people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we kind of admire or maybe you're a bit </v>

2619
01:58:12.630 --> 01:58:17.230
<v Speaker 2>intimidated by or um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like Fitch is going to be the peak.</v>

2620
01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:18.113
<v Speaker 2>They were gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gonna be the people that just </v>

2621
01:58:18.841 --> 01:58:20.640
<v Speaker 2>kind of populated your life at what </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

2622
01:58:20.910 --> 01:58:22.890
<v Speaker 2>And it will amount to no more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there'll be,</v>

2623
01:58:23.550 --> 01:58:26.490
<v Speaker 2>they'll be the people that were there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2624
01:58:27.070 --> 01:58:29.280
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to articulate,</v>

2625
01:58:29.281 --> 01:58:31.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find that like a,</v>

2626
01:58:32.890 --> 01:58:33.723
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot easier to kind of love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot easier to love when you </v>

2627
01:58:36.041 --> 01:58:37.930
<v Speaker 2>realize that it isn't the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

2628
01:58:37.931 --> 01:58:39.240
<v Speaker 2>It's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2629
01:58:39.790 --> 01:58:40.690
<v Speaker 2>none,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of that's gonna.</v>

2630
01:58:40.750 --> 01:58:41.590
<v Speaker 2>None of going to matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2631
01:58:41.591 --> 01:58:42.520
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2632
01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:44.680
<v Speaker 2>the guy that's annoying you everyday is </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

2633
01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:45.613
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was that guy that was with you all </v>

2634
01:58:47.001 --> 01:58:48.040
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of annoying,</v>

2635
01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:50.630
<v Speaker 2>but that was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these people and the puppet July.</v>

2636
01:58:50.690 --> 01:58:53.440
<v Speaker 2>I find it a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very powerful,</v>

2637
01:58:54.250 --> 01:58:57.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of just just reset in terms of sort</v>

2638
01:58:57.941 --> 01:59:02.830
<v Speaker 2>of attitudes towards people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>engender any kind of nervousness,</v>

2639
01:59:02.831 --> 01:59:04.750
<v Speaker 2>irritation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimidation,</v>

2640
01:59:04.751 --> 01:59:07.090
<v Speaker 2>any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

2641
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:08.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are just,</v>

2642
01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:10.740
<v Speaker 2>these are my sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these are,</v>

2643
01:59:10.741 --> 01:59:11.920
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are my fellow people,</v>

2644
01:59:11.921 --> 01:59:12.754
<v Speaker 2>these will be the people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these would be the characters that </v>

2645
01:59:14.681 --> 01:59:19.030
<v Speaker 2>people that populated my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's kind of a nice thing.</v>

2646
01:59:19.470 --> 01:59:21.510
<v Speaker 1>So that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it,</v>

2647
01:59:21.511 --> 01:59:23.610
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in embracing data,</v>

2648
01:59:24.030 --> 01:59:27.360
<v Speaker 1>there is no great grand meaning to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All.</v>

2649
01:59:28.170 --> 01:59:32.340
<v Speaker 2>This sort of intimidation doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

2650
01:59:32.370 --> 01:59:33.203
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their religious going through their own </v>

2651
01:59:34.740 --> 01:59:36.990
<v Speaker 2>shared as well and I'm just a character </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their lives,</v>

2652
01:59:36.991 --> 01:59:39.330
<v Speaker 2>but that's kind of Nice that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2653
01:59:39.331 --> 01:59:41.400
<v Speaker 2>this guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person was with me every day.</v>

2654
01:59:41.401 --> 01:59:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Or even that famous person that maybe I </v>
<v Speaker 2>never even met,</v>

2655
01:59:45.901 --> 01:59:46.734
<v Speaker 2>but like how weird that that was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a force within my life at that </v>

2656
01:59:49.321 --> 01:59:51.660
<v Speaker 2>person represented something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2657
01:59:51.661 --> 01:59:52.251
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

2658
01:59:52.251 --> 01:59:53.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2659
01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:56.730
<v Speaker 2>said it's just a lot easier to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>go out in the world with love,</v>

2660
01:59:56.731 --> 02:00:01.731
<v Speaker 2>which is ultimately what we need to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>and do with that thought.</v>

2661
02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:04.913
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

2662
02:00:05.110 --> 02:00:05.943
<v Speaker 1>don't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great attitude because anytime </v>

2663
02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>you can have less annoyance by a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's just,</v>

2664
02:00:14.321 --> 02:00:15.154
<v Speaker 1>whether they're ignorant or confused or </v>
<v Speaker 1>agitated or whatever's causing them to </v>

2665
02:00:21.071 --> 02:00:22.750
<v Speaker 1>behave in a way that's uncomfortable for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2666
02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:26.930
<v Speaker 1>anytime you can just sort of just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Quito that and just sorta look,</v>

2667
02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:27.813
<v Speaker 1>relax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let it roll off you and just keep </v>

2668
02:00:30.011 --> 02:00:31.420
<v Speaker 1>moving and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2669
02:00:31.450 --> 02:00:32.930
<v Speaker 1>what are you going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2670
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:37.330
<v Speaker 1>That's one less thing you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestle with in your psyche.</v>

2671
02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just,</v>

2672
02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:41.740
<v Speaker 1>that's just a recipe for emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

2673
02:00:41.741 --> 02:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

2674
02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:42.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2675
02:00:42.841 --> 02:00:43.790
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stomach are there.</v>

2676
02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:45.870
<v Speaker 2>If you could only control your thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your actions.</v>

2677
02:00:45.871 --> 02:00:46.830
<v Speaker 2>So powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2678
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:47.783
<v Speaker 2>Anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What other people do where they think </v>

2679
02:00:49.051 --> 02:00:52.340
<v Speaker 2>everything else outcomes are not under </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2680
02:00:52.410 --> 02:00:53.243
<v Speaker 2>not under your control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can decide that those things are </v>

2681
02:00:54.721 --> 02:00:59.721
<v Speaker 2>fine and that's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a like to really let that idea drop into</v>

2682
02:01:00.331 --> 02:01:01.380
<v Speaker 2>the soul that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2683
02:01:01.381 --> 02:01:02.214
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it's fine if my partner handles </v>

2684
02:01:05.070 --> 02:01:07.430
<v Speaker 2>stress battling drives me and what if </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what did,</v>

2685
02:01:07.431 --> 02:01:08.700
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

2686
02:01:08.730 --> 02:01:09.563
<v Speaker 2>Then I'd also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that allows me then to be a better </v>

2687
02:01:10.321 --> 02:01:11.154
<v Speaker 2>partner and maybe be more helpful if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>not internalizing it and making it all </v>

2688
02:01:13.861 --> 02:01:15.390
<v Speaker 2>about me and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making it,</v>

2689
02:01:15.690 --> 02:01:17.670
<v Speaker 2>making it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

2690
02:01:17.671 --> 02:01:20.730
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like a recipe for complacency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like the tennis analogy,</v>

2691
02:01:20.731 --> 02:01:21.564
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like so with success or with matters of </v>

2692
02:01:23.611 --> 02:01:25.980
<v Speaker 2>social injustice where you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I need to,</v>

2693
02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:27.173
<v Speaker 2>I need to go out and change that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is then it's like a game of </v>

2694
02:01:29.221 --> 02:01:29.610
<v Speaker 2>tennis.</v>

2695
02:01:29.610 --> 02:01:30.990
<v Speaker 2>If you go into a game of tennis </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

2696
02:01:31.410 --> 02:01:32.243
<v Speaker 2>I must win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what happens when you start to </v>

2697
02:01:35.221 --> 02:01:36.180
<v Speaker 2>lose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you become anxious.</v>

2698
02:01:36.181 --> 02:01:37.014
<v Speaker 2>You don't play as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to control something you </v>

2699
02:01:37.951 --> 02:01:38.784
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you go into that same game </v>

2700
02:01:40.431 --> 02:01:41.264
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will play to the very best of my </v>

2701
02:01:42.801 --> 02:01:44.240
<v Speaker 2>abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2702
02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:46.370
<v Speaker 2>that's on the line of your thoughts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your actions.</v>

2703
02:01:46.371 --> 02:01:48.350
<v Speaker 2>That's something under your control and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll play better.</v>

2704
02:01:48.351 --> 02:01:50.890
<v Speaker 2>You'll get better results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2705
02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:51.830
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2706
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:56.830
<v Speaker 2>that's become a big thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I get stressed about things,</v>

2707
02:01:57.051 --> 02:01:57.884
<v Speaker 2>I find that something is really niggling</v>
<v Speaker 2>away and bothering me that thought of </v>

2708
02:02:00.471 --> 02:02:01.304
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang on it's face because it's always </v>

2709
02:02:02.931 --> 02:02:03.764
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always something outside of the </v>

2710
02:02:04.641 --> 02:02:05.474
<v Speaker 2>thoughts and actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always something else and it is </v>

2711
02:02:07.461 --> 02:02:08.294
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's normally just someone else's thing </v>

2712
02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:12.560
<v Speaker 2>that is just the way they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifesting.</v>

2713
02:02:12.561 --> 02:02:14.330
<v Speaker 2>That is annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's fine.</v>

2714
02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:15.193
<v Speaker 2>It is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like when I was a kid and I </v>

2715
02:02:16.971 --> 02:02:19.700
<v Speaker 2>used to wake up on a Saturday morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>and think I had to go to school and then</v>

2716
02:02:19.701 --> 02:02:21.950
<v Speaker 2>realized I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of relief.</v>

2717
02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:25.260
<v Speaker 2>I feel as an adult so much with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

2718
02:02:25.390 --> 02:02:25.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2719
02:02:25.770 --> 02:02:26.603
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

2720
02:02:27.370 --> 02:02:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Think it's a complacency thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean the idea is that you're,</v>

2721
02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:32.920
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feared that this attitude would lead</v>

2722
02:02:32.921 --> 02:02:33.754
<v Speaker 1>to complacency?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it just leads to you picking </v>

2723
02:02:35.711 --> 02:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>your battles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Battles exactly.</v>

2724
02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Which is important was your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2725
02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>your wisely allocating resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2726
02:02:44.111 --> 02:02:44.944
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not concentrating on some shit </v>

2727
02:02:46.271 --> 02:02:48.550
<v Speaker 1>that you're not going to control anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2728
02:02:48.610 --> 02:02:50.470
<v Speaker 1>grabbing some guy you don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>

2729
02:02:50.471 --> 02:02:52.000
<v Speaker 1>you gotta straighten your fucking life </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2730
02:02:52.030 --> 02:02:53.800
<v Speaker 1>You're annoying and this is why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

2731
02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:58.000
<v Speaker 1>that guy's not going to listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an ineffective way to interact</v>

2732
02:02:58.001 --> 02:02:58.834
<v Speaker 1>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're way better off going with this </v>

2733
02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>fucking guy and just keep moving so </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself out sort myself out.</v>

2734
02:03:04.931 --> 02:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>And your reaction to him is the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you could really control.</v>

2735
02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:09.933
<v Speaker 1>Certainly can't control him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can control your reaction to </v>

2736
02:03:12.791 --> 02:03:13.624
<v Speaker 1>them and there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of pride in </v>

2737
02:03:15.490 --> 02:03:16.323
<v Speaker 1>just being able to like whatever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to a person or a thing or person's </v>

2738
02:03:21.250 --> 02:03:22.083
<v Speaker 1>behavior that you might have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>furious about just a few years ago or </v>

2739
02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:27.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or deeply irritated by where it would </v>

2740
02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:33.650
<v Speaker 1>cling with you for days you'd be in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>car or thinking about it like.</v>

2741
02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:38.930
<v Speaker 1>But the ability to just let that go or </v>
<v Speaker 1>to even enjoy it,</v>

2742
02:03:39.530 --> 02:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it,</v>

2743
02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:43.070
<v Speaker 2>it's good stuck advice which has come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back now.</v>

2744
02:03:43.071 --> 02:03:45.470
<v Speaker 2>It's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think through CBT seemed to be the way</v>

2745
02:03:45.471 --> 02:03:48.020
<v Speaker 2>that CBT,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cbt,</v>

2746
02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:50.960
<v Speaker 2>not a cock and bull torture the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

2747
02:03:51.150 --> 02:03:53.480
<v Speaker 2>cognitive behavioral therapy that may </v>
<v Speaker 2>for all I know,</v>

2748
02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:56.490
<v Speaker 2>both disciplines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2749
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:57.403
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cognitive behavioral therapy is the </v>

2750
02:03:58.761 --> 02:03:59.594
<v Speaker 2>kind of short form therapy that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially getting into the process of </v>

2751
02:04:05.541 --> 02:04:06.374
<v Speaker 2>how an anxiety pattern might happen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of throw a spanner in that works </v>

2752
02:04:10.371 --> 02:04:11.204
<v Speaker 2>and make people by being more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more aware of other possibilities that </v>

2753
02:04:14.331 --> 02:04:17.970
<v Speaker 2>behavior kind of undoing it like that as</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to the longer form of therapy of</v>

2754
02:04:18.710 --> 02:04:19.543
<v Speaker 2>getting into a deeper dialogue with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>self and tracing those things back to </v>

2755
02:04:22.551 --> 02:04:26.660
<v Speaker 2>where they come from and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is the,</v>

2756
02:04:26.661 --> 02:04:27.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the founder of,</v>

2757
02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:31.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the founders of CBT was,</v>

2758
02:04:31.491 --> 02:04:32.324
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2759
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:34.520
<v Speaker 2>was explicitly taking it from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stoics.</v>

2760
02:04:34.521 --> 02:04:35.990
<v Speaker 2>There's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting how that,</v>

2761
02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:39.780
<v Speaker 2>how that is coming back and I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what it is,</v>

2762
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:43.860
<v Speaker 2>what it is in a culture that's now made </v>
<v Speaker 2>us [inaudible] he was very,</v>

2763
02:04:43.861 --> 02:04:47.220
<v Speaker 2>very popular now and there's that sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of awareness.</v>

2764
02:04:47.550 --> 02:04:50.940
<v Speaker 2>It's a reaction against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>against psychoanalysis.</v>

2765
02:04:50.941 --> 02:04:54.960
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it's a yearning for shorter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quicker answers,</v>

2766
02:04:54.961 --> 02:04:55.794
<v Speaker 2>which may be taps into this difficulty </v>
<v Speaker 2>in tolerating ambivalence and </v>

2767
02:05:00.031 --> 02:05:00.864
<v Speaker 2>complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a thing as a perfectly effective </v>

2768
02:05:03.601 --> 02:05:04.434
<v Speaker 2>therapy for many things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just interesting how it's </v>

2769
02:05:05.491 --> 02:05:09.780
<v Speaker 2>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This stoic audio is cultural cycles of</v>

2770
02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>sort of rediscovering things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2771
02:05:12.780 --> 02:05:15.330
<v Speaker 1>and I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that happens with A.</v>

2772
02:05:15.331 --> 02:05:18.270
<v Speaker 1>I think it happens with Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it happens with meditation.</v>

2773
02:05:18.810 --> 02:05:19.643
<v Speaker 1>They become in vogue and then they sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of die out for awhile when a new </v>

2774
02:05:23.401 --> 02:05:25.950
<v Speaker 1>generation sort of forgets it or doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn,</v>

2775
02:05:25.951 --> 02:05:26.784
<v Speaker 1>and then someone catches onto it 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years later and then it becomes very </v>

2776
02:05:30.121 --> 02:05:32.970
<v Speaker 1>popular again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's in articles and magazines.</v>

2777
02:05:32.971 --> 02:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Then people started talking about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then yeah,</v>

2778
02:05:35.250 --> 02:05:37.530
<v Speaker 1>it's this weird thing that we do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that knowledge,</v>

2779
02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:40.320
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is our version of oral history,</v>

2780
02:05:40.321 --> 02:05:43.980
<v Speaker 1>we just pass things on and in this sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a weird way where,</v>

2781
02:05:44.210 --> 02:05:45.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2782
02:05:45.250 --> 02:05:46.083
<v Speaker 1>we forget that these are tools and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>people start discussing their benefits </v>

2783
02:05:50.791 --> 02:05:51.624
<v Speaker 1>and discussing the positive results </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had with it and then it sort of </v>

2784
02:05:54.661 --> 02:05:55.370
<v Speaker 1>builds up.</v>

2785
02:05:55.370 --> 02:05:57.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit like the atheist argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing I was saying,</v>

2786
02:05:57.460 --> 02:05:57.831
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

2787
02:05:57.831 --> 02:06:00.110
<v Speaker 2>as an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we hung up on the,</v>

2788
02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:02.173
<v Speaker 2>knocking down the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually just sign posts back to </v>

2789
02:06:04.881 --> 02:06:07.430
<v Speaker 2>something that is important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is vital,</v>

2790
02:06:07.431 --> 02:06:11.240
<v Speaker 2>but just very difficult to articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Nisha said that God is dead,</v>

2791
02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:12.973
<v Speaker 2>he meant that the sort of the young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unknowable God is now dead because </v>

2792
02:06:20.331 --> 02:06:22.580
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we've established this thing that we</v>

2793
02:06:22.581 --> 02:06:23.414
<v Speaker 2>call God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just like the big guy and you </v>

2794
02:06:24.770 --> 02:06:25.490
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

2795
02:06:25.490 --> 02:06:28.490
<v Speaker 2>we've put like a box around it and gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that.</v>

2796
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:29.383
<v Speaker 2>And in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've kind of lost that touch with that </v>

2797
02:06:31.340 --> 02:06:32.173
<v Speaker 2>numinous unknowable thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which irrespective of what you believe </v>

2798
02:06:38.150 --> 02:06:38.983
<v Speaker 2>as like a religious believer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the represent something that unknowable </v>

2799
02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:47.140
<v Speaker 2>force that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2800
02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:48.400
<v Speaker 2>led even as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2801
02:06:48.401 --> 02:06:51.050
<v Speaker 2>a hardheaded rationalist is sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a.</v>

2802
02:06:52.030 --> 02:06:53.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to make,</v>

2803
02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:56.740
<v Speaker 2>you want to honor that thing because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>

2804
02:06:56.850 --> 02:06:57.683
<v Speaker 2>we need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to know what it is to step </v>

2805
02:07:00.591 --> 02:07:01.430
<v Speaker 2>outside of ourselves.</v>

2806
02:07:01.610 --> 02:07:02.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honor that thing is a great way to put </v>

2807
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:04.271
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2808
02:07:04.271 --> 02:07:05.104
<v Speaker 1>I think we have a really strong desire </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some sort of a practice of humility </v>

2809
02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:11.260
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2810
02:07:11.260 --> 02:07:13.060
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and true all.</v>

2811
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:14.103
<v Speaker 1>And I would love to be if you could go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in time and interact with people </v>

2812
02:07:19.661 --> 02:07:24.040
<v Speaker 1>where everyone believed in thor and Zeus</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2813
02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:25.073
<v Speaker 1>and it would probably be absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to watch how these people </v>

2814
02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:34.080
<v Speaker 1>live their lives with this undying faith</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these deities were in control</v>

2815
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:39.390
<v Speaker 2>of all the matters of the unit with no </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific knowledge at all.</v>

2816
02:07:39.610 --> 02:07:40.443
<v Speaker 2>It must be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you think about the fact that </v>

2817
02:07:42.731 --> 02:07:44.190
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2818
02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:45.093
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many thousands of years of human </v>

2819
02:07:46.931 --> 02:07:50.830
<v Speaker 2>history people engaged with the universe</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>

2820
02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:52.620
<v Speaker 2>There's other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only two,</v>

2821
02:07:52.630 --> 02:07:53.463
<v Speaker 2>300 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was only with the enlightenment that </v>

2822
02:07:54.671 --> 02:07:58.660
<v Speaker 2>we dispensed with the humor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humoral theory of,</v>

2823
02:07:58.720 --> 02:07:59.553
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2824
02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:00.671
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of medicine,</v>

2825
02:08:00.671 --> 02:08:01.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we believed it was,</v>

2826
02:08:01.721 --> 02:08:05.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fire and flame and all those,</v>

2827
02:08:05.790 --> 02:08:09.820
<v Speaker 2>those kind of ethereal substances in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body that's like that.</v>

2828
02:08:09.850 --> 02:08:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Then it was only at that point that </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine became something that was,</v>

2829
02:08:13.570 --> 02:08:14.403
<v Speaker 2>could actually start to fight against </v>
<v Speaker 2>death ward off death to which means </v>

2830
02:08:18.821 --> 02:08:19.331
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2831
02:08:19.331 --> 02:08:21.910
<v Speaker 2>became the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we start to lose.</v>

2832
02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:24.380
<v Speaker 2>That kind of respectful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2833
02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:27.580
<v Speaker 2>death is some sort of companion rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than just some sort of stranger.</v>

2834
02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:28.401
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2835
02:08:28.401 --> 02:08:29.234
<v Speaker 2>that's only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's only a couple of hundred years </v>

2836
02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:32.373
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2837
02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:33.510
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2838
02:08:33.511 --> 02:08:34.344
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of the enlightenment of </v>

2839
02:08:35.621 --> 02:08:36.610
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2840
02:08:37.450 --> 02:08:42.450
<v Speaker 2>as a magician of coals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you very quickly develop a love of a.</v>

2841
02:08:43.870 --> 02:08:45.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly you did that at that skeptical</v>

2842
02:08:45.401 --> 02:08:47.620
<v Speaker 2>attitude that magicians have had </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

2843
02:08:47.621 --> 02:08:49.750
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of debunking and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

2844
02:08:49.751 --> 02:08:51.360
<v Speaker 2>that goes hand in hand debunking the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2845
02:08:51.370 --> 02:08:55.480
<v Speaker 2>the charlatans and the whole world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of spiritual nonsense.</v>

2846
02:08:55.481 --> 02:08:57.270
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

2847
02:08:57.271 --> 02:08:58.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of a separate thing.</v>

2848
02:08:58.781 --> 02:09:00.310
<v Speaker 2>That's a different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a different thing.</v>

2849
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2850
02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:03.993
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only can only articulate it at all </v>

2851
02:09:04.901 --> 02:09:06.610
<v Speaker 2>because it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't come naturally,</v>

2852
02:09:06.611 --> 02:09:07.444
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2853
02:09:07.450 --> 02:09:08.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2854
02:09:09.330 --> 02:09:10.163
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we find things that are sort of </v>

2855
02:09:13.210 --> 02:09:15.490
<v Speaker 2>compelling because they don't come </v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally do this.</v>

2856
02:09:15.491 --> 02:09:15.941
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2857
02:09:15.941 --> 02:09:16.774
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2858
02:09:17.230 --> 02:09:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't quite know what that means to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2859
02:09:18.941 --> 02:09:19.774
<v Speaker 2>but I think if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I knew too easily what it meant to </v>

2860
02:09:22.271 --> 02:09:24.160
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might have lost something in the mix,</v>

2861
02:09:24.190 --> 02:09:24.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

2862
02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:29.650
<v Speaker 2>I think the relationship to allowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life to,</v>

2863
02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:32.373
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to grow and to transform into whatever </v>

2864
02:09:34.511 --> 02:09:39.070
<v Speaker 2>that means has to be surely are</v>

2865
