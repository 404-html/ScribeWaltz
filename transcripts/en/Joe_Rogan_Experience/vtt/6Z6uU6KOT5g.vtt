11
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>they would successfully throw people from the pit and hit me and I had an</v>

12
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] going off around me and I get hit with bibles a lot too,</v>

13
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:29.874
<v Speaker 1>which was weird.</v>

14
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

15
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

16
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 1>And so boots and stuff.</v>

18
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>So I learned like I learned like the Serpentine,</v>

19
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:36.451
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

20
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:37.231
<v Speaker 1>I would just go back.</v>

21
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:39.130
<v Speaker 1>And how have the times did you open for that?</v>

22
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:39.331
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

23
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I think like 16,</v>

24
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>17 shows.</v>

25
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Then every once in a while we would go okay.</v>

26
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Which was weird,</v>

27
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>but I was more comfortable when it was horrible.</v>

29
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I know that sounds weird,</v>

30
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>but that was my,</v>

31
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>that felt right to do.</v>

32
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:55.460
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

33
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>That's he deserved.</v>

34
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.151
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

35
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it was kind of funny.</v>

36
00:00:58.891 --> 00:00:59.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>like when you get laughs,</v>

38
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>that means the crowd likes you.</v>

39
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>When you get like rage,</v>

40
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>that means you have all of their attention.</v>

41
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.543
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

42
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Like Robin Williams is my good friend,</v>

43
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:10.291
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

44
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.124
<v Speaker 1>And Robin,</v>

45
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>he goes on stage and people love them and then I would go on after him when we</v>

47
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:16.741
<v Speaker 1>do sets and,</v>

48
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

49
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.821
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

50
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>and in a weird way,</v>

51
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:21.300
<v Speaker 1>it meant more for me for people to go,</v>

52
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.661
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

53
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Robin Williams showed up last night.</v>

54
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>And then Bobcat Goldthwait was dead.</v>

56
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:27.130
<v Speaker 1>You know what that fucking asshole said?</v>

57
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.233
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>in a weird way that meant more to me,</v>

59
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>his form of neuroses is way more lucrative.</v>

61
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

62
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling people to fuck off isn't as lucrative.</v>

63
00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

64
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.571
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

66
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>so it was opening for Nirvana and Chicago and Michael Jordan and retired from</v>

67
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:44.154
<v Speaker 1>basketball.</v>

68
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.013
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>

69
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.811
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

70
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>

71
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.281
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

72
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>they hated me to begin with,</v>

73
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:48.751
<v Speaker 1>but I go,</v>

74
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:48.991
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

75
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:49.531
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>

76
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:50.221
<v Speaker 1>I feel bad,</v>

77
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:50.911
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

78
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>for $40 million a year,</v>

79
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I'd shoot my own dad in the fucking head,</v>

80
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

81
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.933
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

82
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.110
<v Speaker 1>And there was a noise that wasn't even like a Bu.</v>

83
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:01.944
<v Speaker 1>It was just</v>

84
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

85
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

86
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had that sample.</v>

87
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.550
<v Speaker 1>It was the best known</v>

88
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.003
<v Speaker 1>and knew.</v>

89
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>What did you think at that moment when you heard that?</v>

90
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>It was funny,</v>

91
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:16.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

93
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>but I did,</v>

94
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a beef with Michael Jordan.</v>

96
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:20.341
<v Speaker 1>I felt bad.</v>

97
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:20.611
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

98
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>even though,</v>

99
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>cause people just because they're super famous doesn't mean they're still not</v>

100
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:24.391
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

101
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>So I did,</v>

102
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.171
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

103
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:25.981
<v Speaker 1>why'd I do that?</v>

104
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:26.521
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

105
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>so he had to live in,</v>

106
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>you learn it's baby steps.</v>

107
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>But the only person laughing that night really was,</v>

108
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I remember walking by Kurt on the amp and he goes,</v>

109
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you said that.</v>

110
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.101
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

111
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:38.491
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

112
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:39.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

113
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>met,</v>

114
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.111
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:40.521
<v Speaker 1>Nirvana.</v>

116
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I met Kurt before they broke.</v>

117
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>He was a fan of mine and wanted to interview me.</v>

118
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>So he interviewed me at a college radio station in Anarbor.</v>

119
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.540
<v Speaker 1>I know that blows people's minds.</v>

120
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like finding out that like a Jimmy Hendrix really loved Buddy Hackett or</v>

121
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:55.494
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

122
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

123
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

124
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.713
<v Speaker 1>but he did,</v>

125
00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

126
00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

127
00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

128
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.123
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

129
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.301
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

130
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Talking Duck Moose</v>

131
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.270

134
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I toured in the open form.</v>

135
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.420
<v Speaker 1>I repelled in nude from the roof of the Oakland Coliseum on new years when the</v>

<v Speaker 1>any good dirt for people.</v>

148
00:03:30.391 --> 00:03:31.830

00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:32.841
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

152
00:03:32.841 --> 00:03:33.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

153
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

154
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

155
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:03:34.801 --> 00:03:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I think people,</v>

157
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

159
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:39.020
<v Speaker 1>people get it well done,</v>

161
00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:41.360
<v Speaker 1>all this crazy conspiracy stuff and all that stuff.</v>

162
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens with some things,</v>

163
00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:45.770
<v Speaker 1>and I know where I am when I'm talking about crazy conspiracy,</v>

164
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes I think like huge tragedies happen and people can't justify them,</v>

165
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.110
<v Speaker 1>so they have to make up some other thing.</v>

166
00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:55.010
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

167
00:03:55.011 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes it's,</v>

168
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.910
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

169
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.711
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

170
00:03:57.711 --> 00:03:58.544
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

171
00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

173
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.981
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

174
00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:01.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Kurt was a really sweet guy,</v>

176
00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:04.280
<v Speaker 1>but he certainly was a,</v>

177
00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:05.540
<v Speaker 1>a manic depressive.</v>

178
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.890
<v Speaker 1>And I almost think like,</v>

179
00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:07.251
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

180
00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:08.630
<v Speaker 1>when we're talking about drugs earlier,</v>

181
00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:09.710
<v Speaker 1>people are talking about drugs.</v>

182
00:04:09.711 --> 00:04:10.544
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

183
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.600
<v Speaker 1>like that killed them.</v>

184
00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:11.931
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

185
00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:13.130
<v Speaker 1>well that didn't really kill him.</v>

186
00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:13.551
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

187
00:04:13.551 --> 00:04:13.791
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

188
00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:13.941
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

189
00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:15.830
<v Speaker 1>he had some in his system when he died,</v>

190
00:04:15.831 --> 00:04:15.981
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

191
00:04:15.981 --> 00:04:16.221
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

192
00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

193
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.631
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

194
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.280
<v Speaker 1>he cleaned up enough to commit suicide.</v>

195
00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:19.431
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

196
00:04:19.431 --> 00:04:21.600
<v Speaker 1>there's some people that are chemical imbalances.</v>

197
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.390
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that are prone to suicide.</v>

198
00:04:23.391 --> 00:04:25.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think blaming drugs is really lazy,</v>

199
00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:26.414
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

200
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Well certainly upsets the balance though,</v>

201
00:04:28.491 --> 00:04:28.731
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

202
00:04:28.731 --> 00:04:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

203
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.870
<v Speaker 1>I have weird,</v>

204
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm 30 years sober and I'm saying this,</v>

205
00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:32.420
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

206
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.051
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

207
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:35.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just easy to blame drugs.</v>

208
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.141
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any,</v>

209
00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:39.860
<v Speaker 1>did you document your time with a nirvana at all or with curt or anything like</v>

210
00:04:39.861 --> 00:04:40.820
<v Speaker 1>that at that time too?</v>

211
00:04:40.821 --> 00:04:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Did you have like video cam quarters and you kept around?</v>

212
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:44.870
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>

213
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

214
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I have seen a photo of me nude behind him on stage with,</v>

215
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.120
<v Speaker 1>I have the Nutro wings on and then I'm naked with a repelling little thing.</v>

216
00:04:56.991 --> 00:04:57.441
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

217
00:04:57.441 --> 00:04:57.620

222
00:05:03.321 --> 00:05:04.700

<v Speaker 1>So I've got a hat.</v>

224
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.453
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I will say this,</v>

226
00:05:08.571 --> 00:05:11.750

235
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Surprising.</v>

236
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Not a ton.</v>

237

00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

312
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.601
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

313
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:39.020
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

314
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.471
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

315
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

316
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.250
<v Speaker 1>it's midnight and they give him the sing though,</v>

317
00:06:41.251 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 1>and he looks up and I'm holding my own weight,</v>

318
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 1>like rappelling down,</v>

319
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 1>but I stopped,</v>

320
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

321
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 1>so he can count.</v>

322
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm giving them the Brown.</v>

323
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.401
<v Speaker 1>I basically,</v>

324
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 1>from 150 feet up,</v>

325
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.650
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

326
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 1>he looks up and he goes,</v>

327
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Hey Oakland,</v>

328
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 1>you wanna hear a drum solo.</v>

329
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.160
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm barely coming out of my own way.</v>

330
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>And then finally he just goes one.</v>

331
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.701
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

332
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:06.470
<v Speaker 1>and I shot down really fast.</v>

333
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:08.210
<v Speaker 1>I had rope burns on my ass and sound like,</v>

334
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.160
<v Speaker 1>and I landed right behind him,</v>

335
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:10.994
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

336
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.571
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

337
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

338
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I came down so fast,</v>

339
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 1>he actually didn't see it.</v>

340
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>And then he like,</v>

341
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.410
<v Speaker 1>he looks up and he's like,</v>

342
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:16.244
<v Speaker 1>Paulie,</v>

343
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.413
<v Speaker 1>Paulie.</v>

344
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.450
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

345
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 1>and so then I ducked behind this amp looking for a cover because they're</v>

346
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be when my clothes are supposed to be there,</v>

347
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:26.690
<v Speaker 1>but someone had taken him as a joke,</v>

348
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.530
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

349
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 1>And so I just kinda had to stand in the middle of the stage because everywhere</v>

350
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>there was bombs going off,</v>

351
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I learned this as if you're nude at midnight,</v>

352
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 1>you don't get a kiss.</v>

353
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Like everywhere I went,</v>

354
00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:37.004
<v Speaker 1>people were like,</v>

355
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.721
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

356
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:40.440
<v Speaker 1>nude guy walking around.</v>

357
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.303
<v Speaker 1>A little weird.</v>

358
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

359
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 1>so again,</v>

360
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:45.650
<v Speaker 1>all of this was in sobriety.</v>

361
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

362
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.900
