00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 2>but definitely you need local fixers in Mexico.</v>

32
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 2>We have 34 offices around the world.</v>

33
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:49.880
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

34
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 2>we have our own guys,</v>

35
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:51.571
<v Speaker 2>local guys,</v>

<v Speaker 2>pretty much everywhere.</v>

37
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 2>And then you have like local fixers who,</v>

38
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.071
<v Speaker 2>know the terrain,</v>

40
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 2>know the language,</v>

41
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 2>know what's going on and how to get you out of shit.</v>

42
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.090
<v Speaker 1>And you guys started this,</v>

43
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>you were doing a magazine called voice and then you took it over and took the o</v>

44
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:08.240
<v Speaker 1>out and just called it advice.</v>

45
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.611
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

46
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

47
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 2>it was called Voice of Montreal and it was a,</v>

48
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 2>it was sort of a welfare project in Canada,</v>

49
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

50
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 2>run by Haitians and they were doing a black history month thing and then they</v>

51
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 2>figured they could get more money out of the government by doing an English</v>

52
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 2>language cultural publication.</v>

53
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 2>And so we were all working there.</v>

54
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be a writer.</v>

55
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:31.171
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

56
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:31.411
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

57
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 2>finally got a job</v>

58
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 2>and be welcomed back.</v>

59
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Was trying to separate from the rest of Canada.</v>

60
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 2>So like English language publications became illegal.</v>

61
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 2>So no audience.</v>

62
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.990
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

63
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>

64
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 2>eventually they couldn't pay us our wages and stuff.</v>

65
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:47.641
<v Speaker 2>So we said,</v>

66
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:47.821
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

67
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 2>well we own it now.</v>

68
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 2>So we dropped the O and just call it advice.</v>

69
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.840
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

70
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.131
<v Speaker 2>there was like,</v>

71
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 2>what a great name.</v>

72
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.683
<v Speaker 2>How'd you,</v>

73
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.660
<v Speaker 2>how'd you think it?</v>

74
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 2>And we're like,</v>

75
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.940
<v Speaker 2>we just dropped the o,</v>

76
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.853
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

77
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 2>and it's a perfect story.</v>

78
00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

79
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 2>And then we moved to the states and then we,</v>

80
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 2>then we started expanding and now we're in 34 countries.</v>

81
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 2>And where are you guys based out of?</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>

96
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Was this a plan from the very beginning to branch off in all these different</v>

97
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:35.660
<v Speaker 1>directions and it just sort of naturally happened?</v>

98
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

99
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:36.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

100
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.770
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

101
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.030
<v Speaker 2>we never had a business plan.</v>

102
00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:39.080
<v Speaker 2>We never knew anything.</v>

103
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:40.970
<v Speaker 2>We never thought about it really.</v>

104
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 2>What happened was uh,</v>

105
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.640
<v Speaker 2>we wanted the outlawed English basically in Quebec.</v>

107
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

108
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.270
<v Speaker 2>we went national in Canada where the biggest magazine in Canada,</v>

109
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 2>but that was like being the biggest magazine in Reykjavik or something where the</v>

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to move if shit gets bad.</v>

116
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Well I came real close in 2004.</v>

117
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at space in Vancouver.</v>

118
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

119
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

120
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about it.</v>

121
00:03:08.091 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

122
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.333
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

123
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.020
<v Speaker 2>you gotta go to the cause it's going to get real bad.</v>

124
00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:15.500
<v Speaker 2>You got to get to like one the north of where I grew up in Ottawa.</v>

125
00:03:15.501 --> 00:03:16.850
<v Speaker 2>There's like a million lakes.</v>

126
00:03:16.851 --> 00:03:18.350
<v Speaker 2>You can just buy a lake for like 100 bucks.</v>

127
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.210
<v Speaker 2>You got to buy a lake and you know,</v>

128
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.770
<v Speaker 2>build a cabin on the lake because when she gets bad you go to get it</v>

129
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.180
<v Speaker 1>far away from the cities.</v>

130
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.920
<v Speaker 1>When it gets that bad though,</v>

131
00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:29.420
<v Speaker 1>you might want to just die.</v>

<v Speaker 1>on scene investigative pieces that you're doing?</v>

149
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.560
<v Speaker 1>What was the first one?</v>

150
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Heavy metal in Baghdad.</v>

151
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.953
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

152
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.803
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

153
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.940
<v Speaker 2>we for about a decade,</v>

154
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.320
<v Speaker 2>we were kind of a style Mac,</v>

155
00:04:07.321 --> 00:04:10.760
<v Speaker 2>so we were really just interested in cocaine and supermodels</v>

156
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.920
<v Speaker 1>and so like these jeans are weird.</v>

157
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

158
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>

159
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 2>it was because it was fun.</v>

160
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of fun and we were kids and,</v>

161
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.193
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

162
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 2>and then when we started expanding around the world,</v>

163
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:26.250
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>

164
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 2>shit is fucked up.</v>

165
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

166
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.151
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck.</v>

167
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

168
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.141
<v Speaker 2>have you seen this?</v>

169
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:29.411
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

170
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

171
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

172
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 2>and we'd write about it and people like,</v>

173
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard about that,</v>

174
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:34.011
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's going on?</v>

175
00:04:34.011 --> 00:04:34.331
<v Speaker 2>And we're like,</v>

176
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:34.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

177
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.543
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

178
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 2>So that happened as well as the sort of failure of mainstream media during,</v>

179
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:41.563
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

180
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

181
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 2>the Iraq war,</v>

182
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.303
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

183
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 2>with everyone saying like,</v>

184
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 2>weapons of mass destruction just lying and they knew that there was no weapons</v>

185
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 2>of mass destruction and all this shit.</v>

186
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.413
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

187
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

188
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.730
<v Speaker 2>we did a thing where we went to,</v>

189
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.200
<v Speaker 2>we snuck into Iraq,</v>

190
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

191
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.550
<v Speaker 2>and we went to hang out with the only heavy metal band in Baghdad across the</v>

192
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 2>counter and it was supposed to be like a seven minute piece.</v>

193
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 2>It was the first piece we launched the VBS with and um,</v>

194
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

195
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 2>eventually we shot them over three years and we turned into a feature film that</v>

196
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 2>one critic stories in Toronto at won best documentary in Berlin film festival.</v>

197
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Like it got picked up by the BBC,</v>

198
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 2>by Ken Blues.</v>

199
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

200
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:23.360
<v Speaker 1>A friend Eddie raves about it.</v>

201
00:05:23.361 --> 00:05:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo raves about that.</v>

202
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 2>And so everyone's like,</v>

203
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

204
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.761

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

207
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:29.630
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>

208
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.431
<v Speaker 2>we're following a band.</v>

209
00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 2>But you saw the whole thing unfold,</v>

210
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 2>like how everything was fucked up shit.</v>

211
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 2>And people could relate to it because like,</v>

212
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:35.671
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

213
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:37.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a band and then there are bad,</v>

214
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.043
<v Speaker 2>gets their,</v>

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 2>a practice space,</v>

00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:41.310
<v Speaker 2>gets bombed by a Scud missile and you know,</v>

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

219
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.960
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be killed because they were like iron maiden tee shirts or like</v>

220
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:45.641
<v Speaker 2>they had bang,</v>

221
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 2>which is seen as Jewish.</v>

222
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:49.270

223
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>And so that was the first thing and it was so successful that.</v>

224
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 2>And we love doing it that we started saying,</v>

225
00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 2>well why don't we,</v>

230
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:02.210

231
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 2>we have none.</v>

232
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 2>All we do is stories that we like.</v>

233
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:04.950
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>

234
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.080
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

235
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 2>if there's a story like general butt naked in the Tupac army,</v>

236
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.460
<v Speaker 2>that's a fucking jaw dropper,</v>

237
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go shoot that,</v>

238
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

239
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 2>And so we started shooting it and people were like,</v>

240
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard anything like this.</v>

241
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:15.134
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

242
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.850
<v Speaker 2>And so more and more and more people started watching and,</v>

243
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.690
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

244
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 2>and we started doing it more and more.</v>

245
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.230
<v Speaker 2>You're a fucking human being.</v>
