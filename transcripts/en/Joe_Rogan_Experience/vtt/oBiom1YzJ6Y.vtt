00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.660
<v Speaker 2>It is what it was.</v>

3
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Just like any other problem that people go back to.</v>

4
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean at some point it's up to you to release yourself from that obligation to</v>

5
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.520
<v Speaker 2>get upset or feel bad about something that didn't go right in the past,</v>

6
00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:18.971
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

7
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

8
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge point because people define themselves by the past instead of</v>

9
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>thinking about who they are now instead of they still look back at a mistake</v>

10
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 1>they made and don't just get past that mistake,</v>

11
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>grow and learn,</v>

12
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>but dwell on it.</v>

13
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I think it defines them.</v>

14
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.970
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst thing.</v>

15
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I met some guys that band and he says,</v>

16
00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:36.874
<v Speaker 2>is it singers?</v>

17
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.200
<v Speaker 2>I've only met him twice,</v>

18
00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:39.010
<v Speaker 2>two different times,</v>

19
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 2>years later.</v>

20
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.721
<v Speaker 2>Both Times.</v>

21
00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:42.190
<v Speaker 2>He started telling me about the story,</v>

22
00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:43.960
<v Speaker 2>about what happened to him when he was in this.</v>

23
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 2>Anything in this poor guy is gone on all these years and he's still focused on</v>

24
00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 2>the worst situation that he ever had to live through.</v>

25
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 1>And so a attached to it,</v>

27
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.350
<v Speaker 1>well some guys get one break up and they're done.</v>

28
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.161
<v Speaker 1>Some guys,</v>

29
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:01.190
<v Speaker 1>one breakup in their twenties will tank them for a decade.</v>

30
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I've met guys like that that,</v>

31
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:03.191
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

32
00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:03.541
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

33

<v Speaker 1>I came out here with Shelly and you know,</v>

42
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.870

<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

46
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:22.370
<v Speaker 1>What if he got mugged by one person who'd done trust in people?</v>

47
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.400
<v Speaker 1>If you get exactly one person was a murderer,</v>

48
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>let's not trust anybody.</v>

49
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.460

<v Speaker 1>I heard about Ted Bundy.</v>

53
00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trusting people anymore.</v>

54
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.201
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

55
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:30.650
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

56

<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

57
00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sleeping tonight.</v>

58
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.273
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

59
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

60
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's definitely pitfalls in life.</v>

61
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.903
<v Speaker 1>You're going to run into him.</v>

62
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.743
<v Speaker 1>We all are.</v>

63
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>You can learn and grow.</v>

64
00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>If you survive it,</v>

65
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.600
<v Speaker 1>pick yourself up,</v>

66
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.771
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

67
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:42.830
<v Speaker 2>dust the dust off,</v>

68
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:43.880
<v Speaker 2>and then you start going,</v>

69
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.230
<v Speaker 2>don't let this stuff.</v>

70
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

71
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 1>let it beat you down.</v>

72
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.680
<v Speaker 1>It's also directly proportionate to the amount of hardships that people face in</v>

73
00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:51.100
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

74
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Their ability to face hardships.</v>

75
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.111
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

76
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:56.200
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of folks that live life on a cushy cloud of marshmallows and</v>

77
00:01:56.201 --> 00:02:00.310
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and then one day something goes wrong and I mean that's why s spoiled</v>

78
00:02:00.311 --> 00:02:01.780
<v Speaker 1>kids are so sad.</v>

79
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Like a spoiled young boy is one of the saddest things ever.</v>

80
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 1>A young boy that becomes a man and can't take care of himself and his dad has to</v>

81
00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:10.240
<v Speaker 1>keep on rescuing him.</v>

82
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.930
<v Speaker 1>His Dad has to keep on bailing them out of situations and giving them money.</v>

83
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:18.190
<v Speaker 1>I've met guys like that and that is a crippling affliction when they don't have</v>

84
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:20.560
<v Speaker 1>the character themselves to be able to get by in life.</v>

85
00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:23.950
<v Speaker 1>They constantly need someone to help them and bail them out.</v>

86
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Even as a grown man,</v>

87
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I've met guys in their forties it's still need help from their parents.</v>

88
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.951
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

89
00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man,</v>

90
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to get it right because somewhere along the line they didn't</v>

91
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.710
<v Speaker 1>face enough of the university to realize that there's sometimes you just got to</v>

92
00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:39.970
<v Speaker 1>get up and get shit done.</v>

93
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 1>There's sometimes we have to fucking pull yourself up and you have to push</v>

94
00:02:44.201 --> 00:02:44.651
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

95
00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:45.910
<v Speaker 1>even if you want to stay in bed.</v>

96
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do that and he just keep calling on your daddy and your daddy</v>

97
00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:49.720
<v Speaker 1>keeps rescuing you,</v>

98
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.430
<v Speaker 1>you never developed those tools,</v>

99
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.910
<v Speaker 1>you never developed that ability to recognize what you're doing wrong with your</v>

100
00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:55.990
<v Speaker 1>life because you're,</v>

<v Speaker 1>do not give your kids money.</v>

136
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Don't give them a fucking penny.</v>

137
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.271
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

138
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>especially boys,</v>

145
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Like in your late forties looking back at your life,</v>

146
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>this disaster wreckage that you've put forth,</v>

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>the millions you've blown now he has like a retail job.</v>

148
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>His parents abandoned them.</v>

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.971
<v Speaker 1>It's a guy.</v>

155
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just still struggling from the way he was developed from the,</v>

156
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>the tools that were instilled in him at a childhood.</v>

157
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

158
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>in adolescence and having that safety net just provided him with a way to stay</v>

160
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:22.894
<v Speaker 1>in bed,</v>

161

163
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Every time things go wrong.</v>

164
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Every time things feel terrible,</v>

165
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 1>you have an opportunity to learn from whatever makes you feel terrible and never</v>

166
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>allow it to happen again.</v>

167
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

168
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.021
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

170
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>That's forward.</v>

171
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

172
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>don't do it again.</v>

173
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

174
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.131
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

175
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:44.170
<v Speaker 1>learn from your mistakes.</v>

176
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.033
<v Speaker 1>We all make them.</v>

177
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>That's where meditation comes in.</v>

178
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Recognizing that and solidifying it and your head and the,</v>

179
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>I believe meditation,</v>

180
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.241
<v Speaker 1>the tank,</v>

181
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>which is a more magnified form of meditation.</v>

182
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more intense and I think that you can,</v>

183
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>you could really get something out of that if with those sort of ideas in your</v>

184
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 1>mind about constant,</v>

185
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 1>consistent improvement and it's only the only thing that you'll allow from</v>

186
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:08.250
<v Speaker 1>yourself just to maintain a certain standard.</v>

187
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Then consistently trying to improve and do that,</v>

188
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.611
<v Speaker 1>do that and you'll be,</v>

189
00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>you'll be a happier person.</v>

190
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.730
<v Speaker 1>That's an amazing concept there to become a part of to where you're involved in,</v>

191
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 1>you're the Osha instruction of your own character.</v>

192
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

193
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.110
<v Speaker 1>It's through your own efforts and your own evaluation and then two,</v>

194
00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>to make the right steps and make the right decisions that to become even</v>

195
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 1>stronger as you go.</v>

196
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
