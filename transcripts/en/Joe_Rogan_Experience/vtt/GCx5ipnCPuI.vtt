00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience the cards.</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever have a comedy card?</v>

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.441
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:05.010
<v Speaker 1>never had it.</v>

5
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.010
<v Speaker 1>We had a card once to promote a website that I put out to promote my website,</v>

6
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>but there was never one for like,</v>

7
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>like I'm appearing in this town like with like pointing to the right and the</v>

8
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.763
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.931
<v Speaker 1>Someone told me,</v>

10
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>what am I coming to you?</v>

11
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Someone told me that my track record is this and then I'll tell you what</v>

12
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:28.711
<v Speaker 1>somebody told me,</v>

13
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>George Carlin said,</v>

14
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>but at least I wish I could have said I never had a card.</v>

15
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>But I am proud to say if I'm going to be 100 percent honest.</v>

16
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I had one for like a month and then I just didn't like the smell of it.</v>

17
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.440
<v Speaker 1>So I got rid of it.</v>

18
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.260
<v Speaker 1>No tagless comedian.</v>

19
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

20
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

21
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw some other comedian with a car and I'm like,</v>

22
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>I should have caught it.</v>

23
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>And then I got rid of him.</v>

24
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm glad because someone said somebody at the.</v>

25
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>George Carlin was talking about cards backstage at the comedy magic club and</v>

26
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:56.274
<v Speaker 1>basically said,</v>

27
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.030
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

28
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>the comedian doesn't have a fucking card,</v>

30
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>and then the comedian that had the guard sort of felt like he took them very</v>

32
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>quickly over to the truck because he had just gotten cards.</v>

33
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

34
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

35
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>That was a thing about head shots back in Boston.</v>

36
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's any good had the shitty headshot,</v>

37
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>they didn't give a fuck about their head and you can see that same,</v>

38
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>that same path.</v>

39
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>They would talk about it like if you hire a photographer to do your headshot,</v>

40
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you fucking suck on stage.</v>

41
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.373
<v Speaker 1>Would always say that.</v>

42
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>That was just such an unspoken.</v>

43
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Are there exceptions?</v>

44
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.481
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

45
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:31.130
<v Speaker 1>but no.</v>

46
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Mostly that such a great.</v>

47
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Well this something that makes you want to take a picture of yourself and be all</v>

48
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>sexy looking.</v>

49
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>That's Uber.</v>

50
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Douchey doesn't translate into comedy.</v>

51
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.913
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>there's some guys are good ham it up.</v>

53
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember Kevin Knox had like a really Zany,</v>

54
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>like head shot,</v>

55
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 1>but it worked for him because that was like his act,</v>

56
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>like he was a wild energetic guy.</v>

57
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>What if I talk about how bad that is and I agree with you,</v>

58
00:01:57.721 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>but then you guys pull online.</v>

59
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.830
<v Speaker 1>A picture of me with my shoe is a phone</v>

60
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.211
<v Speaker 1>picture of you.</v>

61
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:03.401
<v Speaker 1>I like.</v>

62
00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

63
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>that with the shoe?</v>

64
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.240
<v Speaker 1>It was like it was a phone.</v>

66
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Nobody did that then?</v>

67
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

68
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>it was really the first.</v>

69
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was real for sure.</v>

70
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid I was like,</v>

71
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>they sat it on TV.</v>

72
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.180
<v Speaker 1>They said it's a big foot.</v>

73
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>The guy got a big foot,</v>

74
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.151
<v Speaker 1>but then when you watch it,</v>

75
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:20.151
<v Speaker 1>like slowed down and then enhanced and then you look at how little detail you're</v>

76
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:21.084
<v Speaker 1>really seeing.</v>

77
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Like everything's all flush.</v>

78
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Like everything's like bright,</v>

79
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>like the leaves and trees.</v>

80
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>It's almost white,</v>

81
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>like there's no detail at all.</v>

82
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.760
<v Speaker 1>So you pretending that you see all this detail in this monkey suits,</v>

83
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>but ignoring the fact that you can't see the fucking trees,</v>

84
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.121
<v Speaker 1>where's he going?</v>

86
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>He's very nonchalant about it too.</v>

87
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a girl supposedly.</v>

88
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

89
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 1>where's she going?</v>

90
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.920
<v Speaker 1>She's going to go get some dicks.</v>

91
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>It's often a lot of big floods.</v>

92
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Kind of nonchalant,</v>

93
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.731
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

94
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:47.911
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

95
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I got spotted,</v>

96
00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:48.971
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

97
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:49.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm off the lunch.</v>

98
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

99
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>there's no real purpose to look at this thing</v>

101
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.620
<v Speaker 1>to me is like there's like some moments where she picks her feet up or it or he,</v>

102
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Bob Hieronymus Bosch and the bottom of the feet.</v>

103
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:05.750
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking worn.</v>

104
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Big Feet,</v>

105
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>big rubber feet like that.</v>

106
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>You got to really throw your legs up higher and it's definitely apparent and</v>

107
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the things that they said that the gate was off.</v>

108
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious.</v>

109
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to this expert when I was doing the Scifi show who was arguing to</v>

110
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>death with me about this.</v>

111
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>He was like the average gait of a human being.</v>

112
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it was like nine degrees,</v>

113
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>but the big foot is like 25 degrees.</v>

114
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.161
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

115
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:27.311
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

116
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>you mean he would have had to do this?</v>

117
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And then I started walking around like big flood.</v>

118
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:30.371
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

119
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man?</v>

120
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you're supposed to be a scientist.</v>

121
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Like you're crazy.</v>

122
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a guy in a suit.</v>

123
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:36.514
<v Speaker 1>But it's like a,</v>

124
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a crypto zoological.</v>

125
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:39.364
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

126
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not supposed to fuck with the Patterson Gimlin footage.</v>

127
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 1>They all believe it.</v>

128
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>I have not talked to one of those dudes who are like crazy big foot fanatics who</v>

129
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:49.264
<v Speaker 1>think it's a hoax.</v>

130
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Fucking believe I got so high once,</v>

131
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I believe for 15 whole minutes.</v>

132
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>I thought for a second and we were at the Ice House and we're doing a comedy</v>

133
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>show and then we start talking shit and we played the footage and we were so</v>

134
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:01.661
<v Speaker 1>baked.</v>

135
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at the video and I was like,</v>

136
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.971
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

137
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 1>what if it's real and I'm just an asshole?</v>

138
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 1>What if it's real?</v>

139
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>And this whole time I've been denying like the greatest discovery in crypto</v>

140
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>zoological history and I'm just being a dick,</v>

141
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Speaker 1>but then I sobered up.</v>

142
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

143
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>it's like wanting to,</v>

145
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>believe in real monsters.</v>

147
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

148
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>the lochness monster is another one.</v>

149
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

150
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 1>every culture has won.</v>

151
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>The lochness monster has got to be the biggest pussy of all time because he</v>

152
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>never kills anybody.</v>

153
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>How do you get to be a monster?</v>

154
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:31.211
<v Speaker 1>It's icon,</v>

155
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:31.611
<v Speaker 1>a whale,</v>

156
00:04:31.611 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 1>and may just become missing people because they're taken under the water.</v>

157
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Your opinion though,</v>

158
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>at your expert opinion,</v>

159
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

160
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.831
<v Speaker 1>What's what?</v>

161
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>What are we looking at for the paterson footage?</v>

162
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.423
<v Speaker 1>Just for the record,</v>

163
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 1>what are we looking at man in a suit?</v>

164
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:45.723
<v Speaker 1>A man in a suit?</v>

165
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

166
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.931
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent,</v>

167
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:47.764
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

168
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Ninety nine percent.</v>

169
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

170
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking special effects expert.</v>

171
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Speaker 1>And these knuckleheads like of ways that the legs move that you just can't do</v>

172
00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:01.801
<v Speaker 1>what the human frame they want to convince themselves so bad that a con man</v>

173
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to find bigfoot and did it in like a day.</v>

174
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Lighting is your new book and um,</v>

175
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:13.980
<v Speaker 1>what it's a,</v>

176
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a really important thing that you,</v>

177
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

178
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.883
<v Speaker 1>you bring up.</v>

179
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not on the front part of this.</v>

180
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I've read it online somewhere that you can avoid a lot of problems in your life.</v>

181
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

182
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

183
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Simply by not lying.</v>

184
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Almost.</v>

185
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of them.</v>

186
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Of all the ones that are avoidable.</v>

187
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:34.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

188
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.040
<v Speaker 1>When you just look at how people screw up their lives line is.</v>

189
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 1>If it's not the reason,</v>

190
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing that enabled the other reason.</v>

191
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean people complicate their lives massively by a willingness to deceive</v>

192
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>others and this has many features to it.</v>

193
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:56.500
<v Speaker 1>One is just there,</v>

194
00:05:56.501 --> 00:06:01.501
<v Speaker 1>all the things you can do based on the cover that lies provide that you</v>

195
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be doing because they're not good for you and now,</v>

196
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:09.550
<v Speaker 1>and everyone would hate you if they knew you were doing them or your,</v>

197
00:06:09.551 --> 00:06:09.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

198
00:06:09.701 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>your wife would leave you or whatever,</v>

199
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.863
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

200
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.850
<v Speaker 1>And so the law,</v>

201
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 1>the lies,</v>

202
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 1>lies create a space in which you can let your life run off the whale,</v>

203
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.741
<v Speaker 1>run off the rails,</v>

204
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>whether it's becoming an addict or with a or,</v>

205
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.591
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

206
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:22.424
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

207
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

209
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 1>perpetrating financial frauds or whatever it is.</v>

210
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

211
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

212
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.900
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

213
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.190
<v Speaker 1>there's also this component where you don't actually,</v>

214
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:36.191
<v Speaker 1>you never actually discover who you are in social space if you always leave</v>

215
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>yourself this out of line.</v>

216
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you never discovered that if you keep canceling plans with people</v>

217
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.400
<v Speaker 1>and just tell this white lie that you're too busy or you're not feeling well,</v>

218
00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:50.150
<v Speaker 1>or is that you never have to confront the fact that these are people you</v>

219
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>actually don't want to see people in your life who want to go out to dinner with</v>

220
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:55.070
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

221
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to see them and you're never having to confront that because you</v>

222
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>have this out that you're just gonna lie.</v>

223
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.920
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

224
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.330
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

225
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 1>and there's just,</v>

226
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.053
<v Speaker 1>if you want,</v>

227
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.740
<v Speaker 1>there's actually no change in a person's life that I think is more important in</v>

228
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:13.430
<v Speaker 1>terms of getting your life straight,</v>

229
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:13.810
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

230
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 1>your to ship straight.</v>

231
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:20.060
<v Speaker 1>You're just getting into the future without screwing it up for yourself.</v>

232
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 1>There's no more important change than,</v>

233
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.150
<v Speaker 1>than a commitment to being honest in,</v>

234
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.870
<v Speaker 1>in whatever the situation is.</v>

235
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:27.704
<v Speaker 1>That presents itself.</v>

236
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 1>When I was a freshman at Stanford,</v>

237
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 1>I took a course with a professor who actually interview in the back of the book.</v>

238
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm Ronald Howard,</v>

239
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:39.971
<v Speaker 1>who is a really brilliant guy who started a whole academic field called decision</v>

240
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 1>analysis and the sixties,</v>

241
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:42.381
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

242
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:43.214
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

243
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a mechanism which</v>

244
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.810
<v Speaker 1>allows someone to make as rational decision as possible by putting all of their</v>

245
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>information about a topic into,</v>

246
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:56.893
<v Speaker 1>into a,</v>

247
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 1>essentially a calculation.</v>

248
00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

249
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.350
<v Speaker 1>it's got nothing to do with,</v>

250
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:00.681
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

251
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:00.891
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

252
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:02.510
<v Speaker 1>with line or honesty,</v>

253
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:02.900
<v Speaker 1>but he's a,</v>

254
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.500
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

255
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.090
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

256
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.420
<v Speaker 1>a professor in the engineering economic systems department's efforts and he as</v>

257
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.070
<v Speaker 1>kind of a sideline to his,</v>

258
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.320
<v Speaker 1>his academic work was teaching these,</v>

259
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.350
<v Speaker 1>these courses on ethics and one course was just on the question whether it's</v>

260
00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 1>ever ethical to lie.</v>

261
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>And so as a freshman I was just sort of put in the machine of this course and</v>

262
00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 1>came out the other side,</v>

263
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 1>convinced that in virtually any situation,</v>

264
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>apart from like a self defense situation where you would,</v>

265
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.700
<v Speaker 1>where things have really broken down and you're not in the presence of someone</v>

266
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>who you're going to collaborate with line is just unacceptable.</v>

267
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>

268
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not how I want to live.</v>

269
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not how anyone should want to live.</v>

270
00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:44.690
<v Speaker 1>If they look at it closely enough.</v>
