1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's do the countdown is false </v>
<v Speaker 1>calendar.</v>

2
00:00:02.131 --> 00:00:03.390
<v Speaker 1>You go four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

3
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>And we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up my brother quick.</v>

5
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.680
<v Speaker 1>I know how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

6
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Very efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could just start,</v>

7
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>just start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

8
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it.</v>

9
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>So things are getting weird real quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're thinking about this,</v>

10
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>this uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>orange fella.</v>

11
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean I got to say for me it's the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>time ever to start a news service and we</v>

12
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>started a daily show about a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and it just is like,</v>

13
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do want it on vice,</v>

14
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:39.880
<v Speaker 1>on your channel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

15
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>it's with HBO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a daily news show on HBO.</v>

16
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like we were doing so well on </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekly.</v>

17
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't I know about this?</v>

18
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.130
<v Speaker 1>We did our weekly show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:49.964
<v Speaker 1>And that was doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they gave us a daily show and they </v>

20
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>were going to just put it on HBO now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

21
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>But then it was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they put us on,</v>

22
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on TV.</v>

23
00:00:56.671 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the best possible compliment for</v>

24
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>your show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your show is like,</v>

25
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.383
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would expect someone who's never done </v>

26
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:05.574
<v Speaker 1>a show before to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just gave them a fuck load of </v>

27
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably.</v>

28
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:10.164
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly hosts who have really </v>
<v Speaker 1>never hosted anything before and gave </v>

29
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:17.440
<v Speaker 1>them a fuck load of money that the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing feels so [inaudible].</v>

30
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.380
<v Speaker 1>The wrong word to use is unprofessional </v>
<v Speaker 1>but polished.</v>

31
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Unpolished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfakeable.</v>

32
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's unpolished is no one talking like</v>

33
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no Brian Williams.</v>

34
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know what we were doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we started.</v>

35
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.853
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

36
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.763
<v Speaker 1>the criticisms came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite was from the New York Times </v>

37
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>was it's just a bunch of hipsters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>skinny jeans and tattoos,</v>

38
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>high fiving in war zones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

39
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.993
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you aren't criticizing the news are </v>

40
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 1>criticizing the truth or the facts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories.</v>

41
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.843
<v Speaker 1>You're just criticizing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have tattoos and we don't look like </v>

42
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want.</v>

43
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

44
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was our first season and yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

46
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.533
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting to see a bunch </v>

47
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>of young Weirdos in war zones.</v>

49
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:10.464
<v Speaker 1>but one of the reporters was out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had a flak jacket on and he was </v>

50

57
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.330

<v Speaker 1>we just did a thing on the resurgence of</v>

58
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>the Taliban in Afghanistan and how it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically going back to the same borders</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're clearing out these cds and </v>

70
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.513
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked him about it one time and he </v>

71
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:13.781
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's a genetic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's also fucking the best word during </v>

78
00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:32.684
<v Speaker 1>list out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it didn't fall on his head as a </v>

79
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:34.444
<v Speaker 1>youth.</v>

80
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Is there something missing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a broken part and he's just,</v>

81
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>he's built for the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the job.</v>

82
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.743
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see that in this day and </v>

83
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.133
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're dealing with this weird </v>

84
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>time where the president of United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States points to CNN and says,</v>

85
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fake news.</v>

86
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>And then the meme comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

87
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:56.930
<v Speaker 1>The sunglasses fall down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thug life with him and you,</v>

88
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.150
<v Speaker 1>you do get a lot of fake news though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

89
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.013
<v Speaker 1>getting a lot of these unsubstantiated </v>
<v Speaker 1>reports about him with prostitutes in </v>

90
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>urine and they're talking about it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking news,</v>

91
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>which is unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's fake news on both sides.</v>

92
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem and there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it that it's,</v>

93
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.050
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

94
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to wade through </v>
<v Speaker 1>it all.</v>

95
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

96
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>for us when after the election everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>came to me and said,</v>

97
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>what should we do?</v>

98
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>And I said we got to just be logical </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact based,</v>

99
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>middle of the road press record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonpolitical,</v>

100
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>nonpartisan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of this shit.</v>

101
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>We just go out there and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

102
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we view ourself as centrists and sort of</v>

103
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:36.634
<v Speaker 1>press record all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the world takes a sort of giant </v>

104
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>leap to the right with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.770
<v Speaker 1>fake news and all this crazy shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

106
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.933
<v Speaker 1>then you're sitting there sort of going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well all of a sudden we were putting </v>

107
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>this position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for me,</v>

108
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always bring it up and say like,</v>

109
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm an environmentalist because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a boogeyman.</v>

110
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.700
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all get fucked.</v>

111
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:57.190
<v Speaker 1>If the environment gets fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

112
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 1>there's a boogeyman that we can that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can sort of go against and it's good for</v>

113
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:02.441
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:04.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is,</v>

115
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:05.394
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno when environmentalism became a </v>

116
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 1>left thing.</v>

117
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 1>It should be for anyone who's saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who's smart and you know,</v>

118
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 1>I spend time like going back to war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you spend a lot of time in war</v>

119
00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 1>zones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing when you talk to people in</v>

120
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 1>those war zones is wharf is fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun.</v>

121
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:22.984
<v Speaker 1>It's not heroic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a manly shot in the </v>

122
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>catheter bags and you're fucked up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your head's missing.</v>

123
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Your ass is missing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your balls are.</v>

124
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.593
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go to these things you never </v>

125
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 1>want to go back kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

126
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to the scientists,</v>

127
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

128
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 1>of course it's a global scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>consensus.</v>

129
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:45.874
<v Speaker 1>Of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I did this piece this year on </v>

130
00:05:48.861 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 1>in season five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be the first piece.</v>

131
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:51.784
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally don't understand what the </v>

132
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:54.790
<v Speaker 1>fuck is happening here.</v>

133
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Because if you talk to every scientist </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

134
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.740
<v Speaker 1>they're terrible at getting information </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>

135
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.291
<v Speaker 1>but they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

136
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>that's not my fucking job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My job is to do science.</v>

137
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

138
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this global scientific consensus</v>

139
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

140
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 1>global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>97 percent,</v>

141
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 1>which never happens in any science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

142
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's all this,</v>

143
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm a doubt not all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it a lot in America still.</v>

144
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 1>So we looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we said,</v>

145
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is happening here?</v>

146
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 1>And there's now three age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three attorney,</v>

147
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.773
<v Speaker 1>attorneys general with 20 other in </v>
<v Speaker 1>support have come out for this lawsuit </v>

148
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:36.311
<v Speaker 1>now against Exxon Ceo of Exxon is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>our secretary of state rex tillerson.</v>

149
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:38.054
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened was they knew in the </v>

150
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 1>seventies and eighties that fossil fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

151
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 1>burning fossil fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon in the air,</v>

153
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 1>carbon emission caused global warming </v>
<v Speaker 1>and was a factor for global warming.</v>

154
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 1>And then they realized this is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be bad for business.</v>

155
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:01.380
<v Speaker 1>So in the eighties and nineties and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>they spend billions of dollars on,</v>

156
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.543
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 1>discrediting the science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole thing.</v>

158
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no consensus,</v>

159
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:07.480
<v Speaker 1>there's no consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

160
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>

161
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 1>And they spend billions of dollars to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

162
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 1>There is a consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he told him I did.</v>

163
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

164
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.270
<v Speaker 1>And so highlights that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

165
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people,</v>

166
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:19.184
<v Speaker 1>it's the same people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that highlights is it's the exact </v>

167
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 1>same scientist and the exact same people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and groups and uh,</v>

168
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 1>more like smoking spokespeople and went </v>
<v Speaker 1>after cigarettes,</v>

169
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:30.680
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

170
00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some cases the same scientist,</v>

171
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.101
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

172
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 1>well it's exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's questioned the science.</v>

173
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 1>well there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't really figure out smoking.</v>

175
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.903
<v Speaker 1>Lung cancer could be anything and do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>loudly and concisely with quick </v>

176
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:44.834
<v Speaker 1>sentences where they're very well </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared and they did the exact same </v>

177
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 1>thing with global warming.</v>

178
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's why when you come here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk to people and say,</v>

179
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

180
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.910
<v Speaker 1>we have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to know science isn't settled.</v>

181
00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

182
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.643
<v Speaker 1>it's like back in the day when your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth would open and a cigarette would </v>

183
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:01.970
<v Speaker 1>come out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking is good for you.</v>

184
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an oil can comes out.</v>

185
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:04.911
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

186
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:05.744
<v Speaker 1>the science isn't settled yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole argument that the science </v>

187
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:10.280
<v Speaker 1>isn't settled yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>

188
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 1>it's being perpetrated by the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can profit on the science not being</v>

189
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:14.684
<v Speaker 1>settled here and that gets really scary </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people being fucking do and it </v>

190
00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:19.654
<v Speaker 1>gets scary is it makes it real </v>
<v Speaker 1>convenient for right wing people who </v>

191
00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:22.784
<v Speaker 1>just classically think and vote and </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave right wing to just adopt that </v>

192
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:29.650
<v Speaker 1>thinking and then and thing and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

193
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.130
<v Speaker 1>it's not a fucking left thing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a hundred like to go ahead.</v>

194
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 1>It's an everybody who likes to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside thing.</v>

195
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:36.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody likes to hunt thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone likes to swim.</v>

196
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Thing is everyone like that served a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>

197
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Fucking water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

198
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.021
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you see this?</v>

199
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:42.854
<v Speaker 1>There was a new report that came out </v>
<v Speaker 1>today about the infrastructure in terms </v>

200
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:46.694
<v Speaker 1>of the water supply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pipes that we have that the water's </v>

201
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 1>being carried with rotting out your </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in this country.</v>

202
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 1>It will cost a trillion dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're saying that flint,</v>

203
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>but what</v>

204
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.180
<v Speaker 2>happened in flint could happen in a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the pope.</v>

205
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 2>It's just old infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs to be replaced,</v>

206
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here it is national.</v>

207
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.823
<v Speaker 2>Flint's America's one point 2 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles of deteriorating lead pipes and </v>

208
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:10.620
<v Speaker 2>they'll cost $1,000,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix it.</v>

209
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 2>One thing that I like about trump is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he has been saying that he wants to</v>

210
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:14.724
<v Speaker 2>address the infrastructure and he wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to put people to work fixing all the </v>

211
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:21.410
<v Speaker 2>problems that exist and creating jobs by</v>
<v Speaker 2>fixing all these types of.</v>

212
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Which is another famous presidents at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

213
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.593
<v Speaker 2>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>FDR.</v>

214
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

215
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a good guy,</v>

216
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very good one.</v>

217
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.290
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say who's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We only liked the ones that get shot.</v>

218
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 2>I had like a whole bit about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we like Kennedy and like Lincoln.</v>

219
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting</v>

220
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.370
<v Speaker 1>because the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really look at it traditionally,</v>

221
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

222
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.433
<v Speaker 1>there are big power is right now is when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do appointees or when you get a </v>

223
00:09:47.331 --> 00:09:49.270
<v Speaker 1>judge through or when you do an </v>
<v Speaker 1>appointee,</v>

224
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

225
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.833
<v Speaker 1>you put your cabinet together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the cabinet as power and the </v>

226
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:54.523
<v Speaker 1>president goes on to opening bridges and</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying around the world and shaking </v>

227
00:09:58.701 --> 00:10:01.340
<v Speaker 1>hands and kissing babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's what,</v>

228
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we said is we're not going to,</v>

229
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.540
<v Speaker 1>as a news agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the bloombastic or the,</v>

230
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the titillating headlines or they,</v>

231
00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:13.700
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that we're going to look after a</v>

232
00:10:13.701 --> 00:10:14.534
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to look at what is the EPA </v>

233
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:17.803
<v Speaker 1>with a guy who runs the EPA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who tried to sue the EPA and shut it </v>

234
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:21.950
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the energy?</v>

235
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.770
<v Speaker 1>What is the Department of Energy look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like with Rick Perry?</v>

236
00:10:24.771 --> 00:10:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Who as when he ran for president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said I would,</v>

237
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I would shut down the Department of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Energy.</v>

238
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.500
<v Speaker 1>What does that look with him actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>running it or sessions?</v>

239
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Who Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

240
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:35.893
<v Speaker 1>is now the attorney general who sued the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government many times against climate </v>

241
00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:42.540
<v Speaker 1>change reform or rex Tillerson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

242
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.813

<v Speaker 1>companies will now being secretary of </v>

243
00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:46.724
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're looking more at just policy </v>

244
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.070
<v Speaker 1>what policy changes because of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>cabinet,</v>

245
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.913
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Etc.</v>

246
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.620
<v Speaker 1>YEah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird.</v>

247
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:55.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

248
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.100
<v Speaker 2>everybody thought this was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of,</v>

249
00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get rid of political correctness,</v>

250
00:11:01.221 --> 00:11:06.221
<v Speaker 2>stop all these whiny crybaby liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once he got into office,</v>

251
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.830
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the same people that I talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that were kind of in supportive.</v>

252
00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:12.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm just kind of stepped back and went </v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

253
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Like alreadY,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right away,</v>

254
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.150
<v Speaker 2>keystone pipeline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dakota access,</v>

255
00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.190
<v Speaker 2>abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>abortion.</v>

256
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're cutting,</v>

257
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.650
<v Speaker 2>they're cutting insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay a payment,</v>

258
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.850
<v Speaker 2>paying of abor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you say that?</v>

259
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:30.470
<v Speaker 2>The funding of abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't get an abortion with</v>

260
00:11:30.471 --> 00:11:31.304
<v Speaker 2>insurance anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

261
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.520
<v Speaker 2>is that what they have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They passed that has that been passed?</v>

262
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Which is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

263
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.070
<v Speaker 2>obviously for some people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like abortions,</v>

264
00:11:39.071 --> 00:11:41.090
<v Speaker 2>it's a very touchy subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which ironically,</v>

265
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.120
<v Speaker 2>the same people who love war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>

266
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you killing babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't mind killing people.</v>

267
00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Once they're full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can go fuck themselves,</v>

268
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:50.803
<v Speaker 2>especially if they live in some other </v>
<v Speaker 2>spot and he's really fucking building </v>

269
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.033
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>

270
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

271
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

272
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.720
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy who got elected on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>populist,</v>

273
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>platforms.</v>

274
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 1>So he's going to do some of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

275
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

276
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Speaker 1>I think two things about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think so much about trump</v>

277
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:13.930
<v Speaker 1>as much as two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a,</v>

278
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.960
<v Speaker 1>it shows a sort of generational divide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

279
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not just trump [inaudible] you </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked,</v>

280
00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.870
<v Speaker 1>you saw in brexit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing it in France,</v>

281
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:24.640
<v Speaker 1>you saw natalie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing it,</v>

282
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many countries around the world where</v>

283
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 1>you have the largest cohort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest demographic is gen y,</v>

284
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:33.783
<v Speaker 1>but the socioeconomic and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>power is mostly still controlled by the </v>

285
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:38.404
<v Speaker 1>boomers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have this sort of generational </v>

286
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 1>divide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happened in America was,</v>

287
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:45.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

288
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.840
<v Speaker 1>the gen y was more an fractured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

289
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:50.674
<v Speaker 1>we talked a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a fractured because of </v>

290
00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:54.910
<v Speaker 1>bernie sanders and hillary and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>just didn't like hillary.</v>

291
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.890
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way she's,</v>

292
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an older generation as well.</v>

293
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.393
<v Speaker 1>And then trump was the sort of baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>boomers like living in the gated </v>

294
00:13:02.501 --> 00:13:04.470
<v Speaker 1>community saying we don't want all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad shit to happen.</v>

295
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.313
<v Speaker 1>I understand why people don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe environmental change because </v>

296
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:08.380
<v Speaker 1>it's scary and it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

297
00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:09.300
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to believe in that,</v>

298
00:13:09.301 --> 00:13:11.740
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not going to believe in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>

299
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:12.603
<v Speaker 1>but you have this generational divide </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now what you have is just sort of </v>

300
00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:18.670
<v Speaker 1>this backlash of kids going like in </v>
<v Speaker 1>brexit,</v>

301
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:19.540
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

302
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.390
<v Speaker 1>You guys vote to fucking leave europe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now fucked,</v>

303
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>

304
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:25.240
<v Speaker 1>And now I think you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

305
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:26.074
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a global thing and I think </v>

306
00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:30.140
<v Speaker 1>it's also young people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

307
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.630
<v Speaker 1>are getting upset and also they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

308
00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 1>You should have fucking voted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

309
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:34.511
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

310
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:37.000
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to quite a few people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were pissed off that didn't vote.</v>

311
00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

312
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:39.750
<v Speaker 1>well that's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

313
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California is going to hillary anyway.</v>

314
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

315
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

316
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

317
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:48.364
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California legalized recreational </v>

318
00:13:50.921 --> 00:13:53.890
<v Speaker 1>marijuana and a sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

319
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:56.350
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want it.</v>

320
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.890
<v Speaker 1>He literally is on record saying they </v>
<v Speaker 1>good people don't smoke marijuana.</v>

321
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.370
<v Speaker 1>What about drink scotch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People drink scotch.</v>

322
00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:05.320
<v Speaker 1>What about cigars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And good people smoke cigars,</v>

323
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 1>jeff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I work and I think that that's,</v>

324
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it every,</v>

325
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I think young people know what side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>history they want to be on.</v>

326
00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:13.960
<v Speaker 1>like we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

327
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.900
<v Speaker 1>we all know it's going to be legalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know what's going to be there.</v>

328
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:19.180
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like say three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe five years,</v>

329
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.313
<v Speaker 1>and then all this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those people in jail don't have to </v>

330
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:22.030
<v Speaker 1>be in jail.</v>

331
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:22.863
<v Speaker 1>All this money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this tax money could go and look at </v>

332
00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:26.290
<v Speaker 1>what happened in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the cartels and all the,</v>

333
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.020
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like it's going to happen.</v>

334
00:14:29.021 --> 00:14:30.730
<v Speaker 1>So anybody who comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

335
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

336
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on the wrong side of history,</v>

337
00:14:33.371 --> 00:14:33.911
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

338
00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:34.744
<v Speaker 1>he's lifted up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What trump has said is that he's going </v>

339
00:14:37.261 --> 00:14:39.610
<v Speaker 1>to leave it up to the states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if he leaves it up to the states,</v>

340
00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:40.444
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to go across the country</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what are they going to do </v>

341
00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:43.900
<v Speaker 1>federally and once it becomes state </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal everywhere,</v>

342
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.120
<v Speaker 1>and then the federal government still </v>
<v Speaker 1>says it's illegal.</v>

343
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.140
<v Speaker 1>What did they do then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

344
00:14:47.141 --> 00:14:47.974
<v Speaker 1>did they change then because they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to change a lot because of the money </v>

345
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>they have to change law because in</v>

346
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Colorado it's legal but you can't bank </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

347
00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking mess.</v>

348
00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.720
<v Speaker 2>SubmAssive armored cars and guys with </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>

349
00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:00.554
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of guys who are former </v>
<v Speaker 2>seals and and you know guys who worked </v>

350
00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 2>for blackwater and now they're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding guns at at we chops because they</v>

351
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:09.710
<v Speaker 2>got a million dollars in cash in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bank,</v>

352
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:12.270
<v Speaker 2>which is bad enough with one state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it's 20 states,</v>

353
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 2>fucking places in that state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about one state.</v>

354
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:17.654
<v Speaker 2>How many marks do you have weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>running around and it all has to be </v>

355
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:22.274
<v Speaker 2>cashed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to grow your own shit in Colorado </v>

356
00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:24.560
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>

357
00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:25.394
<v Speaker 2>You're not buying it from somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to grow it if you're selling </v>

358
00:15:26.871 --> 00:15:27.704
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're creating a dangerous </v>

359
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.300
<v Speaker 2>situation and people have already been </v>
<v Speaker 2>robbed.</v>

360
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

361
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:34.543
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me it was really disappointing when </v>

362
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:41.750
<v Speaker 2>the dea didn't change the classification</v>
<v Speaker 2>from schedule one in august,</v>

363
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:43.280
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had the opportunity.</v>

364
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 2>All the evidence was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know the evidence is there and they</v>

365
00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:49.790
<v Speaker 2>fucking lied about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is under obama also.</v>

366
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.130
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>scheduled,</v>

367
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.550
<v Speaker 2>you can't do research on cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

368
00:15:55.551 --> 00:15:58.600
<v Speaker 2>all of those cbd stuff that you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's coming out now.</v>

369
00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.443
<v Speaker 2>It's not psychoactive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is so important for people who </v>

370
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:02.924
<v Speaker 2>have issues like arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had joe valtellIna here was a </v>

371
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.440
<v Speaker 2>former kickboxing champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a commentator now for glory.</v>

372
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.423
<v Speaker 2>He told me that he was locked in a room </v>
<v Speaker 2>after one of his concussions from his </v>

373
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:13.694
<v Speaker 2>last fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>locked in a room in the dark for three </v>

374
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:16.184
<v Speaker 2>weeks because you couldn't even see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>light on the power button on a cell </v>

375
00:16:20.491 --> 00:16:24.190
<v Speaker 2>phone to charge a cell phone like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>little red light where it shows you that</v>

376
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.093
<v Speaker 2>that would give him a headache.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so cbd oil cured and it's not </v>

377
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:29.720
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>

378
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.553
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing is again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what side of history do beyond like we </v>

379
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.630
<v Speaker 2>know all of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know where it's going,</v>

380
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.780
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck are we slowing down now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

381
00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:41.930
<v Speaker 2>it's a bunch of old people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really what it is.</v>

382
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a bunch of old people who don't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>high and you know,</v>

383
00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:47.990
<v Speaker 2>and they're scared of it and instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at it pragmatically,</v>

384
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.913
<v Speaker 2>objectively looking at the science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're looking at it like some goddamn </v>

385
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.880
<v Speaker 2>19 fifties episode of dragnet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

386
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.340

<v Speaker 2>It's frustrated.</v>

387
00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Are you a loser mickey?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

388
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 2>that's really what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

389
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.230
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

390
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.340
<v Speaker 2>We did this story,</v>

<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>

393
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.493

<v Speaker 2>They fly around the world and they find </v>

394
00:17:12.261 --> 00:17:13.094
<v Speaker 2>like the best seed strains and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to holland and they make like </v>

395

<v Speaker 2>they wanted the cannabis cup like six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight years in a row that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's a farce.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what they give you.</v>

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Each one of those things has weed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just start fucking smoking.</v>

409
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.930
<v Speaker 2>You're going to watch one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three races.</v>

410
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.690
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first of hits you're on and you just</v>

411
00:17:51.691 --> 00:17:52.524
<v Speaker 2>fucking hammer in it and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's talking in this ridiculous </v>

412
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.850
<v Speaker 2>jargon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

413
00:17:56.851 --> 00:17:58.260
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really tasty.</v>

414
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.140
<v Speaker 2>They're a fucking super annoying and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stinky.</v>

415
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.233
<v Speaker 2>And talking about the cannabis community</v>
<v Speaker 2>had this weird conversation with this </v>

416
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:06.060
<v Speaker 2>one dude who won.</v>

417
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:09.480
<v Speaker 2>When the fuck knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know who I voted for.</v>

418
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.690
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so high afterwards.</v>

419
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:13.524
<v Speaker 2>I was having out of body experiences </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people were giving me cookies </v>

420
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:18.030
<v Speaker 2>and candies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of,</v>

421
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.013
<v Speaker 2>if not the highest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the highest I've ever been in my </v>

422
00:18:20.761 --> 00:18:21.594
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the highest because we were at </v>

423
00:18:22.891 --> 00:18:24.870
<v Speaker 2>this place on melrose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

424
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:25.704
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a head shop and in the back they had </v>

425
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:27.714
<v Speaker 2>this pop thing and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just filled with fucking people </v>

426
00:18:30.571 --> 00:18:32.010
<v Speaker 2>in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No ventilation,</v>

427
00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:36.700
<v Speaker 2>just filled with pot smoker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is an amsterdam los angeles.</v>

428
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:38.243
<v Speaker 2>They did it in La and they're passing </v>
<v Speaker 2>around bongs and pipes and cookies and </v>

429
00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:45.000
<v Speaker 2>cakes and they had security there to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure no one would come and they had</v>

430
00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:48.150
<v Speaker 2>it all blocked off and they did a smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>job like the way they handled it,</v>

431
00:18:48.151 --> 00:18:51.650
<v Speaker 2>but as far as like actually judging </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the best pot,</v>

432
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.500
<v Speaker 2>the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one has any idea.</v>

433
00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:56.483
<v Speaker 2>It's like giving you seven glasses of </v>
<v Speaker 2>whiskey and then telling you to drink </v>

434
00:18:59.731 --> 00:19:01.380
<v Speaker 2>some wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What wine do you like,</v>

435
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:02.214
<v Speaker 2>shane?</v>

436
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.160
<v Speaker 2>That's generally how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

437
00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.100
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how most of our podcasts are now.</v>

438
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I judged it and it was.</v>

439
00:19:09.841 --> 00:19:12.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what I judged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the pot was like.</v>

440
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.553
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a poor judge and everybody else </v>

441
00:19:14.721 --> 00:19:16.620
<v Speaker 2>has a poor judge too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm being honest about it.</v>

442
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.050
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted a judge,</v>

443
00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.700
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wanted to have a real cannabis cup.</v>

444
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.833
<v Speaker 2>You would give someone a strain for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week and then give them another strain </v>

445
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.693
<v Speaker 2>for a week and have make them keep a </v>
<v Speaker 2>journal and then make them send in that </v>

446
00:19:29.581 --> 00:19:30.414
<v Speaker 2>journal like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my experience on this is how </v>

447
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.730
<v Speaker 2>much I smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what it felt like.</v>

448
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.530
<v Speaker 2>Body high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>

449
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.070
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of that shit.</v>

450
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:41.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my stuff.</v>

451
00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.040
<v Speaker 2>It's getting to a strange place now for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

452
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.520
<v Speaker 2>Because what's interesting to me is when</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who don't smoke it,</v>

453
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:49.560
<v Speaker 2>smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I get to see because we're,</v>

454
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.630
<v Speaker 2>our tolerance is so high because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke it.</v>

455
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I smoke it almost every Day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least five days a week.</v>

456
00:19:55.081 --> 00:19:55.914
<v Speaker 2>I probably smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I see people that tried for the </v>

457
00:19:58.831 --> 00:19:59.664
<v Speaker 2>first time and you see that terrified </v>
<v Speaker 2>look in their eye when they're </v>

458
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:04.890
<v Speaker 2>confronted with their own mortality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel the earth spinning and they're</v>

459
00:20:04.891 --> 00:20:05.730
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus,</v>

460
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I've got a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

461
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Smoker?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

462
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Because my problem is I'm an ex smoker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not smoker.</v>

463
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>currently I'm an ex smoker,</v>

464
00:20:14.371 --> 00:20:15.204
<v Speaker 2>smoker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so smoking always makes me want to </v>

465
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.860
<v Speaker 2>smoke cigarettes a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>b.</v>

466
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.270
<v Speaker 2>So I do like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

467
00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:23.670
<v Speaker 2>they have all the different things now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one,</v>

468
00:20:23.671 --> 00:20:28.380
<v Speaker 2>the one I like is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this high cbd sort of,</v>

469
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

470
00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:31.650
<v Speaker 2>it gets you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi honey.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And it's fucking awesome.</v>

472
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you need I can get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>

473
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I've got a question because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about this yesterday because I,</v>

474
00:20:41.751 --> 00:20:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

475
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm like reading all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

476
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.410
<v Speaker 2>how it stops cancer.</v>

477
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.310
<v Speaker 2>ThIs is great for this and great for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and stuff.</v>

478
00:20:47.311 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah,</v>

479
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.280
<v Speaker 2>but isn't smoking it's still bad for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

480
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.750
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently not.</v>

481
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.500
<v Speaker 2>In that it's actually scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zack,</v>

482
00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.880
<v Speaker 2>it actually acts as an expectorant on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your lungs.</v>

483
00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.130
<v Speaker 2>It's actually good for people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphysema.</v>

484
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.130
<v Speaker 2>It's actually good for people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues with their lungs,</v>

485
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:04.990
<v Speaker 2>which is really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asthma,</v>

486
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.660
<v Speaker 2>really good for asthma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smoking weed.</v>

487
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

488
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.090
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem to make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

489
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.990
<v Speaker 2>it more much better though because </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking is still kind of harsh,</v>

490
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:18.690
<v Speaker 2>but the effect of the cannabis smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabis smoke is not toxic the same way</v>

491
00:21:18.691 --> 00:21:19.524
<v Speaker 2>as cigarette smoke is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why cigarette </v>

492
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:22.324
<v Speaker 2>smoke is toxic is not just the tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is 599 fucking chemicals or </v>

493
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.420
<v Speaker 2>whatever the hell it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

494
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.600
<v Speaker 2>marijuana users have good lungs for </v>
<v Speaker 2>transplanting.</v>

495
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:37.120
<v Speaker 2>So if you get high walk off a building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoops man.</v>

496
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:37.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

497
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Your lungs are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to smoke it.</v>

498
00:21:40.661 --> 00:21:41.494
<v Speaker 2>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I'm down with these fucking </v>

499
00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:44.800
<v Speaker 2>things that I got charged and right </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

500
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.520
<v Speaker 2>these vape pens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them suck because some of them,</v>

501
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:51.520
<v Speaker 2>the ones that look like like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>e-cigarette,</v>

502
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.770
<v Speaker 2>those suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have enough juice.</v>

503
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:54.813
<v Speaker 2>They're not powerful enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want one that has a really good </v>

504
00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.133
<v Speaker 2>pull.</v>

505
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.183
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good because these are you high </v>

506
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.300
<v Speaker 2>like getting high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting high.</v>

507
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.433
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got to keep hitting them over and </v>

508
00:22:13.401 --> 00:22:14.990
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

509
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:17.970
<v Speaker 2>These mother fuckers get hot because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that batteries,</v>

510
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:19.280
<v Speaker 2>fat cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>

511
00:22:19.281 --> 00:22:20.114
<v Speaker 2>that battery is as much fat are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other ones when you get the ones that </v>

512
00:22:22.221 --> 00:22:24.530
<v Speaker 2>are skinny like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other problem with the ones that are</v>

513
00:22:24.531 --> 00:22:25.410
<v Speaker 2>skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ms.you</v>

514
00:22:25.411 --> 00:22:27.460
<v Speaker 2>get a lot of duds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make it.</v>

515
00:22:27.461 --> 00:22:29.120
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry China,</v>

516
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.283
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of them suck band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my friend gina who sells me </v>

517
00:22:33.951 --> 00:22:36.350
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave me three.</v>

518
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.690
<v Speaker 2>No four pens and three of them were </v>
<v Speaker 2>duds.</v>

519
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.593
<v Speaker 2>Nearly three out of four were duds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was all legal than exactly what </v>

520
00:22:44.691 --> 00:22:46.650
<v Speaker 2>your quality control to control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

521
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:47.923
<v Speaker 2>They were packaged to see the whole deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that are packaged ready and when </v>

522
00:22:50.511 --> 00:22:52.520
<v Speaker 2>you're getting these ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepackaged,</v>

523
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.650
<v Speaker 2>like you throw them away when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

524
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.753
<v Speaker 2>it's very wasteful.</v>

525
00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:57.830
<v Speaker 2>So this you just get this little </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartridge.</v>

526
00:22:57.831 --> 00:22:58.664
<v Speaker 2>You slide the cartridge into this big </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat battery thing and there were no </v>

527
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.330
<v Speaker 2>scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was scared it a good boy.</v>

528
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

529
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a good time for that and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good time for people to do.</v>

530
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.280
<v Speaker 2>The problem is the research is still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Federal research is still impossible.</v>

531
00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.593
<v Speaker 2>Doing real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real hardcore research on large scale </v>

532
00:23:20.421 --> 00:23:21.254
<v Speaker 2>research nationwide and we should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>going anything that shows some promise </v>

533
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:26.873
<v Speaker 2>re cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be going whole hog after in </v>

534
00:23:28.911 --> 00:23:30.470
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we're not as just </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

535
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.333
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried that he has such trump such </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible connections to money and </v>

536
00:23:36.201 --> 00:23:36.710
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

537
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.570
<v Speaker 2>all the good parts that's going to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that,</v>

538
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.840
<v Speaker 2>like his no nonsense approach to </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure,</v>

539
00:23:41.841 --> 00:23:42.674
<v Speaker 2>wanting to rebuild a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a lot of people to work because of </v>

540
00:23:44.491 --> 00:23:45.920
<v Speaker 2>that and a lot of benefit from that.</v>

541
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.383
<v Speaker 2>WHat scares me is that money connection </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the pharmaceutical companies who </v>

542
00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:52.154
<v Speaker 2>have just gone way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way out of their way to try to stifle </v>

543
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:56.953
<v Speaker 2>marijuana research at every possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn and legalization at every possible </v>

544
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:05.270
<v Speaker 2>turn and it's criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would they do is awful,</v>

545
00:24:05.271 --> 00:24:05.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

546
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Because when you make something illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just making something illegal,</v>

547
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:09.494
<v Speaker 2>which is why I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to like drill this into the head </v>

548
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:14.220
<v Speaker 2>of a friend of mine who was pro hillary </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

549
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's asking me why I'm upset with her.</v>

550
00:24:16.071 --> 00:24:16.821
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look dude,</v>

551
00:24:16.821 --> 00:24:17.654
<v Speaker 2>there's a fucking email that was leaked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wiki leaks email that said she's </v>

552
00:24:20.511 --> 00:24:23.600
<v Speaker 2>against marijuana in every sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>

553
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.733
<v Speaker 2>This was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was making a promise to some </v>

554
00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:28.910
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who it was,</v>

555
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.670
<v Speaker 2>but they were asking her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is our stance on marijuana?</v>

556
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.650
<v Speaker 2>She's againsT it in every sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>

557
00:24:33.651 --> 00:24:34.484
<v Speaker 2>How could you be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like saying I'm against peanut </v>

558
00:24:36.411 --> 00:24:37.970
<v Speaker 2>butter in every sense of the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

559
00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:40.730
<v Speaker 2>like what are you a monster?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want people to go to jail for peanut</v>

560
00:24:40.731 --> 00:24:41.790
<v Speaker 2>butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

561
00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.080
<v Speaker 2>like the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that you don't like it,</v>

562
00:24:45.081 --> 00:24:48.830
<v Speaker 2>which I'm fine with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is you could make people get</v>

563
00:24:48.831 --> 00:24:52.040
<v Speaker 2>locked in a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a crime.</v>

564
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know this is an oculus.</v>

565
00:24:54.171 --> 00:24:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I of just hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're having a conversation.</v>

566
00:24:56.211 --> 00:24:59.150
<v Speaker 2>There's no problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not some devil weed.</v>

567
00:24:59.151 --> 00:25:01.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to ruin lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pay taxes,</v>

568
00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I have a family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's fine.</v>

569
00:25:03.461 --> 00:25:06.770
<v Speaker 2>I wake up when the alarm goes off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're when fed bullshit.</v>

570
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.710
<v Speaker 2>And when someone who In the position of </v>
<v Speaker 2>running for president,</v>

571
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:12.290
<v Speaker 2>like hilary says something crazy like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

572
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.260
<v Speaker 2>she's against marijuana legalization in </v>
<v Speaker 2>every sense of the word.</v>

573
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.200
<v Speaker 2>That means some people are going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to jail.</v>

574
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.093
<v Speaker 2>That means people are going to get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means more mexican drug gangs are </v>

575
00:25:22.731 --> 00:25:25.040
<v Speaker 2>going to ship more illegal product over </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

576
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.070
<v Speaker 2>The church is being done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No research is being done.</v>

577
00:25:28.071 --> 00:25:30.680
<v Speaker 2>People are going to die from cancer that</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to die.</v>

578
00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.980
<v Speaker 2>People are going to get diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have it.</v>

579
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.620
<v Speaker 2>This is my problem because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what side of history do you want to</v>

580
00:25:36.621 --> 00:25:40.970
<v Speaker 2>be on and I think that most people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up the way we did it or seen people</v>

581
00:25:40.971 --> 00:25:42.800
<v Speaker 2>are just saying what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

582
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

583
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.263
<v Speaker 2>and as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's five different positive aspects </v>

584
00:25:49.821 --> 00:25:51.860
<v Speaker 2>for it and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all know where it's going.</v>

585
00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.000
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't go in that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have a fucking revolution</v>

586
00:25:56.230 --> 00:26:00.500
<v Speaker 2>and they need to understand that what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw with that women's march when the</v>

587
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.080
<v Speaker 2>day after trump was inaugurated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see millions of people,</v>

588
00:26:03.081 --> 00:26:05.950
<v Speaker 2>there's a million people in la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they expected 80,000,</v>

589
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.510
<v Speaker 2>970,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking people showed up.</v>

590
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:11.030
<v Speaker 2>Whitney coming sent me some pictures </v>
<v Speaker 2>when she was there.</v>

591
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.130
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>

592
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.820
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of movement,</v>

593
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:17.863
<v Speaker 2>it's not just connected to women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights and it certainly is at that that </v>

594
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.730
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a mindset.</v>

595
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.593
<v Speaker 2>It's a mindset of protesting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting what they think is wrong and </v>

596
00:26:27.441 --> 00:26:28.274
<v Speaker 2>it's going to spread across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're in a weird fucking bipolar </v>

597
00:26:31.431 --> 00:26:34.620
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This country bipolar situation,</v>

598
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.950
<v Speaker 2>the country in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

599
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of you fucking liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>crybabies bunch of loops.</v>

600
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.100
<v Speaker 2>This is the whole thing is that you,</v>

601
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a special on,</v>

602
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.360
<v Speaker 1>on dysfunctions picture from whitney </v>
<v Speaker 1>cummings,</v>

603

<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of people will actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good because,</v>

605
00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:53.123
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think americans had forgotten how to </v>

606
00:26:55.681 --> 00:26:56.514
<v Speaker 1>sort of protest americans had forgotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is part of democracy and all </v>

607
00:26:59.611 --> 00:27:00.720
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been sort of,</v>

608
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk radioing our,</v>

609
00:27:04.361 --> 00:27:04.841
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

610

<v Speaker 1>our anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

611
00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.753
<v Speaker 1>in quiet and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's good to go out and </v>

612
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:10.980
<v Speaker 1>protest if you believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

613
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.570
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

614
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.190
<v Speaker 1>if you sort of look at what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>

615
00:27:16.191 --> 00:27:18.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a thing on a house divided.</v>

616
00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:19.344
<v Speaker 1>And what's interesting is if you ever do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything on Israel and the palestinian </v>

617
00:27:22.921 --> 00:27:25.190
<v Speaker 1>pro palestinian people go after you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever been on palestine,</v>

618
00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.350
<v Speaker 1>the israeli people go after everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can never do anything right.</v>

619
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.480
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing when you do sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

620
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.410
<v Speaker 1>politics here.</v>

621
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.040
<v Speaker 1>And we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

622
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.903
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought we were incredibly even </v>

623
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:35.874
<v Speaker 1>handed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gave republicans the same amount of </v>

624
00:27:37.201 --> 00:27:39.270
<v Speaker 1>time as the democrats and the democrats </v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

625
00:27:39.271 --> 00:27:41.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made the republicans look too good.</v>

626
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.030
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is,</v>

627
00:27:43.031 --> 00:27:44.610
<v Speaker 1>is when you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

628
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:45.953
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

629
00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 1>it's so broken that they used to be just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pendulum swings,</v>

630
00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:51.264
<v Speaker 1>pendulum swings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now what's going to happen is that </v>

631
00:27:54.001 --> 00:27:54.834
<v Speaker 1>trump gets in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to undo a lot of the last </v>

632
00:27:57.271 --> 00:28:00.060
<v Speaker 1>eight years than the dams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it swings to them,</v>

633
00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:03.510
<v Speaker 1>we'll undo what he undid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not doing nothing.</v>

634
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Now it's going backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're sitting there saying,</v>

635
00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:08.124
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of shit that we got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve and we can't solve it if we just </v>

636
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:13.644
<v Speaker 1>keep going backwards politically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's why there's so much </v>

637
00:28:15.931 --> 00:28:18.630
<v Speaker 1>frustration is because you're sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>there going,</v>

638
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.493
<v Speaker 1>let's unwind what they did for the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years and then someone else can </v>

639
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:23.400
<v Speaker 1>get in and unwind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we unwound.</v>

640
00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:28.350
<v Speaker 2>We have a real problem as human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>in getting into that team mentality.</v>

641
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.030
<v Speaker 2>There is so many of us on the left that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have so many.</v>

642
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:33.640
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

643
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.710
<v Speaker 2>we agree with so many things at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right stands for like.</v>

644
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.570
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many on the right that </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with so many on the left,</v>

645
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:41.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm more left than I am,</v>

646
00:28:41.371 --> 00:28:43.230
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm pretty fucking right.</v>

647
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm riding on a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like gun control</v>

648
00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:46.740
<v Speaker 1>and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

649
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.633
<v Speaker 1>your essential trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is hopefully what most people </v>

650
00:28:49.791 --> 00:28:50.624
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That they can see the logic in both </v>

651
00:28:52.011 --> 00:28:52.844
<v Speaker 1>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

652
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.670
<v Speaker 1>The problem is when you get too far to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left or too far to the right,</v>

653
00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.520
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what?</v>

654
00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.790
<v Speaker 1>WhaT's worrisome?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just,</v>

655
00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:00.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>farther look in France,</v>

656
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.040
<v Speaker 1>France elect a socialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

657
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:04.933
<v Speaker 1>pm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden the front </v>

658
00:29:06.381 --> 00:29:11.210
<v Speaker 1>nationale who were a joke become the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders in the next election.</v>

659
00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From nationality or like,</v>

660
00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super.</v>

661
00:29:14.151 --> 00:29:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

662
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.260
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

663
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.670
<v Speaker 1>And so you sit there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

664
00:29:16.671 --> 00:29:17.504
<v Speaker 1>well everyone's moving far apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's best when we're all just fucking </v>

665
00:29:21.381 --> 00:29:23.330
<v Speaker 1>working together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy's doing well,</v>

666
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.860
<v Speaker 1>we're all getting it done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

667
00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.830
<v Speaker 1>we're sitting in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sort of logical middle.</v>

668
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem with going too far to</v>
<v Speaker 1>any side.</v>

669
00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:34.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's like you can be on either </v>
<v Speaker 1>side on,</v>

670
00:29:34.471 --> 00:29:37.730
<v Speaker 1>on issues and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you go too far and you're to sort</v>

671
00:29:37.731 --> 00:29:40.310
<v Speaker 1>of dogmatic on either side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when it gets scary</v>

672
00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.340
<v Speaker 2>and it gets scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quick.</v>

673
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:43.683
<v Speaker 1>Get scary real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as one incident happens and it </v>

674
00:29:46.361 --> 00:29:47.530
<v Speaker 1>gets scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And France,</v>

675
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.573
<v Speaker 1>imagine scary in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you have more guns than you have </v>

676
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:52.130
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

677
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.073
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what people will latch with </v>

678
00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.650
<v Speaker 1>the gun problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a gun problem,</v>

679
00:29:56.651 --> 00:29:59.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a human being problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we address it as a gun problem,</v>

680
00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:00.454
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna make that human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem even worse because you're going </v>

681
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:03.334
<v Speaker 1>to take people's guns and you got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make them more angry or any kind of </v>

682
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:07.323
<v Speaker 1>legislation that fights against their </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights that they think are there by the </v>

683
00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:13.420
<v Speaker 1>founding fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a giant problem.</v>

684
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.090
<v Speaker 1>And when people think that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>just pull it away from them,</v>

685
00:30:16.091 --> 00:30:17.800
<v Speaker 1>we're just going to take away the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

686
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ,</v>

687
00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.490
<v Speaker 1>there is definitely something they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

688
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.910
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to be really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful starting that war.</v>

689
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:25.783
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to messaging and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying like a lot of people are saying </v>

690
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.400
<v Speaker 1>no the sciences out because they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent billions of dollars to do that.</v>

691
00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.640
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when you are playing such far right,</v>

692
00:30:34.641 --> 00:30:38.150
<v Speaker 1>far left partisan politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have people saying,</v>

693
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.600
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

694
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:41.330
<v Speaker 1>obamacare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a socialist.</v>

695
00:30:41.331 --> 00:30:42.910
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to take over the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to do this.</v>

696
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.350
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to do that and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing it up.</v>

697
00:30:45.351 --> 00:30:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that creates the tea party,</v>

698
00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in.</v>

699
00:30:48.201 --> 00:30:50.750
<v Speaker 1>And then they have power and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tea party by the way,</v>

700
00:30:50.751 --> 00:30:52.400
<v Speaker 1>as to go back to their constituents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

701
00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.810
<v Speaker 1>we're going to repeal it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do this,</v>

702
00:30:53.811 --> 00:30:55.600
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be deliver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just becomes a.</v>

703
00:30:55.670 --> 00:31:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Everything goes to the atomic level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that when you actually go into,</v>

704
00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:01.770
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

705
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.970
<v Speaker 1>into congress or into the executive or </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the senate,</v>

706
00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.013
<v Speaker 1>and you try to get anything done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't because you've promised that </v>

707
00:31:10.551 --> 00:31:11.384
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to have any sort of </v>

708
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.490
<v Speaker 1>partisan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A relation.</v>

709
00:31:16.491 --> 00:31:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Bipartisan bipartisan</v>

710
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:18.261
<v Speaker 2>relations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

711
00:31:18.261 --> 00:31:19.280
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

712
00:31:19.281 --> 00:31:20.210
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's stupid.</v>

713
00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:22.700
<v Speaker 2>And it exists because we have two </v>
<v Speaker 2>parties.</v>

714
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:26.540
<v Speaker 2>When you make to people we make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them were red and you make one of</v>

715
00:31:26.541 --> 00:31:28.610
<v Speaker 2>them were blue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start wanting to fight each other.</v>

716
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.860
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a stupid thing.</v>

717
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:32.103
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're also,</v>

718
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:32.963
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if you're in or out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always empower because there's </v>

719
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:35.434
<v Speaker 1>only two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're always going to be this sort </v>

720
00:31:37.661 --> 00:31:38.350
<v Speaker 1>of opposition.</v>

721
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that influenced the problem is like </v>

722
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.600
<v Speaker 2>this is what people have to realize a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of your opinions.</v>

723
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:46.300
<v Speaker 2>And my opinions too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really my opinions,</v>

724
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:47.463
<v Speaker 2>their opinions that I've decided are </v>
<v Speaker 2>good that I've heard from other people </v>

725
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:50.853
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of our patterns of behaviors </v>
<v Speaker 2>from accents to the way we approach </v>

726
00:31:55.361 --> 00:31:57.520
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we think about women,</v>

727
00:31:57.521 --> 00:32:00.760
<v Speaker 2>the way we think about religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of that is learned.</v>

728
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.013
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have these two deeply ingrained </v>

729
00:32:04.121 --> 00:32:04.954
<v Speaker 2>patterns in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the democrats and we have the </v>

730
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:07.683
<v Speaker 2>republicans and the republicans are </v>
<v Speaker 2>these no nonsense get business done and </v>

731
00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:14.320
<v Speaker 2>the democrats are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

732
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:15.183
<v Speaker 2>we always think of all these people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>all cry babies and they're all wishy </v>

733
00:32:18.461 --> 00:32:20.700
<v Speaker 2>washy and they're bleeding hearts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

734
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.970
<v Speaker 2>and that this is like ingrained in sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of ingrained in our system,</v>

735
00:32:24.971 --> 00:32:25.804
<v Speaker 2>these two different patterns of behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're severely problematic because </v>

736
00:32:29.771 --> 00:32:30.604
<v Speaker 2>you could exhibit a lot of traits on </v>
<v Speaker 2>each sides and still be a very good </v>

737
00:32:34.151 --> 00:32:37.490
<v Speaker 2>person or a lot of ideas on each side </v>
<v Speaker 2>and still be a very good.</v>

738
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.650
<v Speaker 2>If you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember one,</v>

739
00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

740
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.813
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at sort of the clinton </v>

741
00:32:41.631 --> 00:32:44.660
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took the largest deficit in history,</v>

742
00:32:44.661 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 1>made it the largest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a surplus in history,</v>

743
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:48.343
<v Speaker 1>a strong government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically the tenants of the republican </v>

744
00:32:51.831 --> 00:32:52.664
<v Speaker 1>party w gets in trading is large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the surplus and the largest deficit in </v>

745
00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.430
<v Speaker 1>expands the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

746
00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.850
<v Speaker 1>But nobody said boo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're like,</v>

747
00:33:01.851 --> 00:33:04.010
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just switched these things.</v>

748
00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.580
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to criticize their side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

749
00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.970
<v Speaker 1>it's like sports teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's exactly.</v>

750
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 1>You pick your sports team when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

751
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.530
<v Speaker 1>you pick your political party because </v>
<v Speaker 1>your parents do generally.</v>

752
00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

753
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.420
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where you are.</v>

754
00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:20.750
<v Speaker 1>And then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit out as a democrat to</v>

755
00:33:20.751 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 1>your dad in a lot of places is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out gay.</v>

756
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's probably because they're just</v>

757
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.910
<v Speaker 1>fucking democrats because were ashamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking democrat.</v>

758
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.060
<v Speaker 1>You're going to vote for bernie sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He only wants to do this family.</v>

759
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Bernie sanders wants to give all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to black lives matter.</v>

760
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.963
<v Speaker 1>We actually did a show up as part of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>news thing of we had people going back </v>

761
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:42.763
<v Speaker 1>for thanksgiving and it was the parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>who voted for trump versus the kids who </v>

762
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.280
<v Speaker 1>voted for either hillary or didn't vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>

763
00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.070
<v Speaker 1>and they were just fighting and crying </v>
<v Speaker 1>and freaking out and like,</v>

764
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff and why did,</v>

765
00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.573
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did we get to this level of </v>

766
00:33:56.601 --> 00:33:57.740
<v Speaker 1>dysfunction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

767
00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:00.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem when you have two sides,</v>

768
00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:00.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would.</v>

769
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:01.763
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult for to sports teams </v>
<v Speaker 1>to meet and say if they meet in neutral </v>

770
00:34:05.871 --> 00:34:07.940
<v Speaker 1>territory like vegas and the fans get </v>
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>

771
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.100
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to get along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are fools.</v>

772
00:34:10.101 --> 00:34:11.660
<v Speaker 1>we have tribal instincts.</v>

773
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.823
<v Speaker 1>We have instincts built into the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we were small bands of 50 people </v>

774
00:34:14.991 --> 00:34:18.290
<v Speaker 1>that could barely stay alive and we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>often wiped out often.</v>

775
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 1>So your genealogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your family line,</v>

776
00:34:20.661 --> 00:34:22.850
<v Speaker 1>all your history of when you love could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be easily dead.</v>

777
00:34:22.851 --> 00:34:26.210
<v Speaker 1>And so that was my questIon because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to me what I'm getting the feeling</v>

778
00:34:26.211 --> 00:34:28.880
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like humanity when they have a big thing</v>

779
00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:29.923
<v Speaker 1>like a war or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like we're all getting </v>

780
00:34:31.641 --> 00:34:32.474
<v Speaker 1>together and we're all going to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>do this together and we're going to </v>

781
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:36.950
<v Speaker 1>science and we're going to work hard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do all this.</v>

782
00:34:36.951 --> 00:34:41.180
<v Speaker 1>And we're like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you know,</v>

783
00:34:41.181 --> 00:34:42.014
<v Speaker 1>this has been the largest or longest </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of peace and prosperity the </v>

784
00:34:45.381 --> 00:34:47.040
<v Speaker 1>world's ever known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

785
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Right now we see things in Syria though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about sort of these are sort</v>

786
00:34:50.571 --> 00:34:54.020
<v Speaker 1>of isolated conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but overall globally.</v>

787
00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:55.723
<v Speaker 1>And what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're sort of eatIng ourselves know </v>

788
00:34:58.911 --> 00:35:00.470
<v Speaker 1>we're looking inwards and just sent out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

806
00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.370
<v Speaker 2>what you're coming to as a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional relationship.</v>

807
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.340
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to end anytime soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm hoping,</v>

808
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.550
<v Speaker 2>and this is totally possible that </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation y,</v>

809
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:00.384
<v Speaker 2>like you're talking about generation x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people that are growing up </v>

810
00:36:02.161 --> 00:36:05.280
<v Speaker 2>right now and just sort of waking up as </v>
<v Speaker 2>adults,</v>

811
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.190
<v Speaker 2>like realizing like half those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are wandering through the streets.</v>

812
00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:11.130
<v Speaker 2>When you looked aT the women's march </v>
<v Speaker 2>have those people are,</v>

813
00:36:11.131 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their twenties.</v>

814
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:15.210
<v Speaker 2>They're young folks that are just kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of realizing like,</v>

815
00:36:15.211 --> 00:36:16.230
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking adult.</v>

816
00:36:16.231 --> 00:36:18.360
<v Speaker 2>I can go out and organize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get something done,</v>

817
00:36:18.361 --> 00:36:19.194
<v Speaker 2>I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am really hoping that this message </v>

818
00:36:21.751 --> 00:36:23.730
<v Speaker 2>will get out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it is high time.</v>

819
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.593
<v Speaker 2>We abandoned this fucking goofy system </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that we demand a better system for </v>

820
00:36:29.011 --> 00:36:29.844
<v Speaker 2>running 350 million people and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>figurehead and all of his cronies that </v>

821
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:38.500
<v Speaker 2>he's stuffs into some office and has </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive influence over all of us.</v>

822
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.863
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a giant problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a giant problem and to keep those </v>

823
00:36:42.751 --> 00:36:43.584
<v Speaker 2>people rotating back and forth from left</v>
<v Speaker 2>to right and it's not doing anybody any </v>

824
00:36:46.981 --> 00:36:47.814
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think what's ironic about that is </v>

825
00:36:48.781 --> 00:36:51.420
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd have a lot of people agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you on both sides.</v>

826
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:54.450
<v Speaker 2>I think we need like a cOuncil of </v>
<v Speaker 2>elders,</v>

827
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.393
<v Speaker 2>like we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been talking about this lately a </v>

828
00:36:56.281 --> 00:36:59.190
<v Speaker 2>lot like having a counselor of really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking smart people.</v>

829
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:01.290
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who would have on though,</v>

830
00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.240
<v Speaker 2>would you have to cancel if you had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>council of eight people?</v>

831
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.313
<v Speaker 2>Who would you put on a people you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want seven because it's probably like </v>

832
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:09.763
<v Speaker 2>titanic or something.</v>

833
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:11.790
<v Speaker 2>Some lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird number that.</v>

834
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:13.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd need a good,</v>

835
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.670
<v Speaker 2>you'd need a good a doctor like just for</v>
<v Speaker 2>health stuff.</v>

836
00:37:17.671 --> 00:37:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I like the dark dot mukherjee who wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>the emperor of all maladies,</v>

837
00:37:21.751 --> 00:37:23.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any about sanjay gupta.</v>

838
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I used to hate them and then I like</v>

839
00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:28.230
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like siddhartha.</v>

840
00:37:28.231 --> 00:37:29.064
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a real genius when it comes to </v>

841
00:37:31.441 --> 00:37:32.274
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you need a good tech person </v>

842
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:38.190
<v Speaker 2>because I think elon musk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in ilan musk.</v>

843
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of elon as well.</v>

844
00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:48.410
<v Speaker 2>You know what he can do on his own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just fucking amazing.</v>

845
00:37:48.781 --> 00:37:50.080
<v Speaker 2>American tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's tired.</v>

846
00:37:50.081 --> 00:37:53.550
<v Speaker 2>Are you tired of the traffic in la?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Digging a giant tunnel.</v>

847
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.300
<v Speaker 2>I love elon musk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>elon musk.</v>

848
00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.270
<v Speaker 2>I love elon musk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the fact that like batteries,</v>

849
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.040
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

850
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.410
<v Speaker 2>The thing that was solar didn't work </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the fucking storage didn't work,</v>

851
00:38:04.411 --> 00:38:05.071
<v Speaker 2>so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

852
00:38:05.071 --> 00:38:08.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he took the tesla battery thing into</v>

853
00:38:08.281 --> 00:38:09.660
<v Speaker 2>a powerhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best battery in the world.</v>

854
00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:11.010
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what else I liked about him?</v>

855
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:14.250
<v Speaker 2>He married an actress twice with no </v>
<v Speaker 2>prenup.</v>

856
00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.590
<v Speaker 2>You married the same actress twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what that means?</v>

857
00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.573
<v Speaker 2>That means he drinks and it fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He drinks and he fucks because it's the </v>

858
00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:22.410
<v Speaker 2>only way you make those goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions.</v>

859
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:25.360
<v Speaker 2>You married that same actress twice with</v>
<v Speaker 2>no pre lump.</v>

860
00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.550
<v Speaker 2>If he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an animal.</v>

861
00:38:27.551 --> 00:38:28.650
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a savage.</v>

862
00:38:28.651 --> 00:38:29.670
<v Speaker 2>He's in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

863
00:38:29.671 --> 00:38:31.230
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck about a prenup.</v>

864
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:32.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

866
00:38:35.291 --> 00:38:36.490
<v Speaker 2>And he's making batteries.</v>

867
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Make them fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Battery charging stations everywhere.</v>

868
00:38:41.801 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 1>You got to put him in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

869
00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 1>So we've got elon musk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got sanjay.</v>

870
00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Meet your guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Siddhartha mukherjee.</v>

871
00:38:47.711 --> 00:38:50.110
<v Speaker 1>But you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a good common sense like,</v>

872
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.810
<v Speaker 1>do we have al gore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>al gore?</v>

873
00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.510
<v Speaker 1>You know the criticism because of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

874
00:38:55.511 --> 00:38:56.344
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's thinking I'm an </v>

875
00:38:58.151 --> 00:38:58.984
<v Speaker 1>environmentalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's too far too far over </v>

876
00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:05.170
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you need to sort of,</v>

877
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:07.240
<v Speaker 1>if it was me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want someone,</v>

878
00:39:07.241 --> 00:39:09.220
<v Speaker 1>you know who I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

879
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy named um,</v>

880
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:11.973
<v Speaker 1>Eric Schmidt and he's the chief or one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the head nasa scientists and these </v>

881
00:39:17.111 --> 00:39:19.990
<v Speaker 1>guys are just super smart dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

882
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Man and women actually because the head </v>
<v Speaker 1>signed the chief scientist at nasa.</v>

883
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.990
<v Speaker 1>I met his mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's fantastic as well,</v>

884
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:27.333
<v Speaker 1>but you just need like a common sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who just goes in there with no </v>

885
00:39:32.441 --> 00:39:34.660
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric or no politics or anything.</v>

886
00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

887
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:38.980
<v Speaker 1>we have to reduce emissions by 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent if we don't,</v>

888
00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:41.200
<v Speaker 1>we all die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what we're gonna do.</v>

889
00:39:41.201 --> 00:39:42.034
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a lot of batteries and we're going </v>

890
00:39:42.771 --> 00:39:45.020
<v Speaker 1>to put the things on because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries can finally do it now.</v>

891
00:39:45.021 --> 00:39:45.854
<v Speaker 1>And this is what we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need someone to do that because it </v>

892
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:49.463
<v Speaker 1>gets when it gets hyper politicized and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and everything gets lost in the </v>

893
00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:53.464
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just need a common sensical person </v>

894
00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:55.714
<v Speaker 1>who just says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what needs to happen because </v>

895
00:39:57.911 --> 00:40:02.350
<v Speaker 1>this is what the science says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The log jams that you must have,</v>

896
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.710
<v Speaker 1>like at a big corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say if you worked for under armour,</v>

897
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.720
<v Speaker 1>like the log jams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must have.</v>

898
00:40:07.721 --> 00:40:09.490
<v Speaker 1>You want to get something done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably monumental.</v>

899
00:40:09.491 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try and talk about this and you have</v>

900
00:40:12.131 --> 00:40:15.220
<v Speaker 1>to have design meetings and sit down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>try new fabric.</v>

901
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.540
<v Speaker 1>All this fucking socks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me try thIs.</v>

902
00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.150
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that I just imagined that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

903
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:20.343
<v Speaker 1>in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the country and trillions of dollars </v>

904
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:27.520
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these people.</v>

905
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Do you watch house of cards?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

906
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:30.590
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

907
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I wish it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it maybe is.</v>

908
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching actually,</v>

909
00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:36.003
<v Speaker 1>ironically I was watching the lbj a </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary and what was interesting </v>

910
00:40:38.861 --> 00:40:43.720
<v Speaker 1>about that was that here's this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's basically a political mechanic,</v>

911
00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:47.020
<v Speaker 1>you know who's sitting there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants something.</v>

912
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Everybody you know is trying to get this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to.</v>

913
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:54.100
<v Speaker 1>And basically it's completely fucked and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get anything done.</v>

914
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.113
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing that came across </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was he got everything done by </v>

915
00:40:57.371 --> 00:40:58.204
<v Speaker 1>lying to everybody by just saying you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you what you want and </v>

916
00:41:01.181 --> 00:41:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you what you want and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you what you want.</v>

917
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.740
<v Speaker 1>And then just sort of figuring it out at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end.</v>

918
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just watching it.</v>

919
00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.573
<v Speaker 1>It was fantastic because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the last era when you </v>

920
00:41:13.091 --> 00:41:15.490
<v Speaker 1>could actually get shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

921
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.230
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

922
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:18.740
<v Speaker 1>who knows because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a movie,</v>

923
00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:20.380
<v Speaker 1>but You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

924
00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.420
<v Speaker 1>he was just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

925
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.460
<v Speaker 1>he was lIke the last of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

926
00:41:24.461 --> 00:41:25.294
<v Speaker 1>because I look at Frank Underwood and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always call him like he was a political </v>

927
00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:28.714
<v Speaker 1>mechanic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the guy who could go get the </v>

928
00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:32.260
<v Speaker 1>votes and you could drum up the boats </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could do it.</v>

929
00:41:32.261 --> 00:41:34.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he reminds me actually talking about the</v>

930
00:41:34.491 --> 00:41:36.200
<v Speaker 1>lead figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kevin spacey,</v>

931
00:41:36.201 --> 00:41:37.770
<v Speaker 1>kevin spacey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>house of cards.</v>

932
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.280
<v Speaker 1>He kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without the sort of psychopath,</v>

933
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:44.510
<v Speaker 1>sociopath thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He reminds me of speaker boehner,</v>

934
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:45.830
<v Speaker 1>speaker boehner was that kind of got </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

935
00:41:45.831 --> 00:41:46.760
<v Speaker 1>how many votes do we need?</v>

936
00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.593
<v Speaker 1>How do we get it in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we trade off like they get an </v>

937
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:52.600
<v Speaker 1>aircraft carrier plant in pittsburgh or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever we get at this thing,</v>

938
00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't happen anymore.</v>

939
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Those kinds of guys don't happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

940
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.630
<v Speaker 1>but why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking know.</v>

941
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:00.763
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that preferable to what we've got </v>

942
00:42:02.361 --> 00:42:03.080
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

943
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.340
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

944
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.220
<v Speaker 1>because shit would actually get done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she gets done now.</v>

945
00:42:07.221 --> 00:42:08.120
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go backwards.</v>

946
00:42:08.121 --> 00:42:08.954
<v Speaker 1>So to go back to the council of elders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something needs to happen where there's </v>

947
00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.030
<v Speaker 1>some sort of change because it it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to fix itself,</v>

948
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to fucking fail.</v>

949
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:19.513
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Washington now they're saying the </v>

950
00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:21.404
<v Speaker 1>biggest thing is the supreme court </v>
<v Speaker 1>nomination because everything's so </v>

951
00:42:25.941 --> 00:42:26.774
<v Speaker 1>fucked and everybody realizes that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything will have to go up to the </v>

952
00:42:29.391 --> 00:42:30.224
<v Speaker 1>supreme court and be decided there </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it will not be decided in the </v>

953
00:42:33.471 --> 00:42:34.850
<v Speaker 1>senate and congress or an executive.</v>

954
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.470
<v Speaker 1>That's how fucked it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we're going.</v>

955
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.333
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really important because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we gonna have to sue each other on </v>

956
00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:40.190
<v Speaker 1>everything we want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

957
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:41.743
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got another member of our council of </v>

958
00:42:43.401 --> 00:42:44.234
<v Speaker 1>elders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neil degrasse tyson must be in their </v>

959
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.770
<v Speaker 1>mustang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to be in America.</v>

960
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who else?</v>

961
00:42:48.951 --> 00:42:53.951
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy that I would take two if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at that kind of thing.</v>

962
00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.690
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

963
00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

964
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.300
<v Speaker 1>taylor wilson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a thing.</v>

965
00:42:58.310 --> 00:42:58.840
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

966
00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.673
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he built the fusion reactor in his </v>

967
00:43:01.551 --> 00:43:03.650
<v Speaker 1>garage when he was 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

968
00:43:03.651 --> 00:43:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I heard that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I interviewed him.</v>

969
00:43:07.221 --> 00:43:08.210
<v Speaker 1>What did they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they find?</v>

970
00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:09.044
<v Speaker 1>They found that the reactor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was some sort of a reading </v>

971
00:43:10.971 --> 00:43:11.900
<v Speaker 1>they were getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

972
00:43:11.901 --> 00:43:12.734
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was taking a energy off the grid and </v>

973
00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:16.941
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

974
00:43:16.941 --> 00:43:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the government sort of took him</v>

975
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.230
<v Speaker 1>and now he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

976
00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.270
<v Speaker 1>he's got his own lab and so he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic guy.</v>

977
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:24.140
<v Speaker 1>They found him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

978
00:43:24.141 --> 00:43:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Like there was some crazy power drain or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

979
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:27.733
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't talk because I don't know </v>

980
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:31.010
<v Speaker 1>the actual story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember they were like,</v>

981
00:43:31.011 --> 00:43:31.844
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they know and because he was </v>

982
00:43:32.871 --> 00:43:34.730
<v Speaker 1>getting the materials and all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

983
00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:38.600
<v Speaker 1>taylor's nukes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually,</v>

984
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.750
<v Speaker 1>he was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was 14,</v>

985
00:43:41.751 --> 00:43:44.820
<v Speaker 1>he was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was plotting uranium mines.</v>

986
00:43:44.821 --> 00:43:46.220
<v Speaker 1>He figured out if you put like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

987
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:49.030
<v Speaker 1>a white bottle with a thing and it says </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a,</v>

988
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.500
<v Speaker 1>you could plot the and he would go get </v>
<v Speaker 1>uranium,</v>

989
00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.000
<v Speaker 1>refine their uranium on his own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into yellow cake and then make this,</v>

990
00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.760
<v Speaker 1>this fusion reactor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of cancer doeS he have?</v>

991
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:01.791
<v Speaker 1>But he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

992
00:44:01.791 --> 00:44:02.624
<v Speaker 1>he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got all sorts of gear on when he </v>

993
00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:05.690
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you need is a bunch of,</v>

994
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

995
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.000
<v Speaker 1>he's an expert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

996
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.150
<v Speaker 1>he's 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the whole thing with them that,</v>

997
00:44:10.151 --> 00:44:10.984
<v Speaker 1>well now he's 23 but not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is he's into dark </v>

998
00:44:13.581 --> 00:44:14.414
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark energy and he's going around the </v>

999
00:44:16.701 --> 00:44:20.300
<v Speaker 1>hydraulic collider and seren and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like this kid,</v>

1000
00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1001
00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:22.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we've talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1002
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.790
<v Speaker 1>look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he came up with the girl.</v>

1003
00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.260
<v Speaker 1>The reason why the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was younger,</v>

1004
00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.910
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I liked him so much as he</v>
<v Speaker 1>came up with a failsafe reactor,</v>

1005
00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:36.440
<v Speaker 1>little tiny one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like with all the sort of the,</v>

1006
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:38.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old um,</v>

1007
00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:39.730
<v Speaker 1>power plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1008
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1009
00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.490
<v Speaker 1>they're spent waste and the weapons that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to store,</v>

1010
00:44:44.491 --> 00:44:46.890
<v Speaker 1>which we can store it for more than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years,</v>

1011
00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:48.720
<v Speaker 1>but they need to be stored for 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1012
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.870
<v Speaker 1>He can take little pea size bits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1013
00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:56.910
<v Speaker 1>put it into fail safe reactor that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of drains into a salt thing,</v>

1014
00:44:56.911 --> 00:44:58.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it can't be whatever.</v>

1015
00:44:58.981 --> 00:45:01.620
<v Speaker 1>It's fail safe and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are small,</v>

1016
00:45:01.621 --> 00:45:04.080
<v Speaker 1>but they do like 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>houses or 100,000</v>

1017
00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:08.970
<v Speaker 1>houses and just by using the fuel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we already have that we can store,</v>

1018
00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.850
<v Speaker 1>we can power the world for the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

1019
00:45:11.851 --> 00:45:13.980
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh jesus chrIst.</v>

1020
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:16.200

<v Speaker 1>and by the way he's being backed by ilan</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the big names and whatever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1031
00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.480
<v Speaker 1>emissions by 80 percent of all going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

1032
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.010
<v Speaker 1>And then taylor goes,</v>

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:46.261
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1035
00:45:46.261 --> 00:45:49.860
<v Speaker 1>these little reactors and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we eat up all the old,</v>

1036
00:45:49.861 --> 00:45:50.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warheads and we're done.</v>

1037
00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:51.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can turn them into batteries that </v>

1038
00:45:52.681 --> 00:45:54.030
<v Speaker 1>last for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull that up.</v>

1039
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:57.150
<v Speaker 1>They turned them into batteries made out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of diamonds.</v>

1040
00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:00.290
<v Speaker 1>That lasts for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you just,</v>

1041
00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.880
<v Speaker 1>you just want somebody to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

1042
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.720
<v Speaker 1>here's what its overall it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

1043
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:05.823
<v Speaker 1>What's always made sense to me that If </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were putting carbon out in the </v>

1044
00:46:07.471 --> 00:46:08.304
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere and carbons valuable for </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction and a lot of different </v>

1045
00:46:10.321 --> 00:46:11.740
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be a way.</v>

1046
00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:14.880
<v Speaker 1>BIofuels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like so if you want to do bio fuels,</v>

1047
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:16.230
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

1048
00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:18.410
<v Speaker 1>it's all carbon you need to ceo to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1049
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.373
<v Speaker 1>to inject into the biofuels and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like refined to carbon out of the </v>

1050
00:46:22.441 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 1>goddamn atmosphere when they make </v>
<v Speaker 1>biodiesel with corn and shit like that.</v>

1051
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.780
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1052
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:29.640
<v Speaker 1>there's the one that you use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Algae.</v>

1053
00:46:29.641 --> 00:46:30.474
<v Speaker 1>The algae.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Diamonds turn nuclear waste into nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>battery go jesus christ.</v>

1055
00:46:34.861 --> 00:46:38.430
<v Speaker 1>See if you can pull up taylor's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactor thing.</v>

1056
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:40.080
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fast.</v>

1057
00:46:40.081 --> 00:46:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I would kind of solve all of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1058
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.313
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really would mean that we no longer </v>

1059
00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>got to react.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like his reactor that uses a,</v>

1060
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.070
<v Speaker 1>spent a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did a ted talk on it anyway.</v>

1061
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:54.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we need him because whenever I'm </v>

1062
00:46:56.311 --> 00:46:58.920
<v Speaker 1>around him I feel better about humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm like,</v>

1063
00:46:58.921 --> 00:47:02.340
<v Speaker 1>this is just so devastating and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know how to fix it.</v>

1064
00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:02.960
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1065
00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.260
<v Speaker 1>the science is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it tomorrow.</v>

1066
00:47:04.261 --> 00:47:04.971
<v Speaker 1>You just got to duh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dah duh duh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sam harris,</v>

1078
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.040
<v Speaker 1>globalist,</v>

<v Speaker 1>A lot of people right now on reddit,</v>

1081
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:42.370
<v Speaker 1>on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

1082
00:47:42.371 --> 00:47:43.204
<v Speaker 1>Who is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is someone that's just got a big </v>

1083
00:47:45.491 --> 00:47:46.324
<v Speaker 1>picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understands everything that's going to </v>

1084
00:47:48.671 --> 00:47:49.504
<v Speaker 1>sort of smooth out everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to find people like </v>

1085
00:47:51.761 --> 00:47:54.130
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to find people that um,</v>

1086
00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.670
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to find people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>open to the facts,</v>

1087
00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:58.563
<v Speaker 1>that are willing to change their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't attached their ideas and willing </v>

1088
00:48:01.631 --> 00:48:04.060
<v Speaker 1>to look at every side of things before </v>
<v Speaker 1>they form an opinion.</v>

1089
00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't have the time to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1090
00:48:05.891 --> 00:48:06.724
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the issue I think when anyone </v>

1091
00:48:08.511 --> 00:48:09.344
<v Speaker 1>who went to talking about anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>related to the environment or politics </v>

1092
00:48:11.351 --> 00:48:12.184
<v Speaker 1>or gender or race or anything is there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is only so much fucking time in the </v>

1093
00:48:15.971 --> 00:48:16.804
<v Speaker 1>world so it's so much easier to form </v>
<v Speaker 1>this prejudice opinion or this </v>

1094
00:48:20.291 --> 00:48:22.930
<v Speaker 1>predetermined opinion on everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the board,</v>

1095
00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.510
<v Speaker 1>which is why I like being on the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so popular.</v>

1096
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.673
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to dismiss it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a bunch of babies and shit on </v>

1097
00:48:29.291 --> 00:48:30.220
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1098
00:48:30.221 --> 00:48:31.054
<v Speaker 1>and it's much easier to shit on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things tend to say here's a solution </v>

1099
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.750
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I like taylor.</v>

1100
00:48:34.751 --> 00:48:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking kid.</v>

1101
00:48:36.311 --> 00:48:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Like he can just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just like,</v>

1102
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:40.510
<v Speaker 1>not only is the science there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do this,</v>

1103
00:48:40.511 --> 00:48:41.111
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and this.</v>

1104
00:48:41.111 --> 00:48:42.190
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why don't we do that?</v>

1105
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:43.450
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

1106
00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:44.201
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1107
00:48:44.201 --> 00:48:49.201
<v Speaker 1>that could have a baby drill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>start drilling into.</v>

1108
00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:51.443
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that we cannot think </v>

1109
00:48:53.261 --> 00:48:57.670
<v Speaker 1>between the two of us have someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>could just be,</v>

1110
00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone is just unbelievable and people </v>

1111
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:06.221
<v Speaker 1>could just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1112
00:49:06.221 --> 00:49:07.280
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1113
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:09.640
<v Speaker 1>someone is really wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone,</v>

1114
00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:12.790
<v Speaker 1>they don't necessarily have to be smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1115
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.660
<v Speaker 1>and also just like they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can convey,</v>

1116
00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're doing,</v>

1117
00:49:18.071 --> 00:49:21.320
<v Speaker 1>this is why we're here because you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>a communicator because you know,</v>

1118
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.890
<v Speaker 1>taylor and elan are not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating,</v>

1119
00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:25.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries and,</v>

1120
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.730
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the physics behind,</v>

1121
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:29.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little piece and the thing when,</v>

1122
00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean you need someone to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're doing,</v>

1123
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:33.490
<v Speaker 1>this is why we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why everybody in the world,</v>

1124
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:34.593
<v Speaker 1>like who is the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most believable politician in the last </v>

1125
00:49:37.661 --> 00:49:38.290
<v Speaker 1>50 years?</v>

1126
00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is going to be that person?</v>

1127
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy carter globally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>globally.</v>

1128
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:45.520
<v Speaker 1>It's funny about jimmy carter because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never met anyone as sort of quick,</v>

1129
00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:46.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so,</v>

1130
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.433
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you'd use it for an </v>

1131
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:51.400
<v Speaker 1>hour or so many so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's got the stats.</v>

1132
00:49:51.401 --> 00:49:53.020
<v Speaker 1>He's got twitter and he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1133
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.120
<v Speaker 1>he looks and he sounds like the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

1134
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:59.380
<v Speaker 1>He was destroyed when he was empowered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was just vilified.</v>

1135
00:49:59.381 --> 00:50:01.570
<v Speaker 1>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a great smart guy.</v>

1136
00:50:01.571 --> 00:50:02.404
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he should have been like a secretary </v>

1137
00:50:03.131 --> 00:50:04.660
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand that you don't know about</v>

1138

<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was um,</v>

1139
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:08.230
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as his character,</v>

1140
00:50:08.231 --> 00:50:10.270
<v Speaker 1>like how he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he presents himself.</v>

1141
00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:14.500
<v Speaker 1>He was not like a firm leader character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1142
00:50:14.501 --> 00:50:18.140
<v Speaker 1>he was a kind gentleman from Georgia </v>

<v Speaker 1>the end by the reagan administration </v>

1146
00:50:29.901 --> 00:50:30.734
<v Speaker 1>when they were coming in the reagan </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign because they were the first </v>

1147
00:50:32.901 --> 00:50:37.901
<v Speaker 1>campaign to ever use the rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection to christianity.</v>

1148
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:39.313
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized the hardcore religious base </v>

1149
00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:43.740
<v Speaker 1>even though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1150
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:47.180
<v Speaker 1>he was a pastor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1151
00:50:47.181 --> 00:50:48.950
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind kinda crazy.</v>

1152
00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:55.050
<v Speaker 1>And the republicans connected themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>to these crazy like televangelists jerry</v>

1153
00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.190
<v Speaker 1>falwell and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1154
00:50:58.250 --> 00:50:59.750
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you got elected?</v>

1155
00:50:59.751 --> 00:51:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Because he could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could get the evangelical base.</v>

1156
00:51:02.221 --> 00:51:04.190
<v Speaker 1>So they worked him there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They worked him there.</v>

1157
00:51:04.191 --> 00:51:07.790
<v Speaker 1>And ronald reagan was an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a much better public speaker.</v>

1158
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:08.624
<v Speaker 1>He was strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had slicked back hair like god damn </v>

1159
00:51:10.461 --> 00:51:12.260
<v Speaker 1>comic book from the fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1160
00:51:12.261 --> 00:51:13.280
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1161
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:14.323
<v Speaker 1>because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like the president and in many </v>

1162
00:51:17.001 --> 00:51:18.230
<v Speaker 1>cases is the queen of england.</v>

1163
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:21.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a ceremonial thing and that's,</v>

1164
00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:22.253
<v Speaker 1>that's why I'm saying you need a </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicator who can sort of get things </v>

1165
00:51:24.921 --> 00:51:27.410
<v Speaker 1>across and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people will believe,</v>

1166
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.273
<v Speaker 1>like nobody really believed carter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>half the country didn't believe reagan </v>

1167
00:51:30.981 --> 00:51:32.690
<v Speaker 1>or they believed him after he was gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1168
00:51:32.691 --> 00:51:35.390
<v Speaker 1>because everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's convenient to love reagan now.</v>

1169
00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.880
<v Speaker 1>But I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you remember when we were kids,</v>

1170
00:51:37.881 --> 00:51:40.160
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what punk rock started in America</v>

1171
00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:41.420
<v Speaker 1>was because right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And got in.</v>

1172
00:51:41.421 --> 00:51:43.880
<v Speaker 1>We all went fucking New York hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that shit.</v>

1173
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.110
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1174
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1175
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:47.870
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a shame that we cannot think.</v>

1176
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:50.150
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be american.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about like in the world,</v>

1177
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:53.540
<v Speaker 1>isn't there somebody in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking world hard pressed,</v>

1178
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:57.500
<v Speaker 1>hard pressed to find a prominent public </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that really stands out.</v>

1179
00:51:57.501 --> 00:51:59.700
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's oprah.</v>

1180
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1181
00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:02.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>

1182
00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

1183
00:52:05.661 --> 00:52:06.490

<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1184
00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:07.323
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that carter got fucked </v>

1185
00:52:08.121 --> 00:52:08.954
<v Speaker 1>on was the hostages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had negotiated the release of the </v>

1186
00:52:11.241 --> 00:52:15.740
<v Speaker 1>hostages to make sure that it was done </v>
<v Speaker 1>once reagan was in office and not before</v>

1187
00:52:15.741 --> 00:52:17.990
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had kept those fucking american</v>

1188
00:52:17.991 --> 00:52:19.450
<v Speaker 1>citizens over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1189
00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:20.393
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a proven conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kept those american citizens over </v>

1190
00:52:23.361 --> 00:52:24.194
<v Speaker 1>there longer than they had to be because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to make sure that it will </v>

1191
00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.890
<v Speaker 1>all look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had,</v>

1192
00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:30.470
<v Speaker 1>you had that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was not good.</v>

1193
00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:31.333
<v Speaker 1>You also had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's also an economic timing </v>

1194
00:52:33.051 --> 00:52:36.530
<v Speaker 1>issue and you had this oil crisis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a recession.</v>

1195
00:52:36.531 --> 00:52:38.640
<v Speaker 1>You have all these bad things happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

1196
00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:39.613
<v Speaker 1>well that's carter's fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was also when they ruined </v>

1197
00:52:41.211 --> 00:52:42.860
<v Speaker 1>american cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1198
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:47.810
<v Speaker 1>They all turned to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>American cars in 19 sixties up until the</v>

1199
00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:48.800
<v Speaker 1>early seventies were fucking awesome.</v>

1200
00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:49.663
<v Speaker 1>They're the best looking cars and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this day they're like the biggest </v>

1201
00:52:52.341 --> 00:52:53.174
<v Speaker 1>collector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cars like barracudas and corvettes and </v>

1202
00:52:55.521 --> 00:52:58.470
<v Speaker 1>all those old cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as that gas crisis hit,</v>

1203
00:52:58.471 --> 00:52:59.900
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those cars turned to shit.</v>

1204
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:02.840
<v Speaker 1>While also same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time there's a gas crisis,</v>

1205
00:53:02.841 --> 00:53:04.940
<v Speaker 1>so that's when the japanese cars became </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>

1206
00:53:04.941 --> 00:53:05.774
<v Speaker 1>That's when it's the exact same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the suv where the highest </v>

1207
00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.153
<v Speaker 1>sellers before the last oil crisis or </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the went through the roof and then </v>

1208
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:18.500
<v Speaker 1>that's when the prius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't,</v>

1209
00:53:18.501 --> 00:53:19.334
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't make them fast enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was exactly the same thing that </v>

1210
00:53:22.251 --> 00:53:24.920
<v Speaker 1>happened in the late seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think anyway,</v>

1211
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 1>it was a princess is a</v>

1212
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.150
<v Speaker 2>far better car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the 19 eighties,</v>

1213
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.970
<v Speaker 2>the dislike taken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took one of the best cars ever.</v>

1214
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Like the from steve mcqueen bullet.</v>

1262
00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:48.243
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you and you have to have guaranteed </v>

1263
00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:52.650
<v Speaker 1>sort of protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at europe,</v>

1264
00:55:52.651 --> 00:55:54.180
<v Speaker 1>it's quite interesting because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1265
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:55.590
<v Speaker 1>when they sort of said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1266
00:55:55.591 --> 00:55:56.390
<v Speaker 1>we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1267
00:55:56.390 --> 00:56:00.090
<v Speaker 1>we were going to protect this area and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to.</v>

1268
00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:02.190
<v Speaker 1>There was an economic benefit for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

1269
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:03.203
<v Speaker 1>You had all the little groups start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say like scotland or the basque </v>

1270
00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:08.280
<v Speaker 1>country's or catalonia or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different say,</v>

1271
00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:10.530
<v Speaker 1>well we want to split off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1272
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Because it's more democratic to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller sort of runnable countries that.</v>

1273
00:56:16.891 --> 00:56:17.724
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we want to have our own thing </v>

1274
00:56:18.331 --> 00:56:19.980
<v Speaker 1>because we'll be part of this bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1275
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:21.203
<v Speaker 1>but we want to be more democratic and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's quite because you have </v>

1276
00:56:23.711 --> 00:56:24.544
<v Speaker 1>these super national political entities </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of guarantee safety and </v>

1277
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:30.160
<v Speaker 1>economic security and then therefore </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much more democratic.</v>

1278
00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:31.630
<v Speaker 1>So you sort of sit there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1279
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:35.560
<v Speaker 1>well if that's the case then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that guarantee security.</v>

1280
00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:37.120
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do you do that?</v>

1281
00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Well this is the ultimate goal and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to take several generations and</v>

1282
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:47.970
<v Speaker 2>all nations treat each other now because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are so big and we are so connected.</v>

1283
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Treat each other now as one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one organism,</v>

1284
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:53.583
<v Speaker 2>one gigantic super organism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human race and all this country </v>

1285
00:56:56.741 --> 00:56:57.574
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let difficult to be back and we'll have </v>

1286
00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.850
<v Speaker 2>an insanely it almost impossible to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1287
00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:02.693
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying</v>

1288
00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:06.340
<v Speaker 1>unless there's a w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where was I going to go back to?</v>

1289
00:57:06.341 --> 00:57:10.900
<v Speaker 1>It was like we're great at like war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when there's a world fuck we got to</v>

1290
00:57:10.901 --> 00:57:14.470
<v Speaker 1>go get them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what if or let's say,</v>

1291
00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:16.360
<v Speaker 1>so I view it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

1292
00:57:16.361 --> 00:57:18.820
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's a fucking asteroid </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming towards us,</v>

1293
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:20.410
<v Speaker 1>like we're going to put all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>global,</v>

1294
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:21.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a movie.</v>

1295
00:57:21.401 --> 00:57:23.010
<v Speaker 1>We're going to put everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smartest guys,</v>

1296
00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:23.853
<v Speaker 1>the russian guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chinese guys and us and everybody's </v>

1297
00:57:25.121 --> 00:57:28.690
<v Speaker 1>going to go off and do this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if that's the case,</v>

1298
00:57:28.691 --> 00:57:31.390
<v Speaker 1>and I always say humans aren't going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>move unless we have a gun to her head,</v>

1299
00:57:31.930 --> 00:57:35.710
<v Speaker 1>but at some point what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say greenland,</v>

1300
00:57:35.711 --> 00:57:40.330
<v Speaker 1>a big chunk about four feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miami goes away and everybody goes,</v>

1301
00:57:40.331 --> 00:57:42.610
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we got to do something.</v>

1302
00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:44.770
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody goes,</v>

1303
00:57:44.771 --> 00:57:46.570
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1304
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.730
<v Speaker 1>because if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if miami goes away,</v>

1305
00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:49.564
<v Speaker 1>shanghai goes away.</v>

1306
00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.480
<v Speaker 1>So then shang shanghai goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes away.</v>

1307
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:54.150
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

1308
00:57:54.151 --> 00:57:54.984
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's going to get together and </v>

1309
00:57:55.541 --> 00:57:56.374
<v Speaker 1>say shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oceans rise and we got to do </v>

1310
00:57:58.451 --> 00:57:59.820
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We gotta do something right now.</v>

1311
00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:02.440
<v Speaker 1>But there's always gonna be people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are ignoring that and profiting.</v>

1312
00:58:02.441 --> 00:58:03.274
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else can take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start drilling and they're going </v>

1313
00:58:04.871 --> 00:58:06.500
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to do that short.</v>

1314
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if mumbai goes away,</v>

1315
00:58:09.881 --> 00:58:11.920
<v Speaker 1>miami goes away in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes away,</v>

1316
00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:13.170
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the seed,</v>

1317
00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:15.910
<v Speaker 1>the big seat next to the cease cities go</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

1318
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Now this is interesting because when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were shooting this a doc on on sea level</v>

1319
00:58:22.061 --> 00:58:22.894
<v Speaker 1>rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's damning to oil </v>

1320
00:58:24.971 --> 00:58:26.340
<v Speaker 1>companies is they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1321
00:58:26.341 --> 00:58:27.174
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know science has not decided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't fucking know while this was </v>

1322
00:58:30.911 --> 00:58:31.630
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

1323
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:32.463
<v Speaker 1>They raised spending hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars more billions of </v>

1324
00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:36.483
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They raised all their oil platforms by </v>

1325
00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.200
<v Speaker 1>eight feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1326
00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:41.493
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they didn't want them getting </v>

1327
00:58:42.581 --> 00:58:47.581
<v Speaker 1>sunk because jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outside prediction so that they have</v>

1328
00:58:47.681 --> 00:58:49.490
<v Speaker 1>to last 80 years for insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1329
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:50.343
<v Speaker 1>for the life of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the outside prediction For 100 years </v>

1330
00:58:53.261 --> 00:58:55.030
<v Speaker 1>was eight feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's four feet,</v>

1331
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:57.610
<v Speaker 1>three feet to four feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the outside is eight feet.</v>

1332
00:58:58.210 --> 00:58:58.961
<v Speaker 1>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1333
00:58:58.961 --> 00:59:01.850
<v Speaker 1>well just do eight feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they know.</v>

1334
00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:06.250
<v Speaker 1>So they know if you don't raise </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and pay hundreds of dollars to</v>

1335
00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:09.280
<v Speaker 1>raise it eight feet by eight feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not four feet?</v>

1336
00:59:09.281 --> 00:59:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Why not three feet wide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 feet in any case?</v>

1337
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.560
<v Speaker 1>So you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is is you sit there and say,</v>

1338
00:59:14.561 --> 00:59:16.660
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight feet at four feet,</v>

1339
00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:18.580
<v Speaker 1>miami's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New york's gone.</v>

1340
00:59:18.581 --> 00:59:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Shane at eight feet were all sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1341
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably gets to paint canyon fucking</v>

1342
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:27.530
<v Speaker 1>eight feet.</v>

1343
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:30.140
<v Speaker 1>It probably gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at that point humanity goes,</v>

1344
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:31.350
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need taylor,</v>

1345
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.660
<v Speaker 1>we need ilan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we did a.</v>

1346
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:33.943
<v Speaker 1>And so that's an interesting point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that ultimately what is gonna </v>

1347
00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:40.520
<v Speaker 1>happen and it may take 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may take 500 years.</v>

1348
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:41.743
<v Speaker 1>I think ultimately we're going to reach </v>
<v Speaker 1>a technologically driven state of </v>

1349
00:59:45.591 --> 00:59:49.340
<v Speaker 1>evolution that bypasses our biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

1350
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:52.160
<v Speaker 1>So I've got an answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1351
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:53.233
<v Speaker 1>Half the world will do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the other half the world goes the </v>

1352
00:59:57.621 --> 01:00:00.800
<v Speaker 1>opposite way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what's happening now,</v>

1353
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's not happening now with cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>

1354
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Cell phones have gone all over the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if this,</v>

1355
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:06.583
<v Speaker 1>if we can achieve a technology that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows people to understand each other </v>

1356
01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.830
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's way more way,</v>

1357
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:18.320
<v Speaker 1>way deeper and more intimate than just </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting to know somebody.</v>

1358
01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:20.150
<v Speaker 1>They talked to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talked to me,</v>

1359
01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:21.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we,</v>

1360
01:00:21.441 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 1>you and I have been friends for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time now and every time I see a give you</v>

1361
01:00:24.981 --> 01:00:25.940
<v Speaker 1>a big hug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1362
01:00:25.941 --> 01:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I see shane.</v>

1363
01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give him a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I associate you with my friend.</v>

1364
01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.240
<v Speaker 1>It's happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot of great talks.</v>

1365
01:00:32.241 --> 01:00:34.430
<v Speaker 1>We get drunk together and that's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>built in,</v>

1366
01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a while to establish that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1367
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:37.243
<v Speaker 1>It takes a while to make a bond between </v>
<v Speaker 1>two people who enjoy each other's </v>

1368
01:00:40.191 --> 01:00:41.024
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we could all this whole world </v>

1369
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:46.460
<v Speaker 1>could be a bunch of friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds crazy,</v>

1370
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:49.850
<v Speaker 1>but it can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be done in small groups.</v>

1371
01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.160
<v Speaker 1>It can be done in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be done in this town.</v>

1372
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're facing extinction,</v>

1373
01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it can be done otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I.</v>

1374
01:00:57.290 --> 01:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>What I see happening to go back to if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have war,</v>

1375
01:01:00.391 --> 01:01:03.650
<v Speaker 1>like global war we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this eating ourselves.</v>

1376
01:01:03.651 --> 01:01:04.880
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the world,</v>

1377
01:01:04.881 --> 01:01:09.881
<v Speaker 1>you have half the world roughly saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology can fix us.</v>

1378
01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.173
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go to mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna have little pellets of </v>

1379
01:01:13.311 --> 01:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>things which are going to feed 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>houses.</v>

1380
01:01:15.981 --> 01:01:16.814
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the other half of the </v>

1381
01:01:19.071 --> 01:01:22.850
<v Speaker 1>world that saying fuck reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1382
01:01:22.851 --> 01:01:27.851
<v Speaker 1>fuck technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going back to another time.</v>

1383
01:01:28.011 --> 01:01:28.844
<v Speaker 1>And not just not just the muslim world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have lots of different groups in </v>

1384
01:01:32.631 --> 01:01:34.710
<v Speaker 1>africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have lots of different groups in and</v>

1385
01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:35.623
<v Speaker 1>obviously the middle east you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>different groups who are saying fuck </v>

1386
01:01:37.221 --> 01:01:38.240
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing that.</v>

1387
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:39.463
<v Speaker 1>And so they're moving away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have this sort of duopoly in the </v>

1388
01:01:42.411 --> 01:01:43.244
<v Speaker 1>world of people who are going one way </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the people who are going the other </v>

1389
01:01:45.531 --> 01:01:47.840
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that unless you have a</v>

1390
01:01:47.841 --> 01:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>common goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is by the way,</v>

1391
01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:52.640
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to die unless we do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1392
01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:56.420
<v Speaker 1>that everybody does it and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>star trek and star trek,</v>

1393
01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:57.254
<v Speaker 1>they did this thing where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where everybody from the world is </v>

1394
01:01:59.781 --> 01:02:00.614
<v Speaker 1>finally together and then we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>working together for this great thing </v>

1395
01:02:02.421 --> 01:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>which is exploring space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they needed that whole,</v>

1396
01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:09.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus that goal and I think we need that</v>

1397
01:02:09.111 --> 01:02:10.730
<v Speaker 1>focus and that go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why,</v>

1398
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.080
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go back to war zones,</v>

1399
01:02:12.081 --> 01:02:13.340
<v Speaker 1>when you go to war zones says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

1400
01:02:13.341 --> 01:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't be fucking dropping bombs </v>
<v Speaker 1>on each other.</v>

1401
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.360
<v Speaker 1>And then when you go and talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>

1402
01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:17.841
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1403
01:02:17.841 --> 01:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>it's coming and it's coming fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>

1404
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that I'm not like this crazy dude or</v>

1405
01:02:24.121 --> 01:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a regular dude going,</v>

1406
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:26.303
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because I talk to these scientists </v>

1407
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just did this thing in Russia where,</v>

1408
01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know about this,</v>

1409
01:02:34.681 --> 01:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>but the permafrost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you heard about the permafrost,</v>

1410
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:37.493
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the carbon in the permafrost is </v>

1411
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>released.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be released as melting and</v>

1412
01:02:41.611 --> 01:02:45.230
<v Speaker 1>so it releases carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually releases methane,</v>

1413
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.073
<v Speaker 1>which is 20 times worse than carbon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more carbon in the permafrost </v>

1414
01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.140
<v Speaker 1>than all of the carbon that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>released since the industrial revolution</v>

1415
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:56.003
<v Speaker 1>started because it's a bunch of dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinGs that have died up there for </v>

1416
01:02:59.791 --> 01:03:01.160
<v Speaker 1>millions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1417
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.500
<v Speaker 1>And all that's going to get warmed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

1418
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:08.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's gonna be a bunch of stinky dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies and animal shit.</v>

1419
01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to know two interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about that?</v>

1420
01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got two interesting things about that.</v>

1421
01:03:13.951 --> 01:03:18.951
<v Speaker 1>One is we went up to lakes in both </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia and the arctic and you pop a hole</v>

1422
01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:21.564
<v Speaker 1>in the lake and you put a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put a like a torch in and it shoots </v>

1423
01:03:24.331 --> 01:03:25.890
<v Speaker 1>out like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an oil flare.</v>

1424
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1425
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that because there's methane </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lake,</v>

1426
01:03:30.511 --> 01:03:33.540
<v Speaker 1>in the water and it just shooting out </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an oil flair.</v>

1427
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:34.920
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1428
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:38.070
<v Speaker 1>A b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is gonna sound crazy.</v>

1429
01:03:38.071 --> 01:03:42.960
<v Speaker 1>But it's actually fucking true in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we go to siberia and we hang out with</v>

1430
01:03:42.961 --> 01:03:44.640
<v Speaker 1>this dude who's been living in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>permafrost,</v>

1431
01:03:44.641 --> 01:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>he's like the world's biggest expert on </v>
<v Speaker 1>permafrost and it's scientists,</v>

1432
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:50.460
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's all these slumps,</v>

1433
01:03:50.461 --> 01:03:52.800
<v Speaker 1>like they have the biggest slump in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1434
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:53.910
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>

1435
01:03:53.911 --> 01:03:54.744
<v Speaker 1>in a slump.</v>

1436
01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:59.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's where the permafrost melts in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The permafrost is like frozen ground,</v>

1437
01:03:59.311 --> 01:04:02.070
<v Speaker 1>like dirt and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also frozen water.</v>

1438
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:05.940
<v Speaker 1>And so when it melts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water goes away and the ground which</v>

1439
01:04:05.941 --> 01:04:09.810
<v Speaker 1>has left sort of slump and it goes down </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 20 or 30 feet.</v>

1440
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:12.130
<v Speaker 1>And so you just had these all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>siberia.</v>

1441
01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.590
<v Speaker 1>You have these huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like two,</v>

1442
01:04:13.591 --> 01:04:14.730
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four mile wide,</v>

1443
01:04:14.731 --> 01:04:17.420
<v Speaker 1>just like craters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1444
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.160
<v Speaker 1>And so he's there and he's like the sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of foremost expert.</v>

1445
01:04:23.161 --> 01:04:25.860
<v Speaker 1>And what's interesting about is he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look in the ice age,</v>

1446
01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:27.900
<v Speaker 1>here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were not that many humans,</v>

1447
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:31.500
<v Speaker 1>but there were millions upon millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and they were like elk.</v>

1448
01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:32.334
<v Speaker 1>And there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1449
01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:35.430
<v Speaker 1>caribou and all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the wooly mammoth.</v>

1450
01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.293
<v Speaker 1>You know what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ate all the fucking shrubs and the </v>

1451
01:04:38.881 --> 01:04:41.010
<v Speaker 1>trees and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which actually,</v>

1452
01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:42.363
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made the ground freeze much deeper </v>

1453
01:04:45.001 --> 01:04:47.940
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot of things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark sort of,</v>

1454
01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:48.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brings in a heat and it takes the </v>

1455
01:04:52.171 --> 01:04:52.890
<v Speaker 1>installation away.</v>

1456
01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:54.280
<v Speaker 1>All theSe stuffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foliage is not,</v>

1457
01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:57.480
<v Speaker 1>the sun beats directly down to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

1458
01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:00.960
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he no because no,</v>

1459
01:05:00.961 --> 01:05:04.800
<v Speaker 1>because the trees bringing the heat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold it in the act,</v>

1460
01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:08.820
<v Speaker 1>it freezes more in the winter and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore stays colder in any case.</v>

1461
01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:10.231
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1462
01:05:10.231 --> 01:05:11.064
<v Speaker 1>here's what we have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to put millions of caribou and </v>

1463
01:05:13.021 --> 01:05:18.021
<v Speaker 1>millions of horses and millions of elk </v>
<v Speaker 1>can stop up in siberia.</v>

1464
01:05:18.851 --> 01:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>But he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's yeah,</v>

1465
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:21.130
<v Speaker 1>that'll get you 60 percent of the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1466
01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:25.540
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that'll get us really </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is the fucking woolly mammoth.</v>

1467
01:05:25.541 --> 01:05:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Now this is not a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1468
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>So ironically they found a woolly </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammoth,</v>

1469
01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:32.943
<v Speaker 1>perfectly preserved in the permafrost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it fell into a fucking lake and </v>

1470
01:05:36.551 --> 01:05:40.300
<v Speaker 1>froze and never a thought out thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they,</v>

1471
01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:43.600
<v Speaker 1>then they opened it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still had red cells living cells.</v>

1472
01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.350
<v Speaker 1>So you know they're doing this is we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

1473
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.880
<v Speaker 1>we shot this and I was watching this </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my mouth on the ground.</v>

1474
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:54.390
<v Speaker 1>They're cloning the wooly mAmmoths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skin found well preserved and permafrost</v>

1475
01:05:55.791 --> 01:05:58.150
<v Speaker 1>gives new hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trump look up the trunk.</v>

1476
01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Look up the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a trunk.</v>

1477
01:06:01.061 --> 01:06:03.610
<v Speaker 1>They have a full jesus look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look it up there,</v>

1478
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>the image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a full truck look up.</v>

1479
01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Woolly mammoth trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1480
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Because they have this full trunk that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1481
01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.020
<v Speaker 1>that there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1482
01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:15.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1483
01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:18.310
<v Speaker 1>They have a trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a full trunk.</v>

1484
01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:21.460
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to clone using tusk,</v>

1485
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:22.920
<v Speaker 1>tusk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

1486
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:24.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a trunk.</v>

1487
01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Why did it pull up tusk hunters for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing.</v>

1488
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:29.290
<v Speaker 1>ThAt's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to say anyway,</v>

1489
01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:31.510
<v Speaker 1>so they're cloning either with the south</v>
<v Speaker 1>koreans.</v>

1490
01:06:31.511 --> 01:06:36.400
<v Speaker 1>They're cloning mammoths in the hopes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're just going to put all these</v>

1491
01:06:36.401 --> 01:06:39.010
<v Speaker 1>clones of mammoths up there and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to freeze.</v>

1492
01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:41.920
<v Speaker 1>The permafrost is just make more shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more dead animals,</v>

1493
01:06:41.921 --> 01:06:44.380
<v Speaker 1>which makes more methane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so confused.</v>

1494
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.333
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount that they would make versus </v>

1495
01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:52.030
<v Speaker 1>the amount of methane that's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>released from the permafrost,</v>

1496
01:06:52.031 --> 01:06:52.864
<v Speaker 1>which has been collecting this shit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking millions of years because </v>

1497
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:58.900
<v Speaker 1>diminimous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is they're going to beat the</v>

1498
01:06:58.901 --> 01:07:02.080
<v Speaker 1>fuck out of all the vegetation that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool the area down.</v>

1499
01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1500
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:04.543
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they just make ice cubes and </v>

1501
01:07:07.241 --> 01:07:10.000
<v Speaker 1>just dumped them out of helicopters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like just as good evaluator.</v>

1502
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:11.263
<v Speaker 1>It'll make fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another guy we need for our </v>

1503
01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:15.580
<v Speaker 1>council is this fucking crazy russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude who's just up there saying,</v>

1504
01:07:15.581 --> 01:07:17.470
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get some mammoths to fix us.</v>

1505
01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:18.773
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that'll get you 60 percent of the </v>

1506
01:07:19.631 --> 01:07:21.490
<v Speaker 1>way there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still 40 percent fucked.</v>

1507
01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:23.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with us we Get 90 percent.</v>

1508
01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the 60 percent.</v>

1509
01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Sixty percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1510
01:07:27.491 --> 01:07:28.870
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the trunk.</v>

1511
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.730
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so crazy.</v>

1512
01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.440
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1513
01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.140
<v Speaker 1>they have a good chance of successfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>colonial.</v>

1514
01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:37.480
<v Speaker 1>They have south koreans and the russians</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the russians are moving very fast on</v>

1515
01:07:37.481 --> 01:07:40.420
<v Speaker 1>this because they realized that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>permafrost melts,</v>

1516
01:07:40.421 --> 01:07:41.254
<v Speaker 1>they're screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do they keep this thing in a frozen </v>

1517
01:07:43.121 --> 01:07:44.050
<v Speaker 1>room?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do,</v>

1518
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.150
<v Speaker 1>we filmed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we filmed them trying to clone it.</v>

1519
01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy time to be alive.</v>

1520
01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:51.083
<v Speaker 1>So amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what's amazing about that is </v>

1521
01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:52.691
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1522
01:07:52.691 --> 01:07:54.100
<v Speaker 1>we're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The permafrost to melt.</v>

1523
01:07:54.101 --> 01:07:55.420
<v Speaker 1>We're all doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're like,</v>

1524
01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:59.040
<v Speaker 1>but we can get some fucking woolly </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammoths and mammoths.</v>

1525
01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:02.770
<v Speaker 1>You need to make saber tooth tigers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just for the fuck of it.</v>

1526
01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there could be an argument there because</v>

1527
01:08:05.111 --> 01:08:05.950
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1528
01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:06.813
<v Speaker 1>who's going to eat the mammoth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we actually talked to nasa and </v>

1529
01:08:08.381 --> 01:08:09.400
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this guy crazy?</v>

1530
01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.233
<v Speaker 1>As he liked don quixote tilting at </v>
<v Speaker 1>windmills and he said actually the </v>

1531
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.960
<v Speaker 1>environmental or the organic solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than dropping ice cubes,</v>

1532
01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 1>that all coverage is the best solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it used to be that 40,000</v>

1533
01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:25.220
<v Speaker 1>years ago this shit regulated itself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is when the planet was cold.</v>

1534
01:08:25.221 --> 01:08:26.054
<v Speaker 1>Now it's too fucking hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a way to get back to being </v>

1535
01:08:28.701 --> 01:08:30.230
<v Speaker 1>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it actually makes sense.</v>

1536
01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>So we need that guy really that he's on </v>
<v Speaker 1>our council.</v>

1537
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.903
<v Speaker 1>We need some people from other countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're gonna get mad at us </v>

1538
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:37.820
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1539
01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>well maybe we shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should have our fucking country</v>

1540
01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:42.720
<v Speaker 1>figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too.</v>

1541
01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.320
<v Speaker 1>It's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll spend into fix the world.</v>

1542
01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I think you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need,</v>

1543
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:50.000
<v Speaker 1>you need other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we need some checks?</v>

1544
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.863
<v Speaker 1>Go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go get some checks on their chicks are </v>

1545
01:08:52.221 --> 01:08:52.820

<v Speaker 1>she's great at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at getting a message across.</v>

1554

1568
01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.033
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it good to call joe Biden to </v>

1582
01:10:08.931 --> 01:10:13.931
<v Speaker 1>relations and understanding people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our religious ideologies.</v>

1583
01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:18.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who else?</v>

1584
01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Sitting down the super liberals get mad </v>
<v Speaker 1>at you for that is not hilarious.</v>

1585
01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Have you read any criticisms of her </v>
<v Speaker 1>know?</v>

1586
01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:29.053
<v Speaker 1>So people that just go so far left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they spun around and their noses up the </v>

1587
01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:34.000
<v Speaker 1>rights ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so confused.</v>

1588
01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:34.873
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing is we're the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left goes so far left and the right </v>

1589
01:10:37.041 --> 01:10:39.650
<v Speaker 1>and the rest goes so far as calls it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1590
01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.513
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1591
01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:44.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like tHis black lives matter going </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the women's march thing.</v>

1592
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody relax one hand though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to Admit though,</v>

1593
01:10:47.751 --> 01:10:48.584
<v Speaker 1>I read the thing and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would they complain about people </v>

1594
01:10:50.901 --> 01:10:51.734
<v Speaker 1>supporting this women's march?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they complain about something </v>

1595
01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:55.310
<v Speaker 1>good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other part of me went,</v>

1596
01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if you were them manage.</v>

1597
01:10:57.381 --> 01:10:59.720
<v Speaker 1>If you were them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're protesting against people getting</v>

1598
01:10:59.721 --> 01:11:00.554
<v Speaker 1>shot and killed by cops and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make a movement out of that </v>

1599
01:11:04.641 --> 01:11:06.350
<v Speaker 1>and you don't get near the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>traction.</v>

1600
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:07.423
<v Speaker 1>Nowhere near the kind of positive press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the other part of me goes back to </v>

1601
01:11:10.761 --> 01:11:11.594

<v Speaker 1>wearing.</v>

1607
01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:31.080
<v Speaker 1>our cops rather were wearing them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women were taking pictures because,</v>

1608
01:11:31.081 --> 01:11:32.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit there and you say,</v>

1609
01:11:32.161 --> 01:11:32.880
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

<v Speaker 1>people can do this and we can do it </v>

1611
01:11:34.561 --> 01:11:38.340
<v Speaker 1>peacefully and we can it rationally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all at the end of the day.</v>

1612
01:11:38.341 --> 01:11:41.810
<v Speaker 1>We're all in the same boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was talking the street.</v>

1613
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:42.953
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's enough people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't racist that you could pull </v>

1614
01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:47.034
<v Speaker 1>something like that off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's more common to be </v>

1615
01:11:49.381 --> 01:11:54.381
<v Speaker 1>racist than it is to be sexist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1616
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I will say the universe does things a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1617
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:01.490
<v Speaker 1>for a reason I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had a,</v>

1618
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I have two amazing daughters and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed my life and it changed the way I</v>

1619
01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:05.843
<v Speaker 1>view the world and it changed the way I </v>
<v Speaker 1>see things and it's why I look at that </v>

1620
01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:11.010
<v Speaker 1>march and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great thing.</v>

1621
01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:12.480
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1622
01:12:12.481 --> 01:12:12.781
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1623
01:12:12.781 --> 01:12:14.040
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it definitely,</v>

1624
01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:17.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it alters how you think about things for</v>

1625
01:12:17.491 --> 01:12:18.324
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also alters how you think about the </v>

1626
01:12:19.651 --> 01:12:21.390
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of people are like,</v>

1627
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:22.343
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>level orange is not going to fucking do </v>

1628
01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:25.710
<v Speaker 1>anything in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have kids,</v>

1629
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:27.180
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1630
01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.313
<v Speaker 1>I want my kid to go swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want a kid to go in a </v>

1631
01:12:31.531 --> 01:12:32.710
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only one.</v>

1632
01:12:32.711 --> 01:12:34.290
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're adults.</v>

1633
01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.193
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gotta we gotta pick up her own shit </v>

1634
01:12:36.361 --> 01:12:38.130
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>

1635
01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:40.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1636
01:12:40.681 --> 01:12:41.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should,</v>

1637
01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:43.013
<v Speaker 1>we will submit our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a council of elders idea to the world </v>

1638
01:12:46.051 --> 01:12:49.320
<v Speaker 1>via the internet and see if we get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion votes,</v>

1639
01:12:49.321 --> 01:12:52.200
<v Speaker 1>then I think everybody has to adopt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1640
01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.034
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we get to sort of be special </v>

1641
01:12:54.691 --> 01:12:55.524
<v Speaker 1>advisors.</v>

1642
01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I seriously think this could actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen one day.</v>

1643
01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:00.180
<v Speaker 1>It might not happen in our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1644
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:03.480
<v Speaker 1>who's a good politician that people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>and would fucking follow a good vibe.</v>

1645
01:13:03.481 --> 01:13:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Ron paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joe biden,</v>

1646
01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you know,</v>

1647
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.313
<v Speaker 1>joe biden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to have joe biden night at </v>

1648
01:13:08.641 --> 01:13:09.474
<v Speaker 1>stitches comedy club back in boston </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we would plagiarize each other's </v>

1649
01:13:11.701 --> 01:13:12.534
<v Speaker 1>material because joe biden got busted </v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches when he was running for </v>

1650
01:13:15.661 --> 01:13:18.060
<v Speaker 1>president eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1651
01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's kinda forgot about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems like a fairly decent dude,</v>

1652
01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:24.300
<v Speaker 1>although a little odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1653
01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:26.400
<v Speaker 1>You want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want a little bit odd.</v>

1654
01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:28.380
<v Speaker 1>But you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever vice president,</v>

1655
01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:29.031
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1656
01:13:29.031 --> 01:13:30.750
<v Speaker 1>it has to do with fucking smile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1657
01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:31.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to.</v>

1658
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:32.441
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1659
01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:35.130
<v Speaker 1>nobody blamed for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Volumes are mainly like,</v>

1660
01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:37.830
<v Speaker 1>to me it's kind of a favorite one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that made him.</v>

1661
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:40.650
<v Speaker 1>If the mems had come out before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>

1662
01:13:40.651 --> 01:13:41.730
<v Speaker 1>he could have won that with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1663
01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:42.613
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite one was biden throwing his </v>

1664
01:13:44.461 --> 01:13:46.170
<v Speaker 1>head back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing is that he goes,</v>

1665
01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:48.330
<v Speaker 1>and then I said to hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did the same thing.</v>

1666
01:13:48.331 --> 01:13:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Monica did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you blew it.</v>

1667
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:52.890
<v Speaker 1>And then then obama says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1668
01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:53.910
<v Speaker 1>she kills people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1669
01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that picture,</v>

1670
01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:00.653
<v Speaker 1>that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they use that with a bunch of </v>

1671
01:14:01.951 --> 01:14:03.820
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad.</v>

1672
01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:05.580
<v Speaker 1>So fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

1673
01:14:05.581 --> 01:14:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1674
01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.770
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

1675
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.823
<v Speaker 1>But I think that what I'm saying about </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology is I think we're way more </v>

1676
01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:16.384
<v Speaker 1>connected as human beings than we ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been before and I think a lot of </v>

1677
01:14:19.031 --> 01:14:19.864
<v Speaker 1>this crazy super social justice warrior </v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive shit that you're seeing </v>

1678
01:14:24.011 --> 01:14:26.290
<v Speaker 1>today where it's getting so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>

1679
01:14:26.291 --> 01:14:27.124
<v Speaker 1>far outreaches of it are so out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all of this is possible and all </v>

1680
01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:34.240
<v Speaker 1>of this is because of this new found </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

1681
01:14:34.241 --> 01:14:36.720
<v Speaker 1>We have to communicate with each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just previously just.</v>

1682
01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:38.920
<v Speaker 1>I've got a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1683
01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:40.323
<v Speaker 1>So you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you like we have this </v>

1684
01:14:43.301 --> 01:14:46.940
<v Speaker 1>ability to connect all day everyday and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be yours.</v>

1685
01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:50.540
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get crazier and we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't connect more and more connected.</v>

1686
01:14:50.541 --> 01:14:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Is this is just the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this?</v>

1687
01:14:52.961 --> 01:14:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Augmented reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yes.</v>

1688
01:14:55.150 --> 01:14:56.650

<v Speaker 1>so augmented,</v>

1705
01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:38.800

1716
01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.900
<v Speaker 1>this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1717
01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:03.850
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1718
01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:05.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a tv and you're watching tv in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your room.</v>

1719
01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:06.813
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

1720
01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:07.813
<v Speaker 1>And they're like putting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only a tv because your brain is </v>

1721
01:16:10.061 --> 01:16:13.270
<v Speaker 1>used to it being a tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get used to it will just flip a</v>

1722
01:16:13.271 --> 01:16:15.370
<v Speaker 1>button and you're on the 50 yard line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1723
01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:16.630
<v Speaker 1>it can be anything.</v>

1724
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:17.600
<v Speaker 1>It can be any size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1725
01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.360
<v Speaker 1>you can do the art and the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1726
01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:23.920
<v Speaker 1>now that's for tv watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was developed for like a media thing,</v>

1727
01:16:23.921 --> 01:16:26.020
<v Speaker 1>like it could be movies or tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're like,</v>

1728
01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:27.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be your phone.</v>

1729
01:16:27.251 --> 01:16:29.140
<v Speaker 1>It can be your computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be everything.</v>

1730
01:16:29.141 --> 01:16:31.270
<v Speaker 1>So everything is going to be in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses,</v>

1731
01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:32.830
<v Speaker 1>a camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1732
01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.580
<v Speaker 1>You control it with this little thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's you.</v>

1733
01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:37.530
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1734
01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:38.291
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1735
01:16:38.291 --> 01:16:40.480
<v Speaker 1>your media is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your phone is there,</v>

1736
01:16:40.481 --> 01:16:41.800
<v Speaker 1>your computers there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's there.</v>

1737
01:16:41.801 --> 01:16:43.990
<v Speaker 1>and it's just this connectivity that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>always there.</v>

1738
01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:46.150
<v Speaker 1>It's always on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>

1739
01:16:46.570 --> 01:16:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Now there's all kinds of ethical things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how's that going to change humanity,</v>

1740
01:16:49.481 --> 01:16:51.310
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who cares is going to happen because</v>

1741
01:16:51.311 --> 01:16:53.830
<v Speaker 1>the technology's there and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than a phone.</v>

1742
01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:55.593
<v Speaker 1>Now once that connectivity happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go back to your point is there's a </v>

1743
01:17:00.341 --> 01:17:03.250
<v Speaker 1>power in there for positivity and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>

1744
01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:05.230
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1745
01:17:05.231 --> 01:17:07.110
<v Speaker 1>social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1746
01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:12.050
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that is destroying </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter is they can't keep like the,</v>

1747
01:17:12.130 --> 01:17:12.951
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

1748
01:17:12.951 --> 01:17:14.750
<v Speaker 1>the fake news on facebook and all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1749
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:18.620
<v Speaker 1>they can't police it is to mom people is</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many people,</v>

1750
01:17:18.621 --> 01:17:20.570
<v Speaker 1>too much shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like bad people.</v>

1751
01:17:20.571 --> 01:17:22.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just people to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's got an opinion.</v>

1752
01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:25.280
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're across the table,</v>

1753
01:17:25.281 --> 01:17:27.070
<v Speaker 1>the reason why we eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why we have feast,</v>

1754
01:17:27.071 --> 01:17:29.360
<v Speaker 1>the reason why we do all this shit just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you're eating together,</v>

1755
01:17:29.361 --> 01:17:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you form social bonds and all this shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

1756
01:17:31.371 --> 01:17:32.950
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to kill you because we had</v>

1757
01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:33.830
<v Speaker 1>a beer together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1758
01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:37.700
<v Speaker 1>But when you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just this anonymous,</v>

1759
01:17:37.701 --> 01:17:39.560
<v Speaker 1>I can say and do whatever the fuck I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

1760
01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:44.150
<v Speaker 1>It just becomes like crazy and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes fun for people there.</v>

1761
01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.433
<v Speaker 1>Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fIfty five to two a asshole and then </v>

1762
01:17:47.721 --> 01:17:49.470
<v Speaker 1>they decided to fuck with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1763
01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.170
<v Speaker 1>if it's fun for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little game,</v>

1764
01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:52.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1765
01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to this radio lab pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1766
01:17:55.311 --> 01:17:56.720
<v Speaker 1>it was an article I was reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

1767
01:17:56.900 --> 01:18:01.900
<v Speaker 1>And it was about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who had been stalked online by his</v>

1768
01:18:03.411 --> 01:18:06.620
<v Speaker 1>friend's son and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

1769
01:18:06.621 --> 01:18:07.454
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got to the point where this guy was </v>

1770
01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:10.950
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were doing all,</v>

1771
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.863
<v Speaker 1>he was doing all sorts of horrible shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sending them a horrible evil </v>

1772
01:18:14.931 --> 01:18:16.370
<v Speaker 1>messages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were terrified.</v>

1773
01:18:16.371 --> 01:18:17.204
<v Speaker 1>They were all having horrible anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out that it was his </v>

1774
01:18:19.971 --> 01:18:22.940
<v Speaker 1>friend's son and he called the fbi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found for fun.</v>

1775
01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:24.643
<v Speaker 1>He didn't think about what he broke down</v>
<v Speaker 1>crying when they confronted him and it </v>

1776
01:18:26.991 --> 01:18:27.890
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was awful.</v>

1777
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.970
<v Speaker 1>But it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1778
01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:29.804
<v Speaker 1>there's lIke some sort of weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perverse thing that people enjoy doing </v>

1779
01:18:33.591 --> 01:18:35.600
<v Speaker 1>just fucking with someone as a game.</v>

1780
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:39.070
<v Speaker 1>And that all takes place because of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of social interaction.</v>

1781
01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:42.020
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is as those tools,</v>

1782
01:18:42.021 --> 01:18:47.021
<v Speaker 1>let's say augmented reality get more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more powerful than that sort of,</v>

1783
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:50.510
<v Speaker 1>unless it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless we look at that aspect of it,</v>

1784
01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.160
<v Speaker 1>we're all fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

1785
01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:53.053
<v Speaker 1>maybe not though you know it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be you and I are going to be able to </v>

1786
01:18:55.491 --> 01:18:59.150
<v Speaker 1>have this conversation where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere near each other exactly the same</v>

1787
01:18:59.151 --> 01:18:59.984
<v Speaker 1>way that we're having it written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're going to be able to look at </v>

1788
01:19:01.641 --> 01:19:04.700
<v Speaker 1>each other in the eye and have like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a conversation and you are going</v>

1789
01:19:04.701 --> 01:19:05.940
<v Speaker 1>to represent you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1790
01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:06.793
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be some sort of A video</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of you that I will not be able </v>

1791
01:19:09.021 --> 01:19:09.854
<v Speaker 1>to distinguish from you and you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sItting there right now and it won't be </v>

1792
01:19:12.021 --> 01:19:13.910
<v Speaker 1>much different other than physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact.</v>

1793
01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:14.773
<v Speaker 1>There's an interesting point though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is when humans are hungry and </v>

1794
01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:23.420
<v Speaker 1>thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our immediate reaction is no,</v>

1795
01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:27.200
<v Speaker 1>and when we're fed and when we're a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>boozed up,</v>

1796
01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:28.093
<v Speaker 1>the reaction is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why everyone says let's have a </v>

1797
01:19:30.081 --> 01:19:31.810
<v Speaker 1>business lunch or a business dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1798
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:35.600
<v Speaker 1>And also if you look at how we socialize</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the family,</v>

1799
01:19:35.601 --> 01:19:36.434
<v Speaker 1>how we socialize with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you actually look back at your </v>

1800
01:19:38.751 --> 01:19:39.561
<v Speaker 1>history and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1801
01:19:39.561 --> 01:19:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm that guy buddy or my family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1802
01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:45.710
<v Speaker 1>If you look back at the majority of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive memories that you have,</v>

1803
01:19:45.711 --> 01:19:46.544
<v Speaker 1>they're generally at thanksgiving with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the family or christmas with this or we </v>

1804
01:19:49.641 --> 01:19:50.474
<v Speaker 1>got drunk with this guy or we at burgers</v>
<v Speaker 1>late at night or whatever it is because </v>

1805
01:19:53.001 --> 01:19:55.910
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get these sort of endorphin rushes.</v>

1806
01:19:55.911 --> 01:19:56.481
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1807
01:19:56.481 --> 01:20:00.080
<v Speaker 1>we're bonding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think once you take that out,</v>

1808
01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:00.980
<v Speaker 1>and I.</v>

1809
01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:04.430
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because I was taught </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone the other day,</v>

1810
01:20:04.431 --> 01:20:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I was saying the more gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated,</v>

1811
01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:14.430
<v Speaker 1>the more you kind of have to fly because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to have that meeting.</v>

1812
01:20:14.431 --> 01:20:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Like we have the night and call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1813
01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.840
<v Speaker 1>but now you have to fly and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the meal and you have to have to.</v>

1814
01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're doing a big deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody and you don't do that,</v>

1815
01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.220
<v Speaker 1>even though it doesn't make any sense at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1816
01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:29.490
<v Speaker 1>it's become a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's flying way more.</v>

1817
01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:33.380
<v Speaker 1>But ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the technology is seen as non</v>

1818
01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:34.120
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>

1819
01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.480
<v Speaker 2>so there's that in the world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

1820
01:20:35.481 --> 01:20:36.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no kidding.</v>

1821
01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see that coming,</v>

1822
01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:40.470
<v Speaker 2>but it totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1823
01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.113
<v Speaker 2>it completely makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel much different about people when </v>

1824
01:20:43.701 --> 01:20:44.534
<v Speaker 2>I meet them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1825
01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.411
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1826
01:20:45.411 --> 01:20:46.244
<v Speaker 2>and not meeting him even for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even being in communication for a long </v>

1827
01:20:49.191 --> 01:20:51.860
<v Speaker 2>time without meeting them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sort of disassociate.</v>

1828
01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.690
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1829
01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense.</v>

1830
01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Totally does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we,</v>

1831
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.883
<v Speaker 2>that's how we interacted forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that same feeling will </v>

1832
01:21:00.621 --> 01:21:03.620
<v Speaker 2>happen when you're dealing with someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a three d form,</v>

1833
01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:05.960
<v Speaker 2>like a hologram that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>indistinguishable.</v>

1834
01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's coming rapidly.</v>

1835
01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the technology is here now,</v>

1836
01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:11.653
<v Speaker 2>it's just how quick can they make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>into like a thing that everybody can </v>

1837
01:21:14.421 --> 01:21:15.051
<v Speaker 2>buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1838
01:21:15.051 --> 01:21:18.530
<v Speaker 2>How quick can they and what would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what form will it take?</v>

1839
01:21:18.531 --> 01:21:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Because we're just extrapolating from </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they have right now.</v>

1840
01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what form it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>

1841
01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:24.973
<v Speaker 2>Google already has their contact lens </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and nobody thought this whole </v>

1842
01:21:27.651 --> 01:21:29.270
<v Speaker 2>thing was going to happen in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

1843
01:21:29.271 --> 01:21:32.450
<v Speaker 2>This augmented reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wasn't something discussed 20 years</v>

1844
01:21:32.451 --> 01:21:34.160
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was always virtual reality.</v>

1845
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:35.540
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1846
01:21:35.541 --> 01:21:37.550
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't reality and it might just </v>
<v Speaker 2>skip,</v>

1847
01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.093
<v Speaker 2>might just go to augmented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could go to something even crazier </v>

1848
01:21:41.241 --> 01:21:43.730
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can go to some sort of a,</v>

1849
01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:47.570
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a recreation of life that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1850
01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:50.410
<v Speaker 2>is imparted into your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1851
01:21:52.030 --> 01:21:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Literally a hologram that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individualized hologram on the inside of</v>

1852
01:21:56.171 --> 01:21:57.004
<v Speaker 1>your eye.</v>

1853
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like projecting on your eyelid or </v>

1854
01:21:59.911 --> 01:22:01.140
<v Speaker 2>on your eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1855
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:05.280
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm thinking is something even </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazier now when you close your eyes and</v>

1856
01:22:05.281 --> 01:22:06.840
<v Speaker 2>you're transported,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1857
01:22:06.841 --> 01:22:08.160
<v Speaker 2>like what was that movie with arnold </v>
<v Speaker 2>work?</v>

1858
01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:09.053
<v Speaker 2>Total recall style because he just shot </v>
<v Speaker 2>into this new place that seems to me to </v>

1859
01:22:14.610 --> 01:22:16.320
<v Speaker 2>not be far off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just see.</v>

1860
01:22:16.321 --> 01:22:21.210
<v Speaker 2>I see where they're going as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ability to send signals from brain</v>

1861
01:22:21.211 --> 01:22:22.620
<v Speaker 2>to brain through an annoyance.</v>

1862
01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:23.573
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is being worked on and </v>

1863
01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:30.710
<v Speaker 1>theoretically possiBle what they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So interstellar space.</v>

1864
01:22:31.981 --> 01:22:36.981
<v Speaker 1>Travel is hard and impossible because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will die before they get to where</v>

1865
01:22:37.741 --> 01:22:39.060
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to be going and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>

1866
01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.680
<v Speaker 1>So theoretically what we can do is we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

1867
01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:44.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have clones in other places and you </v>

1868
01:22:49.201 --> 01:22:53.190
<v Speaker 1>download your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain into a,</v>

1869
01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:54.293
<v Speaker 1>like a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you send that brain to another computer </v>

1870
01:22:59.311 --> 01:23:01.470
<v Speaker 1>through laser beam traveling at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed of light,</v>

1871
01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.950
<v Speaker 1>and then it gets downloaded into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothing on the other side of the thing.</v>

1872
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Now that's obviously highly theoretical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen?</v>

1873
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:10.570
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have a whole country </v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with Donald Trump,</v>

1874
01:23:10.571 --> 01:23:12.010
<v Speaker 1>like 1 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's,</v>

1875
01:23:12.011 --> 01:23:15.280
<v Speaker 1>he's just gonna fucking keep recreating </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves over and over and over again.</v>

1876
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:16.743
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are going to make more than one </v>

1877
01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:20.590
<v Speaker 1>version of themselves going to be walls </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

1878
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:22.090
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come home,</v>

1879
01:23:22.091 --> 01:23:24.370
<v Speaker 1>there's 15 of you in your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1880
01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:27.310
<v Speaker 1>and they all want to watch the game and </v>
<v Speaker 1>scream the same things.</v>

1881
01:23:27.311 --> 01:23:28.760
<v Speaker 1>And then you're competing to see who </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

1882
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:30.183
<v Speaker 1>this is another interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is another interesting thing </v>

1883
01:23:32.141 --> 01:23:32.974
<v Speaker 1>because technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we go back to sanity versus </v>

1884
01:23:36.041 --> 01:23:37.780
<v Speaker 1>insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1885
01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:41.950
<v Speaker 1>right now we have crispr technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can edit the genome,</v>

1886
01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:42.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1887
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:45.220
<v Speaker 1>And go in and log.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can go in and say,</v>

1888
01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:46.054
<v Speaker 1>well I don't want to edit out the cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and like when you were going to </v>

1889
01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:51.370
<v Speaker 1>have a kid and then you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well hey,</v>

1890
01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:53.350
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to have downs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1891
01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:54.520
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds good,</v>

1892
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:58.660
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting cancer and make n six,</v>

1893
01:23:58.661 --> 01:24:00.730
<v Speaker 1>four and you know this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing put out,</v>

1894
01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:01.540
<v Speaker 1>take out the.</v>

1895
01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:02.373
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1896
01:24:02.650 --> 01:24:04.960
<v Speaker 1>And so because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we said,</v>

1897
01:24:04.961 --> 01:24:05.794
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we're not gonna what I'm gonna do </v>

1898
01:24:07.301 --> 01:24:09.430
<v Speaker 1>that because we're playing god know </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1899
01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:12.830
<v Speaker 1>But they have places in China already </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're,</v>

1900
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.943
<v Speaker 1>where they're going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you extrapolate because they're </v>

1901
01:24:16.511 --> 01:24:20.980
<v Speaker 1>already experimenting on human fetus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you extrapolate and you say,</v>

1902
01:24:20.981 --> 01:24:21.814
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start doing this and everybody </v>

1903
01:24:23.861 --> 01:24:28.861
<v Speaker 1>comes out genius plus iq and seven feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>tall and super strong and whatever.</v>

1904
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:31.480
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of an arms race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1905
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:32.800
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

1906
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:37.150
<v Speaker 1>gatica be damned like we were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to compete.</v>

1907
01:24:37.151 --> 01:24:39.370
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's when you don't see like,</v>

1908
01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.233
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this technology where like when your </v>

1909
01:24:40.841 --> 01:24:41.674
<v Speaker 1>logical said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we can't mess with this because </v>

1910
01:24:43.241 --> 01:24:44.650
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1911
01:24:44.670 --> 01:24:46.330
<v Speaker 1>they do things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1912
01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:48.100
<v Speaker 1>they were checking in on how </v>
<v Speaker 1>butterflies,</v>

1913
01:24:48.101 --> 01:24:48.934
<v Speaker 1>he called her and they used crispr to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change like one thing and then all of a </v>

1914
01:24:52.151 --> 01:24:52.984
<v Speaker 1>sudden the butterfly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a monarch butterfly just became all </v>

1915
01:24:54.701 --> 01:24:56.060
<v Speaker 1>white and like their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1916
01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:59.170
<v Speaker 1>things shrunk when her kids were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're playing god and you're like,</v>

1917
01:24:59.171 --> 01:25:01.750
<v Speaker 1>one thing makes all this other shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1918
01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.270
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's happening now.</v>

1919
01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:06.910
<v Speaker 1>That's happening today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually doing it.</v>

1920
01:25:06.911 --> 01:25:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1921
01:25:07.991 --> 01:25:09.310
<v Speaker 1>And what if they deal with wooly </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammoths?</v>

1922
01:25:09.311 --> 01:25:09.881
<v Speaker 1>TheY say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1923
01:25:09.881 --> 01:25:13.140
<v Speaker 1>We could whack this all the way up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>$100 super mammoth.</v>

1924
01:25:13.530 --> 01:25:15.970
<v Speaker 1>And they started making superman mous </v>
<v Speaker 1>with three decks.</v>

1925
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:20.030
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be real strange 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1926
01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:21.340
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1927
01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:24.570
<v Speaker 1>you and I are probably less science can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know that the live.</v>

1928
01:25:25.090 --> 01:25:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing is they're saying</v>

1929
01:25:26.381 --> 01:25:27.214
<v Speaker 1>now with advances in medicine that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids being born today are going to live </v>

1930
01:25:30.730 --> 01:25:32.260
<v Speaker 1>into their hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1931
01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.030
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that they're going to live to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be 150 years old.</v>

1932
01:25:35.031 --> 01:25:38.680
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be really common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is that's just saying that</v>

1933
01:25:38.681 --> 01:25:42.220
<v Speaker 1>today they might come up with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>five years from now that makes people go</v>

1934
01:25:42.221 --> 01:25:45.460
<v Speaker 1>back like reverse aging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's entirely possible.</v>

1935
01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a process.</v>

1936
01:25:46.901 --> 01:25:47.734
<v Speaker 1>It's a biological process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can stay alive long Enough for </v>

1937
01:25:51.011 --> 01:25:53.950
<v Speaker 1>them to figure that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to turn it back and you know,</v>

1938
01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:56.710
<v Speaker 1>that's the real playing god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn you back,</v>

1939
01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:00.000
<v Speaker 1>go back to when you were younger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have to.</v>

1940
01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:03.710
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be a younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You dealing with a new super race that's</v>

1941
01:26:03.711 --> 01:26:04.544
<v Speaker 1>been developed</v>

1942
01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:09.530
<v Speaker 2>where everyone is 300 pounds of solid </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle and every olympic wrestler.</v>

1943
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:10.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every olympic wrestling match between </v>

1944
01:26:12.591 --> 01:26:13.424
<v Speaker 2>two enormous gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no more fighting ai sort of war </v>

1945
01:26:18.411 --> 01:26:21.800
<v Speaker 2>against the terminator bots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be incredibly strange.</v>

1946
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:23.690
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aging is reversible,</v>

1947
01:26:23.691 --> 01:26:28.430
<v Speaker 2>at least in human cells and live mice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Changes to gene activity that occur with</v>

1948
01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:31.700
<v Speaker 2>age can be turned back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A new study shows jesus christ.</v>

1949
01:26:31.701 --> 01:26:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Longevity can be turned back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what's going to happen.</v>

1950
01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Old ladies going to be out getting dick </v>
<v Speaker 2>like crazy.</v>

1951
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:39.830
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to,</v>

1952
01:26:39.831 --> 01:26:42.590
<v Speaker 2>they're going to turn 20 and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be on a rampage.</v>

1953
01:26:42.591 --> 01:26:44.870
<v Speaker 2>They're going to just hit the clubs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck everybody.</v>

1954
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to tell you,</v>

1955
01:26:46.191 --> 01:26:47.024
<v Speaker 2>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that your evolutionary clock stops at </v>

1956
01:26:49.341 --> 01:26:51.530
<v Speaker 2>40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it just at 40.</v>

1957
01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:53.990
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't continue on to,</v>

1958
01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:54.853
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to try this and we're going </v>

1959
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:56.060
<v Speaker 2>to ourselves.</v>

1960
01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:58.520
<v Speaker 2>We'll keep on making new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just stops.</v>

1961
01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:01.640
<v Speaker 2>And if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could go in and said,</v>

1962
01:27:01.641 --> 01:27:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to the clinic and keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>my envelope.</v>

1963
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.270
<v Speaker 2>EvolutionAry clock ticking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you do it?</v>

1964
01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that made me feel better.</v>

1965
01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I feel.</v>

1966
01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:10.431
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1967
01:27:10.431 --> 01:27:11.264
<v Speaker 2>people said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's really selfish and you'll </v>

1968
01:27:11.991 --> 01:27:14.180
<v Speaker 2>stay around forever and use up all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>

1969
01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not up to you bitch in here.</v>

1970
01:27:17.150 --> 01:27:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Here's the other problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when throw 500 years ago,</v>

1971
01:27:20.901 --> 01:27:22.310
<v Speaker 2>everybody died at 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1972
01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:26.930
<v Speaker 2>nobody fucking lived to be today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like being 49 was impossible back then.</v>

1973
01:27:26.931 --> 01:27:28.610
<v Speaker 2>It was incredibly tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny,</v>

1974
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:31.880
<v Speaker 2>tiny people that didn't eat that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1975
01:27:31.881 --> 01:27:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1976
01:27:32.751 --> 01:27:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I would do it selfishly or would I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1977
01:27:34.971 --> 01:27:38.390
<v Speaker 2>I would do it just because it would be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better experience.</v>

1978
01:27:38.690 --> 01:27:39.523
<v Speaker 2>Like if they all of a sudden gave you </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and you felt your immune </v>

1979
01:27:42.021 --> 01:27:43.400
<v Speaker 2>system work better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1980
01:27:43.401 --> 01:27:43.980
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1981
01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:47.390
<v Speaker 2>your body fat was lower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had more vitality,</v>

1982
01:27:47.391 --> 01:27:50.480
<v Speaker 2>you've got more things done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you more energetic and you don't have to</v>

1983
01:27:50.481 --> 01:27:54.080
<v Speaker 2>lose any experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to loSe any understanding</v>

1984
01:27:54.081 --> 01:27:56.210
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't lose your facultIes.</v>

1985
01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't I do it?</v>

1986
01:27:57.321 --> 01:28:00.530
<v Speaker 2>So that's the famous to students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing with technology is that,</v>

1987
01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:03.350
<v Speaker 2>is that there's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to try to hold it back,</v>

1988
01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:06.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's just going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to get it back.</v>

1989
01:28:07.150 --> 01:28:08.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they can hold it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1990
01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the China factor is huge because</v>

1991
01:28:11.541 --> 01:28:12.374
<v Speaker 2>I think if China really does start doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that with crispr and make these super </v>

1992
01:28:15.201 --> 01:28:16.034
<v Speaker 2>athletes and superhumans and make people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are just infinitely smarter than </v>

1993
01:28:18.921 --> 01:28:19.754
<v Speaker 2>what we have today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that also plays into my idea of </v>

1994
01:28:23.361 --> 01:28:24.194
<v Speaker 2>technology induced evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think symbiotically introduced where </v>

1995
01:28:28.611 --> 01:28:31.220
<v Speaker 2>it's like human beings interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>

1996
01:28:31.221 --> 01:28:35.090
<v Speaker 2>but I think also that technology being </v>
<v Speaker 2>applied to our biological being,</v>

1997
01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:38.300
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff is going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever read neuromancer?</v>

1998
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:40.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did I,</v>

1999
01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.220
<v Speaker 2>why does that was a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically he,</v>

2000
01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:45.280
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's was that love prophesied?</v>

2001
01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:48.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lookup neuromancer.</v>

2002
01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:51.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a canadian guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>

2003
01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:54.500
<v Speaker 2>he's a William Gibson gibson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

2004
01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.030
<v Speaker 2>Eighty four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>84.</v>

2005
01:28:56.090 --> 01:28:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2006
01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.680
<v Speaker 2>but basically he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2007
01:28:58.700 --> 01:28:59.533
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sort of foresaw all of stuff </v>

2008
01:29:01.471 --> 01:29:02.304
<v Speaker 2>happening</v>

2009
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:03.930
<v Speaker 1>and sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2010
01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:05.003
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because he gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>credited with a lot of the tech stuff </v>

2011
01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:13.010
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of people who were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>college read em and then use those Ideas</v>

2012
01:29:13.111 --> 01:29:14.910
<v Speaker 1>to invent the things that are coming out</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2013
01:29:14.911 --> 01:29:15.990
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2014
01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:17.460
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a science.</v>

2015
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what drugs he took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably good ones,</v>

2016
01:29:20.341 --> 01:29:21.930
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you've ever read it,</v>

2017
01:29:21.931 --> 01:29:23.040
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit.</v>

2018
01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:24.231
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2019
01:29:24.231 --> 01:29:26.160
<v Speaker 1>he called it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I read it,</v>

2020
01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:28.260
<v Speaker 1>but I think I read it like right out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school.</v>

2021
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been so long distant ones,</v>

2022
01:29:31.890 --> 01:29:36.510
<v Speaker 1>but I love the fact that these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are creative people you know,</v>

2023
01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.820
<v Speaker 1>are the ones that have come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of these ideas.</v>

2024
01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:40.073
<v Speaker 1>There was a thing of reading she wells </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the different things that hg </v>

2025
01:29:42.661 --> 01:29:46.140
<v Speaker 1>wells predicted and the people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually that's not so crazy,</v>

2026
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:48.060
<v Speaker 1>but well that's how things get started.</v>

2027
01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:49.620
<v Speaker 1>It's just they can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2028
01:29:49.621 --> 01:29:50.454
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well all the shit we're talking about </v>

2029
01:29:51.211 --> 01:29:51.950
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2030
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:52.783
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I talking about potential </v>

2031
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:55.223
<v Speaker 1>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those thoughts like between people at </v>

2032
01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:00.960
<v Speaker 1>uni that are not technologically savvy </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

2033
01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Those thoughts can get into the mind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who is and then they can project</v>

2034
01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:08.550
<v Speaker 1>that idea in their own way and start </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on it.</v>

2035
01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Those are going to be a huge revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll say,</v>

2036
01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:14.670
<v Speaker 1>joe and jane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the council of elders,</v>

2037
01:30:14.671 --> 01:30:17.940
<v Speaker 1>we made it to imagine if it all boils </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

2038
01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:20.850
<v Speaker 1>civilization in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the mad max days,</v>

2039
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:22.590
<v Speaker 1>and it'll pull us down to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

2040
01:30:22.591 --> 01:30:25.370
<v Speaker 1>We'll try and wild stallions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>

2041
01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:26.453
<v Speaker 1>How's it like the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whilst I agree with you was thinking </v>

2042
01:30:27.571 --> 01:30:28.404
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bill and ted's excellent </v>

<v Speaker 1>do we have enough people?</v>

2047
01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:43.260
<v Speaker 1>We didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only picked one woman.</v>

2048
01:30:43.261 --> 01:30:45.090
<v Speaker 1>We need more than women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who else?</v>

2049
01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:47.100
<v Speaker 1>I like Martha Stewart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy her on that.</v>

2050
01:30:47.101 --> 01:30:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Snoop dogg show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a hell of a woman she had.</v>

2051
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:52.530
<v Speaker 1>She also doesn't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put her in coach.</v>

2052
01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:53.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's good.</v>

2053
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:55.890
<v Speaker 1>She's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't give a shit.</v>

2054
01:30:55.891 --> 01:30:56.724
<v Speaker 1>I like people don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just through the fucking papers </v>

2055
01:30:58.411 --> 01:30:59.244
<v Speaker 1>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2056
01:30:59.310 --> 01:31:02.040
<v Speaker 1>He just fucking elected Martha Stewart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's an asshole.</v>

2057
01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm not listening to this podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2058
01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:06.390
<v Speaker 1>I liked Martha Stewart because she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been to jail.</v>

2059
01:31:06.450 --> 01:31:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's fucking down.</v>

2060
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I always say like it held her mud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

2061
01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:14.520
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've done shit and seeing things,</v>

2062
01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:19.500
<v Speaker 1>then you're much better a ruler than </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's never done anything.</v>

2063
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I like her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2064
01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.120
<v Speaker 1>So by that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by that logic,</v>

2065
01:31:24.150 --> 01:31:24.983
<v Speaker 1>who else?</v>

2066
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Who else has done shit and seen things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'd like to throw in the mix?</v>

2067
01:31:30.230 --> 01:31:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2068
01:31:32.511 --> 01:31:35.160
<v Speaker 1>it's hard because you're searching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your database is for.</v>

2069
01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:40.190
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there who are sort of admirable.</v>

2070
01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a lock.</v>

2071
01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to really.</v>

2072
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:48.143
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to really sit down if someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to really formulate something </v>

2073
01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:52.740
<v Speaker 1>along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to really think it through.</v>

2074
01:31:52.890 --> 01:31:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not impossible and,</v>

2075
01:31:56.161 --> 01:31:58.920
<v Speaker 1>and a better solution than this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>mess.</v>

2076
01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Presidential masses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

2077
01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:06.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also is gonna sound fucked up,</v>

2078
01:32:06.551 --> 01:32:10.210
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think everybody should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to vote.</v>

2079
01:32:11.290 --> 01:32:12.123
<v Speaker 1>I think you should have to prove in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that you have an understanding of </v>

2080
01:32:15.641 --> 01:32:17.890
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying in order to be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to vote.</v>

2081
01:32:17.891 --> 01:32:18.724
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that of course is who </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell gets to decide that that's the </v>

2082
01:32:20.651 --> 01:32:21.370
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

2083
01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:24.460
<v Speaker 1>But if you have someone who's mentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>deranged and they just haven't committed</v>

2084
01:32:24.461 --> 01:32:25.294
<v Speaker 1>a crime yet and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read what they have to say about </v>

2085
01:32:27.701 --> 01:32:30.190
<v Speaker 1>lIfe and about people and they're racist</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sexist,</v>

2086
01:32:30.230 --> 01:32:31.960
<v Speaker 1>but he's lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem with that.</v>

2087
01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:32.581
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2088
01:32:32.581 --> 01:32:37.210
<v Speaker 1>and I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also problematic because here's</v>

2089
01:32:37.211 --> 01:32:39.460
<v Speaker 1>the problem that's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening all over the world,</v>

2090
01:32:39.461 --> 01:32:40.294
<v Speaker 1>but let's say In America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody's up in arms about </v>

2091
01:32:43.481 --> 01:32:47.380
<v Speaker 1>trump and there's protests and all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and all the media is going,</v>

2092
01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:48.273
<v Speaker 1>can you fucking believe this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you only realize that that's what </v>

2093
01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:55.420
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the country was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time obama opened his mouth.</v>

2094
01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:58.780
<v Speaker 1>And so you sit there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second here.</v>

2095
01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Half the country believes that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2096
01:33:01.690 --> 01:33:05.170
<v Speaker 1>people crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People in California and New York voted.</v>

2097
01:33:05.171 --> 01:33:09.460
<v Speaker 1>And then now I in Texas and Oklahoma </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to fucking suffer on the other.</v>

2098
01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Half of the people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>

2099
01:33:10.961 --> 01:33:15.961
<v Speaker 1>These people in Oklahoma and Texas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ohio voted and now I have to fucking,</v>

2100
01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:18.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to all this shit.</v>

2101
01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:22.780
<v Speaker 1>And so that therein lies the rub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because to go back to it,</v>

2102
01:33:22.810 --> 01:33:23.680
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2103
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.903
<v Speaker 1>if he hear me out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had your security and economic </v>

2104
01:33:28.931 --> 01:33:30.870
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2105
01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.153
<v Speaker 1>like solidified was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be more democratic to just </v>

2106
01:33:38.111 --> 01:33:38.944
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2107
01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Texas is Texas and California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it used to be.</v>

2108
01:33:42.101 --> 01:33:42.934
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States was the states rights </v>

2109
01:33:43.961 --> 01:33:46.960
<v Speaker 1>and all this stuff because the minute </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened to California,</v>

2110
01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:47.794
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

2111
01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.780
<v Speaker 1>That just split off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want our pot.</v>

2112
01:33:50.010 --> 01:33:51.070
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2113
01:33:51.071 --> 01:33:54.940
<v Speaker 1>it would be interesting because you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about with other countries,</v>

2114
01:33:54.970 --> 01:33:55.803
<v Speaker 1>having smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more manageable groups is more </v>

2115
01:33:57.251 --> 01:33:59.560
<v Speaker 1>democratic democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a democratic,</v>

2116
01:33:59.561 --> 01:34:02.740
<v Speaker 1>not a bad idea in the current state that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we exist in.</v>

2117
01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Not a bad idea to run things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's dysfunctional,</v>

2118
01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:07.630
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worse than dysfunctional.</v>

2119
01:34:07.631 --> 01:34:09.370
<v Speaker 1>You're just going back to undo what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just did.</v>

2120
01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

2121
01:34:11.051 --> 01:34:13.990
<v Speaker 1>California is going to go off and do our</v>
<v Speaker 1>own thing in Texas.</v>

2122
01:34:13.991 --> 01:34:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Going to do its thing in Oklahoma is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do its thing.</v>

2123
01:34:16.031 --> 01:34:18.670
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't like it in Oklahoma,</v>

2124
01:34:18.671 --> 01:34:21.430
<v Speaker 1>you can move to California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how about less reliance,</v>

2125
01:34:21.431 --> 01:34:22.360
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

2126
01:34:22.361 --> 01:34:23.194
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less reliance on a federal </v>

2127
01:34:24.521 --> 01:34:26.560
<v Speaker 1>government because it's not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>

2128
01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't work,</v>

2129
01:34:27.971 --> 01:34:28.804
<v Speaker 1>but state government does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it works better because it's smaller </v>

2130
01:34:31.281 --> 01:34:32.950
<v Speaker 1>and more and more democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2131
01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:36.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's sort of tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as we can keep from going to war</v>

2132
01:34:36.401 --> 01:34:37.780
<v Speaker 1>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2133
01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:38.763
<v Speaker 1>but that's what you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you guarantee that economic security </v>

2134
01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:42.393
<v Speaker 1>and you guarantee that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of political and military and </v>

2135
01:34:45.061 --> 01:34:45.894
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it kind of makes a ton of sense to </v>

2136
01:34:48.101 --> 01:34:49.180
<v Speaker 1>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2137
01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:52.390
<v Speaker 1>if we're like minded people in New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>or la or like,</v>

2138
01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:53.770
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

2139
01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:54.760
<v Speaker 1>what's the stat?</v>

2140
01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like California would be the eighth</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy in the world.</v>

2141
01:34:58.101 --> 01:34:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

2142
01:34:59.020 --> 01:34:59.853
<v Speaker 1>six largest economy in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe that paul shows a third of </v>

2143
01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:03.323
<v Speaker 1>california's favor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cal exit from the us and awakened </v>

2144
01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:07.123
<v Speaker 1>trump's election victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were just fucking shitting on </v>

2145
01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Texas by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago for this.</v>

2146
01:35:12.081 --> 01:35:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Either way I favor it because I live </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2147
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:18.230
<v Speaker 1>It's god's country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the tech people here smart,</v>

2148
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:20.840
<v Speaker 1>all the food is here right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2149
01:35:21.230 --> 01:35:23.720
<v Speaker 1>All the money's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the biggest here.</v>

2150
01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Kanye west is here and have all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kardashians and fact,</v>

2151
01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:30.500
<v Speaker 1>and you can sit here and say it's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic.</v>

2152
01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:33.590
<v Speaker 1>We can have our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd have cbd.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why can't California,</v>

2156
01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Nevada be different countries?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2157

<v Speaker 1>I think california's the only one cook </v>

2170
01:36:13.141 --> 01:36:14.610
<v Speaker 1>enough to actually say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

2171
01:36:14.611 --> 01:36:17.090
<v Speaker 1>We're going to leave my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something.</v>

2172
01:36:17.091 --> 01:36:21.590
<v Speaker 1>We might win in this new era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this new era where you can't,</v>

2173
01:36:21.591 --> 01:36:23.090
<v Speaker 1>you can't be president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're canadian,</v>

2174
01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.360
<v Speaker 1>you're american.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we have to change the laws,</v>

2175
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:27.910
<v Speaker 1>but if you're going to have to battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>our.</v>

2176
01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.753
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's immediately going to </v>

2177
01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:31.070
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

2178
01:36:31.071 --> 01:36:31.841
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

2179
01:36:31.841 --> 01:36:35.650
<v Speaker 1>we'll allow it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll wait as a couple.</v>

2180
01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:37.700
<v Speaker 1>You can be governor of California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously arnold.</v>

2181
01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:41.240
<v Speaker 1>I could be governor and then switch it </v>
<v Speaker 1>over or.</v>

2182
01:36:41.241 --> 01:36:41.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2183
01:36:41.931 --> 01:36:43.700
<v Speaker 1>when it becomes a country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we say,</v>

2184
01:36:43.701 --> 01:36:45.710
<v Speaker 1>well fuck all this being born here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>

2185
01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:47.270
<v Speaker 1>You have nothing to do with where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>

2186
01:36:47.271 --> 01:36:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't have anything to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't ask to be born in Canada.</v>

2187
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:53.270
<v Speaker 1>If you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could take it back.</v>

2188
01:36:53.271 --> 01:36:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Would you be born here in god's country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could take it back,</v>

2189
01:36:57.170 --> 01:36:58.670
<v Speaker 1>if you could denounce your canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>birth?</v>

2190
01:36:58.671 --> 01:36:59.504
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why I show you my first </v>

2191
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:02.720

<v Speaker 1>Because.</v>

2192
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.823
<v Speaker 1>Because I think the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the american experience </v>

2193
01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:10.910
<v Speaker 1>ironically is an immigrant experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am literally the american dream.</v>

2194
01:37:10.911 --> 01:37:13.370
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came here as an american to me.</v>

2195
01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:17.120
<v Speaker 1>I came here as an immigrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I killed it.</v>

2196
01:37:17.121 --> 01:37:18.470
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it here.</v>

2197
01:37:18.471 --> 01:37:20.180
<v Speaker 1>I love California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like stroking.</v>

2198
01:37:20.181 --> 01:37:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say it to everybody and everyone shits</v>

2199
01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:23.181
<v Speaker 1>on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2200
01:37:23.181 --> 01:37:24.014
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2201
01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:25.270
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2202
01:37:25.370 --> 01:37:27.020
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up in Canada,</v>

2203
01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great country,</v>

2204
01:37:28.791 --> 01:37:30.860
<v Speaker 1>clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great schools,</v>

2205
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:32.960
<v Speaker 1>nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice people are really nice.</v>

2206
01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I look,</v>

2207
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:37.760
<v Speaker 1>but what I believe 20 percent less </v>
<v Speaker 1>douche bags probably,</v>

2208
01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:38.653
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe that it doesn't fucking </v>

2209
01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:42.410
<v Speaker 1>matter where you're born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2210
01:37:42.411 --> 01:37:43.040
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

2211
01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2212
01:37:43.881 --> 01:37:45.990
<v Speaker 1>if you're good and you're smart and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you,</v>

2213
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.020
<v Speaker 1>you rise to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hard working.</v>

2214
01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:49.423
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a country built by immigrants </v>

2215
01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:52.820
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2216
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:54.650
<v Speaker 1>they were the good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's bad ones.</v>

2217
01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even better because</v>

2218
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:58.290
<v Speaker 2>you were born in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be president,</v>

2219
01:37:58.291 --> 01:38:01.590
<v Speaker 2>which is a shit job in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it makes you the ultimate american.</v>

2220
01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:03.740
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to be president,</v>

2221
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:05.280
<v Speaker 2>fix this mess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't do it.</v>

2222
01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born in the wrong piece of dirt.</v>

2223
01:38:08.130 --> 01:38:08.963
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You literally could fucking drive in a </v>

2224
01:38:11.281 --> 01:38:14.700
<v Speaker 2>couple of hours from where you were into</v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

2225
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:15.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2226
01:38:15.321 --> 01:38:16.154
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like I am connected to </v>

2227
01:38:19.681 --> 01:38:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Delaware in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're both in the same country.</v>

2228
01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>

2229
01:38:23.791 --> 01:38:24.624
<v Speaker 2>you were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Living in Canada is way fucking closer </v>

2230
01:38:27.181 --> 01:38:29.460
<v Speaker 2>to the United States than me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Delaware.</v>

2231
01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:32.150
<v Speaker 2>It's all the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all the same land mass.</v>

2232
01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:33.330
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god damn it.</v>

2233
01:38:33.331 --> 01:38:34.570
<v Speaker 2>We're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2234
01:38:34.890 --> 01:38:36.780
<v Speaker 2>but you're a more american than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2235
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:39.540
<v Speaker 2>You are an actual immigrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just lucky.</v>

2236
01:38:40.410 --> 01:38:42.870
<v Speaker 2>I got lucky that my grandparents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>

2237
01:38:42.871 --> 01:38:45.390
<v Speaker 2>my great grandparents were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck Italy.</v>

2238
01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:49.200
<v Speaker 2>And they moved over with my grandparents</v>
<v Speaker 2>were little and Ireland too.</v>

2239
01:38:49.230 --> 01:38:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My grandfather,</v>

2240
01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:54.870
<v Speaker 2>great grandfather on my father's side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

2241
01:38:55.290 --> 01:38:57.090
<v Speaker 2>They all just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this place.</v>

2242
01:38:57.300 --> 01:39:01.770
<v Speaker 2>And they brought their kids over and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to figure out this new thing.</v>

2243
01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:04.020
<v Speaker 2>It was a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2244
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't wide open.</v>

2245
01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:08.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still kind of a new thing.</v>

2246
01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.640
<v Speaker 2>We'll look at the history.</v>

2247
01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it though,</v>

2248
01:39:10.671 --> 01:39:11.504
<v Speaker 1>like the tech world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's coming from everywhere to </v>

2249
01:39:14.901 --> 01:39:18.440
<v Speaker 1>silicone to hear silicone beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's coming and you're like,</v>

2250
01:39:18.441 --> 01:39:20.630
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a great because you're getting all</v>

2251
01:39:20.631 --> 01:39:24.080
<v Speaker 1>the best and smartest people coming here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and giving us their knowledge and you're</v>

2252
01:39:24.081 --> 01:39:24.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

2253
01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:25.733
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking great.</v>

2254
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:26.663
<v Speaker 2>You know it's really interesting too is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're almost universally leaning left </v>

2255
01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:33.270
<v Speaker 2>if you look at all of these powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>tech giants,</v>

2256
01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:34.163
<v Speaker 2>whether it's even like social media </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies like facebook and apple and </v>

2257
01:39:38.101 --> 01:39:38.934
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they almost predominantly lean left </v>

2258
01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:42.653
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that they're worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of fucking dollars and their </v>

2259
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:48.560
<v Speaker 2>main driving force in our account.</v>

2260
01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my,</v>

2261
01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:54.110
<v Speaker 1>my problem because I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're leaning left necessarily.</v>

2262
01:39:54.111 --> 01:39:59.111
<v Speaker 1>They're backing things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceived as left leaning like that.</v>

2263
01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:01.993
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a fucking brain and you've </v>

2264
01:40:05.151 --> 01:40:08.210
<v Speaker 1>talked to scientists and you've and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've read and you're like,</v>

2265
01:40:08.211 --> 01:40:09.800
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're up against the wall.</v>

2266
01:40:09.801 --> 01:40:10.634
<v Speaker 1>Like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans won't do anything until the </v>

2267
01:40:11.631 --> 01:40:14.030
<v Speaker 1>fucking guns to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guns to the fucking head.</v>

2268
01:40:14.290 --> 01:40:15.123
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you talk to any of these </v>

2269
01:40:16.371 --> 01:40:17.204
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2270
01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:20.180
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2271
01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.100
<v Speaker 1>I fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we fucking fix this?</v>

2272
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:25.460
<v Speaker 1>The fact that that's laughed or liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's stupid.</v>

2273
01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2274
01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:27.793
<v Speaker 1>and I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is you go onto like pot </v>

2275
01:40:30.291 --> 01:40:31.790
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know where it's going.</v>

2276
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Or if you want to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>

2277
01:40:34.611 --> 01:40:38.330
<v Speaker 1>the women's march on civil rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know where we're fucking going.</v>

2278
01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:39.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you grew up as we did in the fucking </v>

2279
01:40:41.330 --> 01:40:43.640
<v Speaker 1>modern age civil rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2280
01:40:43.641 --> 01:40:45.330
<v Speaker 1>We're not fucking going backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2281
01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:48.890
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That became a fucking left thing too.</v>

2282
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:50.780
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2283
01:40:51.490 --> 01:40:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it not a right thing as it should</v>

2284
01:40:53.711 --> 01:40:54.544
<v Speaker 2>be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing we will all meet in the </v>

2285
01:40:54.911 --> 01:40:55.744
<v Speaker 2>middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing where we meet 100 percent in </v>

2286
01:40:57.131 --> 01:40:57.964
<v Speaker 2>the middle and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2287
01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:00.190
<v Speaker 2>there can't be racism anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We gotta get.</v>

2288
01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:02.620
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't make any fucking sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too old.</v>

2289
01:41:02.621 --> 01:41:03.454
<v Speaker 2>It's too stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just an archaic monkey way of </v>

2290
01:41:06.311 --> 01:41:09.340
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's back to our primal tribal fact that</v>

2291
01:41:09.341 --> 01:41:12.400
<v Speaker 2>it's still on the fucking table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this stupid?</v>

2292
01:41:12.430 --> 01:41:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking stupid.</v>

2293
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:16.720
<v Speaker 2>I feel the same way about gay rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel the exact same way.</v>

2294
01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:19.590
<v Speaker 2>If you have a real problem with gay </v>

<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why would anybody care?</v>

2302
01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Civil rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay rights,</v>

2303
01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:39.010
<v Speaker 2>women's rights part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know where we're going.</v>

2304
01:41:39.011 --> 01:41:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know where we're going,</v>

2305
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:41.383
<v Speaker 2>so why the fuck are we having these </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights and fucking is because people on </v>

2306
01:41:44.081 --> 01:41:45.910

<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

2307

<v Speaker 2>the black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People upset at the women's rights </v>

<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trans community upset the women </v>

2309
01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:53.710

<v Speaker 2>fractious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2311
01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:56.140

<v Speaker 2>I ever used it,</v>

2312
01:41:56.141 --> 01:41:56.974
<v Speaker 2>but I'm and start fucking thrown it </v>

<v Speaker 2>we need some sanity and you need some </v>
<v Speaker 2>common sense and saying,</v>

2314
01:42:03.281 --> 01:42:04.114
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2315
01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.310
<v Speaker 2>we all know where we're getting this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

2316
01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:08.890
<v Speaker 2>fighting each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need psychedelic drugs.</v>

2317
01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:10.690
<v Speaker 2>That's really what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2318
01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:15.691
<v Speaker 2>this sounds stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mushrooms and ptsd as well also mtma</v>

2319

<v Speaker 2>people smoking and alcoholism.</v>

2321
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2322
01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:27.813
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that is also because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to get iowasca because </v>

2323
01:42:29.861 --> 01:42:30.694
<v Speaker 2>dimethyltryptamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the active compound of it is illegal in </v>

<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2326
01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:42.673
<v Speaker 2>which is an amazing one for heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rewires the mind if you have someone </v>

2327
01:42:46.781 --> 01:42:48.730
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know as an opiod addiction,</v>

2328

01:42:51.311 --> 01:42:52.144
<v Speaker 2>he runs a center down in Mexico and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>started it out because he had a problem </v>

2330
01:42:56.231 --> 01:42:58.930
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kicked them by using ibogaine and now</v>

2331
01:42:58.931 --> 01:43:01.270
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did a story on it and,</v>

2332
01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:04.800
<v Speaker 2>and it's incredibly successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who we follow through that,</v>

2333
01:43:04.801 --> 01:43:06.490
<v Speaker 2>he's still clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been incredibly.</v>

2334
01:43:07.650 --> 01:43:09.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why,</v>

2335
01:43:09.111 --> 01:43:10.390
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if things work,</v>

2336
01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:12.460
<v Speaker 2>why we just can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2337
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2338
01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:14.801
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2339
01:43:14.801 --> 01:43:17.140
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not on our team.</v>

2340
01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Our team is clean and jesus and bibles </v>
<v Speaker 2>and football and we're not taking trucks</v>

2341
01:43:21.851 --> 01:43:22.684
<v Speaker 2>like a bunch of god damn dirty hippy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so you want bernie sanders and </v>

2342
01:43:25.541 --> 01:43:28.780
<v Speaker 2>you want drugs and it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also a big pharma.</v>

2343
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>

2344
01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:30.760
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2345
01:43:30.761 --> 01:43:32.980
<v Speaker 2>they need to get high too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the problem.</v>

2346
01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Part of the problem is all these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that have already made a fuckload</v>

2347
01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:38.650
<v Speaker 2>of money and they're trying to protect </v>
<v Speaker 2>those investments.</v>

2348
01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:41.290
<v Speaker 2>They are involved in these gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations,</v>

2349
01:43:41.291 --> 01:43:42.124
<v Speaker 2>these corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes this diffusion of </v>

2350
01:43:43.841 --> 01:43:44.674
<v Speaker 2>responsibility situation where you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these people acting in the </v>

2351
01:43:47.951 --> 01:43:50.140
<v Speaker 2>benefit of the group or for the benefit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the group.</v>

2352
01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:51.213
<v Speaker 2>Not thinking about everybody as </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals and justifying what they do </v>

2353
01:43:54.381 --> 01:43:55.670
<v Speaker 2>by the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2354
01:43:55.671 --> 01:43:57.650
<v Speaker 2>this is just business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how it's done.</v>

2355
01:43:57.651 --> 01:43:58.640
<v Speaker 2>This how it's always done.</v>

2356
01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:01.950
<v Speaker 2>There's enough fucking profit or </v>
<v Speaker 2>rhetoric,</v>

2357
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:02.833
<v Speaker 2>there's enough and if you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>business and you're only way to make </v>

2358
01:44:04.731 --> 01:44:06.950
<v Speaker 2>profit is by eating babies and he go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

2359
01:44:06.951 --> 01:44:09.170
<v Speaker 2>my country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been eating babies over here for a</v>

2360
01:44:09.171 --> 01:44:11.510
<v Speaker 2>long time and we're not going to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop eating babies.</v>

2361
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:13.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to stop eating babies.</v>

2362
01:44:13.341 --> 01:44:16.910
<v Speaker 2>We know it's not good now and I feel the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same way about fucking seaworld.</v>

2363
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:21.200
<v Speaker 2>They need to stop having dolphins and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whales and orcas in captivity.</v>

2364
01:44:21.650 --> 01:44:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Cut the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't do that anymore.</v>

2365
01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Like it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2366
01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:27.350
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things that we know are</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>

2367
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:28.303
<v Speaker 2>but we allow them to go on because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've gone on for a long time and I </v>

2368
01:44:31.551 --> 01:44:34.640
<v Speaker 2>think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's across the board.</v>

2369
01:44:34.641 --> 01:44:37.100
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot and those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of those,</v>

2370
01:44:37.230 --> 01:44:38.063
<v Speaker 2>they're being exposed now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the more interesting things </v>

2371
01:44:39.831 --> 01:44:41.750
<v Speaker 2>about this time is that because of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

2372
01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:45.620
<v Speaker 2>All the information that's out now about</v>
<v Speaker 2>opiate addictions,</v>

2373
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:49.550
<v Speaker 2>that's the reason why doctors prescribed</v>
<v Speaker 2>less and less now.</v>

2374
01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:51.620
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason why they're under more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more scrutiny.</v>

2375
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:55.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not because of the doctors wanting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop,</v>

2376
01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:57.793
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because our information got out </v>

2377
01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:00.133
<v Speaker 2>drug in the last 10 years and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>because guys like you and advice got </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

2383
01:45:12.531 --> 01:45:14.930
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way more powerful than heroin,</v>

2384
01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:15.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way more.</v>

2385
01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:19.550
<v Speaker 2>400 times more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2386
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:22.460
<v Speaker 2>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck fucking looked at.</v>

2387
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Oxies went not strong enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

2388
01:45:25.670 --> 01:45:27.810
<v Speaker 2>This stuff's for pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2389
01:45:27.811 --> 01:45:28.644
<v Speaker 2>the thing with fentanyl is you can take </v>
<v Speaker 2>like one grain of it and then cut it </v>

2390
01:45:32.011 --> 01:45:35.120
<v Speaker 2>into so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just to go back to your point,</v>

2391
01:45:35.121 --> 01:45:35.954
<v Speaker 2>it's pure profit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact of the thing is people are </v>

2392
01:45:38.181 --> 01:45:39.710
<v Speaker 2>dying like motherfuckers on it.</v>

2393
01:45:39.710 --> 01:45:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

2394
01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:41.713
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people didn't know that they were </v>

2395
01:45:43.881 --> 01:45:47.540
<v Speaker 2>addicted to fentanyl until they went in </v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to get treated.</v>

2396
01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:48.500
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>

2397
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:51.080
<v Speaker 2>you're not addicted to heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're addicted to fentanyl,</v>

2398
01:45:51.081 --> 01:45:53.860
<v Speaker 2>which is even harder to kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn it.</v>

2399
01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:54.753
<v Speaker 2>And it's synthetic and it's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that human beings have created and </v>

2400
01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:59.070
<v Speaker 2>created over the last 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2401
01:45:59.390 --> 01:46:02.310
<v Speaker 2>And there's not a lot of data on it as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as like,</v>

2402
01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:05.210
<v Speaker 2>it's for like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2403
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:07.610
<v Speaker 2>operating on rhinoceros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2404
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:12.910
<v Speaker 2>it's super fucking straw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super strong were assholes,</v>

2405
01:46:13.610 --> 01:46:17.870
<v Speaker 2>but to like the opioid overdoses are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through the roof.</v>

2406
01:46:17.871 --> 01:46:18.704
<v Speaker 2>It's never been higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A deaths have never been higher and </v>

2407
01:46:21.330 --> 01:46:22.400
<v Speaker 2>we're just sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2408
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:24.430
<v Speaker 2>we're making this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we can stop making it.</v>

2409
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Whoever is making that stuff is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>monster.</v>

2410
01:46:27.490 --> 01:46:29.780
<v Speaker 2>If you're making that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are a monster.</v>

2411
01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:30.643
<v Speaker 2>Whatever company that's making them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that the government hasn't </v>

2412
01:46:32.151 --> 01:46:32.984
<v Speaker 2>stepped in trump immediately steps in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fucking stops the protests and the </v>

2413
01:46:37.161 --> 01:46:37.994
<v Speaker 2>dakota pipeline and start that back up </v>
<v Speaker 2>again and he doesn't do anything about </v>

2414
01:46:40.281 --> 01:46:41.840
<v Speaker 2>fentanyl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent on that.</v>

2415
01:46:41.841 --> 01:46:43.940
<v Speaker 2>That's what numbers of deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

2416
01:46:43.941 --> 01:46:45.830
<v Speaker 2>pull up the numbers of deaths and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2417
01:46:45.831 --> 01:46:48.320
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's not on his table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe people aren't bringing it to him,</v>

2418
01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.220
<v Speaker 2>but goddamn shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

2419
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:51.083
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge problem that the opioid addictions </v>

2420
01:46:54.061 --> 01:46:56.940
<v Speaker 2>are going through the roof and death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's guess,</v>

2421
01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:00.600
<v Speaker 2>how many people a year do you think die </v>
<v Speaker 2>from fentanyl in the United States?</v>

2422
01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just started,</v>

2423
01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:03.600
<v Speaker 2>they just started being able to track </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2424
01:47:03.601 --> 01:47:05.700
<v Speaker 2>but I would say 50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2425
01:47:05.701 --> 01:47:06.534
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say 19,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I said I would say </v>

2426
01:47:08.491 --> 01:47:09.570
<v Speaker 2>50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2427
01:47:09.810 --> 01:47:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm going low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going.</v>

2428
01:47:11.011 --> 01:47:14.340
<v Speaker 2>Hi jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the numbers?</v>

2429
01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:15.870
<v Speaker 2>Drum roll please.</v>

2430
01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:19.293
<v Speaker 2>Readily pal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet that's because the god damned </v>

2431
01:47:21.181 --> 01:47:23.390
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical companies are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around with the man.</v>

2432
01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Let's just see opioid overdoses in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2433
01:47:27.001 --> 01:47:27.151
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2434
01:47:27.151 --> 01:47:28.730
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to specifically find out.</v>

2435
01:47:28.731 --> 01:47:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2436
01:47:29.010 --> 01:47:30.450
<v Speaker 2>let's just go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just see what that is.</v>

2437
01:47:30.451 --> 01:47:31.920
<v Speaker 2>It'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll give us ballpark.</v>

2438
01:47:32.190 --> 01:47:37.190
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be a lot for opioid </v>
<v Speaker 2>overdoses in the United States.</v>

2439
01:47:37.561 --> 01:47:39.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm going with $75,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say,</v>

2440
01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get you gotta?</v>

2441
01:47:41.981 --> 01:47:43.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't say I don't know.</v>

2442
01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:44.960
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2443
01:47:45.070 --> 01:47:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're fine.</v>

2444
01:47:47.490 --> 01:47:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Because you gotta think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh that's overdose deaths.</v>

2445
01:47:49.801 --> 01:47:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>

2446
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:52.770
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a ton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2447
01:47:52.771 --> 01:47:53.604
<v Speaker 2>But I bet it's probably accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you think about the $350 million </v>

2448
01:47:56.611 --> 01:48:00.870
<v Speaker 2>people and I think there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like $39 million that are on.</v>

2449
01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something insane.</v>

2450
01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:03.473
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The number of people that are on </v>

2451
01:48:04.291 --> 01:48:06.360
<v Speaker 2>painkillers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking bananas.</v>

2452
01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:07.553
<v Speaker 2>What do we got here?</v>

2453
01:48:08.110 --> 01:48:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

2454
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:09.630
<v Speaker 2>do 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$2,000.</v>

2455
01:48:09.690 --> 01:48:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a monster.</v>

2456
01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:12.540
<v Speaker 2>You fucking nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at you.</v>

2457
01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Well I got 52.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a.</v>

2458
01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had 50,000</v>

2459
01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:16.573
<v Speaker 2>on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drug over those 15 opioids driving this </v>

2460
01:48:21.961 --> 01:48:23.550
<v Speaker 2>epidemic with 20,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2461
01:48:23.551 --> 01:48:25.890
<v Speaker 2>so I was right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

2462
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:29.310
<v Speaker 2>That's 20 slash 15 slash 16 I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2463
01:48:29.311 --> 01:48:31.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was close to 75.</v>

2464
01:48:31.711 --> 01:48:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>

2465
01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:35.070
<v Speaker 2>So it ramped up that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going.</v>

2466
01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.420
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's doubled in the past three</v>

2467
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:41.140
<v Speaker 2>years in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that maybe it's not open.</v>

2468
01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:43.830
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still counting up.</v>

2469
01:48:43.831 --> 01:48:45.810
<v Speaker 2>The body's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's fucked up.</v>

2470
01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just crazy.</v>

2471
01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:51.180
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find out this,</v>

2472
01:48:51.450 --> 01:48:53.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the number?</v>

2473
01:48:53.071 --> 01:48:55.290
<v Speaker 2>They don't give you the number of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are on them,</v>

2474
01:48:55.291 --> 01:48:56.124
<v Speaker 2>but they'll give you the number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescriptions for 2015 and 16 for </v>

2475
01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:01.734
<v Speaker 2>opiates.</v>

2476
01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:04.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you get that number.</v>

2477
01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I think it's $39 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

2478
01:49:07.110 --> 01:49:07.943
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what I had read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was $39 million </v>

2479
01:49:09.631 --> 01:49:12.810
<v Speaker 2>prescriptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one out of 10,</v>

2480
01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:17.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's not really because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how many times did they refill it?</v>

2481
01:49:17.490 --> 01:49:18.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it that,</v>

2482
01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:20.310
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say someone has a prescription,</v>

2483
01:49:20.610 --> 01:49:24.180
<v Speaker 2>are you saying you had your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's prescribed to you or are you saying</v>

2484
01:49:24.181 --> 01:49:28.890
<v Speaker 2>I write you a new prescription when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>runs at 39 million people on opioids is.</v>

2485
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a large country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah it is,</v>

2486
01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:35.280
<v Speaker 2>but that's one out of 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more than one out of 10.</v>

2487
01:49:35.310 --> 01:49:36.300
<v Speaker 2>If it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2488
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:39.090
<v Speaker 2>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's per person.</v>

2489
01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is per person.</v>

2490
01:49:41.581 --> 01:49:43.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's per prescription.</v>

2491
01:49:43.050 --> 01:49:43.883
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you might be able to have five </v>

2492
01:49:44.701 --> 01:49:47.010
<v Speaker 2>prescriptions over the course of a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2493
01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 2>but then again they don't</v>

2494
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:53.130
<v Speaker 1>know because a lot of it is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the majority of the problem.</v>

2495
01:49:53.370 --> 01:49:53.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2496
01:49:53.951 --> 01:49:54.784
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would gather that probably half of it </v>

2497
01:49:56.651 --> 01:50:00.910
<v Speaker 1>is illegal at least because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you got illegal stuff,</v>

2498
01:50:00.970 --> 01:50:05.260
<v Speaker 1>pills coming in from all over the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mexico and then people.</v>

2499
01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:08.590
<v Speaker 1>So the story we did on it was they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted to oxy,</v>

2500
01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:12.220
<v Speaker 1>then they can't afford it because our </v>
<v Speaker 1>are more expensive than heroin.</v>

2501
01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the fuck that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess whatever.</v>

2502
01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:15.483
<v Speaker 1>And then they're doing heroin because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cheaper than fentanyl because it's </v>

2503
01:50:19.721 --> 01:50:20.554
<v Speaker 1>cheaper still and stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's that whole thing of like </v>

2504
01:50:23.351 --> 01:50:24.184
<v Speaker 1>when someone dies of a heroin overdose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone goes to their dealer and buys </v>

2505
01:50:27.161 --> 01:50:28.570
<v Speaker 1>from them because oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's really strong.</v>

2506
01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:32.530
<v Speaker 1>So that's another reason why fentanyl is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through the roof.</v>

2507
01:50:32.710 --> 01:50:33.543
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a bizarre state that we're in </v>

2508
01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:38.793
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all sorts of other </v>

2509
01:50:40.301 --> 01:50:41.920
<v Speaker 1>prescription pills that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking you.</v>

01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Just darkness and gloomy and heroin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pills.</v>

<v Speaker 1>get that out of the system.</v>

2597
01:54:35.451 --> 01:54:36.284
<v Speaker 1>That's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like having a computer virus and </v>

2598
01:54:38.391 --> 01:54:40.280
<v Speaker 1>you bring it to the computer guy and </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's in everYthing.</v>

2600
01:54:41.850 --> 01:54:44.090
<v Speaker 1>That's also another reason why we're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

2601
01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:46.060
<v Speaker 1>We said everybody's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2604
01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:55.520
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking pot hood talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you're a pothead.</v>

2605
01:54:55.850 --> 01:54:56.720
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro?</v>

2606
01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:59.930
<v Speaker 1>That's pot stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all.</v>

2607
01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:00.681
<v Speaker 1>Second of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2608
01:55:00.681 --> 01:55:02.090
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do anything bad to you.</v>

2609
01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:03.133
<v Speaker 1>It's already been established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously know no one's trying to stop </v>

2610
01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:09.080
<v Speaker 1>whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's trying to stop wine.</v>

2611
01:55:09.230 --> 01:55:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Not trying to stop people from taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are manageable.</v>

2612
01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:15.350
<v Speaker 1>There is nothing manageable about </v>
<v Speaker 1>fentanyl.</v>

2613
01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:20.510
<v Speaker 1>If you're rolling the dice with death </v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you're doing something that's</v>

2614
01:55:20.511 --> 01:55:21.680
<v Speaker 1>not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

2615
01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:24.110
<v Speaker 1>if you're getting addicted like that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't,</v>

2616
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:25.143
<v Speaker 1>you can't do anything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's just stupid and it's way </v>

2617
01:55:27.861 --> 01:55:29.210
<v Speaker 1>harder to kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2618
01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:32.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2619
01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:34.670
<v Speaker 1>it's much stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obviously needed that,</v>

2620
01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:36.620
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who approved that,</v>

2621
01:55:36.970 --> 01:55:39.230
<v Speaker 1>what was it was for animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they said,</v>

2622
01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:40.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can just cut this.</v>

2623
01:55:40.821 --> 01:55:42.740
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of like super strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin.</v>

2624
01:55:44.170 --> 01:55:45.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like pcp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2625
01:55:45.691 --> 01:55:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Pcp was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an animal tranquilizer.</v>

2626
01:55:49.110 --> 01:55:49.943
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just amazing that someone </v>

2627
01:55:50.821 --> 01:55:53.610
<v Speaker 1>greenlit that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they look at goal on paper seems to</v>

2628
01:55:53.611 --> 01:55:55.590
<v Speaker 1>be an order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go roll it out.</v>

2629
01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many.</v>

2630
01:55:57.210 --> 01:55:58.043
<v Speaker 1>This is my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many hippopotamuses and rhinos are </v>

2631
01:55:59.911 --> 01:56:03.030
<v Speaker 1>we traCking because somebody must've </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at at some point and said,</v>

2632
01:56:03.031 --> 01:56:05.480
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a lot of hippopotamus.</v>

2633
01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Is getting their livers removed here in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2634
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:09.720
<v Speaker 1>in New York city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus christ.</v>

2635
01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2636
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:12.383
<v Speaker 1>once those woolly mammoths start fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>roman through Russia and chew and </v>

2637
01:56:14.581 --> 01:56:15.310
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we needed it.</v>

2638
01:56:15.310 --> 01:56:18.840
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to shoot him with darts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going to have to try and check them out,</v>

2639
01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:20.340
<v Speaker 1>make sure they're not doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

2640
01:56:20.341 --> 01:56:22.050
<v Speaker 1>We need the mammoths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need the mammoth.</v>

2641
01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that all evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honest.</v>

2642
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're times man.</v>

2643
01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:28.321
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2644
01:56:28.321 --> 01:56:29.154
<v Speaker 1>really weird times and more weird I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think than any other time in human </v>

2645
01:56:32.251 --> 01:56:34.110
<v Speaker 1>history for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2646
01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:38.160
<v Speaker 1>if we believe in moore's law then it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to just go like you're saying,</v>

2647
01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:43.230
<v Speaker 1>we have this technology now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't even like it Used to be like,</v>

2648
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:46.290
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years from now we'll write about five</v>

2649
01:56:46.291 --> 01:56:47.124
<v Speaker 1>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know what the fuck's going to </v>

2650
01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:49.620
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this shit is just like,</v>

2651
01:56:49.621 --> 01:56:50.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>

2652
01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:51.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>map the genome and now we can edit the </v>

2653
01:56:53.281 --> 01:56:53.640
<v Speaker 1>genome.</v>

2654
01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Now we can reverSe aging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>NOw we can do this now.</v>

2655
01:56:55.890 --> 01:56:57.540
<v Speaker 1>And you'Re jusT sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit.</v>

2656
01:56:57.541 --> 01:57:00.330
<v Speaker 1>This is hAppening in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So quicklY.</v>

2657
01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:01.610
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2658
01:57:01.670 --> 01:57:06.670
<v Speaker 1>and because of that and the sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed is ramping up.</v>

2659
01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like it though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you knoW,</v>

2660
01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of medical research and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2661
01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:14.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2662
01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:15.733
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why I'm not drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>here is because I got to go for my </v>

2663
01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:18.533
<v Speaker 1>annual physical and I'm going to go in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not have too much booze or whatever </v>

2664
01:57:21.781 --> 01:57:22.614
<v Speaker 1>my body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's interesting about it is they </v>

2665
01:57:24.931 --> 01:57:26.760
<v Speaker 1>map your shit and they check out your </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and they say,</v>

2666
01:57:26.761 --> 01:57:28.260
<v Speaker 1>well this is going to happen or that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

2667
01:57:28.261 --> 01:57:30.300
<v Speaker 1>whatever else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you sitting there and you go,</v>

2668
01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:31.433
<v Speaker 1>in five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have aggressive </v>

2669
01:57:34.831 --> 01:57:38.520
<v Speaker 1>therapies if not cures for many forms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

2670
01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:40.380
<v Speaker 1>So you're just sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>

2671
01:57:40.381 --> 01:57:41.214
<v Speaker 1>for fuck's sakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just get me another fucking 10 </v>

2672
01:57:43.201 --> 01:57:44.034
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2673
01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:44.873
<v Speaker 1>So that I can get to this sort of stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think a Lot of people with a lot </v>

2674
01:57:48.181 --> 01:57:52.170
<v Speaker 1>of diseases that hitherto have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>incurable are sitting there going,</v>

2675
01:57:52.171 --> 01:57:53.004
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

2676
01:57:53.050 --> 01:57:54.330
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2677
01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:55.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beCause it's just,</v>

2678
01:57:55.531 --> 01:57:57.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going exponentially.</v>

2679
01:57:57.101 --> 01:57:57.934
<v Speaker 1>And when you can map the genome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can figure this out and we can </v>

2680
01:57:59.581 --> 01:58:00.840
<v Speaker 1>rewire that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2681
01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:02.213
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also more understanding about </v>

2682
01:58:02.701 --> 01:58:03.534
<v Speaker 1>nutrition now than ever before and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes of all these illnesses and a big </v>

2683
01:58:06.031 --> 01:58:07.410
<v Speaker 1>part of that is inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gut,</v>

2684
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:08.820
<v Speaker 1>gut health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gut health,</v>

2685
01:58:09.090 --> 01:58:09.923
<v Speaker 1>gut health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that pertains to a lot of it </v>

2686
01:58:11.221 --> 01:58:13.110
<v Speaker 1>pertains to your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2687
01:58:13.111 --> 01:58:13.944
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also the overprescription of </v>

2688
01:58:15.091 --> 01:58:16.180
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was listening.</v>

2689
01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Posture is your bio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2690
01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:20.730
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to this podcast today </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were discussing,</v>

2691
01:58:20.970 --> 01:58:23.940
<v Speaker 1>this one was discussing having a.</v>

2692
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:27.910
<v Speaker 1>She had some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an illness and they gave her too.</v>

2693
01:58:27.970 --> 01:58:28.803
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had an ear infection and they gave </v>

2694
01:58:29.761 --> 01:58:34.650
<v Speaker 1>her two big doses of antibiotics and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was fucked up for a decade.</v>

2695
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Just her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just had constant pain,</v>

2696
01:58:36.991 --> 01:58:39.330
<v Speaker 1>chronic pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these illnesses and injuries.</v>

2697
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:44.010
<v Speaker 1>And then finally she went to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeopathic doctor and the doctor sorted</v>

2698
01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:47.890
<v Speaker 1>out with probiotics and she'd bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was saying like the woman,</v>

2699
01:58:47.891 --> 01:58:50.590
<v Speaker 1>her name was like snowflake and her </v>
<v Speaker 1>child was moon child,</v>

2700
01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:53.120
<v Speaker 1>don't have the exact card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not started.</v>

2701
01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:54.550
<v Speaker 1>It was a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

2702
01:58:54.551 --> 01:58:57.730
<v Speaker 1>great doctor called dr lipman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an internist.</v>

2703
01:58:58.270 --> 01:59:02.150
<v Speaker 1>And what happened was I had a stomach </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating flesh eating stomach parasite.</v>

2704
01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh jesus and dysentery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got an Afghanistan.</v>

2705
01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I came back and I was in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2706
01:59:08.590 --> 01:59:11.020
<v Speaker 1>went to the sort of tropical disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>center and they're like,</v>

2707
01:59:11.021 --> 01:59:12.880
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to get this out.</v>

2708
01:59:13.650 --> 01:59:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what did it look like?</v>

2709
01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took super strong,</v>

2710
01:59:18.370 --> 01:59:19.203
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super strong antibiotics and afterwards </v>

2711
01:59:22.841 --> 01:59:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucked up.</v>

2712
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm seriously fucked up here.</v>

2713
01:59:26.201 --> 01:59:27.034
<v Speaker 1>I can't get out of bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I messed up and this guy goes like </v>

2714
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:31.540
<v Speaker 1>this internist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to go see him.</v>

2715
01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:34.930
<v Speaker 1>So it goes to him and he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a ton of pro box,</v>

2716
01:59:34.931 --> 01:59:36.970
<v Speaker 1>you need to rebuild your bio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2717
01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:38.193
<v Speaker 1>And so I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just took a ton of probiotics and he </v>

2718
01:59:40.461 --> 01:59:43.000
<v Speaker 1>put me on the shit whenever I was a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2719
01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

2720
01:59:43.590 --> 01:59:44.423
<v Speaker 1>because all your immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is there like the now they </v>

2721
01:59:46.541 --> 01:59:48.390
<v Speaker 1>found out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2722
01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:49.533
<v Speaker 1>what was happening was cdf and crohn's </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease and all these things were </v>

2723
01:59:52.301 --> 01:59:53.134
<v Speaker 1>happening because there was super bugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hospitals because they were over </v>

2724
01:59:55.311 --> 01:59:58.330
<v Speaker 1>prescribing antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics.</v>

2725
01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:03.720
<v Speaker 1>And so they started doing a fecal </v>
<v Speaker 1>transplants,</v>

2726
02:00:05.010 --> 02:00:06.040
<v Speaker 1>have healthy shit.</v>

2727
02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:08.360
<v Speaker 1>I tried to explain that to someone they </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I was joking and read.</v>

2728
02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:09.213
<v Speaker 1>Does your bio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way it was incurable before </v>

2729
02:00:11.051 --> 02:00:11.884
<v Speaker 1>people are dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they do a fecal transplant and </v>

2730
02:00:14.471 --> 02:00:15.610
<v Speaker 1>they're cured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2731
02:00:15.790 --> 02:00:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Because it replenishes your biome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2732
02:00:18.730 --> 02:00:21.670
<v Speaker 1>And you're completely destroying it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics.</v>

2733
02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:22.533
<v Speaker 1>We did a piece on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the post antibiotic world where they </v>

2734
02:00:23.741 --> 02:00:24.574
<v Speaker 1>just stopped working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't come up with shit like </v>

2735
02:00:26.501 --> 02:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>fecal transplants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking dead.</v>

2736
02:00:29.050 --> 02:00:31.240
<v Speaker 1>So I went through that and I've got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2737
02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:34.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking let's spend some money on that.</v>

2738
02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:34.893
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Autism symptoms improve after fecal </v>

2739
02:00:36.551 --> 02:00:38.260
<v Speaker 1>transplant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small study finds.</v>

2740
02:00:38.261 --> 02:00:38.800
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2741
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>they're finding out that it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do with a autistic,</v>

2742
02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parkinson's and alzheimer's.</v>

2743
02:00:44.711 --> 02:00:45.544
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the severity of autism symptoms and </v>

2744
02:00:50.050 --> 02:00:50.883
<v Speaker 1>all the traits that they exhibit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something has to do with their gut </v>

2745
02:00:53.081 --> 02:00:53.890
<v Speaker 1>biome.</v>

2746
02:00:53.890 --> 02:00:56.260
<v Speaker 1>And if you can make the gut biome </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

2747
02:00:56.350 --> 02:00:58.570
<v Speaker 1>radically improve parkinson's and </v>
<v Speaker 1>alzheimer's starts in,</v>

2748
02:00:58.571 --> 02:00:59.780
<v Speaker 1>your gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moves up,</v>

2749
02:00:59.790 --> 02:01:01.990
<v Speaker 1>starts to plaque.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing that apparently</v>

2750
02:01:01.991 --> 02:01:05.560
<v Speaker 1>has a giant effect on people with autism</v>
<v Speaker 1>is medical marijuana,</v>

2751
02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:07.930
<v Speaker 1>medical marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially edible marijuana.</v>

2752
02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend and he moved to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington state particularly because of</v>

2753
02:01:12.071 --> 02:01:12.904
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when they made it legal and </v>

2754
02:01:14.351 --> 02:01:16.750
<v Speaker 1>another friend who is a kid who's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>autistic,</v>

2755
02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>moved to Colorado for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it easily and people with cancer.</v>

2756
02:01:21.341 --> 02:01:22.174
<v Speaker 1>We have a storY of all these parents who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like bible thumpers who found the </v>

2757
02:01:27.791 --> 02:01:29.740
<v Speaker 1>only thing that worked with cbd and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2758
02:01:29.741 --> 02:01:30.574
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're moving from Texas and wherever to </v>

2759
02:01:32.710 --> 02:01:36.070
<v Speaker 1>to Washington and Colorado because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that helps my kid.</v>

2760
02:01:36.071 --> 02:01:38.980
<v Speaker 1>And Here's my message to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you believe in god,</v>

2761
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 1>you got to believe that god made</v>

2762
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:40.963
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know it's man that decided it was </v>

2763
02:01:42.681 --> 02:01:44.900
<v Speaker 2>bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not god.</v>

2764
02:01:45.150 --> 02:01:47.270
<v Speaker 2>It's not logic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not science.</v>

2765
02:01:47.570 --> 02:01:48.403
<v Speaker 2>There's just some bullshit propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 2>that got stuck to it in the 19 thirties </v>

2766
02:01:51.831 --> 02:01:55.190
<v Speaker 2>and we're still trying to shake it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really what's going on.</v>

2767
02:01:55.191 --> 02:01:58.060
<v Speaker 2>It Has nothing to do with what's right </v>
<v Speaker 2>or what not to do.</v>

2768
02:01:58.061 --> 02:01:59.990
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fun in the thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want booze.</v>

2769
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:02.330
<v Speaker 2>It was right after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

2770
02:02:02.331 --> 02:02:03.164
<v Speaker 2>It was right after they had gotten </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the prohibition that they </v>

2771
02:02:07.101 --> 02:02:10.060
<v Speaker 2>decided to go after marijuana and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really what had happened at all.</v>

2772
02:02:10.130 --> 02:02:11.840
<v Speaker 2>It all happened because of William </v>
<v Speaker 2>Randolph hearst.</v>

2773
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:14.740
<v Speaker 2>You know the whole story behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh god dammit.</v>

2774
02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:15.593
<v Speaker 2>I've told it a tHousand times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll give you the abbreviated </v>

2775
02:02:17.001 --> 02:02:17.834
<v Speaker 2>version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>William randolph hearst owned hearst </v>

2776
02:02:19.581 --> 02:02:20.690
<v Speaker 2>publications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>newspapers.</v>

2777
02:02:20.691 --> 02:02:21.524
<v Speaker 2>He also owned paper mills and they came </v>
<v Speaker 2>out with this machine called the </v>

2778
02:02:24.891 --> 02:02:25.760
<v Speaker 2>decorticator.</v>

2779
02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:28.510
<v Speaker 2>That allowed them to much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectively process hemp fiber.</v>

2780
02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:30.400
<v Speaker 2>A machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That process did hemp,</v>

2781
02:02:30.430 --> 02:02:32.930
<v Speaker 2>makes us superior paper and makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>superior cloth.</v>

2782
02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:33.783
<v Speaker 2>It makes appear you can eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hemp seeds and nutritious as </v>

2783
02:02:36.171 --> 02:02:39.590
<v Speaker 2>essential medial central fatty acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the amino acids.</v>

2784
02:02:39.591 --> 02:02:41.540
<v Speaker 2>It's this amazing plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an alien planet,</v>

2785
02:02:41.541 --> 02:02:45.230
<v Speaker 2>and he decides to demonize it because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to convert his wood,</v>

2786
02:02:45.231 --> 02:02:48.890
<v Speaker 2>his trees that he's turning into paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to convert it to him and</v>

2787
02:02:48.891 --> 02:02:49.724
<v Speaker 2>spend millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead he starts publishing stories </v>

2788
02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:52.933
<v Speaker 2>about mexicans and blacks that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking this new drug called marijuana </v>

2789
02:02:56.211 --> 02:02:58.640
<v Speaker 2>and raping white women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This drug,</v>

2790
02:02:58.641 --> 02:03:00.650
<v Speaker 2>marijuana wasn't even the name for </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabis.</v>

2791
02:03:00.651 --> 02:03:04.070
<v Speaker 2>They when they made cannabis outlaw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they made it illegal,</v>

2792
02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:04.993
<v Speaker 2>when they made marijuana illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even know they were making </v>

2793
02:03:06.891 --> 02:03:07.724
<v Speaker 2>hemp illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know because the general </v>

2794
02:03:10.071 --> 02:03:10.904
<v Speaker 2>public did not know it was the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing because this word marijuana was </v>

2795
02:03:13.701 --> 02:03:16.040
<v Speaker 2>never associated with a hamp or with </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabis.</v>

2796
02:03:16.250 --> 02:03:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana was a wild mexican tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally unrelated to cannabis.</v>

2797
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:21.823
<v Speaker 2>They called it marijuana so that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could demonize it and that's when they </v>

2798
02:03:24.321 --> 02:03:25.154
<v Speaker 2>funded reefer madness and all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy propaganda movies and posters and </v>

2799
02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:29.753
<v Speaker 2>we are still to this day trying to shake</v>
<v Speaker 2>off what William Randolph hearst and </v>

2800
02:03:33.741 --> 02:03:34.574
<v Speaker 2>harry anslinger did in the 19 thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very interesting anecdote that </v>

2801
02:03:39.381 --> 02:03:40.214
<v Speaker 2>sort of is very pertinent to what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening today where you can just make </v>

2802
02:03:44.001 --> 02:03:46.220
<v Speaker 2>up a story about something and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

2803
02:03:46.670 --> 02:03:49.970
<v Speaker 2>It's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really perfect.</v>

2804
02:03:49.971 --> 02:03:52.430
<v Speaker 2>It's the perfect way to connect it to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2805
02:03:52.431 --> 02:03:55.550
<v Speaker 2>we're still dealing with that problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>from almost 100 years ago.</v>

2806
02:03:55.620 --> 02:03:58.430
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bananas and it's a.</v>

2807
02:03:58.670 --> 02:04:01.280
<v Speaker 2>It could happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what we're looking at right now</v>

2808
02:04:01.281 --> 02:04:04.640
<v Speaker 2>is not a rigid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely rock solid civilization.</v>

2809
02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:07.670
<v Speaker 2>All it would take is one asteroidal </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact,</v>

2810
02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:08.713
<v Speaker 2>one killing of the power grid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one mean what something happens to </v>

2811
02:04:12.900 --> 02:04:13.160
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>

2812
02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Shower happens and it kills off 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the population and permafrost</v>

2813
02:04:16.970 --> 02:04:17.803
<v Speaker 2>permafrost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could happen and there's so many </v>

2814
02:04:20.301 --> 02:04:22.340
<v Speaker 2>things that could go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yellowstone,</v>

2815
02:04:22.730 --> 02:04:25.880
<v Speaker 2>they have thousands of earthquakes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>yellowstone every year.</v>

2816
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:26.743
<v Speaker 2>It's a giant called dara volcano that at</v>
<v Speaker 2>one point in time blew up and killed </v>

2817
02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:33.590
<v Speaker 2>everything on the continent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every six to 800,000</v>

2818
02:04:33.591 --> 02:04:35.870
<v Speaker 2>years it goes and when it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a wrap.</v>

2819
02:04:35.871 --> 02:04:36.704
<v Speaker 2>Babies in the last time it went 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago and we have thousands of </v>

2820
02:04:40.801 --> 02:04:41.634
<v Speaker 2>earthquakes every year in yellowstone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go there and you watch steam </v>

2821
02:04:45.210 --> 02:04:49.230
<v Speaker 2>shooting out of the ground because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking boiling magma is so close to the</v>

2822
02:04:49.231 --> 02:04:53.520
<v Speaker 2>surface that the rivers and streams in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the underground water runs into it,</v>

2823
02:04:53.521 --> 02:04:56.610
<v Speaker 2>heats it up and shoots it up in the sky </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a regular basis.</v>

2824
02:04:56.820 --> 02:04:57.653
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I love about that is everyone who </v>

2825
02:04:59.811 --> 02:05:01.710
<v Speaker 2>goes and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look that that's fucking awesome.</v>

2826
02:05:01.710 --> 02:05:04.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really cool,</v>

2827
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:05.263
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally possible that that fucking </v>

2828
02:05:07.801 --> 02:05:11.190
<v Speaker 2>thing with very little notice could blow</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it blows,</v>

2829
02:05:11.310 --> 02:05:14.490
<v Speaker 2>we were dead because it's too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or too close to it,</v>

2830
02:05:14.491 --> 02:05:16.980
<v Speaker 2>which it's in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not far enough away.</v>

2831
02:05:16.981 --> 02:05:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe some people in the east </v>
<v Speaker 2>coast to survive,</v>

2832
02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:20.303
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to go into nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>winter and it's going to fuck up </v>

2833
02:05:21.991 --> 02:05:24.180
<v Speaker 2>everybody all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's why,</v>

2834
02:05:25.150 --> 02:05:28.230
<v Speaker 2>speaking about technology that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever talked to,</v>

2835
02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:30.420
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our guy on our council of elders,</v>

2836
02:05:30.421 --> 02:05:31.710
<v Speaker 2>ilan musk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2837
02:05:31.711 --> 02:05:35.160
<v Speaker 2>why would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we a single planetary species?</v>

2838
02:05:35.161 --> 02:05:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't we just hedge our bets and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have by planetary species?</v>

2839
02:05:39.181 --> 02:05:40.014
<v Speaker 2>Because if something does go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least you've got your data and your </v>

2840
02:05:43.530 --> 02:05:46.380
<v Speaker 2>culture and your people and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why wouldn't you do that?</v>

2841
02:05:46.381 --> 02:05:47.214
<v Speaker 2>If you could do that?</v>

2842
02:05:47.410 --> 02:05:48.510
<v Speaker 2>When they put it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2843
02:05:48.890 --> 02:05:50.070
<v Speaker 2>sort of makes sense because everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2844
02:05:50.130 --> 02:05:50.963
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to live on mars was crazy </v>

2845
02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:52.573
<v Speaker 2>nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no evidence that We can live </v>

2846
02:05:53.371 --> 02:05:56.550
<v Speaker 2>there though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is we can't really stay</v>

2847
02:05:56.551 --> 02:06:00.180
<v Speaker 2>in that atmosphere for very long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean they can make fucking.</v>

2848
02:06:00.210 --> 02:06:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even that we're still dealing with a</v>

2849
02:06:02.101 --> 02:06:02.934
<v Speaker 2>lesser gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna have massive health </v>

2850
02:06:04.111 --> 02:06:05.940
<v Speaker 2>consequences for the people that decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>to move there.</v>

2851
02:06:06.030 --> 02:06:06.863
<v Speaker 2>Got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just saying that's their </v>

2852
02:06:08.281 --> 02:06:11.220
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should argue multiplanetary species.</v>

2853
02:06:11.250 --> 02:06:12.083
<v Speaker 2>It's a good argument and it's also </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguable that with all this crispr </v>

2854
02:06:14.461 --> 02:06:15.294
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might be able to figure out some </v>

2855
02:06:16.141 --> 02:06:18.860
<v Speaker 2>sort of a medical solution for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that do move to a,</v>

2856
02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:21.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moon has one sixth earth gravity,</v>

2857
02:06:21.890 --> 02:06:22.723
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be some way that they could </v>

2858
02:06:23.551 --> 02:06:25.620
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to colonize the moon </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2859
02:06:25.650 --> 02:06:26.483
<v Speaker 2>develop some sort of a new technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have crazy shit about permafrost </v>

2860
02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:32.730
<v Speaker 2>terraforming and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2861
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:33.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2862
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Creating an atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't they do that here?</v>

2863
02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:41.130
<v Speaker 2>You have to use nukes to do it in march.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2864
02:06:41.131 --> 02:06:42.930
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to nuke the Polls.</v>

2865
02:06:42.931 --> 02:06:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew couple.</v>

2866
02:06:44.070 --> 02:06:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a good idea.</v>

2867
02:06:46.350 --> 02:06:48.510
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime your.</v>

2868
02:06:48.810 --> 02:06:50.610
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like something a little kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>would come up with.</v>

2869
02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:52.860
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to solve this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're going to draw up some fucking</v>

2870
02:06:52.861 --> 02:06:53.694
<v Speaker 2>nuclear bombs on the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to make the thing make an </v>

2871
02:06:56.191 --> 02:06:58.820
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere too many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt damon.</v>

2872
02:06:58.821 --> 02:06:59.654
<v Speaker 2>I alWays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I always just think about that is </v>

2873
02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:04.440
<v Speaker 2>know they get the equation wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then some like,</v>

2874
02:07:04.441 --> 02:07:05.630
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It throws the,</v>

2875
02:07:05.710 --> 02:07:06.543
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gravitational pull off by four </v>

2876
02:07:08.311 --> 02:07:09.780
<v Speaker 2>centimeters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you and then you're like,</v>

2877
02:07:10.110 --> 02:07:11.040
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

2878
02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:13.060

<v Speaker 2>That should have been a carry the two.</v>

2879
02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:16.410
<v Speaker 2>And then aliens land on it and take it </v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

2880
02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:17.273
<v Speaker 2>As soon as the air comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those like the actual alien from the </v>

2881
02:07:21.091 --> 02:07:23.430
<v Speaker 2>movie alien with the big fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things,</v>

2882
02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:27.030
<v Speaker 2>they just camp out right over there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>start building spaceships and plan their</v>

2883
02:07:27.031 --> 02:07:29.070
<v Speaker 2>attack problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane smith,</v>

2884
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:32.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we're gonna solve them </v>
<v Speaker 2>by moving them or do you see that?</v>

2885
02:07:32.371 --> 02:07:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
