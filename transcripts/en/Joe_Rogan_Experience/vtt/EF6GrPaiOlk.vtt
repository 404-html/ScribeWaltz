00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:29.780
<v Speaker 3>phone in show and we'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

120
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.480
<v Speaker 3>I'd go there every Friday night at </v>
<v Speaker 3>midnight.</v>

121
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 3>It was called the midnight caller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did the show for six years.</v>

122
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

123
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 3>not even when I was in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after,</v>

124
00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:41.721
<v Speaker 3>when I was in community college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a television broadcasting at </v>

125
00:09:41.721 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 3>Algonquin college in Ottawa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

126
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 3>named after the Algonquin Indians.</v>

127
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.780
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been curious about </v>

128
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:50.780
<v Speaker 3>television broadcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you take a course like that,</v>

129
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.071
<v Speaker 3>what do they have you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you pretend to be like a newscaster </v>

130
00:09:55.071 --> 00:09:55.071
<v Speaker 3>or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was mostly,</v>

131
00:09:55.071 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly technical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it wasn't on camera.</v>

132
00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:00.720
<v Speaker 3>There was one on camera course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was mostly like editing,</v>

133
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 3>video editing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lighting,</v>

134
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 3>photography,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to work a video camera,</v>

135
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 3>how to set all your technical stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we had,</v>

136
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 3>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had one broadcast news writing course</v>

137
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.700
<v Speaker 3>and we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

138
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.140
<v Speaker 3>some single camera video production and </v>
<v Speaker 3>film type courses,</v>

139
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.280
<v Speaker 3>but it was mostly tech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

140
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.300
<v Speaker 3>mostly technical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must be hard as fuck to keep up.</v>

141
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.540
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you learn how to video edit from a </v>

142
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:29.540
<v Speaker 3>few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>graduated a few years ago now you go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>today we were learning how to do it on </v>

144
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 3>three quarter inch video cassette.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The video tapes are this big.</v>

145
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.930
<v Speaker 3>You put them in this job and it's like,</v>

150
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:52.470

<v Speaker 3>I edited it ever paintbrush.</v>

<v Speaker 3>broadcasting school to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to now you've always been really </v>

196
00:12:49.981 --> 00:12:50.680
<v Speaker 3>involved in the technology of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind the scenes stuff.</v>

197
00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:55.681
<v Speaker 3>You've always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not kind of figured I was when I </v>

198
00:12:55.681 --> 00:12:58.051
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in high school and I thought it'd </v>

199
00:12:58.051 --> 00:13:00.100
<v Speaker 3>be fun to do a TV show someday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is basically what I thought.</v>

200
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:02.330
<v Speaker 3>I was watching David Letterman at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

201
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.850
<v Speaker 3>and I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

202
00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:06.280
<v Speaker 3>that would be the most fun thing to ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

203
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.610
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

204
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.920
<v Speaker 3>and little did I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that it's a lot of fun doing this </v>

205
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.300
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is,</v>

206
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.170
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes sometimes not,</v>

207
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.140
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is,</v>

208
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:20.640
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

<v Speaker 3>surprising rappers that have come on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>web shop.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Did you initially want to be a rapper </v>
<v Speaker 4>before you became a comedian?</v>

281
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.360
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not really.</v>

282
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:44.930
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

283
00:16:44.931 --> 00:16:49.240
<v Speaker 4>I was in high school and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was a,</v>

284
00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.040
<v Speaker 4>it was a fun thing to do on stage at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>assemblies was,</v>

285
00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:52.430

287
00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:55.870
<v Speaker 4>the data band battle of the bands </v>
<v Speaker 4>nitrate,</v>

288
00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:59.270
<v Speaker 4>it was an excuse to get up on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we made this rap group.</v>

289
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.980
<v Speaker 4>I liked listening to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

290
00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:02.640
<v Speaker 4>I was listening to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

291
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:07.130
<v Speaker 4>nobody knew what rap music was in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>high school.</v>

292
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.280
<v Speaker 4>Everyone was listening to mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 4>music.</v>

293
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:12.230
<v Speaker 4>I was listening to boogie down </v>
<v Speaker 4>productions,</v>

294
00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:13.700
<v Speaker 4>Nwa,</v>

<v Speaker 4>which was not tribe called quest.</v>

296
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.940
<v Speaker 4>These groups weren't really mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 4>yet in,</v>

297
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.560
<v Speaker 4>on the radio in Canada and in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>eighties and nineties.</v>

298
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

299
00:17:22.971 --> 00:17:27.971
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what I was thinking about </v>

300
00:17:27.971 --> 00:17:27.971
<v Speaker 4>this the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rap music back then is kind of like,</v>

301
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.640
<v Speaker 4>it kind of provided what the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 4>provides now,</v>

302
00:17:31.641 --> 00:17:34.700
<v Speaker 4>which is a glimpse into other parts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>

303
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.270
<v Speaker 4>other places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

304
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.040
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here it was,</v>

305
00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 4>we were in Canada and we're listening to</v>
<v Speaker 4>these songs coming out in New York,</v>

306
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:45.101
<v Speaker 4>coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll boogie down productions of the </v>

307
00:17:45.101 --> 00:17:47.890
<v Speaker 4>South Bronx and we're listening to them </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling all these tales of life on the </v>

308
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:47.890
<v Speaker 4>streets in the South Bronx and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>listening to this,</v>

309
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:48.890
<v Speaker 4>you're going on a cassette,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

310
00:17:48.891 --> 00:17:50.180
<v Speaker 4>and you're listening to in your walkman</v>

311
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.820
<v Speaker 1>on the way to school and no criminal </v>
<v Speaker 1>minded the record and you're like,</v>

312
00:17:53.821 --> 00:17:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to these stories,</v>

313
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:57.040
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's A.</v>

314
00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about that driving over </v>

315
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:02.640
<v Speaker 1>here today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda,</v>

316
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of sad because in a way that </v>

317
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:04.730
<v Speaker 1>might be something that disappears from </v>
<v Speaker 1>music now,</v>

318
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:05.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the Internet,</v>

319
00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:06.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's going to screw up music.</v>

320
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Let's not be negative as well because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to go to music now to get </v>

321
00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:12.370
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

322
00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:17.230
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we would listen to them on the </v>

323
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.281
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that anything good is going to </v>

324
00:18:19.281 --> 00:18:21.171
<v Speaker 1>stick around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not going to be anything that's </v>

325
00:18:21.171 --> 00:18:21.171
<v Speaker 1>awesome that's going to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

326
00:18:21.171 --> 00:18:21.171
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

327
00:18:21.171 --> 00:18:25.521
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be the death of music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can anything be the death of music </v>

328
00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:25.521
<v Speaker 1>when everybody loves music.</v>

329
00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he'll be a desk of comedy.</v>

330
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:32.510
<v Speaker 1>I guess I just sort of more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>curious to see how it will affect it or </v>

331
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520
<v Speaker 1>how it'll evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be good.</v>

332
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.140
<v Speaker 1>It'll be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

333
00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:39.141
<v Speaker 1>now there's so many more places that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will want to make music and just </v>

334
00:18:39.141 --> 00:18:40.200
<v Speaker 1>distribute their music to have access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

335
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 1>It just us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do this.</v>

336
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:45.810
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we can do this and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>broadcast talking over the Internet.</v>

337
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 1>This is just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're a little moistening while </v>

<v Speaker 1>they're sitting up there like 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

354
00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.820
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one girl was going,</v>

<v Speaker 1>people who does this.</v>

359
00:19:35.221 --> 00:19:38.030
<v Speaker 1>The fucking music show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fuck ups the go find it in high school </v>

361
00:19:43.031 --> 00:19:46.041

<v Speaker 1>Wasn't an ellen say something or do </v>

362
00:19:46.041 --> 00:19:49.641
<v Speaker 1>something that everybody in the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>school know staring at your leg and </v>

363
00:19:49.641 --> 00:19:53.871
<v Speaker 1>Michael J.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox in the back of the future playing </v>

364
00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:53.871
<v Speaker 1>the guitar on the stage like you're from</v>
<v Speaker 1>outer space or something.</v>

365
00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Weird pressure that is for children to </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to stand out like that.</v>

366
00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Like that's got to be so strange for </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

367
00:19:57.991 --> 00:20:02.991
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the feeling myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you wanted to be some sort of an </v>

368
00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:06.741
<v Speaker 1>act or something and you were 10 and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were in school and you saw some girl </v>

369
00:20:06.741 --> 00:20:07.920
<v Speaker 1>that was on a show and she was 10 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

370
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.660
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come I can't be on that?</v>

371
00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

372
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:16.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible way to be raising kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about getting the most </v>

373
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:20.190
<v Speaker 1>attention possible for almost nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like instantaneously become famous.</v>

374
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:21.950
<v Speaker 1>So everything that your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

375
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.030
<v Speaker 1>all the character that gets developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>from hard work.</v>

376
00:20:24.031 --> 00:20:25.610
<v Speaker 1>That's all nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made it already banged.</v>

377
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Shut up 14 and made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

378
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.410
<v Speaker 1>They put too much pressure on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at Lindsay Lohan,</v>

379
00:20:31.411 --> 00:20:33.360
<v Speaker 1>especially in this day and age now where</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

380
00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:33.960
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing it.</v>

381
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.500
<v Speaker 1>It's in your face all the time and oh </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

382
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:40.800
<v Speaker 1>you could swear dude all the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and shoving down their throats.</v>

383
00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shrill.</v>

384
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.750
<v Speaker 1>We're shoving in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The strangest thing about Hollywood high</v>

385
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.410
<v Speaker 1>was tricking the very people that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

386
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:53.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the grand conspiracy theory is </v>

387
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:53.490
<v Speaker 1>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

388
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hollywood is trying to condition us </v>

389
00:20:55.891 --> 00:20:59.640
<v Speaker 1>to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like subservient to our government man </v>

390
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.550
<v Speaker 1>and be patriotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

391
00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood is giving you what you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

392
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Holly was given you what you want to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're doing what they like to.</v>

393
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:11.610
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making the kind of stupid shit </v>

394
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:11.610
<v Speaker 1>that they like to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

395
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.940
<v Speaker 1>it's like the people that are creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>it or just as much of a victim of the </v>

396
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.420
<v Speaker 1>conditioning as the people that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling it to.</v>

397
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.150
<v Speaker 1>People don't realize that they think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's some grand scheme.</v>

398
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.960
<v Speaker 1>No supply and demand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

399
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.040
<v Speaker 1>People want to see a sex tapes and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the people go do shows and watch </v>

400
00:21:28.301 --> 00:21:31.180
<v Speaker 1>their lives and sort of see everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and know everything.</v>

401
00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do You Watch Jersey shore?</v>

402
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>

403
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I've only seen him once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

404
00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.210
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found it.</v>

405
00:21:37.211 --> 00:21:38.240
<v Speaker 1>I found it very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

406
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.170
<v Speaker 1>I laughed a lot watching the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see why people watch.</v>

407
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are pretty funny too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

408
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

409
00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only seen it once ever hamming it </v>

410
00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 1>up to the camera there having a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

411
00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.530
<v Speaker 1>You're watching people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

412
00:21:50.531 --> 00:21:53.500
<v Speaker 1>you're being voyeuristic right into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different world.</v>

413
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm so stuck with the hills though </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything like that.</v>

414
00:21:56.981 --> 00:21:58.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy the Jersey shore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

415
00:21:58.511 --> 00:22:01.930
<v Speaker 1>I almost think everything's fake now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Typically it's all set up,</v>

416
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.730
<v Speaker 1>but I don't care.</v>

417
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.260
<v Speaker 1>It's encouraging bad behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still,</v>

418
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.020
<v Speaker 1>even if it's fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like these people like wow,</v>

419
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:08.960
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch it.</v>

420
00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:11.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like watching a national geographic</v>
<v Speaker 1>special on some fucking tribe.</v>

421
00:22:11.771 --> 00:22:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Did they found the jungle seemed like </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>

422
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:21.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty funny man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all they're trying to do is get the </v>

423
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.830
<v Speaker 1>dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of funny because it's </v>

424
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.830
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

425
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:28.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean that really is what that guy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is just trying to fucking get it </v>

426
00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:28.290
<v Speaker 1>every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different girls all over the place.</v>

427
00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.480
<v Speaker 1>He's showing you his abs and he's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to clubs at girls are going,</v>

428
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's working,</v>

429
00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.080
<v Speaker 1>it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's pulling it off and it's working.</v>

430
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I think the thing that's bizarre about </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the reality TV,</v>

431
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.500
<v Speaker 1>those not to overanalyze it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe I,</v>

432
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.980
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'd be overanalyzing and at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

433
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.470
<v Speaker 1>but we're talking about my broadcast and</v>
<v Speaker 1>course they taught us about,</v>

434
00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:46.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentation and making documentary.</v>

435
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:51.670
<v Speaker 1>We had a documentary film of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they talk about when you put a </v>

436
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:51.670
<v Speaker 1>camera on something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

437
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:51.760
<v Speaker 1>it changes what you're filming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

438
00:22:51.761 --> 00:22:56.761
<v Speaker 1>So you can never really make a true </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary of anything because as soon </v>

439
00:22:56.761 --> 00:22:57.850
<v Speaker 1>as you put the camera on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to change what's going on.</v>

440
00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Like in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put the camera on all these kids in </v>

441
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Jersey shore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

442
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:02.980
<v Speaker 1>And then are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

443
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.991
<v Speaker 1>we gotta go crazy for the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they go for getting in fights or </v>

444
00:23:06.991 --> 00:23:07.180
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then it's going to.</v>

445
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.280
<v Speaker 1>And then people are gonna Watch that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna get worse and worse than </v>

446
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.461
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are gonna have to get more </v>

447
00:23:14.461 --> 00:23:14.461
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People going to start,</v>

448
00:23:14.461 --> 00:23:14.461
<v Speaker 1>you know we're going to snuff film </v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

449
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we'll get to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't want to see that kind of </v>

450
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.710
<v Speaker 1>negative stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want us,</v>

451
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.990
<v Speaker 1>they want to be fascinated by orange </v>
<v Speaker 1>will recall faces of death.</v>

452
00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.320
<v Speaker 1>They want the want the couple to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and then close the door.</v>

453
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.920
<v Speaker 1>That's where they want it to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

454
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.870
<v Speaker 1>It's all fascinating to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

455
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.340
<v Speaker 1>because it's so easy to change behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>by just putting a camera on it.</v>

456
00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:36.160
<v Speaker 1>If that's really the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all you have to do is add a camera at</v>

457
00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:38.560
<v Speaker 1>the fact that other people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to see it and it changes everything.</v>

458
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still doing this.</v>

459
00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Even if they're faking it and acting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

460
00:23:41.831 --> 00:23:43.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still doing all this stuff on the</v>

461
00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:45.680
<v Speaker 1>show and to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

462
00:23:45.681 --> 00:23:50.681
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like some sort of a national </v>

463
00:23:50.681 --> 00:23:50.681
<v Speaker 1>geographic special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

464
00:23:50.681 --> 00:23:50.850
<v Speaker 1>I want to watch it more.</v>

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.321
<v Speaker 1>haven't watched it more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've been withdrawing a little </v>

00:24:56.321 --> 00:25:00.011
<v Speaker 1>bit from a television need to last </v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't watch that.</v>

499
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:09.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want no more.</v>

500
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.320
<v Speaker 1>I used to like watching the people suck </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning,</v>

501

<v Speaker 1>but then I get them.</v>

00:25:23.691 --> 00:25:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Susan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was her name?</v>

510
00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:29.510
<v Speaker 1>The one could really sang Susan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Susan Boyle,</v>

511

<v Speaker 1>Boyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Susan.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Susan Boyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

513
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.270
<v Speaker 1>That was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was,</v>

514
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.160
<v Speaker 1>that was really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

515
00:25:34.161 --> 00:25:39.161
<v Speaker 1>she had an amazing voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how many hours do I have to sit </v>

516
00:25:39.161 --> 00:25:41.411
<v Speaker 1>through of bullshit before I get to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was the and it was a perfect </v>

517
00:25:41.411 --> 00:25:42.500
<v Speaker 1>moment and it was just sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect,</v>

518
00:25:42.501 --> 00:25:45.890
<v Speaker 1>perfect thing that happened here yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is I don't like to.</v>

519
00:25:45.891 --> 00:25:50.891
<v Speaker 1>I used to like the beginning when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were a fucking up to at the beginning </v>

520
00:25:50.891 --> 00:25:53.861
<v Speaker 1>and they making fools of themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it seems like the people coming </v>

521
00:25:53.861 --> 00:25:55.550
<v Speaker 1>in are coming and I can't watch that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

522
00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another musical sucks on the radio </v>

523
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:00.560
<v Speaker 1>now because it all comes out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

524
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all coming out of that same funnel.</v>

525
00:26:03.501 --> 00:26:08.501
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we gotta we gotta do a really good </v>

<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

532
00:26:15.321 --> 00:26:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

533
00:26:16.351 --> 00:26:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

569
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.400

<v Speaker 5>all sorts of songs that they think they </v>

00:28:51.601 --> 00:28:53.160
<v Speaker 5>You just have to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just hard to do.</v>

596
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.490

<v Speaker 5>through.</v>

602
00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.480
<v Speaker 5>So much data and slash or helps me the </v>

<v Speaker 5>if you don't have that program on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>phone,</v>

607
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.700
<v Speaker 5>it's the most incredible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't even believe it's real.</v>

608
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.770
<v Speaker 5>You hold your phone up to a speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

609
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 5>he plays the song and it tells you what </v>
<v Speaker 5>the song is.</v>

610
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:31.860
<v Speaker 5>And unless you buy it on your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sound snap.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that's impossible.</v>

613
00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.920
<v Speaker 5>It's just trying to tell me about music </v>
<v Speaker 5>chords,</v>

614
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.230
<v Speaker 5>that and that and this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

615
00:29:40.231 --> 00:29:41.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do it.</v>

616
00:29:41.411 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>

617
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just wave forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

618
00:29:44.861 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 1>that's what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes the,</v>

619
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.670
<v Speaker 1>takes the song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it a wave form,</v>

620
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.090
<v Speaker 1>like a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Jpeg,</v>

621
00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:50.900
<v Speaker 1>and it just puts it in a database.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Analyze.</v>

622
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze it.</v>

623
00:29:51.821 --> 00:29:56.821
<v Speaker 1>And it's like matching fingerprints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually pretty brilliant how it </v>

624
00:29:56.821 --> 00:30:00.031
<v Speaker 1>works and it's not that big of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we even get to know when the </v>

625
00:30:00.731 --> 00:30:02.000
<v Speaker 1>computers take over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

626
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.490
<v Speaker 1>we even going to know we're not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to know.</v>

627
00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to take over.</v>

628
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:11.570
<v Speaker 1>So Dave started with the Tia 81 I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing today?</v>

629
00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:17.250
<v Speaker 1>It's real number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you like to play again,</v>

630
00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.170
<v Speaker 1>analyze it in seconds and tell you what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the song is,</v>

631
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.490
<v Speaker 1>listened to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze it,</v>

632
00:30:21.491 --> 00:30:25.000
<v Speaker 1>break it down to a piece of data and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then spit it back at you with options to</v>

633
00:30:25.001 --> 00:30:28.960
<v Speaker 1>purchase it all in seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they can do it for,</v>

634
00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:33.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practically every fucking song there is </v>

635
00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.851
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a failing me wants to </v>

636
00:30:35.851 --> 00:30:35.851
<v Speaker 1>have you ever had a failing once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was also like a remix version.</v>

637
00:30:35.851 --> 00:30:36.610
<v Speaker 1>So it was other shit mixed up.</v>

638
00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:38.480
<v Speaker 4>You hear a song,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like it,</v>

639
00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:43.510
<v Speaker 4>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to know what it is you have </v>

640
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.510
<v Speaker 4>polled Shazamm up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It tells you what it is,</v>

641
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.980
<v Speaker 4>downloads it and buys it</v>

642
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:49.020
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start asking it in your car seconds </v>

643
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:49.020
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your car's Bluetooth,</v>

644
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's planning your.</v>

645
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:54.330
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want bumblebee song because it's like </v>

646
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:54.330
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was,</v>

647
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:54.330
<v Speaker 4>when I was doing my wrap group back </v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

648
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:55.260
<v Speaker 4>I was a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

649
00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.300
<v Speaker 4>we were back then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was all about sampling loops,</v>

650
00:30:57.301 --> 00:30:59.070
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you'd find you'd hear loops of music,</v>

651
00:30:59.071 --> 00:31:04.071
<v Speaker 4>breaks of music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we'd go into the radio station all </v>

652
00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:04.071
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was looking for a cool beat breaks and</v>

653
00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:05.640
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you hear that you'd always hear stuff</v>

654
00:31:05.641 --> 00:31:07.200
<v Speaker 4>and you wouldn't know what to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what it was.</v>

655
00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.170
<v Speaker 4>Then you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

656
00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:09.020
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

657
00:31:09.021 --> 00:31:10.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me ask you a question.</v>

658
00:31:10.171 --> 00:31:11.520
<v Speaker 4>Can I ask you a question?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

659
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:14.940
<v Speaker 4>Because I've noticed you have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Buddhas around the house,</v>

660
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:15.670
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

661
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:16.680
<v Speaker 4>It said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

662
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.590
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

663
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:21.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I had a Buddha and uh,</v>

664
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:21.810
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

665
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.200
<v Speaker 4>I really like them a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had one at my house.</v>

666
00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.450
<v Speaker 4>It was when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

667
00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:29.430
<v Speaker 4>when I got my house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was there already.</v>

668
00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.230
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get the Buddha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Buddha was there already.</v>

669
00:31:31.231 --> 00:31:32.940
<v Speaker 4>It was a fountain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

670
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.600
<v Speaker 4>Because on a pole it was a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>fountains,</v>

671
00:31:36.601 --> 00:31:41.010
<v Speaker 4>but the size of that poster there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big concrete fountain.</v>

672
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.620
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had uh,</v>

673
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.600
<v Speaker 4>a meeting one day with a television </v>
<v Speaker 4>executive at my house.</v>

674
00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:53.650
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we went up on the roof of my house </v>

675
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:53.970
<v Speaker 4>and we had a meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a discussion,</v>

676
00:31:53.971 --> 00:31:56.190
<v Speaker 4>having a beer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about some ideas,</v>

677
00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.760
<v Speaker 4>television ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we hear this enormous crash.</v>

678
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:05.060
<v Speaker 4>We go down and the Buddha has just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason the pole is on this </v>

679
00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.590
<v Speaker 4>metal pole smashed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has fallen,</v>

680
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:12.780
<v Speaker 4>it is smashed into a million pieces and </v>
<v Speaker 4>gone into my swimming pool.</v>

681
00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.780
<v Speaker 4>And I'm looking at it and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>

682
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.220
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apart from like,</v>

683
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.460
<v Speaker 4>I really miss the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a sign of.</v>

684
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:21.720
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

685
00:32:21.721 --> 00:32:22.080
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

686
00:32:22.081 --> 00:32:27.081
<v Speaker 1>it's not like swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a donald duck statute's still </v>

687
00:32:27.081 --> 00:32:27.081
<v Speaker 1>a little fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's just,</v>

688
00:32:27.081 --> 00:32:29.880
<v Speaker 1>there's no magical property to having </v>
<v Speaker 1>the boot and it's just,</v>

689
00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:31.380
<v Speaker 1>it's just a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nice thing to look.</v>

690
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:36.420
<v Speaker 1>I am fascinated by ancient Asian artwork</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinated by Buddhists and tie Buddhas </v>

691
00:32:37.411 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that they've looked that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way for</v>

692
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:45.010
<v Speaker 5>hundreds and thousands of years and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these different people depict these </v>

693
00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:48.971
<v Speaker 5>things in the different artistic ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that the Buddha is a character of </v>

694
00:32:48.971 --> 00:32:49.220

716
00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:52.661
<v Speaker 5>practice is and it's been done several </v>
<v Speaker 5>times by these monks and one of the </v>

717
00:33:53.241 --> 00:33:56.420
<v Speaker 5>things they do is they eat nothing but a</v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

00:33:56.421 --> 00:34:00.050
<v Speaker 5>very lean foods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They eat like seeds and nuts and they go</v>

719
00:34:00.051 --> 00:34:05.051
<v Speaker 5>through rigorous exercise routines for </v>
<v Speaker 5>like three years where they virtually </v>

720
00:34:05.051 --> 00:34:07.510
<v Speaker 5>stripped their body of all its fat and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then they start drinking this,</v>

721
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:12.590
<v Speaker 5>this crazy a tonic that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like semi poisonous so it doesn't </v>

722
00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.860
<v Speaker 5>kill them but it fucks them up nice and </v>
<v Speaker 5>slowly and it keeps maggots from growing</v>

723
00:34:15.861 --> 00:34:17.180
<v Speaker 5>on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get this.</v>

724
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:20.780
<v Speaker 5>Then they climb into a sarcophagus when </v>
<v Speaker 5>after they've done this for awhile,</v>

725
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.520
<v Speaker 5>so their bodies like ready to go.</v>

726
00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:27.570
<v Speaker 5>They climbing this sarcophagus and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>close the lid on them and there's just </v>

727
00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.690
<v Speaker 5>an air hole and a bell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so like the guy in the Lotus position,</v>

728
00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:34.970
<v Speaker 5>that new movie with a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He stays in the Lotus position with the </v>

729
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:37.940
<v Speaker 5>air hole in the bell and every day if </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's alive he rings the bell and the day</v>

730
00:34:37.941 --> 00:34:42.941
<v Speaker 5>that he doesn't ring the Bell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they seal the coughing up and then he's </v>

731
00:34:42.941 --> 00:34:44.290
<v Speaker 5>in there for good and he's mummified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why modification?</v>

732
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.580

<v Speaker 4>fun about doing standup as I'm getting </v>

810
00:37:33.031 --> 00:37:34.360
<v Speaker 4>to go to a comedy festival and hanging </v>
<v Speaker 4>out with a bunch of funny people.</v>

811
00:37:34.361 --> 00:37:35.850
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

812
00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.290
<v Speaker 4>I've saw Doug Stan hope up at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Montreal comedy festival.</v>

813
00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:43.220
<v Speaker 4>He had this awesome party in a carwash,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

814
00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:48.240
<v Speaker 4>it was like a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he calls it just for spite and he </v>

815
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.110
<v Speaker 4>does it a po opposing the actual camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

816
00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:56.120
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not part of the festival and this </v>

817
00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:56.120
<v Speaker 4>was this whole sort of controversial </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that was going on up there,</v>

818
00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.631
<v Speaker 4>but it was actually quite funny because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he had this amazing party in this </v>

819
00:38:00.631 --> 00:38:01.270
<v Speaker 4>carwash right across the street isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really great.</v>

823
00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:05.770
<v Speaker 4>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

824
00:38:05.771 --> 00:38:07.810
<v Speaker 4>well the bar at the hotel closed and </v>

00:41:51.491 --> 00:41:54.280
<v Speaker 4>we've rigged up this compressed air that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to put in the back of the </v>

926
00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:54.890
<v Speaker 4>taxidermy deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to run your knife down.</v>

927
00:41:54.891 --> 00:41:58.430
<v Speaker 4>The slit is going to shoot out real pig </v>
<v Speaker 4>guts that we've got the butcher shop,</v>

928
00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm draped in pig guts and I'm doing</v>

929
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:03.410
<v Speaker 4>all this stuff right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're thinking,</v>

930
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:04.310
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy,</v>

931
00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:06.560
<v Speaker 4>this is going to look crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the movie comes out,</v>

932
00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.000
<v Speaker 4>everybody like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

933

<v Speaker 4>you've never been seen before in your </v>

936
00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:16.060
<v Speaker 4>life at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

937
00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:19.510
<v Speaker 4>Local papers and people and you and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel completely kind of confused about </v>

938
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.510
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

939
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:21.980
<v Speaker 4>Because you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

940
00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:23.300
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was pretty fucking funny.</v>

941
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's wrong with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

942
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:27.410
<v Speaker 4>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fun thing about it is after that</v>

943
00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:32.190
<v Speaker 4>initial weekend and the whole sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody talking about your movie being</v>

944
00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:36.500
<v Speaker 4>crazy and disgusting and all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you uh,</v>

945
00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:41.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been on tour this year doing stand </v>

946
00:42:41.501 --> 00:42:42.500
<v Speaker 4>up and it's been so much fun because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of a nut jobs out there in</v>

947
00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:44.640
<v Speaker 4>the world that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that let that love the movie and they're</v>

948
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.760
<v Speaker 4>part of my show now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when I do my standup,</v>

949
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.000
<v Speaker 4>I do a little guitar at my show in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle and I seen a couple like,</v>

950
00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:51.320
<v Speaker 4>Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you like some sausage?</v>

951
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:53.480

<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

952
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.670
<v Speaker 4>And then people start shouting out some </v>
<v Speaker 4>of their favorite bits.</v>

953
00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.280
<v Speaker 4>But I'm surprised it went all across </v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>

954
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:03.880
<v Speaker 4>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Next month I'm going to be in a Toronto </v>

<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

956
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:06.470
<v Speaker 4>a Hamilton and London,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ontario,</v>

957
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:10.360
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people come to the shows and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Freddie.</v>

960
00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.970
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Feels a lot.</v>

961
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.180
<v Speaker 4>I guess what I'm saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thanks for bringing it up.</v>

962
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:21.250
<v Speaker 4>This is what I used to be out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually getting all this positive </v>

963
00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.551
<v Speaker 4>feedback about the movie because I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>made to feel like you're a victim of a </v>

964
00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:30.880
<v Speaker 4>pre-internet review system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a bunch of fogy old douche bags </v>

965
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.660
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way people looked at things was,</v>

966
00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:34.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't just be when,</v>

967
00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:36.560
<v Speaker 4>what year was pretty good fingered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was 2001,</v>

968
00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:41.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck was on the Internet back </v>

969
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:41.580
<v Speaker 4>then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

970
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:41.580
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't the same as 2010 and the thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't attend.</v>

971
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.480
<v Speaker 4>You get your reviews from ain't it cool </v>
<v Speaker 4>news.com.</v>

972
00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:49.810
<v Speaker 4>That kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I always go to Fandango or </v>

973
00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:49.810
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get my reviews online.</v>

974
00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.640
<v Speaker 4>I want to use this moment as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a real opportunity for me to actually</v>

975
00:43:52.641 --> 00:43:53.780
<v Speaker 4>talk about this for a second.</v>

976
00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.970
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I directed this movie.</v>

977
00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.540
<v Speaker 4>I wrote this whole thing and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>freaks out on it.</v>

978
00:43:59.541 --> 00:44:00.530
<v Speaker 4>It's Pre-internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

979
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.710
<v Speaker 4>I the other day I went and I looked at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>netflix.</v>

980
00:44:03.711 --> 00:44:05.690
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the end of the reviews of the movies.</v>

981
00:44:05.691 --> 00:44:10.691
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I did this just two days ago and I </v>

982
00:44:10.691 --> 00:44:12.581
<v Speaker 4>looked at the reviews and Freddy got </v>
<v Speaker 4>fingered and the point of making that </v>

983
00:44:12.581 --> 00:44:13.010
<v Speaker 4>movie was to kind of be polarizing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

984
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:18.100
<v Speaker 4>It was supposed to be ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was done in a way where I think that </v>

985
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:21.911
<v Speaker 4>50 percent of the people who watch it </v>
<v Speaker 4>are definitely going to hate it more </v>

986
00:44:21.911 --> 00:44:22.790
<v Speaker 4>than anything they've ever seen in their</v>
<v Speaker 4>entire life.</v>

987
00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:24.760
<v Speaker 4>And that was the goal to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

988
00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:27.560
<v Speaker 4>in the job is obviously that the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>50 percent of the people are laughing at</v>

989
00:44:27.561 --> 00:44:28.850
<v Speaker 4>the 50 percent of the people that hate </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

990
00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:30.200
<v Speaker 4>And that's the joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

991
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.400
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went on Netflix and you're reading the</v>

992
00:44:32.401 --> 00:44:37.401
<v Speaker 4>reviews and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty much 50 slash 50 people are </v>

993
00:44:37.401 --> 00:44:38.640
<v Speaker 4>giving it either you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good review or the worst review you've</v>

994
00:44:38.641 --> 00:44:40.590
<v Speaker 4>ever read in your life back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back and forth,</v>

995
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:42.920
<v Speaker 4>and these people are just arguing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other about it.</v>

996
00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:48.120
<v Speaker 4>And here we are 10 years later after I </v>
<v Speaker 4>made this thing and looking at these </v>

997
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.951
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having these passionate arguments </v>

998
00:44:51.951 --> 00:44:51.951
<v Speaker 4>completely on opposite ends of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>spectrum.</v>

999
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:57.380
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I like to go read the reviews on </v>

1000
00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:59.900
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really truly believed that at that </v>

1001
00:44:59.900 --> 00:44:59.970
<v Speaker 4>movie came out today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be an internet phenomenon.</v>

1002
00:44:59.971 --> 00:45:03.240
<v Speaker 4>People will be so into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a fucking fun,</v>

1003
00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:04.890
<v Speaker 4>crazy movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Red You will.</v>

1004
00:45:04.891 --> 00:45:09.891
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping to make another movie this </v>
<v Speaker 4>year since since he has asked about the </v>

1005
00:45:09.891 --> 00:45:13.851
<v Speaker 4>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping to make another movie this </v>

1006
00:45:13.851 --> 00:45:14.070
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is going to be called insane prank</v>

1007
00:45:14.071 --> 00:45:17.970
<v Speaker 4>movie and it's going to be just a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 4>of crazy pranks street stuff,</v>

1008
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:19.640
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be sort of a.</v>

1009
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.900
<v Speaker 4>well don't get beat up man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been hearing you.</v>

1010
00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:23.430
<v Speaker 4>You're telling me you're getting in </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I've been in two fights.</v>

1014
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.430
<v Speaker 4>You're grown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1015
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:34.800
<v Speaker 4>I won't be around and not get in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was defending myself both times.</v>

1016
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was attacked both times by who?</v>

1017
00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:42.690
<v Speaker 4>I was by strangers both times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For what reason?</v>

1018
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time I was attacked.</v>

1019
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:47.340
<v Speaker 4>Where was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where does taking place?</v>

1020
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:52.370
<v Speaker 4>About two years ago in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And did the guy know you were Tom Green?</v>

1021
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:57.580
<v Speaker 4>The he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was somebody who knew somebody.</v>

1022
00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1023
00:45:59.161 --> 00:46:04.161
<v Speaker 4>He was somebody who was an acquaintance </v>
<v Speaker 4>of somebody who I knew and now I'm now </v>

1024
00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:09.891
<v Speaker 4>I'm starting to get worried about </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting into the details because what </v>

1025
00:46:09.891 --> 00:46:09.990
<v Speaker 4>really happened was quite intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quite intense.</v>

1026
00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.180
<v Speaker 4>Why I'm worried about getting it.</v>

1027
00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:11.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

1028
00:46:11.851 --> 00:46:13.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just thinking now all of a sudden I've</v>

1029
00:46:13.261 --> 00:46:15.680
<v Speaker 4>never really talked about this on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>radio in.</v>

1030
00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:17.830
<v Speaker 4>That'd be kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's weird when you get in a fight,</v>

1031
00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.470
<v Speaker 4>beat somebody up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom Green?</v>

1032
00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:20.340
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>

1033
00:46:20.341 --> 00:46:22.980
<v Speaker 4>He was punched in the head and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>retaliated.</v>

1034
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:25.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then whoop that ass,</v>

1035
00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:30.340
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you get all up in their beat that </v>

1036
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:30.340
<v Speaker 4>ass essentially?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1037
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1038
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.430
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was not heard.</v>

1039
00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.150
<v Speaker 4>Probably shouldn't give out the details </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

1040
00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:36.900
<v Speaker 4>I just don't get sued.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're Tom Green.</v>

1041
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:37.890
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1042
00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.930
<v Speaker 4>somebody punched me in the head and so I</v>
<v Speaker 4>had to kind of thing.</v>

1043
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:46.080
<v Speaker 4>But then the other solid jaw take a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot right there.</v>

1044
00:46:46.081 --> 00:46:47.730
<v Speaker 4>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a bump the next day.</v>

1045
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.950
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was itching gray out or did you stand</v>

1046
00:46:49.951 --> 00:46:52.650
<v Speaker 4>your ground?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was actually sitting down.</v>

1047
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.420
<v Speaker 4>He punched you when you were sitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

1048
00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:00.260
<v Speaker 4>What did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were you getting blown by his </v>

1049
00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:00.260
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why while you sitting?</v>

1050
00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.470
<v Speaker 4>I was sitting beside his girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were?</v>

1051
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:02.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or a girl that he knew,</v>

1052
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:05.430
<v Speaker 4>but I wasn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1053
00:47:05.431 --> 00:47:07.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was also with a girl who was my friend</v>

1054
00:47:07.831 --> 00:47:12.831
<v Speaker 4>who was sitting beside me on this side </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we were all friends and she was </v>

1055
00:47:12.831 --> 00:47:13.200
<v Speaker 4>friends with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>

1056
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:14.340
<v Speaker 4>this is the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's,</v>

1057
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:15.910
<v Speaker 4>let's move past that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The point is,</v>

1058
00:47:15.911 --> 00:47:17.610
<v Speaker 4>as you got in fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got in a fight,</v>

1059
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.710
<v Speaker 4>so then the second time around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1060
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.350
<v Speaker 4>you're a veteran by now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're ready to end.</v>

1061
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.750
<v Speaker 4>This is actually something I can ask you</v>
<v Speaker 4>about for advice on this because this is</v>

1062
00:47:24.751 --> 00:47:26.730
<v Speaker 4>about controlling your temper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1063
00:47:26.731 --> 00:47:29.670
<v Speaker 4>This is about when somebody comes at you</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know you're.</v>

1064
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:31.810
<v Speaker 4>You are a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you know about this stuff,</v>

1065
00:47:31.811 --> 00:47:33.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about this stuff,</v>

1066
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 4>but what happened I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go go into this sort of post traumatic</v>

1067
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:42.460
<v Speaker 4>stress disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of everything goes in slow motion.</v>

1068
00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:43.560
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1069
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:47.480
<v Speaker 5>that's one of the best things about </v>
<v Speaker 5>learning martial arts is that you become</v>

1070
00:47:47.481 --> 00:47:49.670
<v Speaker 5>confident in your ability to defend </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>

1071
00:47:49.671 --> 00:47:51.830
<v Speaker 5>not you might not always be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>defend yourself.</v>

1072
00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:53.550
<v Speaker 5>You might.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There might be guns and weapons and all,</v>

1073
00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:57.020
<v Speaker 5>but you're not going to feel completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>helpless.</v>

1074
00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:58.580
<v Speaker 5>You're going to feel like you have at </v>
<v Speaker 5>least confidence.</v>

1075
00:47:58.581 --> 00:48:00.110
<v Speaker 5>If you have a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do something.</v>

1076
00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.930
<v Speaker 5>Whereas a person who doesn't know how to</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight it all and has no experience,</v>

1077
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:07.130
<v Speaker 5>it's such a paralyzing feeling when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the presence of violence.</v>

1078
00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:09.290
<v Speaker 5>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just want to cover up in a ball,</v>

1079
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:10.730
<v Speaker 5>you just want to try to protect </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>

1080
00:48:10.731 --> 00:48:14.050
<v Speaker 5>You don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this first occasion had bad feelings.</v>

1081
00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:14.930
<v Speaker 5>First occasion happened</v>

1082
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:19.930
<v Speaker 4>and cut to three months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe six months later I'm walking down </v>

1083
00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:22.400
<v Speaker 4>sunset outside Mel's diner that's got </v>
<v Speaker 4>the stitches taken out.</v>

1084
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:25.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Somehow,</v>

1085
00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:25.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1086
00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:30.440
<v Speaker 4>for some reason somebody comes up behind</v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

1087
00:48:30.441 --> 00:48:35.441
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'd actually had a few drinks </v>

1088
00:48:35.441 --> 00:48:37.811
<v Speaker 4>that night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me and my friends were being somewhat </v>

1089
00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:37.811
<v Speaker 4>obnoxious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1090
00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:39.680
<v Speaker 4>talking loudly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being generally idiots on the street.</v>

1091
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:40.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And some,</v>

1092
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:45.440
<v Speaker 4>some guy saw me being kind of an idiot </v>
<v Speaker 4>and came walking up to me and my friend,</v>

1093
00:48:45.441 --> 00:48:47.390
<v Speaker 4>that was Brian and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

1094
00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:49.640
<v Speaker 4>I want to kick your ass right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like that.</v>

1095
00:48:49.641 --> 00:48:50.630
<v Speaker 4>No reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1096
00:48:50.631 --> 00:48:52.940
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to kick your ass right now.</v>

1097
00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:57.110
<v Speaker 4>And this guy was actually smaller than </v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

1098
00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.490
<v Speaker 4>which I thought was strange in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming out of nowhere.</v>

1099
00:48:59.491 --> 00:49:03.680
<v Speaker 4>And the word of the dark and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>one around right by Poquito mas outside.</v>

1100
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:06.740
<v Speaker 4>Mel Mel's diner on sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look at him,</v>

1101
00:49:06.741 --> 00:49:07.730
<v Speaker 4>my friend looks at him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1102
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:10.220
<v Speaker 4>my friend says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you serious dude?</v>

1103
00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:11.480
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1104
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:14.060
<v Speaker 4>And then my friend for whatever reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes okay.</v>

1105
00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.060
<v Speaker 4>And goes like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then this guy's running at me,</v>

1106
00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:22.330
<v Speaker 4>but because of the previous situation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm now in like the slow motion mode.</v>

1107
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.260
<v Speaker 4>Like he's coming at me and I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1108
00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.670
<v Speaker 4>this is not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I went at him and I,</v>

1109
00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.650
<v Speaker 4>I just put my hands on his neck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1110
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:35.790
<v Speaker 4>And I put my hand behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of lowered them down under the </v>

1111
00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:36.410
<v Speaker 4>ground and I put my fist up in his face </v>
<v Speaker 4>like this.</v>

1112
00:49:36.411 --> 00:49:37.880
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to hurt you man.</v>

1113
00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:40.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to hurt you.</v>

1114
00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.160
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said his leg was kind of flapping</v>

1115
00:49:43.161 --> 00:49:48.161
<v Speaker 4>up on the side of my body like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had him pinned on his back on the </v>

1116
00:49:48.161 --> 00:49:48.161
<v Speaker 4>sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

1117
00:49:48.161 --> 00:49:48.530
<v Speaker 4>okay man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1118
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:52.750
<v Speaker 4>And I got up and he walked away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

1119
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:57.910
<v Speaker 5>so then how for rape joke to the mount </v>
<v Speaker 5>position for those that you don't know </v>

1120
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:58.880
<v Speaker 5>what Tom Green was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grabbing the hand and the bitch,</v>

1121
00:49:58.881 --> 00:50:01.370
<v Speaker 5>where's my money grip?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he had a fist up.</v>

1122
00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:03.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it just kind of ended.</v>

1123
00:50:03.331 --> 00:50:07.890
<v Speaker 4>It diffused the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody got hurt and uh,</v>

1124
00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:12.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1125
00:50:12.081 --> 00:50:17.081
<v Speaker 4>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's something that people </v>

1126
00:50:17.081 --> 00:50:17.081
<v Speaker 4>need to know is that to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1127
00:50:17.081 --> 00:50:19.310
<v Speaker 4>there is this flash of a moment when </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody attacks you were,</v>

1128
00:50:19.311 --> 00:50:20.870
<v Speaker 4>you kind of go into this animal mode,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1129
00:50:20.871 --> 00:50:22.820
<v Speaker 4>And you're not in complete control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1130
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000
<v Speaker 4>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta you gotta kind of be able to </v>

1131
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:28.120
<v Speaker 4>control that now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you like paranoid</v>

1132
00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.510
<v Speaker 1>that everyone's going to attack you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1133
00:50:29.511 --> 00:50:32.930
<v Speaker 1>do you like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although less paranoid now because I now</v>

1134
00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:34.520
<v Speaker 1>know I got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a,</v>

1135
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:39.610
<v Speaker 1>got that sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like a throat on the </v>

1136
00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:40.270
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always thinking about it.</v>

1137
00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the other thing is,</v>

1138
00:50:42.311 --> 00:50:47.311
<v Speaker 1>is that that only worked because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming at me fast and he was sort of </v>

1139
00:50:47.311 --> 00:50:47.720
<v Speaker 1>smaller than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that would've worked if he</v>

1140
00:50:47.721 --> 00:50:49.940
<v Speaker 1>was bigger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have worked on new.</v>

1141
00:50:49.941 --> 00:50:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Anything new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that would work.</v>

1142
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.440
<v Speaker 1>You find a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was probably really,</v>

1143
00:50:54.441 --> 00:50:59.441
<v Speaker 1>really drunk and it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it was exciting though because I </v>

1144
00:50:59.441 --> 00:51:00.350
<v Speaker 1>haven't been in any sort of physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>altercation since I was at a kid.</v>

1145
00:51:00.351 --> 00:51:03.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't want that kind of excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to go to Jujitsu class,</v>

1146
00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to spar,</v>

1147
00:51:05.601 --> 00:51:10.601
<v Speaker 1>you get to go full blast with each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to kill each other with your </v>

1148
00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:10.601
<v Speaker 1>bare hands.</v>

1149
00:51:10.601 --> 00:51:13.420
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get all that shit out and you don't </v>

1150
00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.341
<v Speaker 1>have to get in fights on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On your conflict is there's a certain </v>

1151
00:51:15.771 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 1>amount over a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>excitement,</v>

1152
00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:21.470
<v Speaker 1>primal excitement that comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's very dangerous man.</v>

1153
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

1154
00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:27.180
<v Speaker 1>when you're an alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys were walking down the street </v>

1155
00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:27.180
<v Speaker 1>making a fuck load of noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1156
00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:30.821
<v Speaker 1>this has become so paranoid about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since then that I've actually kind of </v>

1157
00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:35.500
<v Speaker 1>essentially really laid off the sauce a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit because I realized that,</v>

1158
00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I didn't really kind of.</v>

1159
00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I got attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1160
00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:43.430
<v Speaker 1>but it was due to my own sort of loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obnoxious behavior.</v>

1161
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:45.320
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you learn from that,</v>

1162
00:51:45.321 --> 00:51:45.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1163
00:51:45.891 --> 00:51:46.610
<v Speaker 1>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do.</v>

1164
00:51:46.611 --> 00:51:51.611
<v Speaker 1>And drunkenness and things you can do if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really loud and in public.</v>

1165
00:51:51.801 --> 00:51:54.410
<v Speaker 1>That's a douchey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's when you're in your twenties,</v>

1166
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.800
<v Speaker 1>being drunk out at the bar and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

1167
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part,</v>

1168
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:04.040
<v Speaker 1>it's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just turned 39 years old and I'm </v>

1169
00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:04.310
<v Speaker 1>thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not cute anymore.</v>

1170
00:52:04.311 --> 00:52:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

1171
00:52:05.001 --> 00:52:10.001
<v Speaker 1>It's not cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not cute when it annoys other </v>

1172
00:52:10.001 --> 00:52:10.001
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is,</v>

1173
00:52:10.001 --> 00:52:12.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I never used to think about that </v>

1174
00:52:12.821 --> 00:52:12.821
<v Speaker 1>when I was younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think about it.</v>

1175
00:52:12.821 --> 00:52:12.890
<v Speaker 1>I just random fun it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

1176
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're having fun.</v>

1177
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a shit and then as you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>older you start going,</v>

1178
00:52:16.461 --> 00:52:21.461
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we're having fun at other </v>

1179
00:52:21.461 --> 00:52:21.461
<v Speaker 1>people's expense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't be fun.</v>

1180
00:52:21.461 --> 00:52:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Should be annoying to me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should be embarrassed.</v>

1181
00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:24.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they learn not to be a Douche bag.</v>

1182
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1183
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what moved that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ready to go.</v>

1184
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I think you might want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you,</v>

1185
00:52:31.911 --> 00:52:36.911
<v Speaker 1>we'll go onto my cage in the garage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you some counters to be very </v>

1186
00:52:36.911 --> 00:52:36.911
<v Speaker 1>careful.</v>

1187
00:52:36.911 --> 00:52:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

1188
00:52:36.951 --> 00:52:41.480
<v Speaker 1>I would appreciate some self defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I want to extend your arm.</v>

1189
00:52:41.481 --> 00:52:43.040
<v Speaker 1>You've got to make sure you do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

1190
00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.110
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to take some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some Jujitsu.</v>

1191
00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Crop was fun too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a combination of things and </v>

1192
00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:50.700
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1193
00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.440
<v Speaker 1>they give you like a lot of stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you do on the street when a</v>

1194
00:52:51.441 --> 00:52:56.441
<v Speaker 1>guy comes after you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't prepare for everything on </v>

1195
00:52:56.441 --> 00:52:56.441
<v Speaker 1>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really know what the fuck.</v>

1196
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.050
<v Speaker 1>If a guy's going to have a gun or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>knife,</v>

1197
00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:00.250
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1198
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:03.710
<v Speaker 1>You're better off just getting really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at any sort of a martial art.</v>

1199
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Like you know you're really going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at knife defense.</v>

1200
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:09.260
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1201
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:13.010
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a waste of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>considering no one's ever pulled a knife</v>

1202
00:53:13.011 --> 00:53:14.840
<v Speaker 1>on you and your life away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>douchebags.</v>

1203
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Keep your life clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's hope we don't get stabbed.</v>

1204
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

1205
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:20.990
<v Speaker 1>don't be going out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Practice every day because one day God's</v>

1206
00:53:20.991 --> 00:53:25.991
<v Speaker 1>going to have a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this fat guy has his website on </v>

1207
00:53:25.991 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of attacks,</v>

1208
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 3>like a knife against a knife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how he will block this knife and then he</v>

1209
00:53:30.091 --> 00:53:33.510
<v Speaker 3>will attack this means up fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck Guy's hilarious.</v>

1210
00:53:33.511 --> 00:53:35.020
<v Speaker 3>He's completely out of shape and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1211
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.590
<v Speaker 3>he's actually kind of a half decent </v>
<v Speaker 3>writer,</v>

1212
00:53:37.591 --> 00:53:40.590
<v Speaker 3>but totally completely delusional </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts guy.</v>

1213
00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:41.650
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1214
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:46.670
<v Speaker 3>he's got these instructional videos </v>
<v Speaker 3>where a guy will come at him with a </v>

1215
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:48.660
<v Speaker 3>knife and he will block this knife and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cut to the guy's body,</v>

1216
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:54.110
<v Speaker 3>go behind him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he cuts like major organs and I'm </v>

1217
00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:57.051
<v Speaker 3>looking to make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the most ridiculous thing I've </v>

1218
00:53:57.051 --> 00:53:59.001
<v Speaker 3>ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Preparing for a knife fight that will </v>

1219
00:53:59.001 --> 00:53:59.790
<v Speaker 3>never have one probably cause of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>preparing for it to take your clothes.</v>

1220
00:53:59.791 --> 00:54:03.690
<v Speaker 3>Increasing his odds of being killed by </v>
<v Speaker 3>like $10,000</v>

1221
00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.280
<v Speaker 3>times carrying knives on them </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

1222
00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.650
<v Speaker 3>Challenged asking for a knife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

1223
00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:10.290
<v Speaker 3>He's begging for a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fight is nuts.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what the fuck's wasting their </v>
<v Speaker 3>life?</v>

1226
00:54:15.181 --> 00:54:20.181
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I look down here at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stream and then I see you and I'm </v>

1227
00:54:20.181 --> 00:54:20.670
<v Speaker 3>thinking that I'm looking at you live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's deliberately.</v>

1228
00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's not look at it because I don't </v>

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:43.020
<v Speaker 3>maybe we wait until the show's over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>as one of the most awkward things,</v>

1267
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:45.100
<v Speaker 3>every driveway or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1268
00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:50.220
<v Speaker 3>Like when Doug's down opens here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to sell it really good </v>

1269
00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:50.220
<v Speaker 3>things about them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>

1270
00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:53.541
<v Speaker 3>it's so weird saying that he's right </v>
<v Speaker 3>here and it's going to broadcasting in </v>

1271
00:55:53.541 --> 00:55:53.541
<v Speaker 3>front of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a great show though.</v>

1272
00:55:53.541 --> 00:55:55.890
<v Speaker 3>You come up to Joe's house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee,</v>

1273
00:55:55.891 --> 00:55:58.640
<v Speaker 3>you get a blow job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people though I think a</v>

1274
00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:03.650
<v Speaker 3>lot you've inspired a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>inspired me to do this man this online.</v>

1275
00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:06.540
<v Speaker 3>When I came over to your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1276
00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:07.320
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

1277
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.490
<v Speaker 3>I remember how excited you are about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you talk to the,</v>

1278
00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:15.550
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a document or was an </v>

1279
00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:19.460
<v Speaker 3>entertainment tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada or somebody who was at the house </v>

1280
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:19.460
<v Speaker 3>and you said you were very excited about</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I thought,</v>

1281
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:23.751
<v Speaker 3>well this is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is maybe maybe this is not a waste </v>

1282
00:56:23.751 --> 00:56:23.970
<v Speaker 3>of time doing the show in living room </v>
<v Speaker 3>just so we,</v>

1283
00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:29.120
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we knew that eventually it was going to </v>

1284
00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:29.120
<v Speaker 5>get to the point where the Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the television combined.</v>

1285
00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.730
<v Speaker 5>It hasn't totally happened yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Convert pretty close concert.</v>

1286
00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:34.960
<v Speaker 5>Too small a dribble,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1287
00:56:34.961 --> 00:56:39.961
<v Speaker 5>I can get like I have a DVD player that </v>
<v Speaker 5>lets you go to let you go to different </v>

1288
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:43.660
<v Speaker 5>sources and get netflix and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1289
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:47.380
<v Speaker 5>And even youtube allows you go to </v>
<v Speaker 5>youtube as well and you stream.</v>

1290
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.580
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about ustream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1291
00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.020
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I was wrong.</v>

1292
00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:52.870
<v Speaker 5>That was youtube here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just,</v>

1293
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:53.830
<v Speaker 5>it's close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1294
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:57.010
<v Speaker 5>you can get the Internet is bringing </v>
<v Speaker 5>content to your television.</v>

1295
00:56:57.011 --> 00:57:02.011
<v Speaker 5>It's just doing it through outside </v>
<v Speaker 5>parties now is not quite as accessible </v>

1296
00:57:02.011 --> 00:57:02.011
<v Speaker 5>as I would.</v>

1297
00:57:02.011 --> 00:57:06.670
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worry that it's going to get all </v>

1298
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:06.670
<v Speaker 4>controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you end up,</v>

1299
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:11.171
<v Speaker 4>everyone gets some box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're watching the internet on their </v>

1300
00:57:11.171 --> 00:57:11.171
<v Speaker 4>TV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not the real internet,</v>

1301
00:57:11.171 --> 00:57:16.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just the stuff that the shows that </v>

1302
00:57:16.031 --> 00:57:16.580
<v Speaker 4>get bought by Time Warner cable until </v>
<v Speaker 4>they decide to put on the Internet,</v>

1303
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:19.190
<v Speaker 4>which then all of a sudden you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the Internet.</v>

1304
00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:24.220
<v Speaker 4>You have this sort of other way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>distributing and television that's on </v>

1305
00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:24.430
<v Speaker 4>demand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're,</v>

1306
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.600
<v Speaker 4>it's not free net neutrality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1307
00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.050
<v Speaker 4>you need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>need to make sure that,</v>

1308
00:57:30.051 --> 00:57:31.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know a whole lot about it,</v>

1309
00:57:31.641 --> 00:57:36.641
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking about this the other day </v>

1310
00:57:36.641 --> 00:57:36.641
<v Speaker 4>with my friend and he said net </v>
<v Speaker 4>neutrality is a big issue right now.</v>

1311
00:57:36.641 --> 00:57:37.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're talking about,</v>

1312
00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.630
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>since you're in Hollywood,</v>

1313
00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.420
<v Speaker 5>since we don't know a lot about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>argue about it.</v>

1314
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:47.100
<v Speaker 5>It's one of us know the points.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I just think that we got to stop this</v>

1315
00:57:47.101 --> 00:57:49.230
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how we rock it in Hollywood.</v>

1316
00:57:49.890 --> 00:57:51.280
<v Speaker 5>Argue about shit we don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

1317
00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:52.010
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1318
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:56.460
<v Speaker 5>I was on stage at some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some guy in the audience just decided he</v>

1319
00:57:56.461 --> 00:57:58.080
<v Speaker 5>was going to heckle and this is what he </v>
<v Speaker 5>had called.</v>

1320
00:57:58.290 --> 00:58:03.290
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even Stephen Hawking said that the </v>

1321
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:06.060
<v Speaker 5>universe proves there must be a god.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he was arguing with me,</v>

1322
00:58:06.061 --> 00:58:07.880
<v Speaker 5>angry at me and this is what he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying.</v>

1323
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:10.500
<v Speaker 5>And then Stephen Hawkins came out last </v>
<v Speaker 5>week talking,</v>

1324
00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:14.680
<v Speaker 5>said and came out two weeks ago and said</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like,</v>

1325
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:15.750
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't even read it.</v>

1326
00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:17.310
<v Speaker 5>He didn't even read it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're arguing,</v>

1327
00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:22.410
<v Speaker 5>you're yelling it out publicly and Stan </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's La.</v>

1328
00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.930
<v Speaker 5>That's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was Los Angeles.</v>

1329
00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:26.880
<v Speaker 5>Think about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just argue it.</v>

1330
00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:33.020
<v Speaker 5>Not only did he argue it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he yelled it out and I don't even know </v>

1331
00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:36.111
<v Speaker 5>what I was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forgot because it was so ridiculous </v>

1332
00:58:36.111 --> 00:58:38.751
<v Speaker 5>what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he yelled it out like from the side </v>

1333
00:58:38.751 --> 00:58:41.151
<v Speaker 5>of the stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it was like an important point for </v>

1334
00:58:41.151 --> 00:58:43.101
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you have a conversation with them </v>

1335
00:58:43.101 --> 00:58:43.101
<v Speaker 5>about it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very little.</v>

1336
00:58:43.101 --> 00:58:43.101
<v Speaker 5>I talked to him a little bit from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stage.</v>

1337
00:58:43.101 --> 00:58:45.420
<v Speaker 5>I tried to be nice and just segwayed </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the rest of the show,</v>

1338
00:58:45.421 --> 00:58:47.250
<v Speaker 5>but he just like wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a weird thing.</v>

1339
00:58:47.251 --> 00:58:52.251
<v Speaker 5>It was like he was a guy that just </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to argue like it wasn't a game </v>

1340
00:58:52.251 --> 00:58:52.740
<v Speaker 5>like he wanted to play catch with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you noticed a lot more heckling joe</v>

<v Speaker 1>the weirdest thing when people talk back</v>

1379
01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1380
01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:21.560
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to,</v>

1381
01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just go do comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1382
01:00:23.491 --> 01:00:24.670
<v Speaker 1>and go do your own show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1383
01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to criticize.</v>

1384
01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:29.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like critics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These critics hated your fucking movie.</v>

1385
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Go make a better movie where they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make a better movie.</v>

1386
01:00:31.911 --> 01:00:33.650
<v Speaker 1>They have nothing to contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're contributing.</v>

1387
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:39.010
<v Speaker 1>They're doing their best to be verbose </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their bitchiness that's what their </v>

1388
01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:41.120
<v Speaker 1>contribution is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be County about things.</v>

1389
01:00:41.121 --> 01:00:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Always look for the negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love everything foreign.</v>

1390
01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also even when the yellow fun </v>

1391
01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:49.640
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of annoying too,</v>

1392
01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:49.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1393
01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were saying was when think they're </v>

1394
01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>trying to help you or something worse is</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they talk to you,</v>

1395
01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>you ever have people in the front row </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just talk at you,</v>

1396
01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:58.900
<v Speaker 1>like why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1397
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.140
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck I'm going to get to it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get to the whole subject,</v>

1398
01:01:03.550 --> 01:01:04.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1399
01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.200
<v Speaker 1>don't move me in a different direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

1400
01:01:06.201 --> 01:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1401
01:01:06.881 --> 01:01:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where were you going?</v>

1402
01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Why are you talking to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1403
01:01:09.411 --> 01:01:11.810
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fucking comedy show.</v>

1404
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I always give people the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yell shit out though.</v>

1405
01:01:14.751 --> 01:01:19.751
<v Speaker 1>I do a q and a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It almost end of almost every one of my </v>

1406
01:01:19.751 --> 01:01:20.150
<v Speaker 1>shows just because it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's anticlimactic.</v>

1407
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:25.390
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous because sometimes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>drags on and I do the q and a for like </v>

1408
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:28.430
<v Speaker 1>an hour or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to end because it's so </v>

1409
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:32.081
<v Speaker 1>open ended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think people like fucking around </v>

1410
01:01:32.081 --> 01:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>and being able to talk to me so I let </v>
<v Speaker 1>them know like,</v>

1411
01:01:32.631 --> 01:01:34.280
<v Speaker 1>well there'll be a time where we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>yell shit out,</v>

1412
01:01:34.281 --> 01:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

1413
01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Let me get my material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do all this and then we'll fuck </v>

1414
01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:39.700
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1415
01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:39.700
<v Speaker 1>that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1416
01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:42.140
<v Speaker 1>because it's the best is when there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines and microphones.</v>

1417
01:01:42.141 --> 01:01:43.730
<v Speaker 1>That's how I did it when I recorded my </v>
<v Speaker 1>DVD.</v>

1418
01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>That's the best way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

1419
01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>We have a line and people come up to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>line and they get to the microphone.</v>

1420
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1421
01:01:48.711 --> 01:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Because when they just yell shit out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just gets too crazy.</v>

1422
01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1423
01:01:52.521 --> 01:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to say,</v>

1424
01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>let's see guys name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1425
01:01:54.771 --> 01:01:55.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1426
01:01:55.220 --> 01:02:00.220
<v Speaker 1>talk about Jews to churches in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>church.</v>

1427
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.390
<v Speaker 1>What should he have done different now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you have stuff out on,</v>

1428
01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:12.770
<v Speaker 1>headed on tv or you do people the Leo to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do bits that I can't remember.</v>

1429
01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:17.771
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is when I stopped doing a </v>

1430
01:02:17.771 --> 01:02:17.771
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1431
01:02:17.771 --> 01:02:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody yelled out,</v>

1432
01:02:18.081 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>do the talking dog that the other day,</v>

1433
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:22.200
<v Speaker 5>the drug commercial bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like fuck,</v>

1434
01:02:22.201 --> 01:02:25.290
<v Speaker 5>how does that go?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I haven't done it in a long time so</v>

1435
01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.890
<v Speaker 5>I had to try to perform it from memory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1436
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1437
01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:33.560
<v Speaker 5>I always try to come up with new shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>and when you have new shit you got to </v>

1438
01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.351
<v Speaker 5>abandon the old shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't keep remembering it every now </v>

1439
01:02:36.351 --> 01:02:36.351
<v Speaker 5>and then what will pop up from like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>old days?</v>

1440
01:02:36.351 --> 01:02:37.590
<v Speaker 5>I remember one like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

1441
01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:42.591
<v Speaker 5>I remember how this one goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in order to keep writing new </v>

1442
01:02:42.591 --> 01:02:45.501
<v Speaker 5>material,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know I've had right now I had the </v>

1443
01:02:45.501 --> 01:02:48.651
<v Speaker 5>first one was I'm going to dead some day</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then there was the showtime special </v>

1444
01:02:48.651 --> 01:02:53.211
<v Speaker 5>that I did or not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then there was belly of the beast </v>

1445
01:02:53.211 --> 01:02:53.211
<v Speaker 5>and the showtime special in 2005 and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then shiny,</v>

1446
01:02:53.211 --> 01:02:55.560
<v Speaker 5>happy Jihad and then talking Mikey's in </v>
<v Speaker 5>space.</v>

1447
01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.990
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of different material.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember all that shit.</v>

1448
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:01.920
<v Speaker 5>Just pop in the DVD and watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch your show.</v>

1449
01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:07.060
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's gonna get it back in your head </v>
<v Speaker 5>for me to watch the stuff that I've just</v>

1450
01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:12.080
<v Speaker 5>done recently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really uncomfortable for me to </v>

1451
01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:12.720
<v Speaker 5>watch something like from like a few </v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago while you fucking a fleshlight</v>

1452
01:03:12.721 --> 01:03:13.410
<v Speaker 5>might help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1453
01:03:13.411 --> 01:03:15.570
<v Speaker 5>What are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1454
01:03:15.571 --> 01:03:16.680
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's like when you were playing that</v>

1455
01:03:16.681 --> 01:03:19.280
<v Speaker 5>song earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was sort of sitting there kind of sort</v>

1456
01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.350
<v Speaker 5>of curling up inside my shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1457
01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.360
<v Speaker 5>because it's like you're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 5>something from 20 years ago and you're </v>

1458
01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.570
<v Speaker 5>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't really do it exactly that </v>

1459
01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:28.570
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know which way I'm patrolling,</v>

1460
01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:28.780
<v Speaker 5>so look truck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you know,</v>

1461
01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:30.960
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of cheesy,</v>

1462
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:36.500
<v Speaker 5>but it's capturing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody said this to me once that you </v>

1463
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.840
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just have to think of all these </v>

1464
01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:38.840
<v Speaker 5>performances as capturing a moment in </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

1465
01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:38.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

1466
01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1467
01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.920
<v Speaker 5>That's all well and good and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>appreciate that,</v>

1468
01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:42.300
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still me,</v>

1469
01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:47.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really want to watch me from 15 </v>

1470
01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:47.440
<v Speaker 5>years ago do comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not fun.</v>

1471
01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't know like me for five years ago </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing it,</v>

1472
01:03:48.661 --> 01:03:50.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard watching yourself,</v>

1473
01:03:50.551 --> 01:03:50.950
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

1474
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:53.130
<v Speaker 5>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're very critical and honest,</v>

1475
01:03:53.131 --> 01:03:53.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hard.</v>

1476
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.400
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like in trying to figure out how much of</v>

1477
01:03:56.401 --> 01:04:01.401
<v Speaker 5>this should I be trying to enjoy this </v>
<v Speaker 5>but trying to enjoy it like a spectator </v>

1478
01:04:01.401 --> 01:04:02.970
<v Speaker 5>or should I be hypercritical of </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything I'm doing because that's what</v>

1479
01:04:02.971 --> 01:04:04.250
<v Speaker 5>I always wind up doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1480
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.610
<v Speaker 5>I'd prefer not watching myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have to go over material I think</v>

1481
01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.330
<v Speaker 5>to um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to uh,</v>

1482
01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.630
<v Speaker 5>like you listen to bits and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 5>you go out,</v>

1483
01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.370
<v Speaker 5>your brain will take you down different </v>
<v Speaker 5>paths.</v>

1484
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:14.940
<v Speaker 5>Like go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1485
01:04:14.941 --> 01:04:17.400
<v Speaker 5>why didn't I say this or why didn't I </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk about that?</v>

1486
01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:22.550
<v Speaker 5>Or you remember like certain taglines </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you may have adlibbed at the </v>

1487
01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:25.701
<v Speaker 5>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which may be gone if you don't remember </v>

1488
01:04:25.701 --> 01:04:25.701
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of my best taglines.</v>

1489
01:04:25.701 --> 01:04:29.061
<v Speaker 5>I forget them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just stopped doing it for some reason </v>

1490
01:04:29.061 --> 01:04:29.061
<v Speaker 5>and then I forget it and then some.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So someone will say to you like,</v>

1491
01:04:29.061 --> 01:04:29.730
<v Speaker 5>why don't you say that anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1492
01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:30.960
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forgot.</v>

1493
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:33.960
<v Speaker 5>I know you have it all written down </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere or most of it.</v>

1494
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:36.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of the material is written down.</v>

1495
01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:41.300
<v Speaker 5>It's all written by the way I start off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost all of my bits is I start them </v>

1496
01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:45.291
<v Speaker 5>off with like blog entries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether or not it gets posted on the </v>

1497
01:04:45.291 --> 01:04:45.480
<v Speaker 5>Internet at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Almost all of it is just me dissecting a</v>

1498
01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:50.481
<v Speaker 5>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the method that I've come to </v>

1499
01:04:50.481 --> 01:04:52.731
<v Speaker 5>over the last few years is the most.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To me it's the best method because it </v>

1500
01:04:52.731 --> 01:04:56.571
<v Speaker 5>allows me to really examine all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>different ways I think about a subject </v>

1501
01:04:56.571 --> 01:04:57.480
<v Speaker 5>without worrying about people's </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention spans.</v>

1502
01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.560
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just right.</v>

1503
01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:03.610
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it could be page after page after </v>

1504
01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:05.481
<v Speaker 5>page,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just ramblings on what I think about </v>

1505
01:05:05.481 --> 01:05:05.481
<v Speaker 5>anything and then I dissect what's funny</v>
<v Speaker 5>about it,</v>

1506
01:05:05.481 --> 01:05:06.570
<v Speaker 5>like this is funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is funny,</v>

1507
01:05:06.571 --> 01:05:07.470
<v Speaker 5>this is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I say,</v>

1508
01:05:07.471 --> 01:05:09.870
<v Speaker 5>well how much this would go into a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could this be a bit,</v>

1509
01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:10.950
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this could be a bat right here.</v>

1510
01:05:10.951 --> 01:05:12.360
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is how I'd have to say it.</v>

1511
01:05:12.361 --> 01:05:14.760
<v Speaker 5>And then I looked at it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm stealing from myself,</v>

1512
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:17.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm stealing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get back to the Internet,</v>

1513
01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:18.060
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>People</v>

1514
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:20.160
<v Speaker 3>if I post it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot</v>

1515
01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.660
<v Speaker 5>stuff that I read that I don't post,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff that I write,</v>

1516
01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:27.661
<v Speaker 5>I write it as if it was going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>blog entry and then just winds up going </v>

1517
01:05:27.661 --> 01:05:30.511
<v Speaker 5>into file because I don't like where I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was going with it or it wasn't finished </v>

1518
01:05:30.511 --> 01:05:34.171
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I do like this part and that part </v>

1519
01:05:34.171 --> 01:05:34.171
<v Speaker 5>will become a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you like,</v>

1520
01:05:34.171 --> 01:05:38.101
<v Speaker 5>do you think of your ideas when you sit </v>
<v Speaker 5>down to write or is it when you're out </v>

1521
01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:38.290
<v Speaker 5>in a boat with friends hanging out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then you bolt?</v>

1522
01:05:38.330 --> 01:05:39.870
<v Speaker 5>It's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you know,</v>

1523
01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:44.880
<v Speaker 5>you get different kinds of creativity </v>
<v Speaker 5>just from driving in your car with the </v>

1524
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:44.880
<v Speaker 5>music off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1525
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.790
<v Speaker 5>if you have your stereo off and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>just drive your car and don't talk to </v>

1526
01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:48.790
<v Speaker 5>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just doing that,</v>

1527
01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:49.570
<v Speaker 5>doing like every average everyday </v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

1528
01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:54.960
<v Speaker 5>a percentage of your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you're going to focus on what </v>

1529
01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:54.970
<v Speaker 5>you're doing and focus on our activity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're going to get bored.</v>

1530
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.890
<v Speaker 5>Your brain is going to get bored with </v>
<v Speaker 5>just driving,</v>

1531
01:05:56.891 --> 01:05:58.480
<v Speaker 5>so your brain is gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Start thinking about things,</v>

1532
01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:03.660
<v Speaker 5>so percentage of your brain will start </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming up with ideas and you start </v>

1533
01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.080
<v Speaker 5>pondering things and questioning </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationships,</v>

1534
01:06:05.081 --> 01:06:06.910
<v Speaker 5>and you start breaking down your life </v>
<v Speaker 5>while you're driving.</v>

1535
01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:08.920
<v Speaker 5>No Stereo on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now when you got the music on,</v>

1536
01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:12.370
<v Speaker 5>you listen to that and then you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're often no thinking land,</v>

1537
01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:13.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the one.</v>

1538
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:18.630
<v Speaker 5>One of the most dangerous things about </v>
<v Speaker 5>the media is the fact that it's so </v>

1539
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:20.830
<v Speaker 5>pervasive and it's so easy to get to and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so easy to just sit there and watch</v>

1540
01:06:20.831 --> 01:06:22.780
<v Speaker 5>and just get sucked into it and never </v>
<v Speaker 5>think at all.</v>

1541
01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:27.940
<v Speaker 3>I know I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been addicted to the 24 hour news </v>

1542
01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.270
<v Speaker 3>cycle in this last few years and it just</v>
<v Speaker 3>drives me nuts.</v>

1543
01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Is the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you watch?</v>

01:06:31.941 --> 01:06:33.590
<v Speaker 3>So it's like I'm at the computer but </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's on,</v>

1546
01:06:33.591 --> 01:06:35.450
<v Speaker 3>in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you sleep to news?</v>

1547
01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Sounds a little.</v>

<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always do the 40 minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you watch?</v>

<v Speaker 3>TV shuts itself off.</v>

1561
01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:08.640
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have watched TV before I go to </v>

<v Speaker 5>I have a very open mind and even if I </v>

1589
01:08:11.830 --> 01:08:11.830
<v Speaker 5>think someone,</v>

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:37.300
<v Speaker 5>I do notice that there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a scientific theory about </v>

1642
01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:41.741
<v Speaker 5>the amount of people that we can store </v>
<v Speaker 5>in our brain and I absolutely believe </v>

1643
01:10:41.741 --> 01:10:44.801
<v Speaker 5>that they say it's 150 people have room </v>
<v Speaker 5>for 150 faces and names they recognize.</v>

1644
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:50.770
<v Speaker 5>I have recognized someone that I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>know was still in my database where you </v>

1645
01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:53.150
<v Speaker 5>have to re assimilate the memory and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

1646
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:57.530
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1647
01:10:57.531 --> 01:10:59.630

1675
01:11:56.100 --> 01:12:01.100
<v Speaker 5>It seems like a data processing issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like we're not supposed to have </v>

<v Speaker 5>numbers,</v>

1683
01:12:16.741 --> 01:12:19.200
<v Speaker 5>if they could figure out how to update </v>
<v Speaker 5>the database of your mind,</v>

1684
01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:22.650
<v Speaker 5>it might have just download stuff into </v>

<v Speaker 5>They're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're gonna get there as long as they </v>

1688
01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:32.120
<v Speaker 5>keep tampering and they always will.</v>

<v Speaker 5>coolest,</v>

1691
01:12:34.261 --> 01:12:35.910
<v Speaker 5>best shit and they're going to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're gonna.</v>

1692
01:12:35.911 --> 01:12:40.911
<v Speaker 5>Learn from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as we don't blow ourselves off </v>

1693
01:12:40.911 --> 01:12:42.741
<v Speaker 5>the face of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got some petty shit coming from </v>

1694
01:12:42.741 --> 01:12:42.741
<v Speaker 5>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1697
01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.690
<v Speaker 5>they're developing skin that can feel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's artificial.</v>

1698
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:46.750
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1699
01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:50.650
<v Speaker 5>Artificial skin that you can feel with </v>
<v Speaker 5>their have artificial limb.</v>

1700
01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:51.830
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you gonna be able to look.</v>

1701
01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.840
<v Speaker 5>You attach it to your finger and you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>make your finger like 40 feet long and </v>

1702
01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.960
<v Speaker 5>you can touch stuff eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ultimately they want you to be able to </v>

1703
01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.021
<v Speaker 5>be sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you can pick up a piece of paper </v>

1704
01:13:03.021 --> 01:13:03.021
<v Speaker 5>with it or you could hold a thick mug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

1705
01:13:03.021 --> 01:13:07.131
<v Speaker 5>Be able to touch and feel things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get electrical impulses </v>

1706
01:13:07.321 --> 01:13:12.321
<v Speaker 5>from this artificial hands so they can </v>
<v Speaker 5>just go into your nerve endings and </v>

1707
01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:14.530
<v Speaker 5>they're gonna figure out how to make it </v>
<v Speaker 5>so your brain thinks this is a hand,</v>

1708
01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:17.050
<v Speaker 5>so they figured out the conversion of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their work to like.</v>

1709
01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:19.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how long it is or how close</v>

1710
01:13:19.921 --> 01:13:24.921
<v Speaker 5>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know that this is an ultimate </v>

1711
01:13:24.921 --> 01:13:26.901
<v Speaker 5>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to figure out a what </v>

1712
01:13:26.901 --> 01:13:26.901
<v Speaker 5>would be some uses for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know about fake humans,</v>

1713
01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:29.790
<v Speaker 5>how they gonna make fake people do </v>
<v Speaker 5>depending flashlight.</v>

1714
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:33.000
<v Speaker 5>That's the real thing that are flushed </v>
<v Speaker 5>with thing is artificial life.</v>

1715
01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.950
<v Speaker 5>That's the real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's really,</v>

1716
01:13:34.951 --> 01:13:38.300
<v Speaker 5>really possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really possible we don't know what,</v>

1717
01:13:38.301 --> 01:13:39.570
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what life really is.</v>

1718
01:13:39.571 --> 01:13:41.370
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>technology might be life,</v>

1719
01:13:41.371 --> 01:13:46.371
<v Speaker 5>it might be life in some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>embryotic form and it has to break out </v>

1720
01:13:46.371 --> 01:13:47.430
<v Speaker 5>of this like a caterpillar that becomes </v>
<v Speaker 5>a butterfly.</v>

1721
01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:50.640
<v Speaker 5>This might with we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're seeing what technology that people</v>

1722
01:13:50.641 --> 01:13:54.030
<v Speaker 5>created today in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We might be seeing just the,</v>

1723
01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:59.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just this egg shell that's about to </v>

1724
01:13:59.140 --> 01:13:59.140
<v Speaker 5>break and this new thing is going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>hatch out of it.</v>

1725
01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.440
<v Speaker 5>I A guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could use a,</v>

1726
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:02.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

1727
01:14:02.710 --> 01:14:06.120
<v Speaker 5>a robot around the house that had </v>
<v Speaker 5>sensitive skin,</v>

1728
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:10.470
<v Speaker 5>smooth mouth pretty lit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that would be so strange.</v>

1729
01:14:10.471 --> 01:14:12.160
<v Speaker 5>We just had this really</v>

1730
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:17.160
<v Speaker 1>super hot robot that you could fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you wanted and you didn't have </v>

1731
01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:17.160
<v Speaker 1>to feed her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could shut her off,</v>

1732
01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.150
<v Speaker 1>you can do whatever you wanted when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned around and was like,</v>

1733
01:14:19.210 --> 01:14:20.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fucking up.</v>

1734
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Clearly this is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly these scientists are,</v>

1735
01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.080
<v Speaker 1>are putting their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>tolerate their wife's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you can fuck this super hot robot </v>

1741
01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.820
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't be a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if she's absolutely artificial?</v>

1742
01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Even her,</v>

1744
01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:49.510
<v Speaker 1>artificial person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1745
01:14:49.810 --> 01:14:52.780
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't age.</v>

01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:10.000
<v Speaker 1>If you could actually have these totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>controllable artificial people where you</v>

1754
01:15:10.001 --> 01:15:13.660
<v Speaker 1>could program in their personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them super accepting and docile and</v>

<v Speaker 3>You definitely would have to be in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sealed rapper.</v>

1822
01:17:48.891 --> 01:17:49.840
<v Speaker 3>Let's put it as a common.</v>

1823
01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:52.880
<v Speaker 3>A seals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hermetically sealed plastic.</v>

1824
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Insurance.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This has been unsealed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a signature thing?</v>

1828
01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.790
<v Speaker 3>I think Ricky Schroder even touched that</v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

1829
01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Did Ricky Schroder test?</v>

1830
01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:11.300
<v Speaker 3>And so does it do anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it vibrate or anything?</v>

<v Speaker 3>they didn't have that obviously,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think I've watched too much of it in </v>

1869
01:19:52.930 --> 01:19:53.660
<v Speaker 3>my life and I'm not interested in not </v>
<v Speaker 3>much anymore,</v>

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:59.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be honest with you when you're </v>

1871
01:19:59.040 --> 01:19:59.040
<v Speaker 3>campaigning for a nice curl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I start,</v>

1872
01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.310
<v Speaker 3>when I started seeing it online and </v>
<v Speaker 3>video,</v>

1873
01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:06.370
<v Speaker 3>to be honest with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched it a lot because I was </v>

1874
01:20:06.370 --> 01:20:06.370
<v Speaker 3>interesting in the web streaming </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>

1875
01:20:06.370 --> 01:20:10.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would go on some of the sites just </v>

1876
01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:10.920
<v Speaker 3>to kind</v>

1877
01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:10.920
<v Speaker 1>of cuts it just for purely </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological.</v>

1878
01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.420
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of like a business or </v>
<v Speaker 1>research kind of thing.</v>

1879
01:20:12.421 --> 01:20:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm doing my web show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that the streaming quality</v>

1880
01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:20.811
<v Speaker 1>was good and things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can get the most data from the </v>

<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1930
01:22:20.210 --> 01:22:21.650
<v Speaker 1>we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was watching.</v>

1931
01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:24.040
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shot was on the reactions.</v>

1932
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.160
<v Speaker 1>What was that called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that called when?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Video video.</v>

1934
01:22:30.090 --> 01:22:31.160
<v Speaker 1>That was one of those.</v>

1935
01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:36.400
<v Speaker 1>It was good one for reaction videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody knew by the sound of </v>

1936
01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:36.510
<v Speaker 1>the music what was going on if you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>already seen it.</v>

1937
01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:41.540
<v Speaker 1>That was a very odd sort of blip on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pop culture radar the day that that came</v>

1938
01:22:41.641 --> 01:22:42.080
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1939
01:22:42.081 --> 01:22:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was this site dedicated to one</v>

1940
01:22:44.821 --> 01:22:48.170
<v Speaker 1>video and everybody went and watched a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days,</v>

1941
01:22:48.171 --> 01:22:51.720
<v Speaker 1>got millions and millions and millions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of views.</v>

1942
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I joke about it and I bring it up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage sometimes and it's incredible how </v>

1943
01:22:57.110 --> 01:23:01.431
<v Speaker 1>many people have seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think what's interesting about it </v>

1944
01:23:01.431 --> 01:23:03.921
<v Speaker 1>is it repulsed people so instantly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't really catch on like it did.</v>

1983
01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:23.560
<v Speaker 3>contract,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really strange</v>

1984
01:24:23.650 --> 01:24:26.200
<v Speaker 5>thing that a lot of the people in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>porn business do.</v>

1985
01:24:26.201 --> 01:24:29.440
<v Speaker 5>They figure out a way to have boyfriends</v>
<v Speaker 5>and girlfriends and be in relationships,</v>

1986
01:24:29.441 --> 01:24:31.540
<v Speaker 5>but they still fuck the fuck other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people when they work,</v>

1987
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:33.040
<v Speaker 5>but they're only allowed to do it when </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're working.</v>

1988
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must,</v>

1989
01:24:34.730 --> 01:24:37.990
<v Speaker 3>it must because we're also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:38.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1991
01:24:38.821 --> 01:24:43.821
<v Speaker 3>accustomed to seeing it now that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably out there actually can justify </v>

1992
01:24:43.821 --> 01:24:44.210
<v Speaker 3>it in their mind because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1993
01:24:44.211 --> 01:24:49.211
<v Speaker 3>this is a legitimate profession here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one is the Tom Green sex tape </v>

1997
01:24:59.870 --> 01:25:04.870

1998
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:06.290
<v Speaker 3>ever ever see myself doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there one that exists though that you</v>

<v Speaker 3>I should just throw that tape right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you got get arrested.</v>

2051
01:26:59.331 --> 01:27:02.140
<v Speaker 3>Probably if you could be public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be illegal master patient.</v>

2052
01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:07.150
<v Speaker 3>It could be considered a child </v>
<v Speaker 3>pornography to catch kids for 16 years </v>

2053
01:27:07.641 --> 01:27:12.641
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you be charged for being in </v>

2054
01:27:12.641 --> 01:27:15.281
<v Speaker 3>possession of child pornography?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that kids are getting their cell </v>

2055
01:27:15.281 --> 01:27:16.820
<v Speaker 3>phones taken away and they find photos </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>

2056
01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:20.330
<v Speaker 3>Girls are getting charged with child </v>
<v Speaker 3>pornography because they have a photo of</v>

2057
01:27:20.331 --> 01:27:23.120
<v Speaker 3>themselves for themselves that they sent</v>
<v Speaker 3>to him.</v>

2058
01:27:23.121 --> 01:27:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're charged with child pornography.</v>

2059
01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:27.050

<v Speaker 3>tape.</v>

2060

<v Speaker 3>behind the story because there was,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well fill me full detail.</v>

2095
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:50.510
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily live and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

2096
01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.740
<v Speaker 3>so it's not on anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows the song.</v>

2097
01:28:52.741 --> 01:28:54.030
<v Speaker 3>What was the song and what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2098
01:28:54.031 --> 01:28:57.870
<v Speaker 3>So we went to Seattle and we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>filming bits and Seattle and we thought,</v>

2099
01:28:57.871 --> 01:29:02.871
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this would be funny to do the song </v>

2100
01:29:02.871 --> 01:29:02.871
<v Speaker 3>called the bum bumps on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My favorite songs,</v>

2101
01:29:02.871 --> 01:29:02.871
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous idea.</v>

2102
01:29:02.871 --> 01:29:04.010
<v Speaker 4>And I would go and it was just a silly </v>
<v Speaker 4>video.</v>

2103
01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:06.660
<v Speaker 4>Me going around Seattle saying Obama's </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the cheese,</v>

2104
01:29:06.661 --> 01:29:09.170
<v Speaker 4>my bum's on the rail albums in the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My bumps on the duck.</v>

2105
01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:13.260
<v Speaker 4>It was a silly sort of like a doctor zoo</v>
<v Speaker 4>style nursery rhyme,</v>

2106
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:14.840
<v Speaker 4>rap and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

2107
01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:18.730
<v Speaker 4>and the comedy of it was me out in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>street sticking my ass on everything and</v>

2108
01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:20.730
<v Speaker 4>confusing people and filming the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reactions.</v>

2109
01:29:20.731 --> 01:29:22.410
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And singing this silly song.</v>

2110
01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:26.340
<v Speaker 4>And then we played it on my show and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>said we want this to go to number one on</v>

2111
01:29:26.341 --> 01:29:27.720
<v Speaker 4>total request live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

2112
01:29:27.721 --> 01:29:32.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their countdown music show that they </v>

2113
01:29:32.721 --> 01:29:32.721
<v Speaker 4>would have every night hosted by Carson </v>
<v Speaker 4>Daly.</v>

2114
01:29:32.721 --> 01:29:37.400
<v Speaker 4>And I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we played it on Seattle radio and it </v>

2115
01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.220
<v Speaker 4>went to number one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instantly.</v>

2116
01:29:38.221 --> 01:29:40.030
<v Speaker 4>This was when my show was on MTV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2117
01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:43.470
<v Speaker 4>it was really doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Show on MTV show was doing well on MTV.</v>

2118
01:29:43.471 --> 01:29:48.471
<v Speaker 4>People went to number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people saw the absurdity of this song </v>

2119
01:29:48.471 --> 01:29:52.500
<v Speaker 4>knocking 98 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brittany Spears in sync and whoever else</v>

2120
01:29:52.501 --> 01:29:55.110

2121
01:29:55.170 --> 01:29:57.270

<v Speaker 4>And so we went.</v>

2122
01:29:57.271 --> 01:29:59.340
<v Speaker 4>We played it on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we asked people to vote for it,</v>

2123
01:29:59.490 --> 01:30:02.730
<v Speaker 4>people voted for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It went to number one on Tuesday.</v>

2124

<v Speaker 3>I went in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a nice plaque and you know what?</v>

2176
01:32:04.601 --> 01:32:06.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Well,</v>

2177
01:32:06.791 --> 01:32:07.950
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2178
01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:09.130
<v Speaker 3>I think of it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2179
01:32:09.131 --> 01:32:14.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could have rode that thing a little </v>

2180
01:32:14.131 --> 01:32:14.131
<v Speaker 3>further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could have put out a record.</v>

2181
01:32:14.131 --> 01:32:15.070
<v Speaker 3>I probably could have know had some fun </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>

2182
01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:16.570
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2183
01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:17.860
<v Speaker 3>that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happened.</v>

2184
01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:19.540
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting man.</v>

2185
01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:22.490
<v Speaker 3>That's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fucked by the corporations.</v>

2186
01:32:22.491 --> 01:32:23.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2187
01:32:23.201 --> 01:32:28.201
<v Speaker 3>It was a sense that they would probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>cost them a fuck load of money in </v>

2188
01:32:28.201 --> 01:32:31.000
<v Speaker 3>theater already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pre-Taped reshoot five shows and it's </v>

2189
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:31.000
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how crazy is that?</v>

2190
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:31.810
<v Speaker 3>Now you find out what the rankings are </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

2191
01:32:31.811 --> 01:32:33.580
<v Speaker 3>It's totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they prop them up.</v>

2192
01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:35.350
<v Speaker 3>It probably had deals with the record </v>
<v Speaker 3>company,</v>

2193
01:32:35.351 --> 01:32:38.800
<v Speaker 3>like we need to push 98 degrees and </v>
<v Speaker 3>here's $100,000</v>

2194
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:41.770
<v Speaker 3>we need to probably it's illegal.</v>

2195
01:32:41.770 --> 01:32:44.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's definitely did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did that.</v>

2196
01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.510
<v Speaker 3>I never heard any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just making shit up.</v>

2197
01:32:46.530 --> 01:32:46.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2198
01:32:47.170 --> 01:32:50.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm just throwing shit on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never did anything like that.</v>

2199
01:32:50.531 --> 01:32:53.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it was just basically it was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very strange week and uh,</v>

2200
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.450
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2201
01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:55.180
<v Speaker 3>they sort of said it wasn't for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

2202
01:32:55.181 --> 01:32:57.820
<v Speaker 3>That song could have stayed on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>countdown and because I can't.</v>

2203
01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Basically that week was a Republican </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republic of the week before and what are</v>

2204
01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:06.070
<v Speaker 3>you doing Brian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To be screaming.</v>

2205
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:12.350
<v Speaker 3>They ended the song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that video going out to and that's </v>

2206
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.350
<v Speaker 3>an Ipad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty awesome,</v>

2207
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:13.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually just streaming on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ipad but it's not going out.</v>

2208
01:33:14.170 --> 01:33:19.170
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People can hear the audio audio but you </v>

2209
01:33:19.170 --> 01:33:19.170
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I've told that story before.</v>

2211
01:33:19.481 --> 01:33:21.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anyone at MTV cares </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

2212
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.450
<v Speaker 3>It's on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>

2214
01:33:24.370 --> 01:33:26.470

<v Speaker 3>You could have got paid.</v>

2248
01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.040
<v Speaker 3>Do you still write music?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to think about doing another</v>

2249
01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 3>hits?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have</v>

2250
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:01.920
<v Speaker 4>a friend of mine who is a really cool </v>
<v Speaker 4>producer here in town who uh,</v>

2251
01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:02.680
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2252
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:07.870
<v Speaker 4>I make music with sometimes the names </v>
<v Speaker 4>detail and he does a lot of cool music </v>

2253
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:09.440
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just do it for fun.</v>

2254
01:35:09.441 --> 01:35:14.441
<v Speaker 4>I have a home studio for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to the pro tools and the MAC </v>

2255
01:35:14.441 --> 01:35:15.320
<v Speaker 4>computer and he's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2256
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:17.720
<v Speaker 4>So you got your fingers in all aspects </v>
<v Speaker 4>of show business.</v>

2257
01:35:17.721 --> 01:35:19.370
<v Speaker 4>You're always doing something more like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a hobby,</v>

2258
01:35:19.371 --> 01:35:20.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's more just a fun thing,</v>

2259
01:35:20.601 --> 01:35:21.620
<v Speaker 4>but it's a fun thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2260
01:35:21.621 --> 01:35:23.960
<v Speaker 4>the songs I make are so ridiculous that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're never,</v>

2261
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:27.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'm really there ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be sort of any mainstream.</v>

2262
01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:32.660
<v Speaker 5>So I think the standup thing is an </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting subject because you didn't </v>

2263
01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:34.140
<v Speaker 5>do standup for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did stand up when you were like 15,</v>

2264
01:35:34.141 --> 01:35:37.470
<v Speaker 5>16 and then you stopped for like God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2265
01:35:37.471 --> 01:35:38.220
<v Speaker 5>Twenty years?</v>

2266
01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:43.280
<v Speaker 4>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would do it sort of occasionally but </v>

2267
01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:43.280
<v Speaker 4>never sort of as I had an act that I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>working on.</v>

2268
01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.500
<v Speaker 4>Launched it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What made you decide to want to get back</v>

2269
01:35:45.501 --> 01:35:46.400
<v Speaker 4>into it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2270
01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:47.690
<v Speaker 4>you know about a,</v>

2271
01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:50.370
<v Speaker 5>a boot boot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2272
01:35:50.371 --> 01:35:55.371
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That still has the one that's the one </v>

2273
01:35:55.371 --> 01:35:55.371
<v Speaker 5>word that I get nailed on gifts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sear goes sincere.</v>

2274
01:35:55.371 --> 01:35:57.540
<v Speaker 5>You go deep detail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Canadian beer,</v>

2275
01:35:57.630 --> 01:35:58.540
<v Speaker 5>a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2276
01:35:58.710 --> 01:36:00.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do when I can do what I can,</v>

2277
01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:05.160
<v Speaker 5>I just sort of drink a drink when I can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so what happened?</v>

2278
01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:05.940
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2279
01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well about two years ago,</v>

2280
01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:13.620
<v Speaker 4>Rob Schneider came on my show as a guest</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the web show and uh,</v>

2281
01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:18.800
<v Speaker 4>his brother John also came up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>started hanging out with those guys and </v>

2282
01:36:18.811 --> 01:36:20.670
<v Speaker 4>it was maybe about a year and a half </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>

2283
01:36:20.671 --> 01:36:23.310
<v Speaker 4>John said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he know rob's doing stand up now too.</v>

2284
01:36:23.311 --> 01:36:25.500
<v Speaker 4>He's been touring all year and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rob's gonna start doing stand up.</v>

2285
01:36:25.501 --> 01:36:26.790
<v Speaker 4>You should start doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>

2286
01:36:26.791 --> 01:36:28.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this would be pretty cool way.</v>

2287
01:36:28.650 --> 01:36:33.650
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's something that I've been thinking </v>

2288
01:36:33.650 --> 01:36:33.650
<v Speaker 4>about since I was a kid and I was very </v>
<v Speaker 4>intimidated by it.</v>

2289
01:36:33.650 --> 01:36:35.820
<v Speaker 4>I was afraid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was in the back of my head.</v>

2290
01:36:35.821 --> 01:36:36.630
<v Speaker 4>I was kind of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2291
01:36:37.210 --> 01:36:38.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2292
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.940
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2293
01:36:39.190 --> 01:36:44.190
<v Speaker 4>I was so used to doing the show and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember how hard it was when I was a </v>

2294
01:36:44.190 --> 01:36:44.190
<v Speaker 4>teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2295
01:36:44.190 --> 01:36:48.921
<v Speaker 4>when you're 15 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>standing up in front of a bunch of </v>

2296
01:36:48.921 --> 01:36:48.921
<v Speaker 4>college kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2297
01:36:48.921 --> 01:36:48.921
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

2298
01:36:48.921 --> 01:36:48.921
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was tough.</v>

2299
01:36:48.921 --> 01:36:50.910
<v Speaker 4>Things were stressful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I've done it over the years,</v>

2300
01:36:50.911 --> 01:36:53.610
<v Speaker 4>hosting shows and things like this in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of the audience,</v>

2301
01:36:53.611 --> 01:36:56.070
<v Speaker 4>but not having the act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rob was doing it.</v>

2302
01:36:56.370 --> 01:36:59.910
<v Speaker 4>He was going around jumping up at clubs </v>
<v Speaker 4>around town,</v>

2303
01:36:59.911 --> 01:37:04.230
<v Speaker 4>at the Ice House in Pasadena and to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>belly room at the comedy store.</v>

2304
01:37:04.231 --> 01:37:05.150
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2306
01:37:10.151 --> 01:37:10.720
<v Speaker 4>out stuff and it sort of instantly was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2307
01:37:10.830 --> 01:37:14.570
<v Speaker 4>instantly was something that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately was kind of.</v>

2308
01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:16.690
<v Speaker 4>I thought Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2309
01:37:16.710 --> 01:37:19.740
<v Speaker 4>why did I not start doing this sooner?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just such a great thing.</v>

2310
01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:24.880
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of it also is I've been living in </v>

2322
01:37:44.791 --> 01:37:46.420
<v Speaker 4>So it's just been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been an amazing time.</v>

01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:57.870

<v Speaker 3>first time,</v>

2331
01:37:57.990 --> 01:38:01.020
<v Speaker 3>but you're doing like an hour onstage </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it went down.</v>

2332
01:38:01.021 --> 01:38:04.640

<v Speaker 3>I'm headlining on the road performing on</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage for an hour.</v>

2334
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:12.830
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you used to have to actually go </v>

2335
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.830
<v Speaker 3>about an hour and 15 when you used to do</v>

2348
01:38:36.531 --> 01:38:36.531
<v Speaker 3>before you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2349
01:38:36.531 --> 01:38:36.531
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take this to the road now.</v>

2350
01:38:36.531 --> 01:38:40.580
<v Speaker 3>Basically what happened was I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>jumping up all around town and the Norm </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to book you on a tour.</v>

2358

<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she now.</v>

2360
01:38:59.071 --> 01:39:00.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many months is this into your stent?</v>

2361
01:39:00.650 --> 01:39:04.590
<v Speaker 3>I've been nine months on the road and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she's been between the time you got back</v>

2362
01:39:04.591 --> 01:39:06.720
<v Speaker 3>on stage at the time you started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long was that?</v>

2363
01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:11.810
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was probably about six months or </v>

2364
01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:11.810
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

2365
01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:14.700
<v Speaker 3>So you very much with the intention of I</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to go on the road.</v>

2366
01:39:14.701 --> 01:39:19.701
<v Speaker 3>And it's very impressive that you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to put together over an hour of </v>

2367
01:39:19.701 --> 01:39:20.040
<v Speaker 3>material in six months.</v>

2368
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:21.570
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

2369
01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was doing the same jokes </v>

2370
01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:28.251
<v Speaker 3>again last night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're developing new shit out of </v>

2371
01:39:28.251 --> 01:39:31.731
<v Speaker 3>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my friend Mike Young did some shit </v>

2372
01:39:31.731 --> 01:39:31.731
<v Speaker 3>that he did nine years ago last night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2373
01:39:31.731 --> 01:39:35.550
<v Speaker 3>I approached it from a really kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I approach doing my television </v>

2374
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:35.550
<v Speaker 3>show or my web show very from very like </v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

2375
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:40.530
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be writing all the time and </v>

2376
01:39:40.530 --> 01:39:40.770
<v Speaker 3>trying to build up the diligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jumping up to and stuff.</v>

2377
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:43.900
<v Speaker 3>I organized it all out in paper and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>

2378
01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:44.750
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2379
01:39:44.751 --> 01:39:46.080
<v Speaker 3>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2380
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:48.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the first,</v>

2381
01:39:48.451 --> 01:39:53.451
<v Speaker 3>for the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the first few months of doing our </v>

2382
01:39:53.451 --> 01:39:53.451
<v Speaker 3>set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>

2383
01:39:53.451 --> 01:39:55.890
<v Speaker 3>I had a set list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually took on stage with me and I'd</v>

2384
01:39:55.891 --> 01:39:57.640
<v Speaker 3>set it on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the stool,</v>

2385
01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:58.650
<v Speaker 3>so my water on it.</v>

2386
01:39:59.070 --> 01:40:00.990
<v Speaker 3>I do my bits and then I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I've got lost,</v>

2387
01:40:00.991 --> 01:40:02.420
<v Speaker 3>I'd look down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good move.</v>

2388
01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:04.650
<v Speaker 3>You know Doug Benson brings a notes on </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage and goes,</v>

2389
01:40:04.651 --> 01:40:09.651
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want me to be stumbled around </v>

2390
01:40:09.651 --> 01:40:09.651
<v Speaker 3>wondering what the fuck I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2391
01:40:09.651 --> 01:40:10.020
<v Speaker 3>This is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But eventually after,</v>

2392
01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:15.750
<v Speaker 3>after awhile though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was feeling like it was kind of a bit </v>

2393
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.930
<v Speaker 3>of a crutch because I like to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to be really physical.</v>

2394
01:40:15.931 --> 01:40:18.060
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the thing.</v>

2395
01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:18.730
<v Speaker 3>The thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2396
01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:21.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't use no notes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing about notes,</v>

2397
01:40:21.170 --> 01:40:22.880
<v Speaker 3>the good thing is that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2398
01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:23.940
<v Speaker 3>if you need them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

2399
01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:25.620
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like why not have it there?</v>

2400
01:40:25.690 --> 01:40:26.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2401
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:28.800
<v Speaker 3>there's sometimes you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear.</v>

2402
01:40:28.801 --> 01:40:31.140
<v Speaker 3>Like Joey Diaz will say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck was I talking about?</v>

2403
01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:32.510
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck was I talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2404
01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:33.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

2405
01:40:33.931 --> 01:40:38.931
<v Speaker 3>And you tell him and then he's got the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story and it would just run and ramble </v>

2406
01:40:38.931 --> 01:40:38.931
<v Speaker 3>on to the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you just need a little note.</v>

2407
01:40:38.931 --> 01:40:43.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I might start putting new stuff </v>

2408
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:47.090
<v Speaker 3>that I've never done before on notes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling that out at some point or </v>

2409
01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:47.670
<v Speaker 3>setting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something I can remember.</v>

2410
01:40:47.671 --> 01:40:50.220
<v Speaker 3>All this stuff I've done for once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done it three or four times,</v>

2411
01:40:50.221 --> 01:40:52.100
<v Speaker 3>I can remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but usually I can't remember it.</v>

2412
01:40:52.110 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 3>There's something about writing things </v>
<v Speaker 3>down on paper that's really</v>

2413
01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:59.220
<v Speaker 5>good for your memory to actually the act</v>
<v Speaker 5>of creating a note makes it solidify in </v>

2414
01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:02.710
<v Speaker 5>your mind and when you use your memory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can recall like what you wrote,</v>

2415
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:07.750
<v Speaker 5>like you could see it in the order.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just have a set list of just your </v>

2416
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.750
<v Speaker 5>basic cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The iphone thing.</v>

2417
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:09.070
<v Speaker 5>Setlist is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's definitely better than nothing,</v>

2418
01:41:09.071 --> 01:41:12.730
<v Speaker 5>but I think writing something down on </v>
<v Speaker 5>paper seems to have the most effect.</v>

2419
01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.880
<v Speaker 5>It seems to be sticks better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2420
01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:17.230
<v Speaker 5>So do you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you wrote out your act,</v>

2421
01:41:17.290 --> 01:41:20.350
<v Speaker 5>did you write out a ver,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a beginning,</v>

2422
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:25.470
<v Speaker 5>a middle and an end?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you put it all together verbatim or </v>

2423
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.540
<v Speaker 5>do you ad Lib when you're on stage?</v>

2424
01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:26.240
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2425
01:41:26.250 --> 01:41:30.080
<v Speaker 4>Initially I sort of a yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ad Lib a lot on stage,</v>

2426
01:41:30.110 --> 01:41:35.110
<v Speaker 4>but I have this sort of pretty solid </v>
<v Speaker 4>began like I know where I'm nowhere I'm </v>

2427
01:41:35.110 --> 01:41:35.150
<v Speaker 4>going to start.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I'm going to do when I start,</v>

2428
01:41:35.151 --> 01:41:40.151
<v Speaker 4>I know when I'm going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I'm finished actually pretty much </v>

2429
01:41:40.151 --> 01:41:42.521
<v Speaker 4>know the order I'm going to go in </v>
<v Speaker 4>through the bits that I've tried and </v>

2430
01:41:42.521 --> 01:41:45.290
<v Speaker 4>tested and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then often I'll kind of go off into </v>

2431
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:49.241
<v Speaker 4>the audience between bits for a second </v>
<v Speaker 4>and talk to some people for a second.</v>

2432
01:41:49.371 --> 01:41:50.540
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2433
01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:53.270
<v Speaker 4>but what's happened is it sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolved over the year,</v>

2434
01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:57.260
<v Speaker 4>like last nine months of doing it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>every week I'll kind of go,</v>

2435
01:41:57.261 --> 01:42:00.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe this is a little too depressing,</v>

2436
01:42:00.891 --> 01:42:03.680
<v Speaker 4>have a subject matter to talk off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>top.</v>

2437
01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:06.410
<v Speaker 4>So then I'll move it sort of later in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the act.</v>

2438
01:42:06.410 --> 01:42:09.290
<v Speaker 4>And then it's kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been fun.</v>

2439
01:42:09.291 --> 01:42:11.000
<v Speaker 4>It's been really fun and challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2440
01:42:11.001 --> 01:42:14.930
<v Speaker 4>doing it and a sort of shuffling things </v>
<v Speaker 4>around all the time.</v>

2441
01:42:14.931 --> 01:42:19.931
<v Speaker 4>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been cool and I write bits down in </v>

2442
01:42:19.931 --> 01:42:19.931
<v Speaker 4>my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my notepad,</v>

2443
01:42:19.931 --> 01:42:24.460
<v Speaker 4>in my phone if I think something weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I'll go home and I'll type it </v>

2444
01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:25.790
<v Speaker 4>up in the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so do you type it up as a joke or do</v>

2445
01:42:25.791 --> 01:42:27.650
<v Speaker 4>you type up bullet points,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what do you do?</v>

2446
01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:33.220
<v Speaker 4>I usually write it out word for word </v>
<v Speaker 4>with punchlines and exactly how I'm </v>

2447
01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:37.181
<v Speaker 4>going to say it and then I edit it and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>get it exactly what I want to be and </v>

2448
01:42:37.181 --> 01:42:40.991
<v Speaker 4>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I try to sort of remember it </v>

2449
01:42:40.991 --> 01:42:41.540
<v Speaker 4>and then usually the first time I say it</v>
<v Speaker 4>on stage,</v>

2450
01:42:42.110 --> 01:42:45.690
<v Speaker 4>I forget about half of the taglines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forget about half of them and then I,</v>

2451
01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:48.710
<v Speaker 4>but I say it but then I get off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage and I immediately remember,</v>

2452
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:50.600
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot that,</v>

2453
01:42:50.601 --> 01:42:50.990
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2454
01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:56.080
<v Speaker 4>And I think the disappointment of </v>
<v Speaker 4>forgetting them makes it easier to </v>

2455
01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:56.080
<v Speaker 4>remember the next time because then I go</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at them again.</v>

2456
01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.980
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got to remember this tag line,</v>

2457
01:42:57.981 --> 01:42:59.360
<v Speaker 4>this line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it's sort of,</v>

2458
01:42:59.390 --> 01:43:01.250
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is interesting because you really,</v>

2459
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:02.890
<v Speaker 4>it really is kind of cool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2460
01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:06.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean again this first year of doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>this full time night after night,</v>

2461
01:43:06.021 --> 01:43:08.450
<v Speaker 4>but to see what people tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2462
01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:09.890
<v Speaker 4>you got to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a muscle,</v>

2463
01:43:09.891 --> 01:43:12.850
<v Speaker 4>you get up on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start to pertain it differently and,</v>

2464
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:14.150
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2465
01:43:14.151 --> 01:43:19.151
<v Speaker 4>there's been obviously periods for two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three weeks where I haven't done a show </v>

2466
01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:19.151
<v Speaker 4>this year and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2467
01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:19.930
<v Speaker 4>you get back on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's weird.</v>

2468
01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:21.090
<v Speaker 4>You can't remember anything</v>

2469
01:43:21.650 --> 01:43:24.080
<v Speaker 5>cool a week or two off all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to come back on stage.</v>

2470
01:43:24.081 --> 01:43:25.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always have to do a warmup set.</v>

2471
01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:30.820
<v Speaker 5>I'd do something in town in La and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>it charges it and then that's the only </v>

2472
01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:34.331
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's the time where I'll go over </v>

2473
01:43:34.331 --> 01:43:36.101
<v Speaker 5>material just to familiarize myself with</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I've been talking about most </v>

2474
01:43:36.101 --> 01:43:39.701
<v Speaker 5>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I have like my iphone records all my </v>

2475
01:43:39.701 --> 01:43:39.701
<v Speaker 5>sense and I get recordings from Brian </v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

2476
01:43:39.701 --> 01:43:42.830
<v Speaker 5>So then I take them and I put them on my</v>
<v Speaker 5>ipod and I just listened to my plans.</v>

2477
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:44.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2478
01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:49.540
<v Speaker 4>So it makes you dissect your shit also </v>
<v Speaker 4>unconfident audio record and be better </v>

2479
01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:49.650
<v Speaker 4>than what you're listening to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2480
01:43:49.651 --> 01:43:51.950
<v Speaker 4>you want to tighten it up and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Oh yeah.</v>

2481
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:57.010
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're not hearing it for the first </v>

2482
01:43:57.010 --> 01:43:57.010
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're hearing it for the 400th time and</v>

2483
01:43:57.010 --> 01:43:57.490
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2484
01:43:57.491 --> 01:43:58.580
<v Speaker 5>you really start breaking shit.</v>

2485
01:43:58.910 --> 01:44:00.740
<v Speaker 4>So you recorded in an ipod or</v>

2486
01:44:01.110 --> 01:44:03.840
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I'm the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I feel from him.</v>

2487
01:44:03.841 --> 01:44:04.110
<v Speaker 5>He</v>

2488
01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:05.530
<v Speaker 4>plugs up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2489
01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:08.620
<v Speaker 4>Good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's helpful because then you can hear</v>

2490
01:44:08.621 --> 01:44:10.710
<v Speaker 4>the little things that you say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're enjoying it,</v>

2491
01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:12.310
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're enjoying this whole process.</v>

2492
01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.240
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been really,</v>

2493
01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:14.230
<v Speaker 4>really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2494
01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:19.240
<v Speaker 4>I like what we were talking about when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we were having coffee when I got </v>

2495
01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:19.800
<v Speaker 4>here in the kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2496
01:44:19.810 --> 01:44:24.810
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about how it's just </v>

2497
01:44:24.810 --> 01:44:24.810
<v Speaker 4>nice to be in an independent thing where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2498
01:44:24.810 --> 01:44:29.680
<v Speaker 4>you want to come up with a crazy idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was a funny thought and you go up</v>

2499
01:44:29.681 --> 01:44:31.750
<v Speaker 4>and you can try it and there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2500
01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:34.720
<v Speaker 4>somebody coming in and telling you not </v>
<v Speaker 4>to say this or do that.</v>

2501
01:44:34.770 --> 01:44:35.260
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2502
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:37.280
<v Speaker 5>That's the most frustrating thing for </v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody.</v>

2503
01:44:37.281 --> 01:44:42.281
<v Speaker 5>Controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you is got to be a bunch of </v>

2504
01:44:42.281 --> 01:44:42.740
<v Speaker 5>executives that have their ideas about </v>
<v Speaker 5>what they think is going to be funny and</v>

2505
01:44:42.741 --> 01:44:44.100
<v Speaker 5>they're imposing it and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2506
01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:49.120
<v Speaker 5>it may not be funny for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might not be funny for three people </v>

2507
01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:49.120
<v Speaker 5>in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for people in this room,</v>

2508
01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:53.861
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the funny shit they've ever</v>
<v Speaker 5>seen and you're going for those four </v>

2509
01:44:53.861 --> 01:44:54.710
<v Speaker 5>people and these people can never see </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2510
01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:57.260
<v Speaker 5>All they can see is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're losing three.</v>

2511
01:44:57.610 --> 01:45:02.610
<v Speaker 5>You just took this back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This person would still like it yet </v>

2512
01:45:02.610 --> 01:45:03.410
<v Speaker 5>still get the original people and we'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>have two more people that like it.</v>

2513
01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:04.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how they think.</v>

2514
01:45:04.791 --> 01:45:07.220
<v Speaker 5>They think in these nutty numbers and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not thinking creative</v>

2515
01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:12.220
<v Speaker 4>and then you end up spending most of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your time dealing with that and at the </v>

2516
01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:12.220
<v Speaker 4>end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the end of it all,</v>

2517
01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:17.111
<v Speaker 4>you're never really sure what it would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have been if you'd just sort of gone </v>

2518
01:45:17.111 --> 01:45:17.111
<v Speaker 4>wild on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful,</v>

2519
01:45:17.111 --> 01:45:19.190
<v Speaker 4>great freedom and just being on the road</v>
<v Speaker 4>has been really fun.</v>

2520
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:21.440
<v Speaker 4>It's been really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been a good way.</v>

2521
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:26.590
<v Speaker 4>I also thought it'd be cool way to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>out and film stuff for my website </v>

2522
01:45:26.590 --> 01:45:26.600
<v Speaker 4>because I always wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always said,</v>

2523
01:45:26.601 --> 01:45:28.730
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be cool to take my web show,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and go to different cities and see the </v>

2525

<v Speaker 4>people that watched the web show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every show I go to,</v>

2530
01:45:43.131 --> 01:45:45.860

01:45:48.711 --> 01:45:49.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

01:45:58.431 --> 01:46:03.431
<v Speaker 4>That's just somebody to fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scared of them.</v>

2540
01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:06.410
<v Speaker 4>She never admitted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucked up.</v>

2541
01:46:06.411 --> 01:46:08.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm not scared of you already fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You already.</v>

2542
01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:09.550
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to join them.</v>

2543
01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:12.980
<v Speaker 4>Now we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2544
01:46:12.981 --> 01:46:14.100
<v Speaker 4>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is with the.</v>

2545
01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:19.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean to give you a little bit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of an idea here.</v>

2546
01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:22.010
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what we've done in my eyesight,</v>

2547
01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:24.140
<v Speaker 4>because four Chan was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was I,</v>

2548
01:46:24.190 --> 01:46:29.190
<v Speaker 4>I found,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did some fairly clever and ridiculous </v>

2549
01:46:29.190 --> 01:46:32.531
<v Speaker 4>and absurd prank calls on us constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are completely irrelevant and </v>

2550
01:46:33.591 --> 01:46:36.080
<v Speaker 4>obviously the most annoying thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's completely irrelevant.</v>

2551
01:46:36.081 --> 01:46:38.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm sitting here with guests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2552
01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:39.320
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was on the phone,</v>

2553
01:46:39.321 --> 01:46:44.321
<v Speaker 4>but on skype it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a much more difficult for them to </v>

2554
01:46:44.321 --> 01:46:47.081
<v Speaker 4>do that because we've created a system </v>
<v Speaker 4>which I'll tell you about off air </v>

2555
01:46:47.081 --> 01:46:47.500
<v Speaker 4>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you about off air.</v>

2556
01:46:47.890 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 4>Off Air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I motherfuckers you aint</v>

2557
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:53.100
<v Speaker 1>getting to stay one step ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step ahead of the four Chan guys,</v>

2558
01:46:53.110 --> 01:46:58.110
<v Speaker 1>bell all system for skype that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually use that will help help in that</v>

2559
01:46:58.741 --> 01:47:02.130
<v Speaker 1>area for Chan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it.</v>

2560
01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard everybody's ears and you </v>

2561
01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:07.500
<v Speaker 1>pissed a bunch of people off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're coming after you now dude.</v>

2562
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we went after that bitch that through</v>

2563
01:47:09.541 --> 01:47:11.120
<v Speaker 1>puppies in the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got her.</v>

2564
01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Was that loud for Cenk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got that.</v>

2565
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:15.230
<v Speaker 1>It was all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a little annoyance.</v>

2566
01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Tom Bring.</v>

2567
01:47:17.271 --> 01:47:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm losing my hearing because of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that too.</v>

2568
01:47:19.090 --> 01:47:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Did you want me to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm starting to lose my hearing.</v>

2569
01:47:21.321 --> 01:47:26.321
<v Speaker 1>I have noticed a lot of times I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations with people and they're </v>

2570
01:47:26.321 --> 01:47:27.760
<v Speaker 1>talking to me as if I should be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear what they're saying the same.</v>

2571
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Same with me and I'm like thinking maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not paying attention to them,</v>

2572
01:47:31.201 --> 01:47:32.710
<v Speaker 1>but I can't hear them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call it.</v>

2573
01:47:32.850 --> 01:47:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Having your years blown out from people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that what it is or is it just a bunch</v>

2574
01:47:36.241 --> 01:47:38.680
<v Speaker 1>of people that are talking all soft </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

2575
01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:43.700
<v Speaker 1>like a fucking normal person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people just mumbled certain </v>

2576
01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:46.470
<v Speaker 1>frequencies to when people have sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that frequency of noisy area.</v>

2577
01:47:48.710 --> 01:47:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Tell me how annoying is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of stuff do you talk about?</v>

2578
01:47:55.770 --> 01:47:57.420
<v Speaker 1>That is the dumbest question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2579
01:47:57.421 --> 01:48:00.140
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a relevant question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for,</v>

2580
01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:01.190
<v Speaker 1>for a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2581
01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:02.700
<v Speaker 1>What are you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the things you're talking about</v>

2582
01:48:02.701 --> 01:48:03.810
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2583
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:06.280
<v Speaker 1>when we tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Sarah Pailin is dumb.</v>

2584
01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me do the bit right now.</v>

2585
01:48:07.711 --> 01:48:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Which doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2586
01:48:09.330 --> 01:48:14.330
<v Speaker 1>killer whales are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be in pools are going to </v>

2587
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:16.650
<v Speaker 1>run out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a lot of Ufo stuff going on,</v>

2588
01:48:16.651 --> 01:48:21.651
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't there and I go into a little </v>

2589
01:48:21.651 --> 01:48:21.651
<v Speaker 1>UFO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somebody.</v>

2590
01:48:21.651 --> 01:48:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what you're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that people,</v>

2591
01:48:22.501 --> 01:48:27.501
<v Speaker 1>when they ask that question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand how important the </v>

2592
01:48:27.501 --> 01:48:28.380
<v Speaker 1>audiences when you're telling these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2593
01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:31.190
<v Speaker 1>it's so much part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2594
01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:34.370
<v Speaker 1>you need the audience there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

2595
01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:38.250
<v Speaker 1>So wait Ufo thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have you been paying attention to</v>

2596
01:48:38.251 --> 01:48:38.790
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

2597
01:48:38.850 --> 01:48:43.850
<v Speaker 1>That's something that an appointed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>liaison or a spokesperson for the </v>

2598
01:48:43.981 --> 01:48:48.981
<v Speaker 1>American for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the human race rather in </v>

2599
01:48:48.981 --> 01:48:48.981
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When aliens land.</v>

2600
01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Really it's some weird looking chick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like very like,</v>

2601
01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:58.120
<v Speaker 1>it's not Sarah Pale man looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the person that they're not to.</v>

2602
01:48:58.380 --> 01:48:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a strange looking.</v>

2603
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:01.260
<v Speaker 1>She's the person that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to.</v>

2604
01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:04.290
<v Speaker 1>She's speaking for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't we have some sort of insight?</v>

2605
01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Fuck the UN over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the pucker just like.</v>

2606
01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:11.820

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2607
01:49:11.821 --> 01:49:13.690

<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

2608
01:49:13.691 --> 01:49:14.730
<v Speaker 1>They did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

2609
01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe like a resident firefighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

2610
01:49:17.541 --> 01:49:19.210
<v Speaker 1>It's just like that's the most basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>

2611
01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:22.170
<v Speaker 1>I hope so because you imagine that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulltime job.</v>

2612
01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine if she gets like 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>grand a year in benefits and all she has</v>

2613
01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:26.200
<v Speaker 1>to just sit around and wait for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

2616
01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck it looked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The aliens don't give a fuck about who </v>

2617
01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:37.420
<v Speaker 1>the leader is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a shit.</v>

2618
01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:39.450
<v Speaker 1>If they were going to come here from </v>
<v Speaker 1>another galaxy.</v>

2619
01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:41.250
<v Speaker 1>They're the leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no leader.</v>

2620
01:49:41.251 --> 01:49:43.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to represent like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens don't care.</v>

2628
01:50:01.111 --> 01:50:02.881
<v Speaker 5>what aliens decide to do to us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll do the same thing to us that we </v>

2629
01:50:02.881 --> 01:50:05.551
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The monkeys that we do to dolphins that </v>

2630
01:50:05.551 --> 01:50:05.551
<v Speaker 5>we did a killer whales,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they treat us well.</v>

2631
01:50:05.551 --> 01:50:07.450
<v Speaker 5>They should be like that monkey that was</v>
<v Speaker 5>holding the kitten the other day.</v>

2632
01:50:07.451 --> 01:50:10.640
<v Speaker 5>They might just come down and cradle us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be the exact opposite.</v>

2633
01:50:10.641 --> 01:50:11.710
<v Speaker 5>They might just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2634
01:50:11.711 --> 01:50:16.711
<v Speaker 5>we just want to comb your hair and fuzzy</v>
<v Speaker 5>to Baka type creatures that come down.</v>

2635
01:50:16.931 --> 01:50:17.590
<v Speaker 5>Just want to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

2636
01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:21.780
<v Speaker 5>I try to keep these thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these ideas of Ufo aliens.</v>

2637
01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:26.790
<v Speaker 5>I tried to keep him away from my </v>
<v Speaker 5>consciousness because I think they're </v>

2638
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:29.970
<v Speaker 5>giant time-wasters contemplate what if </v>
<v Speaker 5>the aliens are really these Ufo videos </v>

2639
01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:31.400
<v Speaker 5>real?</v>

2640
01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:37.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm open to the possibility that there </v>

2641
01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:37.280
<v Speaker 5>are aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not gonna.</v>

2642
01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:41.070
<v Speaker 5>Sit around and watch some fucking lights</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the sky that I don't know what the </v>

2643
01:50:41.070 --> 01:50:43.891
<v Speaker 5>fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It turned out it was actually a </v>

2644
01:50:43.891 --> 01:50:43.891
<v Speaker 5>helicopter and you're actually retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2645
01:50:43.891 --> 01:50:44.020
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2646
01:50:44.021 --> 01:50:49.021
<v Speaker 5>I mean maybe this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a prank when those little </v>

2647
01:50:49.021 --> 01:50:53.611
<v Speaker 5>helicopters that he souped up and has a </v>
<v Speaker 5>couple leds and I'm not closed to the </v>

2648
01:50:53.611 --> 01:50:58.351
<v Speaker 5>idea that there are something there that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is possible that there are some sort </v>

2649
01:50:58.571 --> 01:51:01.540
<v Speaker 5>of intelligent life forms out there that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are capable of traveling here,</v>

2650
01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:03.450
<v Speaker 5>whether they're from another planet or </v>
<v Speaker 5>another dimension.</v>

2651
01:51:03.550 --> 01:51:08.550
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't be ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but everything about this life would be </v>

2652
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.550
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We weren't living it.</v>

2653
01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:11.860
<v Speaker 5>The idea that we can get the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 5>would be ridiculous if it didn't exist.</v>

2654
01:51:12.010 --> 01:51:13.930
<v Speaker 5>The idea that you could send pictures </v>
<v Speaker 5>from your phone,</v>

2655
01:51:13.931 --> 01:51:18.931
<v Speaker 5>the idea that you had to have a phone </v>
<v Speaker 5>that fits in your pocket and you call </v>

2656
01:51:18.931 --> 01:51:18.970
<v Speaker 5>someone in China and to talk in real </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2657
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.120
<v Speaker 5>Everything is so small condensed now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so much smaller now.</v>

2658
01:51:22.210 --> 01:51:25.060
<v Speaker 5>It's also strange that it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>feel entirely possible.</v>

2659
01:51:25.061 --> 01:51:30.061
<v Speaker 5>There's something super advanced past </v>
<v Speaker 5>this and they can communicate with us </v>

2660
01:51:30.061 --> 01:51:30.910
<v Speaker 5>and it's probably could be here right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now watching us,</v>

2661
01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:33.330
<v Speaker 5>but these guys that came out today or </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you were.</v>

2662
01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:37.840
<v Speaker 5>You were talking about last couple days </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are air force generals,</v>

2663
01:51:37.850 --> 01:51:40.510
<v Speaker 5>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That have been sworn to secrecy for last</v>

2664
01:51:40.511 --> 01:51:42.280
<v Speaker 5>50 years or whatever that say that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2665
01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:45.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they came and checked out some nuclear,</v>

2666
01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:49.030
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our nuclear sites and that they shut off</v>

2667
01:51:49.031 --> 01:51:51.640
<v Speaker 5>some nuclear weapons and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying that this happened.</v>

2668
01:51:52.450 --> 01:51:55.240
<v Speaker 5>Do you Think that happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or it could be one of two things.</v>

2669
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:56.200
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it can be many things,</v>

2670
01:51:56.230 --> 01:52:01.230
<v Speaker 5>but one of the things that it could be </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I was thinking is maybe these guys </v>

2671
01:52:01.230 --> 01:52:04.231
<v Speaker 5>are like being paid by the government to</v>
<v Speaker 5>say absolutely ridiculous things and </v>

2672
01:52:04.511 --> 01:52:06.460
<v Speaker 5>that nothing ever really happened at </v>
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>

2673
01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:09.800
<v Speaker 5>And what there are is a part of some </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of a disinflation campaign and then</v>

2674
01:52:09.801 --> 01:52:14.801
<v Speaker 5>eventually turn out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They lied about a few details and that </v>

2675
01:52:14.801 --> 01:52:17.611
<v Speaker 5>will discredit the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it just makes aliens seem more and </v>

2676
01:52:17.611 --> 01:52:21.841
<v Speaker 5>more ridiculous to calm people down </v>
<v Speaker 5>because maybe there may be some things </v>

2677
01:52:21.841 --> 01:52:22.510
<v Speaker 5>that they can't keep wraps on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when those things are leaked,</v>

2678
01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:24.780
<v Speaker 5>the best way to diffuse the impact that </v>
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>

2679
01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:28.840
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a crazy event or video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best way to diffuse the impact would</v>

2680
01:52:28.841 --> 01:52:33.841
<v Speaker 5>be to show all these other ones have </v>
<v Speaker 5>similar stories that seem absolutely </v>

2681
01:52:33.841 --> 01:52:34.030
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it automatically gets lumped into,</v>

2682
01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:35.350
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a ufo video.</v>

2683
01:52:35.351 --> 01:52:36.490
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're crazy.</v>

2684
01:52:36.491 --> 01:52:37.600
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you believe that?</v>

2685
01:52:37.870 --> 01:52:40.030
<v Speaker 5>And so it automatically puts it into </v>
<v Speaker 5>that category.</v>

2686
01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:45.040
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's an effective psychological </v>

2687
01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:47.041
<v Speaker 5>tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you were someone like the cia or </v>

2688
01:52:47.041 --> 01:52:49.651
<v Speaker 5>someone in the nsa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who's of a super intelligence </v>

2689
01:52:49.651 --> 01:52:52.661
<v Speaker 5>community,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they know how to fucking manipulate </v>

2690
01:52:52.661 --> 01:52:52.661
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>

2691
01:52:52.661 --> 01:52:52.661
<v Speaker 5>don't make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They absolutely do.</v>

2692
01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:57.700
<v Speaker 5>So it could be that or it could be that </v>
<v Speaker 5>these people really saw some shit and </v>

2693
01:52:57.700 --> 01:52:58.400
<v Speaker 5>they don't even know what the fuck it </v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

2694
01:52:58.401 --> 01:53:00.780
<v Speaker 5>It could be that you know that they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>all crazy.</v>

2695
01:53:00.890 --> 01:53:02.330
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of bs,</v>

2696
01:53:02.331 --> 01:53:05.990
<v Speaker 5>but until I see something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>until some shit comes into my life,</v>

2697
01:53:05.991 --> 01:53:10.991
<v Speaker 5>I'm just wasting my time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't want to sit around </v>

2698
01:53:10.991 --> 01:53:10.991
<v Speaker 5>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2699
01:53:10.991 --> 01:53:13.250
<v Speaker 5>whether or not half this shit is real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And rob [inaudible],</v>

2700
01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:14.390
<v Speaker 5>did he really work at area?</v>

2701
01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:16.070
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to know that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw that guy.</v>

2702
01:53:16.071 --> 01:53:21.071
<v Speaker 4>I've watched all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got addicted to watching that stuff </v>

2703
01:53:21.071 --> 01:53:21.071
<v Speaker 4>for a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

2704
01:53:21.071 --> 01:53:24.000
<v Speaker 4>for a good year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was addicted to watching all this </v>

2705
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:24.000
<v Speaker 4>stuff and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2706
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:24.620
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and talk to this disclosure,</v>

2707
01:53:24.621 --> 01:53:25.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna get,</v>

2708
01:53:25.371 --> 01:53:27.770
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna tell us soon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just prepping us for it,</v>

2709
01:53:27.771 --> 01:53:29.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the disclosure project.</v>

2710
01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:31.170
<v Speaker 4>I really do hope that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2711
01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:33.710
<v Speaker 4>they tell us soon because I think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be pretty cool,</v>

2712
01:53:33.711 --> 01:53:34.100
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2713
01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:39.220
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>scrambling trying to figure out a bunch </v>

2714
01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:41.921
<v Speaker 5>of different things that don't make </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense and I think it's very possible </v>

2715
01:53:41.921 --> 01:53:44.891
<v Speaker 5>that there are some alien life forms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do not think that our government </v>

2716
01:53:44.891 --> 01:53:46.940
<v Speaker 5>has shit under control enough to keep </v>
<v Speaker 5>all that shit under wraps and to somehow</v>

2717
01:53:46.941 --> 01:53:48.680
<v Speaker 5>or another be communicating with these </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

2718
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:53.830
<v Speaker 5>I think if the government knows anything</v>
<v Speaker 5>about ufo is they know barely more than </v>

2719
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:58.180
<v Speaker 5>the average person knows and they have </v>
<v Speaker 5>some evidence and they keep that shit </v>

2720
01:53:58.180 --> 01:53:58.370
<v Speaker 5>under wraps with they have cleared up </v>
<v Speaker 5>some evidence.</v>

2721
01:53:58.371 --> 01:53:59.780
<v Speaker 5>Perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe if it's true,</v>

2722
01:53:59.930 --> 01:54:02.780
<v Speaker 5>maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you hear all the area 51 stories and the</v>

2723
01:54:02.781 --> 01:54:07.781
<v Speaker 5>roswell stories and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the crashes has been recovered all over </v>

2724
01:54:07.781 --> 01:54:08.060
<v Speaker 5>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's has been crashes,</v>

2725
01:54:08.061 --> 01:54:10.250
<v Speaker 5>recovered supposedly in Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the woods,</v>

2726
01:54:10.251 --> 01:54:12.140
<v Speaker 5>and who knows how much of that shit's </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>

2727
01:54:12.141 --> 01:54:17.141
<v Speaker 5>Who knows how much of that stuff is just</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a prototype that the us </v>

2728
01:54:17.141 --> 01:54:17.141
<v Speaker 5>government was working on.</v>

2729
01:54:17.141 --> 01:54:18.410
<v Speaker 5>It didn't work and it crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know who the fuck knows,</v>

2730
01:54:19.010 --> 01:54:24.010
<v Speaker 5>but I'm open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm open to the possibility that that's </v>

2731
01:54:24.010 --> 01:54:24.620
<v Speaker 5>just the fact that we exist to ants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

2732
01:54:24.710 --> 01:54:26.600
<v Speaker 5>Then that means the way the universe </v>
<v Speaker 5>works,</v>

2733
01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:31.720
<v Speaker 5>things become ever more complicated to </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep going in the same direction over </v>

2734
01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:34.481
<v Speaker 5>and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If human beings came from emmy buzz and </v>

2735
01:54:34.481 --> 01:54:34.640
<v Speaker 5>all sudden someday evolve to become </v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings,</v>

2736
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:35.840
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever the fuck.</v>

2737
01:54:35.841 --> 01:54:38.420
<v Speaker 5>We were a single celled organisms that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we became us.</v>

2738
01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:43.010
<v Speaker 5>There's gonna be a similar group of </v>
<v Speaker 5>evolution from us to something else,</v>

2739
01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:48.220
<v Speaker 5>so it literally will be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The aliens will be treating us the same </v>

2740
01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:49.220
<v Speaker 5>way we treat a fucking ant colony.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at these silicons.</v>

2741
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:50.780
<v Speaker 5>I'll get these silly concert,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their pollution.</v>

2742
01:54:50.781 --> 01:54:51.530
<v Speaker 5>They're stupid building.</v>

2743
01:54:51.610 --> 01:54:56.610
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping what it is is these ships </v>

2744
01:54:56.610 --> 01:54:56.610
<v Speaker 4>that come,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2745
01:54:56.610 --> 01:54:59.221
<v Speaker 4>They come and they start talking to us </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then eventually it started to open </v>

2746
01:54:59.221 --> 01:54:59.221
<v Speaker 4>up and they come on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look exactly like us,</v>

2747
01:54:59.221 --> 01:55:01.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They look exactly like us and what it is</v>

2748
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:02.680
<v Speaker 4>we've spent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've spread.</v>

2749
01:55:02.681 --> 01:55:04.280
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe they got like and know.</v>

2750
01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:05.110
<v Speaker 4>We're like ants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2751
01:55:05.111 --> 01:55:07.270
<v Speaker 4>They got similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's so great about us?</v>

2752
01:55:07.330 --> 01:55:12.330
<v Speaker 4>So then we get in this thing and you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go to another planet instantly with </v>

2753
01:55:12.330 --> 01:55:12.970
<v Speaker 4>our technology and it's got more space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not all.</v>

2754
01:55:12.971 --> 01:55:14.760
<v Speaker 4>There's no pollution and they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2755
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:17.150
<v Speaker 4>sorta like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm kinda hoping for.</v>

2756
01:55:17.151 --> 01:55:19.570
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I'm kind of angling for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping for that.</v>

2757
01:55:19.630 --> 01:55:21.310
<v Speaker 4>You want utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's beautiful.</v>

2758
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:23.620
<v Speaker 4>You should write a book saying that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2759
01:55:23.621 --> 01:55:25.030
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't start a call.</v>

2760
01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:27.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then drink a bunch of grape kool aid</v>

2761
01:55:27.341 --> 01:55:30.870
<v Speaker 4>and they have to go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was an africa,</v>

2762
01:55:30.871 --> 01:55:32.070
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2763
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:35.330
<v Speaker 4>it was a diana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2764
01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:39.190
<v Speaker 4>Was it cool to diana tragedy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jon jones?</v>

2765
01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:40.480
<v Speaker 4>It's ncd amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

2766
01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.250
<v Speaker 4>That self american radio was south </v>
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>

2767
01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:44.250
<v Speaker 4>Guyana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>south Guyana</v>

2768
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:45.890
<v Speaker 1>in south America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you heard the audio,</v>

2769
01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:48.550
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scary,</v>

2770
01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:51.180
<v Speaker 1>so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know the story of jim jones</v>

2771
01:55:51.181 --> 01:55:54.620
<v Speaker 1>was a cult leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved all of his people to Guyana,</v>

2772
01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:56.250
<v Speaker 1>wherever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was africa,</v>

2773
01:55:56.580 --> 01:55:58.930
<v Speaker 1>sounds african and they all drank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drank.</v>

2774
01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:01.300
<v Speaker 1>He made them all poison themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they shot a bunch of people to.</v>

2775
01:56:01.301 --> 01:56:06.301
<v Speaker 1>We didn't want to take the poison </v>
<v Speaker 1>congressmen flew down there to see them </v>

2776
01:56:06.301 --> 01:56:06.301
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2777
01:56:06.301 --> 01:56:09.180
<v Speaker 1>the way they poisoned them was they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cyanide in grape kool aid and that's</v>

2778
01:56:09.181 --> 01:56:09.840
<v Speaker 1>why they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2779
01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:12.030
<v Speaker 1>they say don't drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't drink the koolaid.</v>

2780
01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:13.800
<v Speaker 1>That's where that saying comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2781
01:56:13.801 --> 01:56:14.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2782
01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:18.780
<v Speaker 1>the pretty major it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It resulted in a saying cultural.</v>

2783
01:56:18.781 --> 01:56:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cultural tag.</v>

2784
01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Don't treat pissed about that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they,</v>

2785
01:56:24.631 --> 01:56:26.550
<v Speaker 1>when they're so delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they worry.</v>

2786
01:56:26.730 --> 01:56:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Why would truly give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're connected to a mass </v>

2787
01:56:31.730 --> 01:56:34.170
<v Speaker 1>murder for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how we should research,</v>

2788
01:56:34.171 --> 01:56:37.940
<v Speaker 1>find out what their sales were up or </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2789
01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:40.050
<v Speaker 1>That's probably why hawaiian punch was </v>
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>

2790
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Probably came out after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They changed their name.</v>

2791
01:56:44.090 --> 01:56:47.340
<v Speaker 1>You might be rankeD top green.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good note to end it on.</v>

2792
01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been awesome.</v>

2793
01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Is a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been on for like a couple of hours</v>

2794
01:56:52.201 --> 01:56:53.130
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two hours.</v>

2795
01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:55.320
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go because we get to go into depth</v>

2796
01:56:55.321 --> 01:56:56.280
<v Speaker 1>about subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2797
01:56:56.490 --> 01:56:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I find that like when we were doing an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>

2798
01:56:58.561 --> 01:56:59.880
<v Speaker 1>we would just start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2799
01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden we'd run out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and I'm like,</v>

2800
01:57:01.561 --> 01:57:06.561
<v Speaker 1>why can't we just keep going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love what you said that when I was on </v>

<v Speaker 1>it was just so much fun.</v>

2802
01:57:06.561 --> 01:57:07.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like it seems like it'd be more fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we got to keep going.</v>

2803
01:57:07.651 --> 01:57:10.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just to get into a really time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
