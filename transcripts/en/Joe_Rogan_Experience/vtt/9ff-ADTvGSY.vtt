<v Speaker 1>Dog almost blew up the kitchen.</v>

148
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

149
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>These mother fuckers afternoon,</v>

150
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>they fired me as a baker and they made me a fucking dishwasher at a stock room</v>

151
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.453
<v Speaker 1>quite right.</v>

152
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.060
<v Speaker 1>So I was a dishwasher,</v>

153
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.710
<v Speaker 1>the stock room cloak and whenever they had shitty meals,</v>

154
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>the guys I knew when they were going through the line,</v>

155
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.823
<v Speaker 1>I would yell,</v>

156
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.950
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

157
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.000
<v Speaker 1>So I would go go.</v>

158
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>How often were the meals?</v>

159
00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Three times a week.</v>

160
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't matter because at lunch time I was allowed to go to the store for</v>

161
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:03.281
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes.</v>

162
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:04.114
<v Speaker 1>I worked it out.</v>

163
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.441
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

164
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I had a drive to take garbage out,</v>

165
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>so I would go to the store for 15 minutes.</v>

166
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:08.194
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

167
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I would call it my own at the Chinese restaurant.</v>

168
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>So it would be ready by the time I got there.</v>

169
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>So I would go back to the prison with Chinese food and groceries.</v>

170
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>That's how strong I was in there plus fuck around and call us.</v>

171
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.710
<v Speaker 1>They were doing steroids and selling drugs in prison ways.</v>

172
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Like a motherfucker.</v>

173
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 1>I was in the stock room clerk so they had to pay me rent.</v>

174
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>So how cause they never,</v>

175
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>once you stopped,</v>

176
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.880
<v Speaker 1>you stopped.</v>

177
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I would say you,</v>

178
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

179
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

180
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.753
<v Speaker 1>I'll hold your voice.</v>

181
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>You got to get $3.</v>

182
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:34.744
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

183
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>you gotta give me some cigarettes.</v>

184
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I had roids cigarettes,</v>

185
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 1>I had pills in their lap.</v>

186
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.203
<v Speaker 1>They weren't mine.</v>

187
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>They just belong to other people.</v>

188
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>But you put them on the pallets.</v>

189
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 1>So I would give them a key whenever they need it to go take shit out.</v>

190
00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>So they were the connection.</v>

191
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.111
<v Speaker 1>I was the,</v>

192
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:50.501
<v Speaker 1>I was the,</v>

193
00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:50.711
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

194
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I was the holdup.</v>

195
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>

196
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>did they get the steroids in?</v>

197
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Somebody had to put it up their ass.</v>

198
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.793
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

199
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.621
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

200
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:58.950
<v Speaker 1>I never imagine shooting a steroid in nearby.</v>

201
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>How do they smuggled it in again?</v>

202
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.123
<v Speaker 1>Up the rest of it.</v>

203
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Then they get,</v>

204
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>then they put it where that contact visits,</v>

205
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.091
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

206
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:09.770
<v Speaker 1>You'd do is you take your fucking kid and you fill his pockets with the yummy</v>

207
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.680
<v Speaker 1>this and why you're making out with your husband.</v>

208
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>You said you want to see the kid and you pass the kid to the husband and he</v>

209
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 1>takes the drugs that did.</v>

210
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:16.564
<v Speaker 1>It gives you back.</v>

211
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.150
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

212
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.180
<v Speaker 1>that's how Henry Hill did it.</v>

213
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.861
<v Speaker 1>That's how they do it.</v>

214
00:05:21.861 --> 00:05:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Same Shit.</v>

215
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.151

218
00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:27.350
<v Speaker 1>That was the ones on the outside and to boot.</v>

219
00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:29.090
<v Speaker 1>This was a minimum security camp.</v>

220
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.830
<v Speaker 1>We had contact visits.</v>

221
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.060
<v Speaker 1>When you have a contact visit,</v>

222
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.590
<v Speaker 1>there's parties every night.</v>

223
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.601
<v Speaker 1>These motherfuckers.</v>

224
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:38.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the first time I did it,</v>

225
00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:39.021
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

226
00:05:39.021 --> 00:05:40.560
<v Speaker 1>the second time I did heroin was it,</v>

227
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.691
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't,</v>

228
00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:42.524
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do a needle.</v>

229
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.431
<v Speaker 1>So the Mexican was,</v>

230
00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:44.570

231
00:05:44.571 --> 00:05:45.530
<v Speaker 1>a heroin melted it.</v>

232
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I had to put like a funnel in mind.</v>

233
00:05:47.151 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Those made out of paper when they dripped to them my nose and I got up,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and I'd be out there with them.</v>

246
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:10.790

263
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

264
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

265
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

266
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I was at,</v>

267
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>when I go to the halfway house,</v>

268
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 1>it was even better because I started loaning money out to the Invictus as a loan</v>

269
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:47.020
<v Speaker 1>shark fix.</v>

270
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

271
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:48.120
<v Speaker 1>because they want to go on,</v>

272
00:06:48.121 --> 00:06:49.590
<v Speaker 1>but if your rent's not paid on Thursday,</v>

273
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 1>not allowed for the weekend,</v>

274
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.680
<v Speaker 1>so the rent would be $65 I give him 65 and [inaudible] 92 you know what I'm</v>

275
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:54.831
<v Speaker 1>saying?</v>

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm going to give you $65 but you gotta give me 92 tomorrow and I had 10</v>

277
00:06:58.581 --> 00:06:59.414
<v Speaker 1>guys on that role.</v>

278
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 1>I was a fucking machine in there.</v>

279
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Gamma had at the camp,</v>

280
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.060
<v Speaker 1>the biggest scam I had was with,</v>

281
00:07:06.061 --> 00:07:08.430
<v Speaker 1>there was an old Italian dude from Brooklyn,</v>

282
00:07:08.431 --> 00:07:12.330
<v Speaker 1>he was like a half a mobster and he had pool cards and he would only do one card</v>

283
00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:12.631
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>

284
00:07:12.631 --> 00:07:13.860
<v Speaker 1>You would make like 30 bucks.</v>

285
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.001
<v Speaker 1>And I went up to him,</v>

286
00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:15.241
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

287
00:07:15.241 --> 00:07:15.451
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

288
00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:16.800
<v Speaker 1>you have a problem with these cards.</v>

289
00:07:16.801 --> 00:07:17.020
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

290
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.360
<v Speaker 1>you're giving them to white guys.</v>

291
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.920
<v Speaker 1>You're not getting the black population.</v>

292
00:07:19.921 --> 00:07:20.970
<v Speaker 1>You got to get in the fucking specs.</v>

293
00:07:20.971 --> 00:07:21.301
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

294
00:07:21.301 --> 00:07:21.631
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

295
00:07:21.631 --> 00:07:22.464
<v Speaker 1>They won't talk to me.</v>

296
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.891
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

297
00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:23.730
<v Speaker 1>give me the fucking cards.</v>

298
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.690
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go partners.</v>

299
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.200
<v Speaker 1>He went from selling one card every Monday they're doing 10 with me.</v>

300
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Cause I had the brothers,</v>

301
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.320
<v Speaker 1>I had the Puerto Ricans,</v>

302
00:07:31.321 --> 00:07:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I had the whites at everybody and it was amazing.</v>

303
00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:36.900
<v Speaker 1>That's why I really learned that I could really fucking do this.</v>

304
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.060
<v Speaker 1>So on Thursday nights they would say Cuba,</v>

305
00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:39.721
<v Speaker 1>fuck the movie.</v>

306
00:07:39.721 --> 00:07:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Just go up there and talk about the kitchen.</v>

307
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.173
<v Speaker 1>And they were all,</v>

308
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.111
<v Speaker 1>all the yarns,</v>

309
00:07:43.111 --> 00:07:44.700
<v Speaker 1>but y'all don't do it.</v>

310
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.650
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking hysterical.</v>

311
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Talk about</v>

312
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.141
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

313
00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:50.820
<v Speaker 1>And then I had this one crazy black guy.</v>

314
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.290
<v Speaker 1>This guy was Anton Spencer,</v>

315
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.640
<v Speaker 1>his name was Spencer Antwan from New Orleans and he was crazy.</v>

316
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.571
<v Speaker 1>And he called me,</v>

317
00:07:57.571 --> 00:08:00.390
<v Speaker 1>he told me that he was in there for eight years but involuntary manslaughter.</v>

318
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.800
<v Speaker 1>And he was my mentor.</v>

319
00:08:01.801 --> 00:08:03.090
<v Speaker 1>That was my dog Jack.</v>

320
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.500
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking nuts.</v>

321
00:08:04.501 --> 00:08:07.560
<v Speaker 1>And he would tell me like one day some guy nailed him $2 and he comes to the</v>

322
00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:07.861
<v Speaker 1>kitchen.</v>

323
00:08:07.861 --> 00:08:08.280
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

324
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.240
<v Speaker 1>but you see that guy?</v>

325
00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:09.541
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

326
00:08:09.541 --> 00:08:09.691

00:08:09.691 --> 00:08:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I think he's packing and leaving.</v>

328
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.110
<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker went and got a knife.</v>

329
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.690
<v Speaker 1>He got them at the gate as the guy was getting out of jail.</v>

336
00:08:22.561 --> 00:08:24.740
<v Speaker 1>That's like the best attorney from brothers got killed.</v>

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.003
<v Speaker 1>downtown La,</v>

344
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.090
<v Speaker 1>because I was in a federal place.</v>

345
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:38.300
<v Speaker 1>He beat him with his fucking hands and got say eight years for voluntary</v>

346
00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:39.330
<v Speaker 1>manslaughter.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He had like $50,000 attorney's he's got,</v>

348
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.630

<v Speaker 1>He got a gold tooth in his mouth.</v>

350
00:08:44.071 --> 00:08:46.650
<v Speaker 1>He was one of those brothers and shifted his eyes would go crazy.</v>

351
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I went in there every Thursday I get on stage and then one day this is fucked up</v>

352
00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:52.801
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>

353
00:08:52.801 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 1>This is why I really dig it because one day guy in the library,</v>

354
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>it was like a nerdy dude.</v>

355
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.670
<v Speaker 1>The guy that ran the library and I was friends with them.</v>

356
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:00.271
<v Speaker 1>We did acid.</v>

357
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:03.190
<v Speaker 1>He was very into Nostradamus and you know,</v>

358
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.730
<v Speaker 1>he was intelligent but he had just,</v>

359
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.860
<v Speaker 1>he had some problem or some,</v>

360
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:06.703
<v Speaker 1>he went to prison.</v>

361
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 1>And the funny thing was that one day he came up to me and the jail and a</v>

362
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 1>notebook was a big thing and I was getting ready to get out and I never even</v>

363
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 1>thought about it.</v>

364
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 1>He came up to me and then he goes,</v>

365
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:15.571
<v Speaker 1>hey bro,</v>

366
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 1>I got you a notebook.</v>

367
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:17.941
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

368
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:18.751
<v Speaker 1>what's the notebook for?</v>

369
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:18.961
<v Speaker 1>It goes,</v>

370
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:20.700
<v Speaker 1>so when you get out you could write some jokes.</v>

371
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:21.360
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

372
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

373
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.160
<v Speaker 1>every week you write jokes.</v>

374
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I never see the notebook.</v>

375
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:24.894
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at him and I go,</v>

376
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't even right and this motherfucker went nuts.</v>

377
00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:28.891
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

378
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:29.491
<v Speaker 1>you don't right.</v>

379
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>And you go up there every week and do that.</v>

380
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.461
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

381
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:33.191
<v Speaker 1>when you get out of here,</v>

382
00:09:33.191 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

383
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.313
<v Speaker 1>it was like an angel.</v>

384
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.161
<v Speaker 1>It was like an angel.</v>

385
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:36.220
<v Speaker 1>I never seen the guy again.</v>

386
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I never heard from him again.</v>

387
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.483
<v Speaker 1>He just goes,</v>

388
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.570
<v Speaker 1>what I watched you do.</v>

389
00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:41.190
<v Speaker 1>You really need to write and get it together.</v>

390
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

391
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Cause you have a gift.</v>

392
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Just pursue this and that guy never even talked to me like he never used to talk</v>

393
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:47.060
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

394
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I just set it out of the blue.</v>

395
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:48.901
<v Speaker 1>I got blue,</v>

396
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:49.591
<v Speaker 1>came up to me one day.</v>

397
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:49.801
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

398
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

399
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I got your notebook,</v>

400
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.093
<v Speaker 1>the black guy,</v>

401
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.131
<v Speaker 1>white guy,</v>

402
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>white nerdy guy.</v>

403
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.390
<v Speaker 1>That was like a really nerdy guy that would always roll his own cigarettes or</v>

404
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.660
<v Speaker 1>some random guy came up.</v>

405
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that if you didn't go to prison,</v>

406
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:06.480
<v Speaker 1>if he didn't have that experience of talking in front of those people that you</v>

407
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 1>probably never would have done standup over,</v>

408
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:09.840
<v Speaker 1>stand up something that was in the back of your head anyway,</v>

409
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.100
<v Speaker 1>it was in the back of my head.</v>

410
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:16.130
<v Speaker 1>The prison really woke the animal up because not only I had thought I bro,</v>

411
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:17.551
<v Speaker 1>if any,</v>

412
00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:21.510
<v Speaker 1>because you had to be funny before prison buddy who heard the niggas crazy by</v>

413
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Richard Pryor.</v>

414
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.890
<v Speaker 1>You had to think of,</v>

415
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.140
<v Speaker 1>he pushed it so hard on that before prison.</v>

416
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was always good at at the Deli.</v>

417
00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:31.500
<v Speaker 1>I was always loved telling stories.</v>

418
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:31.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

419
00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I was always good with that shit.</v>

420
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:35.740
<v Speaker 1>And then the thing that really got me was when you go to prison,</v>

421
00:10:35.741 --> 00:10:38.950
<v Speaker 1>they do a diagnostic on you and I like to get an attorney now.</v>

422
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:39.480
<v Speaker 1>A really,</v>

423
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 1>that's the only thing that irks me about my life.</v>

424
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of times people say,</v>

425
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.170
<v Speaker 1>oh I slept with this guy with me is I always wanted to know what's on that</v>

426
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:50.010
<v Speaker 1>paperwork because it was an intense psychological evaluation.</v>

427
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.230
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't a guy with a piece of paper saying,</v>

428
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 1>what do you think when you see a star?</v>

429
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Like they put shit in my head,</v>

430
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.100
<v Speaker 1>electrodes and all this shit.</v>

431
00:10:57.101 --> 00:11:00.630
<v Speaker 1>It was three days of mental testing and it was eating me alive and I wanted to</v>

432
00:11:00.631 --> 00:11:00.871
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

433
00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I kept asking the counselor who was from Mississippi,</v>

434
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:04.590
