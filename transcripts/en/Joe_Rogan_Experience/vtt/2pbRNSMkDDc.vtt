<v Speaker 2>involved in defending the guy looks.</v>

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Hilary Clinton,</v>

17
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>this is way back when she was a criminal</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense attorney.</v>

18
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>She got a a child rapist off and a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad one.</v>

19
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.380
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't one of those good child </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapists.</v>

20
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.293
<v Speaker 2>It was a real way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was like jared bang and 15 year </v>

21
00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 2>olds who was making sandwiches,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

24
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.113
<v Speaker 2>you heard like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way Michael Jackson was accused of </v>

25
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 2>raping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

26
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 2>that was like the nicest way you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>rape a kid.</v>

27
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.000
<v Speaker 2>It was like take him to an amusement </v>
<v Speaker 2>park.</v>

28
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

30
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Child rape is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me start with that.</v>

31
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst thing ever.</v>

32
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Kanye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick Pics.</v>

33
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 2>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

34
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 2>Just want to be clear on where I stand.</v>

35
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so sheet,</v>

36
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>so this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.553
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically raped a 12 year old girl and </v>

38
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:39.441
<v Speaker 1>really brutal the details of the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she defended the guy and there's a,</v>

39
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>there's tape of her in an interview </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about this years later now.</v>

40
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>It's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's back in the day.</v>

41
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>It's when Hillary Clinton's doing like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern accent.</v>

42
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.610
<v Speaker 1>There's been like six different Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton's that have existed.</v>

43
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>This was the southern wife of Bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton.</v>

44
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:53.994
<v Speaker 1>Hillary when she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was the mayor or governor of </v>

45
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Arkansas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was that early eighties?</v>

46
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around that,</v>

47
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>around that time period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

48
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure precisely where the tape is</v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

49
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she is,</v>

50
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

51
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of videos I could point to</v>

52
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:10.921
<v Speaker 1>online that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

53
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>strong evidence that Hillary Clinton is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sociopath.</v>

54
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm personally convinced of that.</v>

55
00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not a professional and I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnose her,</v>

56
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>but this video is really up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

57
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:21.624
<v Speaker 1>she's laughing about the details of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rape case and how she got the guy off </v>

58
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>and she laughs about how funny it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

59
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:31.074
<v Speaker 1>when she basically admits that she knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was guilty because she's going </v>

60
00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:34.921
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

61
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>we convinced the jury it was a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>miscarriage of justice and she's,</v>

62
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>she says that he took a polygraph and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and passed it.</v>

63
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>And then she says that forever destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 1>my belief in polygraphs.</v>

64
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>So she's basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this guy raped this,</v>

65
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>this little girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we were able to get them off and she</v>

66
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>laughs about having the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bloody underwear as the big piece of</v>

67
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:56.131
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really intense.</v>

69
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful shit.</v>

70
00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>And what's really</v>

71
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 2>crazy about it is that in this world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

72
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:03.994
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rape culture and Social Justice Warrior </v>

73
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 2>liberal outrage there is just deafening </v>
<v Speaker 2>silence when it comes to the Clintons.</v>

74
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's a lack of information?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because most people don't go looking for</v>

75
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 2>this stuff for stuff like what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

76
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Most people have to find it on Fox News </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>

77
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Outrageous.</v>

78
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.963
<v Speaker 2>They don't go looking for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's a lot you'd have to look </v>

79
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:24.604
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you'd have to go through all the </v>

80
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:26.254
<v Speaker 2>Whitewater stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to go through all that Vince </v>

81
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:29.130
<v Speaker 2>foster stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to try to find,</v>

82
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of like weird stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>about them in their past that you'd have</v>

83
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:34.290
<v Speaker 2>to sort through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of this is legit,</v>

84
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 2>how much has it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people aren't going to do that.</v>

85
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not being discussed and you'll have</v>

86
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:40.710
<v Speaker 2>to filter out like that just nonsense.</v>

87
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.553
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem with where we're at </v>

88
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 2>now is that the truth is out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>

89
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's sandwiched in between a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of nonsense.</v>

90
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 2>And so you've got to like get that out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the way.</v>

91
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 2>And the conspiracy theorists would say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that nonsense is there on purpose.</v>

92
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.991
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

93
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Because everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every conspiracy theorist,</v>

94
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 2>as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I read more conspiracy theorist,</v>

95
00:03:57.281 --> 00:03:58.114
<v Speaker 2>it turns out they were just working for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the conspiracy and they're against like </v>

96
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:01.564
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all think now is working to tryst </v>

97
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alison is my friend.</v>

98
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.140
<v Speaker 2>He's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no CIA involved there.</v>

99
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.403
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a fun thing when you get into </v>

100
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 2>stuff that people think is a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you're like,</v>

101
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.331
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

102
00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a crazy guy.</v>

103
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.703
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard conspiracies that involve me </v>

104
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 2>and so when I hear that I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

105
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:21.471
<v Speaker 2>I see how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

106
00:04:21.471 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 2>I've read some shit about me being a CIA</v>
<v Speaker 2>agent.</v>

107
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.551
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

108
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:25.384
<v Speaker 2>what a circuitous route I took.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went from kickboxing to standup </v>

109
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the while,</v>

110
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 2>secretly undercover for the CIA are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to plant them in news radio.</v>

111
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 2>And before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll be leading public opinion.</v>

112
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how even funnier one I have Eddie</v>

113
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Bravo thinks that it's perhaps possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps that Laurel Canyon was all about</v>

114
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:44.794
<v Speaker 2>a CIA psyops and Jim Morrison and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these music music musical in the middle </v>

115
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 2>of saying musicians musical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful La Pot,</v>

116
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.700
<v Speaker 2>that they were all a part of some CIA </v>
<v Speaker 2>plan to,</v>

117
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like the institute,</v>

118
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 2>the drug movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't even understand the plan,</v>

119
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is that all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>influential people came out of the,</v>

120
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:06.244
<v Speaker 2>this Laurel Canyon area and Jim </v>
<v Speaker 2>Morrison's dad was in the CIA and light </v>

121
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 2>take is like Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how much fucking,</v>

122
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 2>how busy CIA dads are?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're never around for their kid.</v>

123
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kid grows up to be Jim Morrison.</v>

124
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not that like the dad was there </v>
<v Speaker 2>influencing him with a fucking hypnosis,</v>

125
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.223
<v Speaker 2>one of those watches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are going to be the voice of a </v>

126
00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:29.550
<v Speaker 2>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

127
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 2>It's not no one engineer or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

128
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.070
<v Speaker 2>All things being equal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's best to look at the,</v>

129
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Speaker 2>the most simple answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

130
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.100
<v Speaker 2>but outcomes razor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

131
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.900
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

132
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.733
<v Speaker 2>I do think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like with a lot of those </v>

133
00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theorists like my take on it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like you,</v>

134
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 2>you have like the government who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like if the government was a</v>

135
00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be like,</v>

136
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:49.834
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got them on murdering these 50 </v>

137
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:51.874
<v Speaker 2>people and we have it cold hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They clearly did it and then you're </v>

138
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:54.761
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

139
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 2>but I heard a rumor that they also </v>
<v Speaker 2>murdered another people.</v>

140
00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

141
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>can we just focus on what we know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it right.</v>

142
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Like we're slaughtering people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle East.</v>

143
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:02.774
<v Speaker 1>We don't need a makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this other nonsense just to make it </v>

144
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>more sellable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

145
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that we're being controlled.</v>

146
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the overlying theme I guess,</v>

147
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>or the over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

148
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.943
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at like all of the </v>

149
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:20.654
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether their chem trails or whether </v>

150
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>it's all about like engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like global warming.</v>

151
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:28.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like Geo Engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all this,</v>

152
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.113
<v Speaker 1>it's all about engineering friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about people that are worried </v>

153
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 1>about eugenics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want,</v>

154
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>like Alex Jones says they want to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

155
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.400
<v Speaker 1>They want to leave 500 million people </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldwide or something like that,</v>

156
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>like this fucking number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

157
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:42.591
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

158
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:43.221
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

159
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 1>I think going to be a mortal like did </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what the fuck they're doing?</v>

160
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>

161
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>you really think that this is a plan.</v>

162
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Kill everyone except half a million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

163
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I do think there's some really shady </v>
<v Speaker 1>plans that are up there at the top.</v>

164
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I think what they get wrong sometimes is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that,</v>

165
00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:58.184
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everything that's happening was </v>

166
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:00.044
<v Speaker 1>actually controlled from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's plans that people in it </v>

167
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.163
<v Speaker 1>like to build a bear group is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That exists and I think they do want to </v>

168
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:10.610
<v Speaker 1>control the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think more often than not,</v>

169
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 1>they have like 10 things they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

170
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Some of them work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them don't.</v>

171
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.993
<v Speaker 1>Then they roll with the punches on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they try to change things from </v>

172
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:20.024
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as perfect as like everything </v>

173
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 1>they did worked out perfectly and was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

174
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a little easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more,</v>

175
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.790
<v Speaker 1>it's more of a fun story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're just an ultimate control,</v>

176
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 1>well then the have that number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 500 million number,</v>

177
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.650
<v Speaker 1>like why is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that number?</v>

178
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.110
<v Speaker 1>It's specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I heard.</v>

179
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 1>500 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

180
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.833
<v Speaker 1>Wonder if I'd make the cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still thinking about all the </v>

181
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:46.160
<v Speaker 1>billions of people and it could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 million's not that much.</v>

182
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:46.994
<v Speaker 1>If you think about 7 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're probably going to come off </v>

183
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.163
<v Speaker 1>Indians and Oliver's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to think whether you could </v>

184
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:52.184
<v Speaker 1>make the cut and my top 500 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're going to leave 500 million </v>

185
00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 1>people and the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this room,</v>

186
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:58.850
<v Speaker 1>there's some wiggle room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

187
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.860
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need like 60 comedians.</v>

188
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Did you want to get in though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

189
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:03.860
<v Speaker 1>what are they going to do with all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies?</v>

190
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 1>What are I going to do at six and a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion of bodies?</v>

191
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>How bad is the earth going to smell for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a month?</v>

192
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.521
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good point.</v>

194
00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I have these guys thought this through.</v>

195
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's hot the wall and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

196
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:17.830
<v Speaker 1>but what did you kill the wrong people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if the people that you kill,</v>

197
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 1>we're going to figure out a way to cure </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer or get us to Mars or you don't.</v>

198
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>You just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's why that whole,</v>

199
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:23.803
<v Speaker 1>that's why believing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a much more common belief out </v>

200
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>of the conspiracy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but believing that populations a problem</v>

201
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is crazy because like you said,</v>

202
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:31.630
<v Speaker 1>you never know when that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

203
00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:33.770
<v Speaker 1>they'll like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentalist.</v>

204
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:34.461
<v Speaker 1>There'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

205
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 1>if we have too many people and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>two big carbon footprint,</v>

206
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.031
<v Speaker 1>if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

207
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:41.690
<v Speaker 1>except until we have the one person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures out how to save all of us.</v>

208
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that got,</v>

209
00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:44.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a bunch of people to get that.</v>

210
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:47.070
<v Speaker 1>You don't get that in a village with log</v>
<v Speaker 1>cabins.</v>

211
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.913
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't figure out how to fix the </v>

212
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:49.394
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't heed millions of people </v>

213
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:53.390
<v Speaker 1>that need to live in cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Food needs to be delivered to them.</v>

214
00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>They need to be safe and then they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with ideas.</v>

215
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:59.400
<v Speaker 1>This thing is a game of numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You to have mad,</v>

216
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>mad numbers man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to throw a lot.</v>

217
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.353
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did want to address what you asked </v>

218
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>La Pod is powerful.</v>

219
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Powerful what you said before when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about this stuff with the</v>

220
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Clinton uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tape and you said,</v>

221
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:10.220
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

222
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 1>why is it that people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to find the information.</v>

223
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I think there is some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

224
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Because say if they made this a story on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news,</v>

225
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>like if every day they were playing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>

226
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.253
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing the power that media has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose what story we're going to make </v>

227
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 1>the story and what story will maybe get </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned here and then fallen,</v>

228
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fade into obscurity so they could,</v>

229
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.700
<v Speaker 1>the media could make that a story that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has to deal with.</v>

230
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:40.510
<v Speaker 1>But I've found there's a lot of denial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I talk to liberals or,</v>

231
00:09:40.511 --> 00:09:44.550
<v Speaker 1>or Hillary supporters and I'll bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff up and there's a lot of like,</v>

232
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well whatever.</v>

233
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well whatever.</v>

234
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:49.314
<v Speaker 1>But the same people who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in a rape culture and we'll go </v>

235
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>after like tosh for making a joke in bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>taste.</v>

236
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.873
<v Speaker 1>And then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here's this woman laughing about </v>

237
00:09:57.751 --> 00:09:58.584
<v Speaker 1>getting a child rapist off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget some abstract contributing to </v>

238
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 1>rape culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contributing to rape culture,</v>

239
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:04.914
<v Speaker 1>getting a rapist who would've gone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail back out into the streets and </v>

240
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:08.454
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>

241
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.293
<v Speaker 1>to me a mix of the media doesn't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>their job and then people are also kind </v>

242
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:15.360
<v Speaker 1>of in denial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well people are intensely tribal,</v>

243
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.090
<v Speaker 1>intensely tribal and their support for </v>
<v Speaker 1>brands,</v>

244
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about political parties,</v>

245
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:23.760
<v Speaker 1>political parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes the most tribal,</v>

246
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean I follow people that all they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is mock liberals online and then I fall.</v>

247
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.773
<v Speaker 1>Other people we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they do is mock conservatives and </v>

248
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.410
<v Speaker 1>God they're so similar or the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking people.</v>

249
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.820
<v Speaker 1>There's atheism and then there's these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are super religious.</v>

250
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.550
<v Speaker 1>There's all this God Christian stuff on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right.</v>

251
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.310
<v Speaker 1>And then on the left it's like atheism </v>
<v Speaker 1>is their God.</v>

252
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.930
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean it in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God is like,</v>

253
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:50.040
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an actual religion.</v>

254
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:50.874
<v Speaker 1>Their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you almost kind of have to be in </v>

255
00:10:53.281 --> 00:10:54.114
<v Speaker 1>that group to be on that side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this weird thing that's going on </v>

256
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.110
<v Speaker 1>where you've got people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribing to atheism.</v>

257
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with atheism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what I'm saying.</v>

258
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.103
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying God is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so universal on the left that it </v>

259
00:11:06.901 --> 00:11:10.560
<v Speaker 1>seems to me to be a trait that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>attribute with this tribe.</v>

260
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Like almost like you have to accept this</v>
<v Speaker 1>trait.</v>

261
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I think,</v>

262
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.593
<v Speaker 1>and I guess that's maybe a criticism I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have of a like Sam Harris and that's </v>

263
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.703
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you had him on your show </v>

264
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:20.784
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot of those guys who got </v>

265
00:11:22.051 --> 00:11:22.884
<v Speaker 1>themselves in this camp of we're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheists or the ones committed to </v>

266
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:27.690
<v Speaker 1>rational thought and religion is </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

267
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.060
<v Speaker 1>And now if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll look at things like,</v>

268
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:30.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

269
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.490
<v Speaker 1>the wars in the Middle East and it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like,</v>

270
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.353
<v Speaker 1>to me it seems like they have a tendency</v>
<v Speaker 1>to always try to blame the religiously </v>

271
00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:37.434
<v Speaker 1>motivated violence because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've kind of got themselves on like </v>

272
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 1>team anti-religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're on team atheist,</v>

273
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.620
<v Speaker 1>so the Muslims have to be worse than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American military because they're,</v>

274
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:47.454
<v Speaker 1>the religious ones were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated and advanced and </v>

275
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.753
<v Speaker 1>everything about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s military is built on like </v>

276
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 1>science and reason and thought.</v>

277
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.263
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are crazy Muslims who are just </v>

278
00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:58.780
<v Speaker 2>maniacs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have to blame them.</v>

279
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Even though if you look at the numbers </v>
<v Speaker 2>of dead,</v>

280
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty staggeringly one side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're murdering them.</v>

281
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're also in where they live.</v>

282
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 2>So that has to be taken into account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we had to get there,</v>

283
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 2>we had to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>

284
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.020
<v Speaker 2>but let's just look at the actual facts </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's not cassie judge.</v>

285
00:12:16.021 --> 00:12:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are where they live.</v>

286
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't speak their language.</v>

287
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.200
<v Speaker 2>We come in and mass and we kill a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>load.</v>

288
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:24.034
<v Speaker 2>More people than they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the a good percentage of the people </v>

289
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:28.870
<v Speaker 2>that are in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian,</v>

290
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very decent size.</v>

291
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>

292
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:32.933
<v Speaker 2>a very big percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a very big percentage of like </v>

293
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.510
<v Speaker 2>the hardcore supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people like who are really hardcore,</v>

294
00:12:38.511 --> 00:12:41.200
<v Speaker 2>the evangelical base that voted for </v>
<v Speaker 2>George W.</v>

295
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Bush.</v>

296
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.213
<v Speaker 2>A big part of that support is this goofy</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious belief that we need to be pro </v>

297
00:12:46.991 --> 00:12:47.824
<v Speaker 2>Israel because the Jews need to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel and that's what then Jesus can </v>

298
00:12:51.131 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 2>come back for us and if some Muslims got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get slaughtered in the process,</v>

299
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.970
<v Speaker 2>well this is how it's supposed to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we got to protect that.</v>

300
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.310
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that weird shit on our </v>
<v Speaker 2>side as well.</v>

301
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.620
<v Speaker 2>A lot of weird old southern money that </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes into that.</v>

302
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a great vice piece on those </v>

303
00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:07.600
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a great vice piece where they,</v>

304
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

305
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.170
<v Speaker 2>vice has someone in those online shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are awesome.</v>

306
00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:12.004
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to know which one it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they went with these people to </v>

307
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:16.744
<v Speaker 2>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these crazy evangelicals who are going </v>

308
00:13:18.191 --> 00:13:20.260
<v Speaker 2>back to the motherland and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

309
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:22.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where Jesus is going to camp.</v>

310
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.403
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where we're going to set up his </v>

311
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:27.340
<v Speaker 2>fire here and he'll pull his trailer in </v>
<v Speaker 2>right here like they had,</v>

312
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.203
<v Speaker 2>it was almost like that and his head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he was setting up to Budweiser's </v>

313
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.760
<v Speaker 2>one from me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one for Jesus when he gets here.</v>

314
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

315
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.730
<v Speaker 2>But you if you're on the right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even Gavin McInnes who I love,</v>

316
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.690
<v Speaker 2>I love Gavin Love Gavin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gavin's a bright,</v>

317
00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:46.750
<v Speaker 2>bright guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also a Catholic and he became a</v>

318
00:13:46.751 --> 00:13:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Catholic like late in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

319
00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you,</v>

320
00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:51.244
<v Speaker 2>what is this like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like you have to be a part </v>

321
00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:57.070
<v Speaker 2>of something that's religious to get in </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the right side.</v>

322
00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.270
<v Speaker 2>Like a Glenn Beck became a Mormon when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like 50 like,</v>

323
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

324
00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:03.244
<v Speaker 2>Did you even read it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you read any of the history about </v>

325
00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Smith being 14 when he made all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit up?</v>

326
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.633
<v Speaker 2>Magic seer stone that he had to use to </v>
<v Speaker 2>read the golden tablets that contained </v>

327
00:14:13.011 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 2>the loss work of Jesus that only he </v>
<v Speaker 2>could read with this rock.</v>

328
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:17.403
<v Speaker 2>I'm torn between whether I hate </v>
<v Speaker 2>mormonism for that or I love them for </v>

329
00:14:19.871 --> 00:14:20.410
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

330
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:21.610
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to bullshit,</v>

331
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.470
<v Speaker 2>let's just go bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

332
00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:24.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

333
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.810
<v Speaker 2>he lives in Kansas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

334
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.580
<v Speaker 2>He was friends with my grandpa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

335
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.443
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American Indians were actually from </v>

336
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was another one of his,</v>

337
00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:33.700
<v Speaker 2>that this guy spent a ton of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

338
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:34.563
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking with when Sam was here </v>

339
00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:36.604
<v Speaker 2>the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about how 15 years ago </v>

340
00:14:38.141 --> 00:14:40.690
<v Speaker 2>it was like billions of dollars to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your genome map.</v>

341
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like a couple thousand bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we were talking about how crazy that</v>

342
00:14:44.171 --> 00:14:46.120
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what would an insane leap,</v>

343
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few years back,</v>

344
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.170
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before it became that cheap,</v>

345
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 2>some dudes spent a fuck ton of money.</v>

346
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.380
<v Speaker 2>It was a mormon to try to prove that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morman scriptures were in fact correct.</v>

347
00:14:57.381 --> 00:14:58.214
<v Speaker 2>And the American Indians did come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we learned from that actually it's </v>

348
00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.010
<v Speaker 2>actually want up being good for science </v>
<v Speaker 2>because these guys spent so much money,</v>

349
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.210
<v Speaker 2>we realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

350
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.163
<v Speaker 2>they actually came from Siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So reinforces the idea of them crossing </v>

351
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:09.584
<v Speaker 2>the landmass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bering strait and coming into </v>

352
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.140
<v Speaker 2>America from Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they are Siberian like it's,</v>

353
00:15:14.141 --> 00:15:15.970
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting like the,</v>

354
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.470
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the merge or the,</v>

355
00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:19.304
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movement and migration of people </v>

356
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 2>from Asia to North America and down into</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>

357
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:27.290
<v Speaker 2>And if it's really fucking cool when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>find out that it's not that long ago,</v>

358
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few thousand years,</v>

359
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the most 20,</v>

360
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was like during the ice age.</v>

361
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not that long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

362
00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:34.791
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

363
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:35.624
<v Speaker 2>A history is a weird thing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even when we talk about thing and </v>

364
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like World War II,</v>

365
00:15:38.511 --> 00:15:40.040
<v Speaker 2>World War Two was like that long ago.</v>

366
00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Like your grandfather was there and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

367
00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:43.910
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just happened.</v>

368
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Just happened historically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have Vietnam and how about Vietnam?</v>

369
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.673
<v Speaker 2>There's one that this conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories can really grab a hold of the </v>

370
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.951
<v Speaker 2>Gulf of Tonkin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

371
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Wah.</v>

372
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.323
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's my point when before it's </v>

373
00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:54.734
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we even wasting our time with </v>

374
00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:55.964
<v Speaker 2>anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

375
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Let's grab that one and hold on to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

376
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.520
<v Speaker 2>That was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that was bullshit.</v>

377
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Tens of thousands of Americans died in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that war,</v>

378
00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:06.940
<v Speaker 2>let alone how many Vietnamese we just </v>
<v Speaker 2>slot.</v>

379
00:16:06.941 --> 00:16:07.774
<v Speaker 2>It was just like mass slaughter that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people made billions off of that was </v>

380
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.950
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>

381
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need anymore.</v>

382
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.760
<v Speaker 2>We flag attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

383
00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Look it up folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're listening to this going</v>

384
00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:20.384
<v Speaker 2>what you sitting on your porch and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Georgia with your lemonade hating black </v>

385
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:27.440
<v Speaker 2>people just go online and it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

386
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.380
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to sit on their porch </v>
<v Speaker 2>with lemonade and hate black people.</v>

387
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.340
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

388
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.970
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really do read that story,</v>

389
00:16:34.971 --> 00:16:36.290
<v Speaker 2>it's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you realize,</v>

390
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.340
<v Speaker 2>oh well this was deception was the rule </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the land at that time.</v>

391
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.680
<v Speaker 2>This was when they had the operation </v>
<v Speaker 2>northwoods,</v>

392
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that had been passed.</v>

393
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:47.330
<v Speaker 2>And if you haven't seen that document,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

394
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.583
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was signed by the Joint Chiefs of </v>

395
00:16:49.701 --> 00:16:50.534
<v Speaker 2>staff and then vetoed by Kennedy where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were going to attack American </v>

396
00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:55.220
<v Speaker 2>civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were going to bomb,</v>

397
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.233
<v Speaker 2>they were going to bomb Guantanamo Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were going to arm Cuban friendlies </v>

398
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.820
<v Speaker 2>and they were going to give them weapons</v>
<v Speaker 2>to attack Guantanamo Bay.</v>

399
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.300
<v Speaker 2>They were going to blow a drone jetliner</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the sky,</v>

400
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.440
<v Speaker 2>blame it on Castro and wind up killing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ton of people.</v>

401
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:14.470
<v Speaker 2>And they were doing it all just to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>support of this idea of attacking Cuba.</v>

402
00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.390
<v Speaker 2>So they were going to pretend that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people died,</v>

403
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

404
00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:18.920
<v Speaker 2>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

405
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.731
<v Speaker 2>we're going to add,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

406
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:22.500
<v Speaker 2>how could they take off in a plane that </v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

407
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure where the drone technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>was that,</v>

408
00:17:24.771 --> 00:17:26.060
<v Speaker 2>but this was the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

409
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:28.520
<v Speaker 2>it was a plan that I think Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself had to,</v>

410
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.550
<v Speaker 2>had to veto but not sign off on it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

411
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

412
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.150
<v Speaker 2>they took care of him quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allegedly.</v>

413
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.160
<v Speaker 2>That's the other conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

414
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:38.773
<v Speaker 2>Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to me to be even a dumber </v>

415
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:41.623
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there was a bunch of people </v>

416
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:43.454
<v Speaker 2>involved killing that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't agree with you more on that </v>

417
00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:45.701
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

418
00:17:45.701 --> 00:17:46.534
<v Speaker 2>it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the north would think it's just a </v>

419
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:49.260
<v Speaker 2>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

420
00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 2>glimpse into</v>

421
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.710
<v Speaker 1>the mindset of the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are on the inside,</v>

422
00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:56.190
<v Speaker 1>who really do view the world as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as pawns on a chess board.</v>

423
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.360
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

424
00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.243
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a lie is what it took to get the </v>

425
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:03.930
<v Speaker 1>geopolitical result that they wanted and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Americans had to die or whatever,</v>

426
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.490
<v Speaker 1>that's not a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

427
00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.710
<v Speaker 1>and I think people should be aware of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

428
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Like anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times,</v>

429
00:18:09.161 --> 00:18:11.340
<v Speaker 1>like you were talking about getting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the team mentality,</v>

430
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.350
<v Speaker 1>people kind of have this team mentality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

431
00:18:13.351 --> 00:18:14.184
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

432
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone's willing to just slaughter </v>

433
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:19.110
<v Speaker 1>people in a third world country to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>their buddies rich,</v>

434
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I'd be careful with them around your </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids too.</v>

435
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:22.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>

436
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.440
<v Speaker 1>they're probably looking at everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>like their pawns on a board,</v>

437
00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:26.820
<v Speaker 1>not just those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

438
00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I think people learn really quickly how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to disassociate.</v>

439
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.273
<v Speaker 1>They learn how to not think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're using like drone </v>

440
00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:35.694
<v Speaker 1>technology and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're flying a robot and shooting </v>

441
00:18:38.191 --> 00:18:40.830
<v Speaker 1>missiles out of a robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're watching it all on a screen.</v>

442
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.010
<v Speaker 1>How easy is it to distance yourself from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you're the person,</v>

443
00:18:44.011 --> 00:18:47.100
<v Speaker 1>not even he's pushing the button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who gave the order to give the,</v>

444
00:18:47.101 --> 00:18:48.360
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

445
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:49.194
<v Speaker 1>and when I talked to Ed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Baker on here was a former CIA </v>

446
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:52.254
<v Speaker 1>operative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been on a few Fox News shows with </v>

447
00:18:53.281 --> 00:18:54.114
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told me all that stuff is done by </v>

448
00:18:54.991 --> 00:18:56.700
<v Speaker 1>lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all decided like,</v>

449
00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:58.150
<v Speaker 1>can we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we do this?</v>

450
00:18:58.151 --> 00:18:58.984
<v Speaker 1>And the lawyer sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hash it out and they give him the </v>

451
00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:01.440
<v Speaker 1>green light or the red light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

452
00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is fucking dark when you're leaving</v>

453
00:19:05.881 --> 00:19:06.714
<v Speaker 1>military matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whether or not you attack with a </v>

454
00:19:08.701 --> 00:19:09.534
<v Speaker 1>flying robot to lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguably the most heartless creatures </v>

455
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I've ever created in our capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

456
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Well that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

457
00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:19.600
<v Speaker 1>that's who's running government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all lawyers do it.</v>

458
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.473
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that Obama is what Michelle Obama </v>

459
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:23.070
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Bill Clinton was,</v>

460
00:19:23.071 --> 00:19:24.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they all are.</v>

461
00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:26.490
<v Speaker 1>They're all lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great lawyers.</v>

462
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.200
<v Speaker 1>There's awesome people out there that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are lawyers.</v>

463
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.063
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even if you're an awesome person </v>

464
00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:33.240
<v Speaker 1>that's a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking know some psychos.</v>

465
00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:34.074
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the awesome person who was a lawyer is </v>

466
00:19:35.221 --> 00:19:36.180
<v Speaker 1>the most adamant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

467
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:38.760
<v Speaker 1>do not put lawyers in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do your job.</v>

468
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:39.421
<v Speaker 1>Do you not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

469
00:19:39.421 --> 00:19:40.231
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comedian.</v>

470
00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:41.064
<v Speaker 1>But if you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should comedians being charged or it'd </v>

471
00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:43.140
<v Speaker 1>be like Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

472
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.330
<v Speaker 1>we won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We won't make it through this podcast.</v>

473
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't be in charge of anything.</v>

474
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Even comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't be in charge.</v>

475
00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly right.</v>

476
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Cause then you get like these salt </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooms,</v>

477
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.540
<v Speaker 1>they get mad at you if you talk loud.</v>

478
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.180
<v Speaker 1>But like when people are in charge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything they fuck.</v>

479
00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

480
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.450
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about the drone wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

481
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.750
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is brilliant historian,</v>

482
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Tom Woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've heard of him,</v>

483
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.560
<v Speaker 1>but he's got a great podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's incredible.</v>

484
00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:11.760
<v Speaker 1>This guy like I to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe like the smartest libertarian</v>

485
00:20:11.761 --> 00:20:13.440
<v Speaker 1>voice out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's his podcast called?</v>

486
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.630
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Tom Woods show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

487
00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:16.590
<v Speaker 1>You should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would love him.</v>

488
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I think he would be great on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he had a podcast.</v>

489
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.810
<v Speaker 1>He's got a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just a brilliant historian.</v>

490
00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 1>He nails all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he uses this analogy and I love it.</v>

491
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just goes through,</v>

492
00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:29.700
<v Speaker 1>imagine we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used the drone campaign,</v>

493
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.250
<v Speaker 1>like imagine we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fought crime that way.</v>

494
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:32.941
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

495
00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:34.500
<v Speaker 1>imagine there'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone was like a,</v>

496
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.010
<v Speaker 1>so we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

497
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:41.330
<v Speaker 1>to suspected criminals at a wedding in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

498
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California somewhere.</v>

499
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:44.743
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the plan is we're going to bomb the </v>

500
00:20:46.381 --> 00:20:47.214
<v Speaker 1>wedding.</v>

501
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Everybody just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

502
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 2>that's not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that because there's,</v>

503
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.250
<v Speaker 2>there's innocent human life there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But literally we,</v>

504
00:20:57.251 --> 00:20:59.800
<v Speaker 2>that's just how we conduct the war in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East.</v>

505
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they don't,</v>

506
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of disingenuous because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know it's a wedding.</v>

507
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.050
<v Speaker 2>They just see a group of people gathered</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they know that the dickheads in</v>

508
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:10.840
<v Speaker 2>there and they want to blow them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it turns out to be a wedding.</v>

509
00:21:10.841 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 2>And we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>

510
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:13.893
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So still the analogy say that's how we </v>

511
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:17.621
<v Speaker 2>fought crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

512
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:21.160
<v Speaker 2>But we just followed the metadata on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your cell phones and wherever you happen</v>

513
00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:23.170
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to blow that place up.</v>

514
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:24.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's important to point out </v>

515
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:26.014
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they're shooting at phones and </v>

516
00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.890
<v Speaker 2>then they don't even have a visual id on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person.</v>

517
00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.140
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find where the phone is.</v>

518
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.093
<v Speaker 2>They do the find my iphone feature with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the eye in the sky and then they launch </v>

519
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.370
<v Speaker 2>aptly named Hellfire missile at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's dark too,</v>

520
00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.250
<v Speaker 2>that they have cool nicknames for their </v>
<v Speaker 2>missiles.</v>

521
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Hell fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>

522
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.700
<v Speaker 2>They do all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

523
00:21:47.701 --> 00:21:50.200
<v Speaker 2>although like you're saying like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>operation names,</v>

524
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.030
<v Speaker 2>operation kick ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

525
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just fucking 18 year olds blast and</v>

526
00:21:58.481 --> 00:22:02.500
<v Speaker 2>ACDC rolling through some time in town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Jesus.</v>

527
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:03.343
<v Speaker 2>Well have you ever seen those pieces </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they've done on those kids that </v>

528
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:08.590
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were involved in operating those tanks?</v>

529
00:22:08.591 --> 00:22:10.690
<v Speaker 2>It would listen to metal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

530
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:11.703
<v Speaker 2>that's bizarre too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're letting these kids get jacked up </v>

531
00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:17.080
<v Speaker 2>on metal and who knows what else you let</v>
<v Speaker 2>them have.</v>

532
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.580
<v Speaker 2>They probably let them have </v>
<v Speaker 2>amphetamines.</v>

533
00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:22.120
<v Speaker 2>They definitely let them have steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give steroids to soldiers.</v>

534
00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.880
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's common shit man.</v>

535
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.530
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason they prefer an 18 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old to a 30 year old.</v>

536
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:27.843
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason they prefer someone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>is still just as good fighting shape or </v>

537
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:30.610
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

538
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:33.120
<v Speaker 2>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when you're 18 you're,</v>

539
00:22:33.121 --> 00:22:35.680
<v Speaker 2>you're in a different place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your levels are at a different place and</v>

540
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:38.050
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your willingness to follow orders,</v>

541
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.910
<v Speaker 2>I think as a mother is in a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

542
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.540
<v Speaker 2>We're all essentially like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

543
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.940
<v Speaker 2>older people being wiser if they've had </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough experiences.</v>

544
00:22:45.941 --> 00:22:46.774
<v Speaker 2>But we're all gathering experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering experiences and then </v>

545
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.520
<v Speaker 2>calculating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out,</v>

546
00:22:50.521 --> 00:22:51.430
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did that go wrong?</v>

547
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Well what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh here's that fucking thing again.</v>

548
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh here's this thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see how it goes.</v>

549
00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:56.893
<v Speaker 2>And that's why as people get older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get less and less tolerant of </v>

550
00:22:58.661 --> 00:23:01.270
<v Speaker 2>certain things because they see these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things over and over and over again.</v>

551
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.660
<v Speaker 2>And they recognize these patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get more confident in your assertion</v>

552
00:23:04.661 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 2>of that pattern cause you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this bullshit six times now.</v>

553
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.270
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it works that way with politics too.</v>

554
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.113
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the common expression about </v>

555
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:12.400
<v Speaker 2>radicals in college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

556
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:13.234
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>show me a young man who's not a liberal </v>

557
00:23:14.621 --> 00:23:15.454
<v Speaker 2>and I'll show you a man without a heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show me an old man is on a conservative </v>

558
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.510
<v Speaker 2>and I'll show you a man without a brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

559
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Because after to why you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

560
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.530
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

561
00:23:23.531 --> 00:23:25.420
<v Speaker 2>and it's not black and white when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to that issue,</v>

562
00:23:25.421 --> 00:23:28.900
<v Speaker 2>but when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with something that,</v>

563
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a human being that gathers up this data.</v>

564
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.870
<v Speaker 2>When you were 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you got?</v>

565
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:37.870
<v Speaker 2>A couple of fucking birthday parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember the first time you get your</v>

566
00:23:37.871 --> 00:23:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Dick sucked was only six months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

567
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.050
<v Speaker 2>what do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

568
00:23:41.051 --> 00:23:42.550
<v Speaker 2>what do you have to base on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

569
00:23:42.551 --> 00:23:43.570
<v Speaker 2>what do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Movies.</v>

570
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 2>You watch a lot of movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably what they're basing</v>

571
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.843
<v Speaker 1>it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they think their life's going to </v>

572
00:23:47.511 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some fucking Tom Hanks movie,</v>

573
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 1>they'll come back and cry to their kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're younger,</v>

574
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.330
<v Speaker 1>when they're older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather about the,</v>

575
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:54.164
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I served in the war of serving my </v>

576
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:56.330
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did my country proud.</v>

577
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Now you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might go home with no legs.</v>

578
00:23:58.581 --> 00:24:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Like you're in a crazy situation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're killing people.</v>

579
00:24:01.401 --> 00:24:02.234
<v Speaker 1>You don't know because someone you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know told you you're supposed to kill </v>

580
00:24:04.701 --> 00:24:06.620
<v Speaker 1>people you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of them figure it out.</v>

581
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:07.483
<v Speaker 1>It's just they figured out when they see</v>
<v Speaker 1>that real shit that you're talking </v>

582
00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:09.861
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>

583
00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:11.480
<v Speaker 1>there is also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing that's very,</v>

584
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:13.320
<v Speaker 1>very downplayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

585
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:14.183
<v Speaker 1>that should have been maybe the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>story in at least one of the biggest </v>

586
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:17.864
<v Speaker 1>stories in the last 10 years is that Ron</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul in 2000 in the 2008 run and in the </v>

587
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:25.640
<v Speaker 1>2012 Ryan both runs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got more money,</v>

588
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:29.900
<v Speaker 1>more donations from active duty military</v>
<v Speaker 1>people than all of the other candidates.</v>

589
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:30.853
<v Speaker 1>He got more than the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the Republican candidates combined </v>

590
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:37.250
<v Speaker 1>in 2012 and he got he outraised uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama both times.</v>

591
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's like there's actually a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in this military,</v>

592
00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.383
<v Speaker 1>in the military who see through this </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and we're very happy to have </v>

593
00:24:44.571 --> 00:24:45.404
<v Speaker 1>like the only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Ron Paul to me is like the only </v>

594
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:49.543
<v Speaker 1>politician on a presidential level in </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent memory who has been </v>

595
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:52.693
<v Speaker 1>unapologetically antiwar and not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just like this hasn't worked like </v>

596
00:24:56.271 --> 00:24:58.970
<v Speaker 1>this is bullshit racket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we started it.</v>

597
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

598
00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:03.560
<v Speaker 1>When you get that many active military </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your side,</v>

599
00:25:03.561 --> 00:25:04.730
<v Speaker 1>you really have to really think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

600
00:25:04.731 --> 00:25:06.500
<v Speaker 1>these are the people that are dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this issue.</v>

601
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It affects their families,</v>

602
00:25:09.231 --> 00:25:10.730
<v Speaker 1>it affects their friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their loved ones,</v>

603
00:25:10.731 --> 00:25:11.564
<v Speaker 1>all the people they serve with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is it's so hard to </v>

604
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:19.520
<v Speaker 1>believe that they've been able to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>this going for so long and this war with</v>

605
00:25:19.521 --> 00:25:23.060
<v Speaker 1>no end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this war against terrorism is one of the</v>

606
00:25:23.061 --> 00:25:27.050
<v Speaker 1>most devious things because whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not terrorism exists,</v>

607
00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:27.770
<v Speaker 1>it certainly does.</v>

608
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not we have to combat </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism,</v>

609
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:30.404
<v Speaker 1>we certainly do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not we have to take measures </v>

610
00:25:31.881 --> 00:25:35.090
<v Speaker 1>to ensure the safety of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We definitely do 100%,</v>

611
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:35.953
<v Speaker 1>but there's something really suspicious </v>
<v Speaker 1>about an unnamed enemy or an unseen and </v>

612
00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Miller and an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just terrorism.</v>

613
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:44.743
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like herpes just floating through </v>

614
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.010
<v Speaker 1>all these parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't even have a,</v>

615
00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:49.893
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even a country with a leader </v>

616
00:25:50.811 --> 00:25:52.940
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now it's just terrorism.</v>

617
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works out pretty great if you're like</v>

618
00:25:54.801 --> 00:25:56.890
<v Speaker 1>a weapons company that's making more </v>
<v Speaker 1>money than ever,</v>

619
00:25:56.891 --> 00:25:57.724
<v Speaker 1>or if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want it to keep this military </v>

620
00:25:58.851 --> 00:25:59.571
<v Speaker 1>budget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

621
00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

622
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.161
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

623
00:26:01.161 --> 00:26:04.700
<v Speaker 1>people were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liberals were all outraged over George</v>

624
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.790
<v Speaker 1>W Bush's military budgets and Obama </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatly expanded those.</v>

625
00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:09.230
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

626
00:26:09.231 --> 00:26:10.064
<v Speaker 1>if you're making tons of money off it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works out great to have kind of this </v>

627
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:14.210
<v Speaker 1>vague concept that we're fighting a war </v>
<v Speaker 1>against.</v>

628
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.910
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

629
00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think terrorism,</v>

630
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.130
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

631
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.860
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think terrorism,</v>

632
00:26:18.861 --> 00:26:21.230
<v Speaker 1>as Pat Buchanan said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the price of empire.</v>

633
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.333
<v Speaker 1>And it kind of always has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what we're going to be </v>

634
00:26:24.561 --> 00:26:27.170
<v Speaker 1>dealing with as long as we want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>an empire in the Middle East.</v>

635
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now it's not,</v>

636
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:29.203
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a one particular enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this vague threat of attacks by </v>

637
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.173
<v Speaker 1>irrational people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you see them scattered </v>

638
00:26:36.951 --> 00:26:37.784
<v Speaker 1>throughout the world and other places </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they don't have the kind of </v>

639
00:26:38.901 --> 00:26:40.140
<v Speaker 1>security that we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

640
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:43.010
<v Speaker 1>So it reinforces idea or idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>TSA is,</v>

641
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.470
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to get through that line </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you gotta be nice to these people.</v>

642
00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:49.220
<v Speaker 1>And though they failed on like 95%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that test?</v>

643
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.230
<v Speaker 1>They felt 95% of the like fake knives </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bombs.</v>

644
00:26:52.231 --> 00:26:53.580
<v Speaker 1>These are all getting it and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

645
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.260
<v Speaker 1>they're just feeling up old people.</v>

646
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They felt me up the other day.</v>

647
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Did they need to check my dick happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me at the back of his hand.</v>

648
00:27:00.991 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 1>He had to go up to both sides of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

649
00:27:02.611 --> 00:27:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Did it give you the nice ex ex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

650
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:05.850
<v Speaker 1>explanation about how he's going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

651
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:07.370
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going to feel what the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our hand,</v>

652
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.810
<v Speaker 1>the guy who did it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like I said earlier,</v>

653
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:11.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm no conspiracy theorist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they're like,</v>

654
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.580
<v Speaker 1>you've been randomly selected for </v>
<v Speaker 1>additional screening and inside,</v>

655
00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that last podcast?</v>

656
00:27:15.901 --> 00:27:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit something.</v>

657
00:27:17.011 --> 00:27:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may stuff which,</v>

658
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.850
<v Speaker 1>you know what he said to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

659
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.043
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be,</v>

660
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.750
<v Speaker 1>that would be more uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he said before he did it,</v>

661
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the guy said it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he goes up if you want,</v>

662
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Speaker 1>we can bring into a private room for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

663
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did say that.</v>

664
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:34.600
<v Speaker 1>It was like two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do this right here.</v>

665
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Right now in a private room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>

666
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.263
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to play George Michael's </v>

667
00:27:40.671 --> 00:27:42.460
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

668
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:43.470
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

669
00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so convenient that they need to</v>

670
00:27:45.411 --> 00:27:47.640
<v Speaker 1>kind of security that the NSA was trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get,</v>

671
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.340
<v Speaker 1>or they're the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

672
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:51.683
<v Speaker 1>not security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm the kind of invasion of privacy </v>

673
00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:56.850
<v Speaker 1>that the NSA was doing with monitoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>your metadata,</v>

674
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:57.953
<v Speaker 1>the ability to check all your emails and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that what snowden exposed was </v>

675
00:28:02.281 --> 00:28:03.114
<v Speaker 1>kind of everybody's worst fear about all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff was that one day we're going </v>

676
00:28:05.341 --> 00:28:06.174
<v Speaker 1>to get to a point where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>recording everything and you're always </v>

677
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:13.200
<v Speaker 1>going to be scared to speak your mind in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the private and public with your friends</v>

678
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.700
<v Speaker 1>because you think they could always </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

679
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.900
<v Speaker 1>And if there's certain key things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say that upset them while they could</v>

680
00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:19.500
<v Speaker 1>just target you.</v>

681
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Like they were talking about people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the NSA,</v>

682
00:28:22.351 --> 00:28:26.280
<v Speaker 1>we're actively targeting their exes </v>
<v Speaker 1>email accounts.</v>

683
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And reading their exes emails.</v>

684
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:30.220
<v Speaker 1>What does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just,</v>

685
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.850
<v Speaker 1>of course it's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's human beings.</v>

686
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:35.670
<v Speaker 1>A buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine worked at a bank and he</v>

687
00:28:35.671 --> 00:28:38.310
<v Speaker 1>told me how they had a big problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like checking on celebrities,</v>

688
00:28:38.311 --> 00:28:39.870
<v Speaker 1>accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>checking on other people,</v>

689
00:28:39.871 --> 00:28:41.450
<v Speaker 1>other friends of theirs accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

690
00:28:41.451 --> 00:28:44.100
<v Speaker 1>it's human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think personally,</v>

691
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:44.934
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest thing that snowden </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed more so than any particular </v>

692
00:28:48.631 --> 00:28:52.290
<v Speaker 1>program was that he exposed that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy clapper said,</v>

693
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clapper was I think just six months </v>

694
00:28:54.811 --> 00:28:55.644
<v Speaker 1>a year before snowden released those </v>
<v Speaker 1>files through Glenn Greenwald at the </v>

695
00:28:58.741 --> 00:29:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Guardian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

696
00:29:00.331 --> 00:29:01.980
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before a congressional hearing goes,</v>

697
00:29:01.981 --> 00:29:02.814
<v Speaker 1>there is no bulk mass data collection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's amazing about what </v>

698
00:29:06.991 --> 00:29:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Snowden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

699
00:29:08.011 --> 00:29:08.844
<v Speaker 1>showed you that they will just </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that they will lie through </v>

700
00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:14.700
<v Speaker 1>their fucking teeth to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're liars,</v>

701
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.430
<v Speaker 1>they're not like misguided or they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what's happening.</v>

702
00:29:17.431 --> 00:29:18.090
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

703
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:18.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're telling you what they think you </v>

704
00:29:19.711 --> 00:29:22.230
<v Speaker 1>need to know so they can get away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their bullshit.</v>

705
00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.673
<v Speaker 1>And that to me is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very important thing for people to </v>

706
00:29:26.101 --> 00:29:26.851
<v Speaker 1>realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

707
00:29:26.851 --> 00:29:27.684
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real insidious problem with the US </v>

708
00:29:29.821 --> 00:29:32.400
<v Speaker 1>versus them idea is that they're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>people too.</v>

709
00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:33.443
<v Speaker 1>So you've people that are operating </v>
<v Speaker 1>these mass surveillance programs on </v>

710
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.020
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing like,</v>

711
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing essentially noble about</v>

712
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.600
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't passed any tasks.</v>

713
00:29:43.601 --> 00:29:44.434
<v Speaker 2>They haven't shown themselves to be some</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are devoid of jealousy and </v>

714
00:29:48.341 --> 00:29:49.174
<v Speaker 2>pettiness and clear thought always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're just the smartest people we </v>

715
00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:53.434
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we give them this position cause </v>

716
00:29:54.071 --> 00:29:55.990
<v Speaker 2>there's so they're like the knights of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the watch,</v>

717
00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:56.921
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

718
00:29:56.921 --> 00:29:58.830
<v Speaker 2>You just go otherwise overlords.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

719
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 2>We'll watch us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will walk.</v>

720
00:29:59.981 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 2>They protect us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was arguing with a,</v>

721
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:04.380
<v Speaker 2>what's his name or who you bro brought </v>
<v Speaker 2>up?</v>

722
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:05.131
<v Speaker 2>Baker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

723
00:30:05.131 --> 00:30:05.964
<v Speaker 2>I was on a panel with him on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a Fox News show and we were talking </v>

724
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:09.514
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the apple when apple versus FBI </v>

725
00:30:12.101 --> 00:30:13.480
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I guess is still going on.</v>

726
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.553
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was kind of siding with apple and </v>

727
00:30:15.641 --> 00:30:18.640
<v Speaker 2>he was siding with the FBI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember bigger said to me,</v>

728
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:19.331
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

729
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you worried?</v>

730
00:30:20.231 --> 00:30:21.064
<v Speaker 2>Are you worried they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>checking your emails or checking your </v>

731
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:23.980
<v Speaker 2>phone?</v>

732
00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that kind of attitude.</v>

733
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.673
<v Speaker 2>How was like the FBI was spying on civil</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights leaders being run by a cross </v>

734
00:30:31.231 --> 00:30:35.200
<v Speaker 2>dressing maniac like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust these people are going to,</v>

735
00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust those people anymore than </v>
<v Speaker 2>I trust any group of people.</v>

736
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.333
<v Speaker 2>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that they think that that </v>

737
00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:40.894
<v Speaker 2>organization has been cleaned up like </v>
<v Speaker 2>how much j Edgar Hoover and what they </v>

738
00:30:45.191 --> 00:30:47.770
<v Speaker 2>did during the bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's coming out now more.</v>

739
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.633
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting the stories that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are coming out now about how the war on </v>

740
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:51.694
<v Speaker 2>drugs was a big part of their plan to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to break down the civil rights </v>

741
00:30:55.601 --> 00:30:56.434
<v Speaker 2>movement and break down these anti war </v>
<v Speaker 2>protesters because this one thing they </v>

742
00:30:59.201 --> 00:31:00.910
<v Speaker 2>shared in common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were all doing drugs.</v>

743
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:01.781
<v Speaker 2>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

744
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:05.170
<v Speaker 2>this will just have a fucking crazy war </v>
<v Speaker 2>on drugs and we just go in and get these</v>

745
00:31:05.171 --> 00:31:06.410
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be smoking pile,</v>

746
00:31:06.411 --> 00:31:09.040
<v Speaker 2>which is arrest the shit out of them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just break up everything.</v>

747
00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.390
<v Speaker 2>And they really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

748
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.970
<v Speaker 2>it's brilliant in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy,</v>

749
00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:14.050
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to go after your </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemies.</v>

750
00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:15.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great way to do it.</v>

751
00:31:15.281 --> 00:31:20.240
<v Speaker 2>But we're still suffering the </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of Nixon's actions from Jad</v>

752
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.400
<v Speaker 2>or hoovers guidance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that that was all,</v>

753
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:25.030
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole pile that that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>operating under.</v>

754
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you get this whole,</v>

755
00:31:26.381 --> 00:31:27.214
<v Speaker 2>like it spawns this whole system of mass</v>
<v Speaker 2>incarceration and private prisons and </v>

756
00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.700
<v Speaker 2>this whole nightmare or hoover was </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome though.</v>

757
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:34.803
<v Speaker 2>You got to love with the bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's wearing a dress like cross </v>

758
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:40.630
<v Speaker 2>dressing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>banging dude's keeping secrets.</v>

759
00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Not only doing that today when it's cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing this at a time when like if</v>

760
00:31:44.771 --> 00:31:46.570
<v Speaker 2>it came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would be just,</v>

761
00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:47.404
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that was how he kept it all under </v>

762
00:31:49.451 --> 00:31:50.680
<v Speaker 2>wraps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

763
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:54.280
<v Speaker 2>the reason that guy was so into getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>into other people's Shit,</v>

764
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.740
<v Speaker 2>just cause he had so much shit to </v>
<v Speaker 2>expose.</v>

765
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.150
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I can't let this get out.</v>

766
00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.103
<v Speaker 2>I gotta be proactive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got to gather up data on </v>

767
00:32:01.271 --> 00:32:02.770
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Elvis.</v>

768
00:32:02.771 --> 00:32:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Jimmy page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

769
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.313
<v Speaker 2>But I just went after everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that there's something </v>

770
00:32:06.851 --> 00:32:10.030
<v Speaker 2>inherently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in the cross dressing,</v>

771
00:32:10.031 --> 00:32:10.864
<v Speaker 2>banging dudes scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to meet other people with </v>

772
00:32:13.091 --> 00:32:15.010
<v Speaker 2>dirt too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

773
00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.300
<v Speaker 2>you know the other guy who you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

774
00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:16.631
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

775
00:32:16.631 --> 00:32:18.160
<v Speaker 2>we both know where in that scene </v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

776
00:32:18.161 --> 00:32:20.110
<v Speaker 2>so you keep your mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true too.</v>

777
00:32:20.111 --> 00:32:20.944
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of those things where people </v>

778
00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:23.160
<v Speaker 2>always say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

779
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.180
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

780
00:32:24.181 --> 00:32:25.014
<v Speaker 2>are with a partner and that partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden it starts getting like </v>

781
00:32:26.891 --> 00:32:28.480
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>irrationally jealous.</v>

782
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.310
<v Speaker 2>It's probably because they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something sneaky.</v>

783
00:32:30.311 --> 00:32:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

784
00:32:31.211 --> 00:32:34.170
<v Speaker 2>and what he was doing was sort of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was jagger,</v>

785
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.720
<v Speaker 2>hoover was a fucking maniac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was in charge of the FBI.</v>

786
00:32:37.721 --> 00:32:39.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just a bonafide,</v>

787
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.520
<v Speaker 2>insane person.</v>

788
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.380
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like you said,</v>

789
00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:44.120
<v Speaker 1>it's like who's to say they're cleaned </v>
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>

790
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.073
<v Speaker 1>I think we always have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this like idea that we get comfortable </v>

791
00:32:47.181 --> 00:32:49.700
<v Speaker 1>with the fucked up shit in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were like,</v>

792
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:50.780
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was so fucked up.</v>

793
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.600
<v Speaker 1>But now it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

794
00:32:52.601 --> 00:32:53.434
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love to look back at slavery or look </v>

795
00:32:54.861 --> 00:32:56.850
<v Speaker 1>back at Jim Crow or look back at </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

796
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were these people thinking?</v>

797
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.300
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean mass incarceration for nonviolent</v>

798
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:03.134
<v Speaker 1>crimes or mass slaughter in the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>East or any of this stuff that these </v>

799
00:33:05.811 --> 00:33:07.490
<v Speaker 1>people believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

800
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.360
<v Speaker 1>if all the details of what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>came out in 20 years,</v>

801
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.400
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have the same attitude in</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years and be like,</v>

802
00:33:13.401 --> 00:33:14.234
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucked.</v>

803
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit going on in 2016.</v>

804
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:17.593
<v Speaker 1>Well you know what's interesting to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's even tribalism in the </v>

805
00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:20.534
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the CIA and the FBI can't get </v>

806
00:33:23.091 --> 00:33:24.200
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how,</v>

807
00:33:24.201 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

808
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:26.083
<v Speaker 1>General.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy who got busted for cheating </v>

809
00:33:27.681 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 1>on his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patraeus so trays,</v>

810
00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.970
<v Speaker 1>that's how betrays got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The at the FBI was spying,</v>

811
00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.950
<v Speaker 1>was gone after the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only that,</v>

812
00:33:33.951 --> 00:33:36.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dianne Feinstein,</v>

813
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.140
<v Speaker 1>who is the head of the Senate </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence committee.</v>

814
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

815
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.903
<v Speaker 1>they're tasked with overseeing the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She came out and said that the CIA is </v>

816
00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:46.064
<v Speaker 1>spying on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know exactly how they </v>

817
00:33:48.201 --> 00:33:49.910
<v Speaker 1>figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she came out and said,</v>

818
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.040
<v Speaker 1>so the CIA was spying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

819
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:52.874
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't get big story on like a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>story on the new CIA spying and the </v>

820
00:33:56.361 --> 00:34:01.340
<v Speaker 1>people who oversee the CIS supposedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have no clue.</v>

821
00:34:01.341 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Rand Paul came out and said something </v>
<v Speaker 1>along the lines of,</v>

822
00:34:03.711 --> 00:34:04.544
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even know who's running this </v>

823
00:34:05.631 --> 00:34:09.080
<v Speaker 1>thing when it comes to government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the thing that Libertarians,</v>

824
00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Rand Paul said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

825
00:34:10.821 --> 00:34:13.580
<v Speaker 1>he said this like a year and a half ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was still doing well.</v>

826
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.120
<v Speaker 1>He actually should know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why that's a scary thing.</v>

827
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Like he actually should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's probably talking to me,</v>

828
00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.180
<v Speaker 1>but there's also this weird thing where </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

829
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.033
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's this weird thing where like </v>

830
00:34:23.421 --> 00:34:24.254
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you stuff but then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't talk about it to anyone if it's </v>

831
00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:29.660
<v Speaker 1>like classified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot,</v>

832
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:30.494
<v Speaker 1>there's actually congressmen who don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want the classified information because </v>

833
00:34:33.831 --> 00:34:36.260
<v Speaker 1>they want to be able to say whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to be able to say.</v>

834
00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:38.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole cluster fuck.</v>

835
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.700
<v Speaker 1>But I think this is one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Libertarians,</v>

836
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:41.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the type of libertarian that I </v>

837
00:34:43.341 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 1>am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that school of thought,</v>

838
00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:49.670
<v Speaker 1>it really tries to emphasize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't look at government as if it's</v>

839
00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:53.000
<v Speaker 1>a different entity from humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all people,</v>

840
00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:53.581
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

841
00:34:53.581 --> 00:34:55.430
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the CIA and the FBI,</v>

842
00:34:55.431 --> 00:34:56.570
<v Speaker 1>they're not one monolith.</v>

843
00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.420
<v Speaker 1>It's different power sources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different groups of people.</v>

844
00:34:59.421 --> 00:35:00.254
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they all are incentivized the </v>

845
00:35:02.211 --> 00:35:04.250
<v Speaker 1>way people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're a corporation,</v>

846
00:35:04.251 --> 00:35:05.084
<v Speaker 1>like any other business where there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people that are backstabbing </v>

847
00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:08.900
<v Speaker 1>each other trying to get to the top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ladder.</v>

848
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:09.743
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're fucking each other over </v>

849
00:35:10.671 --> 00:35:12.490
<v Speaker 1>inside the tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

850
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:16.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking weird world man.</v>

851
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:18.650
<v Speaker 1>When you hear someone like Ran Paul </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

852
00:35:18.651 --> 00:35:22.400
<v Speaker 1>we don't know who's running this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the government,</v>

853
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.710
<v Speaker 1>the whole government of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

854
00:35:24.711 --> 00:35:25.544
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about the strings behind </v>

855
00:35:27.141 --> 00:35:29.150
<v Speaker 1>the strings and we don't know who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>running it.</v>

856
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.141
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

857
00:35:30.141 --> 00:35:31.220
<v Speaker 1>you see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

858
00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:33.520
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting when you hear like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

859
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:35.780
<v Speaker 1>like Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came out in one of these,</v>

860
00:35:35.781 --> 00:35:36.614
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of her last batch of emails that </v>

861
00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:39.903
<v Speaker 1>that got like released it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like her and her team were </v>

862
00:35:41.851 --> 00:35:42.684
<v Speaker 1>bragging about how she had convinced </v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama to go ahead with regime change in </v>

863
00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Libya.</v>

864
00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

865
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.660
<v Speaker 1>And then gates comes out and writes his </v>
<v Speaker 1>book and he's like,</v>

866
00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:52.890
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was against it.</v>

867
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Hillary was for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

868
00:35:54.781 --> 00:35:55.614
<v Speaker 1>it's just this fucking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you convinced the guy and now this </v>

869
00:35:59.401 --> 00:36:02.220
<v Speaker 1>country is fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

870
00:36:02.221 --> 00:36:03.270
<v Speaker 1>she and all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

871
00:36:03.271 --> 00:36:04.104
<v Speaker 1>And well also did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you saw the time where she was </v>

872
00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:10.380
<v Speaker 1>being interviewed and she was laughing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Kadafi Diane.</v>

873
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:12.600
<v Speaker 1>We came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw he died when I said,</v>

874
00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:13.443
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's video evidence of her being a </v>

875
00:36:14.491 --> 00:36:15.600
<v Speaker 1>sociopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

876
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not cut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't just die right before that.</v>

877
00:36:18.001 --> 00:36:19.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a human being who died.</v>

878
00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:20.784
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kadafi died the way that dictators fear </v>

879
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:25.463
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His people got a hold of him and beat </v>

880
00:36:28.021 --> 00:36:30.780
<v Speaker 1>him and sodomized him to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got like,</v>

881
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about as disturbing as it could be.</v>

882
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.673
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

883
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.863
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to her laughing about getting the </v>

884
00:36:36.601 --> 00:36:37.434
<v Speaker 1>child rapist off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She then a few days later she's just </v>

885
00:36:40.081 --> 00:36:43.260
<v Speaker 1>cackling it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a video of a guy stabbing him in</v>

886
00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:44.310
<v Speaker 1>the ass hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

887
00:36:44.311 --> 00:36:45.660
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen that,</v>

888
00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:46.494
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes that knife and he shoves it in </v>

889
00:36:48.181 --> 00:36:49.090
<v Speaker 1>his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

890
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:52.860
<v Speaker 1>While they're talking to them and Kadafi</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fucked up.</v>

891
00:36:52.861 --> 00:36:53.694
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even know what's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like in a state of shock or some </v>

892
00:36:56.011 --> 00:36:58.290
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a knife in his ass.</v>

893
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.980
<v Speaker 1>All these people have a hold of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all yelling alla walk bar.</v>

894
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

895
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:04.620
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad way to go.</v>

896
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:05.483
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that guy with the knife in </v>

897
00:37:07.801 --> 00:37:09.420
<v Speaker 1>his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that will be like,</v>

898
00:37:09.421 --> 00:37:11.680
<v Speaker 1>you know that he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jima statue.</v>

899
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:13.883
<v Speaker 1>They plant the flag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll make a statue of the one guy </v>

900
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:18.390
<v Speaker 1>with a knife up Qaddafi's ass.</v>

901
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:22.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like over your fireplace in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

902
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:24.450
<v Speaker 1>That will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

903
00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:26.190
<v Speaker 1>that'll be his monument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

904
00:37:26.191 --> 00:37:27.840
<v Speaker 1>it's uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stopped because after you in the ass,</v>

905
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:29.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a video on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show it Mama,</v>

906
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.460
<v Speaker 1>and she puts it on the big screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody watches it.</v>

907
00:37:32.461 --> 00:37:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's closing your ears.</v>

908
00:37:35.301 --> 00:37:36.134
<v Speaker 1>Bomb bombs going off the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause Libby's even more fucked up now </v>

909
00:37:38.881 --> 00:37:39.714
<v Speaker 1>than it was then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That regime change was terrible for the </v>

910
00:37:41.611 --> 00:37:42.421
<v Speaker 1>people who live there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

911
00:37:42.421 --> 00:37:43.201
<v Speaker 1>it's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

912
00:37:43.201 --> 00:37:45.440
<v Speaker 1>I think we lose sight of it sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

913
00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:46.560
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

914
00:37:46.561 --> 00:37:48.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well they're always fucked up.</v>

915
00:37:48.271 --> 00:37:49.720
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little bit more fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

916
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:50.693
<v Speaker 1>but Libya was by regional standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the better places to be in the </v>

917
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Middle East and it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

918
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:58.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a failed state.</v>

919
00:37:58.801 --> 00:37:59.571
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

920
00:37:59.571 --> 00:38:02.120
<v Speaker 1>it's just run by thugs and terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 1>organisms,</v>

921
00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.060
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>

922
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:03.893
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a nightmare.</v>

923
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

924
00:38:04.441 --> 00:38:07.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a breeding ground for isis now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis is all over the place there now.</v>

925
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:09.623
<v Speaker 1>She's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's weird because she gets all these </v>

926
00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:15.690
<v Speaker 1>free passes because she's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange because that's,</v>

927
00:38:15.691 --> 00:38:18.360
<v Speaker 1>that's a a giant part of why people want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to support her.</v>

928
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:19.320
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

929
00:38:19.321 --> 00:38:21.240
<v Speaker 1>we got one of ours in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

930
00:38:21.241 --> 00:38:24.500
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get one of ours in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my wife wants a vote for it because</v>

931
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:25.650
<v Speaker 1>she's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

932
00:38:25.651 --> 00:38:27.510
<v Speaker 1>if you have paid attention to what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country is,</v>

933
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:32.460
<v Speaker 1>have you really read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly I should say Clinton toxic and</v>

934
00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.293
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

935
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying all this for humor.</v>

936
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:38.973
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's not the woman you want to </v>

937
00:38:41.561 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 1>sound what you're looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

938
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:43.624
<v Speaker 1>she's not a scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not a wise woman who's got </v>

939
00:38:45.881 --> 00:38:46.714
<v Speaker 1>some really kind words to say she's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifelong career politician and like you </v>

940
00:38:50.051 --> 00:38:50.831
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that always,</v>

941
00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you talk to any Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters,</v>

942
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.210
<v Speaker 1>it is only sometimes it's not the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing they say.</v>

943
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.250
<v Speaker 1>But if you give like give me three </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why you want Hillary Clinton and</v>

944
00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:00.040
<v Speaker 1>one of them has to do with her being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

945
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:00.874
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be great to see a woman do </v>

946
00:39:01.661 --> 00:39:03.910
<v Speaker 1>it for change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

947
00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:06.220
<v Speaker 1>that's what she runs on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She runs on women's issues.</v>

948
00:39:06.221 --> 00:39:07.780
<v Speaker 1>She plays that card all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

949
00:39:07.781 --> 00:39:09.400
<v Speaker 1>she said like when Donald Trump called </v>
<v Speaker 1>her on that,</v>

950
00:39:09.401 --> 00:39:10.234
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm a kid is a playing the woman's </v>

951
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:15.290
<v Speaker 1>card deal me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's her cadence by the way,</v>

952
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:18.260
<v Speaker 1>it's always this not as knowing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to be a little more noise.</v>

953
00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Just not the pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the pitch down.</v>

954
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:26.770
<v Speaker 1>She's she substitute having no charisma </v>
<v Speaker 1>with just volume,</v>

955
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.031
<v Speaker 1>but she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just,</v>

956
00:39:28.031 --> 00:39:30.650
<v Speaker 1>if I go louder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's charismatic wishes.</v>

957
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:31.563
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't just have no charisma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's oddly transparent in her </v>

958
00:39:36.401 --> 00:39:37.270
<v Speaker 1>creepiness.</v>

959
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.103
<v Speaker 1>Like when she's doing these debates and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders is calling her out on </v>

960
00:39:40.481 --> 00:39:41.314
<v Speaker 1>taking all that money from the banks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how she does his speeches for quarter </v>

961
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:46.030
<v Speaker 1>million dollars and he liked to read the</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcripts.</v>

962
00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:48.070
<v Speaker 1>She just sitting there and while he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>

963
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Speaker 1>just like this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the seething angry over here.</v>

964
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.820
<v Speaker 1>She's smiling on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

965
00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:56.660
<v Speaker 1>deep down she could fucking kill you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>

966
00:39:56.661 --> 00:40:00.640
<v Speaker 1>And she's going over her preparation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they prepped her for this.</v>

967
00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:01.660
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it come,</v>

968
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:02.503
<v Speaker 1>it comes out in this weird sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>robotic I kido move where she's trying </v>

969
00:40:06.731 --> 00:40:07.564
<v Speaker 1>to push it to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a fucking thug and a Steven </v>

970
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Seagal movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird man.</v>

971
00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.353
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't really answer it in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only thing that I find a </v>

972
00:40:16.211 --> 00:40:19.330
<v Speaker 1>positive about Hillary Clinton is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can constantly,</v>

973
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.193
<v Speaker 1>you can see through her and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>point to that shit and other people and </v>

974
00:40:22.751 --> 00:40:24.070
<v Speaker 1>go but see how she's full of Shit.</v>

975
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:27.130
<v Speaker 1>But how about for the woman card thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact that uh,</v>

976
00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:31.690
<v Speaker 1>she's been taking like tens of millions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of dollars from the Saudi government,</v>

977
00:40:31.691 --> 00:40:34.810
<v Speaker 1>something like $100 million from Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorships.</v>

978
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.380
<v Speaker 1>How can you run on the women's issue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like being a Jew,</v>

979
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.740
<v Speaker 1>running on Jewish issues and you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>business with the Nazis.</v>

980
00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.830
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this money and does what with it?</v>

981
00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take it for the Clinton Foundation,</v>

982
00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.093
<v Speaker 1>which is like her and bill and Chelsea's</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation and they do all these </v>

983
00:40:50.621 --> 00:40:51.454
<v Speaker 1>projects and it's all kind of in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>name of charity in the name of </v>

984
00:40:54.161 --> 00:40:54.994
<v Speaker 1>philanthropy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's pretty clearly like you get </v>

985
00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:58.953
<v Speaker 1>like the Saudis aren't giving tens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars to the Clinton </v>

986
00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Foundation cause they all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to be really good people.</v>

987
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:06.003
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it because they know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clintons wield a lot of influence and </v>

988
00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:08.704
<v Speaker 1>this is their way of giving them money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Clintons can use that as </v>

989
00:41:12.221 --> 00:41:15.100
<v Speaker 1>leverage to justify their association </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

990
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Cause look all the good it does good </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

991
00:41:18.341 --> 00:41:19.174
<v Speaker 1>But in the meantime they can also do all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these projects and lots of different </v>

992
00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:22.570
<v Speaker 1>companies can make money off these </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects.</v>

993
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:23.643
<v Speaker 1>And then they get in and we have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy business relationship with Saudi </v>

994
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Arabia who is the worst of the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all the shit that we,</v>

995
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:32.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love a,</v>

996
00:41:32.501 --> 00:41:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I love when the war machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever there's a war they want,</v>

997
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:36.493
<v Speaker 1>they get real humanitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden like when Obama wanted </v>

998
00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:42.710
<v Speaker 1>to go back in a serious back into Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 1>or when he wants to go into Syria,</v>

999
00:41:42.711 --> 00:41:43.191
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1000
00:41:43.191 --> 00:41:45.050
<v Speaker 1>these people are getting gassed or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1001
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a few hundred years.</v>

1002
00:41:46.591 --> 00:41:48.920
<v Speaker 1>Eddie is up on the top of a mountain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could die.</v>

1003
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:49.933
<v Speaker 1>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Saudi Arabia is slaughtering their </v>

1004
00:41:50.961 --> 00:41:51.800
<v Speaker 1>own people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1005
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.960
<v Speaker 1>when Saddam was gassing people and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked him,</v>

1006
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:55.250
<v Speaker 1>that was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only when,</v>

1007
00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.940
<v Speaker 1>when you're on the wrong side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever business deal we are,</v>

1008
00:41:57.941 --> 00:41:59.990
<v Speaker 1>we have going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden they're like,</v>

1009
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:00.824
<v Speaker 1>but think of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden John Mccain cares about </v>

1010
00:42:03.231 --> 00:42:04.064
<v Speaker 1>Muslim people.</v>

1011
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.970
<v Speaker 1>He's playing poker and it's phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1012
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.863
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This john for a moment and talk about </v>

1013
00:42:10.311 --> 00:42:12.530
<v Speaker 1>the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little suspicious.</v>

1014
00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:13.933
<v Speaker 1>Well it's less suspicious now I guess </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it was in the 1960s and in the </v>

1015
00:42:18.681 --> 00:42:22.250
<v Speaker 1>1950s probably before that was even more</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuckery going on.</v>

1016
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:26.510
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like it's more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to pull off the really obvious</v>

1017
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.373
<v Speaker 1>operation northwoods type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there the transparency that we are </v>

1018
00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:31.814
<v Speaker 1>enjoying today even though there's still</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of questions like what Jeb Bush </v>

1019
00:42:35.151 --> 00:42:36.240
<v Speaker 1>was or would um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1020
00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.093
<v Speaker 1>ran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul was saying like we really have no </v>

1021
00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:40.070
<v Speaker 1>idea who's running the whole thing at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the very top.</v>

1022
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:41.113
<v Speaker 1>It seems like that's going to be exposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eventually it's all going to get </v>

1023
00:42:43.221 --> 00:42:44.054
<v Speaker 1>chipped away because information just </v>
<v Speaker 1>travels weight quicker now than it ever </v>

1024
00:42:46.491 --> 00:42:48.830
<v Speaker 1>did before and it's just too hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hide shit.</v>

1025
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:49.520
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1026
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That force is on their side too though.</v>

1027
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:53.204
<v Speaker 1>Like we have that force of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>information can spread but they also </v>

1028
00:42:55.221 --> 00:43:00.221
<v Speaker 1>have the Predator drones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was no way a president in the</v>

1029
00:43:00.261 --> 00:43:04.970
<v Speaker 1>50s or whatever could have just had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>option to say bomb Yemen,</v>

1030
00:43:04.971 --> 00:43:05.804
<v Speaker 1>Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya and Pakistan and all these </v>

1031
00:43:09.381 --> 00:43:12.260
<v Speaker 1>different countries without sending </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops there are having bases nearby.</v>

1032
00:43:12.261 --> 00:43:13.910
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have advantages.</v>

1033
00:43:13.911 --> 00:43:14.890
<v Speaker 1>They have advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1034
00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:15.793
<v Speaker 1>But it's taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I was going to get at is that </v>

1035
00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.820
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is what we're seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>now from the,</v>

1036
00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:23.000
<v Speaker 1>like the NSA gathering data on everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying we needed to PK,</v>

1037
00:43:23.001 --> 00:43:24.560
<v Speaker 1>but he's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost,</v>

1038
00:43:24.561 --> 00:43:26.750
<v Speaker 1>it almost mirrors like with j Edgar </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hoover was doing,</v>

1039
00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:31.130
<v Speaker 1>cause j edgar hoover had all that dirt </v>
<v Speaker 1>on him and so to hide it,</v>

1040
00:43:31.131 --> 00:43:33.050
<v Speaker 1>he just went after everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep everybody quiet.</v>

1041
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:34.103
<v Speaker 1>Everybody scared.</v>

1042
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:38.390
<v Speaker 1>That mean you could make that same </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison to this strategy.</v>

1043
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.920
<v Speaker 1>The NSA is employable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1044
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.890
<v Speaker 1>we'll just fucking monitor everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if,</v>

1045
00:43:43.891 --> 00:43:44.724
<v Speaker 1>if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this dave guys been talking to a lot </v>

1046
00:43:46.851 --> 00:43:48.680
<v Speaker 1>of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's check his emails and it's going to</v>

1047
00:43:48.681 --> 00:43:51.110
<v Speaker 1>go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh look at all this.</v>

1048
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I was joking and I just want to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>already I was joking,</v>

1049
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:54.853
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's an insidious sort of </v>

1050
00:43:57.111 --> 00:43:59.060
<v Speaker 1>device that they can use to keep you </v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet.</v>

1051
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about the fact that it,</v>

1052
00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:01.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 20 years,</v>

1053
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.353
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's some leader who's coming up </v>

1054
00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.120
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a would be,</v>

1055
00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:07.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some type of great leader,</v>

1056
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have grown up just </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely in the Internet age where the,</v>

1057
00:44:11.871 --> 00:44:14.060
<v Speaker 1>if you have all of their metadata </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

1058
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.390
<v Speaker 1>you have everything on that person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they can literally just go like,</v>

1059
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:21.610
<v Speaker 1>we want to ruin that guy and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got something that could be a,</v>

1060
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.950
<v Speaker 1>an issue you could insert into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign should ruin them or you know,</v>

1061
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:26.300
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're boring.</v>

1062
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1063
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:28.393
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I don't want you president </v>

1064
00:44:28.911 --> 00:44:29.744
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they can't ruin you by checking your </v>

1065
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.030
<v Speaker 1>that I don't even want</v>

1066
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:33.210
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great way to put it.</v>

1067
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.360
<v Speaker 2>If you can't be ruined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to be my leader.</v>

1068
00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking Weirdo.</v>

1069
00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 2>You pious Weirdo from birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:41.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like you've just been clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going like,</v>

1071
00:44:41.431 --> 00:44:44.040
<v Speaker 2>well Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get power Sunday as long as I don't</v>

1072
00:44:44.041 --> 00:44:46.920
<v Speaker 2>fuck up and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh she looks pretty but stay hungry.</v>

1073
00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:51.240
<v Speaker 2>We taught him while he was in his crib.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep your cards close to your tests,</v>

1074
00:44:51.241 --> 00:44:52.074
<v Speaker 2>Donnie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's like the thing where they </v>

1075
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:56.250
<v Speaker 2>said isn't about George Washington </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they tried to make him out to be</v>

1076
00:44:56.251 --> 00:44:57.090
<v Speaker 2>such a great word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1077
00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.220
<v Speaker 2>his father was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you cut down that cherry tree?</v>

1078
00:44:59.221 --> 00:44:59.941
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>

1079
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:00.774
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what type of fucking creep was </v>

1080
00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:03.414
<v Speaker 2>George Washington?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe had her like a really open </v>

1081
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:07.260
<v Speaker 2>relationship with his dad or just a dad </v>
<v Speaker 2>who loved him.</v>

1082
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Stand out really cool and he knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

1083
00:45:09.481 --> 00:45:11.550
<v Speaker 2>somebody chop the tree down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got blisters in your hand.</v>

1084
00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:12.450
<v Speaker 2>The fuck's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1085
00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:13.763
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just really compelling evidence </v>

1086
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:17.400
<v Speaker 2>or maybe yet never fucking happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1087
00:45:17.401 --> 00:45:19.770
<v Speaker 2>That's the other maybe more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:20.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all these stories that you get </v>

1089
00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:24.870
<v Speaker 2>from the 16 hundreds like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

1090
00:45:24.871 --> 00:45:26.400
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are barely people.</v>

1091
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Those were monkeys with clothes on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They barely know how to write.</v>

1092
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.593
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and historians like to tell it as if </v>

1093
00:45:31.951 --> 00:45:34.710
<v Speaker 2>they know for a fact what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rather than just being like,</v>

1094
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:35.723
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a nice guests at what maybe </v>

1095
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:37.591
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll be like,</v>

1096
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:38.424
<v Speaker 2>he thought about going left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he went right and it was kind </v>

1097
00:45:40.841 --> 00:45:41.674
<v Speaker 2>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

1098
00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:43.183
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always wondered if one day they'll </v>

1099
00:45:44.881 --> 00:45:49.881
<v Speaker 2>be able to create a computer that's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful that it will be able to somehow</v>

1100
00:45:50.521 --> 00:45:51.354
<v Speaker 2>through some unseen technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take account of everything that's in </v>

1101
00:45:54.631 --> 00:45:57.690
<v Speaker 2>place as it is right now in the world.</v>

1102
00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.793
<v Speaker 2>Then monitor for a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and then go backwards and try to </v>

1103
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:04.171
<v Speaker 2>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1104
00:46:04.171 --> 00:46:05.004
<v Speaker 2>all of these things got into place </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of these events and these </v>

1105
00:46:07.621 --> 00:46:10.470
<v Speaker 2>motions and be able to recreate it </v>
<v Speaker 2>digitally.</v>

1106
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.393
<v Speaker 2>It sounds ridiculous right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we can get to a place where they </v>

1107
00:46:15.301 --> 00:46:17.520
<v Speaker 2>can literally do an account of </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that's happened,</v>

1108
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.863
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every pebble that's on this earth and </v>

1109
00:46:21.511 --> 00:46:22.470
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1110
00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:23.423
<v Speaker 2>We can extrapolate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can take all this data and follow it </v>

1111
00:46:27.031 --> 00:46:31.020
<v Speaker 2>for a short amount of time and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>within the 99% accuracy,</v>

1112
00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:34.610
<v Speaker 2>go back in time and recreate events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

1113
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:35.663
<v Speaker 2>that sounds so stupid and ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that might be like almost a method </v>

1114
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:43.110
<v Speaker 2>of a virtual time travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like just super calculation.</v>

1115
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.750
<v Speaker 2>You just take into account all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that we do,</v>

1116
00:46:45.751 --> 00:46:48.120
<v Speaker 2>know all the pieces that are in place </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1117
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.983
<v Speaker 2>Everything that's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the people that are there and then </v>

1118
00:46:50.581 --> 00:46:53.520
<v Speaker 2>figure out how they got their account </v>
<v Speaker 2>for all factors.</v>

1119
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Account for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm massive,</v>

1120
00:46:55.651 --> 00:46:56.484
<v Speaker 2>super calculations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impossible for the human mind to even </v>

1121
00:46:59.881 --> 00:47:02.610
<v Speaker 2>conceive of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then boom,</v>

1122
00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:03.444
<v Speaker 2>they have a digital recreation of George</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington fucking his sister and lying </v>

1123
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.390
<v Speaker 2>about the cherry tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was full of shit like to black people</v>

1124
00:47:09.391 --> 00:47:11.280
<v Speaker 2>on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1125
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:13.250
<v Speaker 2>George Washington was a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1126
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.900
<v Speaker 2>allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean that for allegedly,</v>

1127
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:17.210
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alleged cones,</v>

1128
00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:20.010
<v Speaker 2>allegedly a piece of shit being </v>
<v Speaker 2>credible.</v>

1129
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:20.873
<v Speaker 2>I mean if they could literally get to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>position where they could do a </v>

1130
00:47:22.681 --> 00:47:26.670
<v Speaker 2>calculation that's so complete that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>could feed it into some sort of,</v>

1131
00:47:26.671 --> 00:47:28.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1132
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.913
<v Speaker 2>someday created virtual reality machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will give you like a version of </v>

1133
00:47:34.481 --> 00:47:35.314
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go back and watch the asteroid </v>

1134
00:47:36.791 --> 00:47:37.870
<v Speaker 2>that killed the dinosaurs.</v>

1135
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.040
<v Speaker 2>If humans can manage to not like destroy</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves or we don't have some asteroid</v>

1136
00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:42.874
<v Speaker 2>reset or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to do magical shit like </v>

1137
00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:45.161
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1138
00:47:45.161 --> 00:47:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're on,</v>

1139
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 2>we're already doing magic compared to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we could do a hundred years ago.</v>

1140
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.863
<v Speaker 2>So I mean we're gonna it's the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can never predict what it would be </v>

1141
00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.353
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can never stand back and you </v>

1142
00:47:56.131 --> 00:47:56.964
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't stand back in the year like </v>

1143
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:58.743
<v Speaker 2>1850 and going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be metal machines running on </v>

1144
00:48:01.121 --> 00:48:02.500
<v Speaker 2>dinosaur juice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1145
00:48:02.501 --> 00:48:04.750
<v Speaker 2>like you just wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1146
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.400
<v Speaker 2>we'll be doing some magical shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1147
00:48:06.401 --> 00:48:07.234
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris was talking about it and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was four Rican me out because he was </v>

1148
00:48:10.901 --> 00:48:14.530
<v Speaker 2>talking about the power that computers </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to have once they,</v>

1149
00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:16.690
<v Speaker 2>once artificial intelligence become </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentient,</v>

1150
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.823
<v Speaker 2>the power that they're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>improve upon themselves and how quickly </v>

1151
00:48:20.921 --> 00:48:21.754
<v Speaker 2>that's going to take place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where thousands of years of progress </v>

1152
00:48:23.711 --> 00:48:24.850
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take place in a week.</v>

1153
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:25.931
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1154
00:48:25.931 --> 00:48:26.291
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1155
00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:27.124
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1156
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:29.200
<v Speaker 2>And then it's just from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each,</v>

1157
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:32.350
<v Speaker 2>each time the improve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it improves exponentially.</v>

1158
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Thousands more years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe in an hour,</v>

1159
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.270
<v Speaker 2>thousands more years in a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

1160
00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:38.523
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to get to some insane </v>
<v Speaker 2>place where he's saying they're </v>

1161
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.200
<v Speaker 2>reasonably certain that one day we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a machine.</v>

1162
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:48.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like an Adam machine that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot out into the universe and given an</v>

1163
00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:49.234
<v Speaker 2>amount of time extracting all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>building materials and needs from the </v>

1164
00:48:52.121 --> 00:48:53.500
<v Speaker 2>sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will make a planet.</v>

1165
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:57.070
<v Speaker 2>It'll make a planet and inhabit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet with intelligent life.</v>

1166
00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.190
<v Speaker 2>And then we can go there and it'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Miami in the sky.</v>

1167
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:01.570
<v Speaker 2>We'll go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be,</v>

1168
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:04.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally you could create anything.</v>

1169
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.330
<v Speaker 2>You might already be living in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How we all got here,</v>

1170
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.240
<v Speaker 2>even want to Elon Musk's more recents </v>
<v Speaker 2>talks.</v>

1171
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:12.430
<v Speaker 2>He talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of people had been saying that</v>

1172
00:49:12.431 --> 00:49:13.090
<v Speaker 2>for a long time.</v>

1173
00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:13.923
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's potentially possible that one day </v>

1174
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:20.270
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality that's into indecipherable or,</v>

1175
00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can't tell the difference between</v>

1176
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:26.170
<v Speaker 2>what is fake and what is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will not be able to stay in.</v>

1177
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Wish it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will,</v>

1178
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:29.920
<v Speaker 2>it will be so good that it will be just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like life.</v>

1179
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:30.843
<v Speaker 2>So if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know that you're not already </v>

1180
00:49:32.441 --> 00:49:33.274
<v Speaker 2>in it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1181
00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.390
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1182
00:49:34.391 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

1183
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:36.573
<v Speaker 2>it's all Mumbo jumbo right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you think that it could've </v>

1184
00:49:39.191 --> 00:49:41.200
<v Speaker 2>already happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's not Mumbo jumbo.</v>

1185
00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:42.310
<v Speaker 2>And if Harris has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1186
00:49:42.311 --> 00:49:45.190
<v Speaker 2>the real problem with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is not even his ideas,</v>

1187
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:48.430
<v Speaker 2>this is all these people that are really</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the forefront of all this technology.</v>

1188
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:49.930
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>

1189
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.810
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something is going to be a god.</v>

1190
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.273
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it literally is going to be able to </v>

1191
00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:56.170
<v Speaker 2>create worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:57.183
<v Speaker 2>It's potentially possible that one day </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have something that </v>

1193
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:04.270
<v Speaker 2>could create a universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1194
00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:04.751
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1195
00:50:04.751 --> 00:50:05.584
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an argument that that's how we </v>

1196
00:50:07.951 --> 00:50:10.870
<v Speaker 2>were created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're here like we are here.</v>

1197
00:50:10.871 --> 00:50:13.420
<v Speaker 2>We do exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And truthfully in the reductionist,</v>

1198
00:50:13.421 --> 00:50:16.870
<v Speaker 2>atheist scientific way of looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no good reason for that.</v>

1199
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:18.550
<v Speaker 2>But you of course there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1200
00:50:18.551 --> 00:50:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that because the universe is</v>
<v Speaker 2>filled with magical shit.</v>

1201
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Like why wouldn't people be here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1202
00:50:24.731 --> 00:50:26.290
<v Speaker 2>well look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at supernovas.</v>

1203
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Look at black holes absorbing galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>

1204
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:32.540
<v Speaker 2>let me look at solar storms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at flares.</v>

1205
00:50:32.541 --> 00:50:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Look at this fucking ball of fire that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sky.</v>

1206
00:50:35.401 --> 00:50:38.990
<v Speaker 2>That's a million times bigger than us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so weird that people exist?</v>

1207
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.970
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is fucking madness.</v>

1208
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's I guess,</v>

1209
00:50:42.411 --> 00:50:43.131
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

1210
00:50:43.131 --> 00:50:45.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying the whole thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>magical already.</v>

1211
00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.910
<v Speaker 2>So what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

1212
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's humans more magic.</v>

1213
00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.310
<v Speaker 2>We're not any more magic than everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's already out there.</v>

1214
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:55.400
<v Speaker 2>How about the Big Bang?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is based on magic.</v>

1215
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll,</v>

1216
00:50:56.361 --> 00:50:57.194
<v Speaker 2>the whole university of something being </v>
<v Speaker 2>created from nothing smaller than the </v>

1217
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:05.120
<v Speaker 2>head of the pin and for whatever reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>instantaneously explodes to sh to create</v>

1218
00:51:05.121 --> 00:51:08.030
<v Speaker 2>all the mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both seen and unseen.</v>

1219
00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.280
<v Speaker 2>That's in the galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including dark matter.</v>

1220
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.233
<v Speaker 2>You get through a conversation with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>point where we show we almost should </v>

1221
00:51:12.771 --> 00:51:15.950
<v Speaker 2>just come back to just being religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's just follow the fucking book.</v>

1222
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:16.813
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying like mormonism </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's so dumb that it's kind of </v>

1223
00:51:19.461 --> 00:51:21.380
<v Speaker 2>comforting that you might be beating </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone.</v>

1224
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:23.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That all these other people like joining</v>

1225
00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.073
<v Speaker 2>on this dumb shit and you all agree and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you call each other elders and you're </v>

1226
00:51:26.301 --> 00:51:29.240
<v Speaker 2>only 12 there's something about just </v>
<v Speaker 2>belief though,</v>

1227
00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:33.820
<v Speaker 2>like like belief might be beating </v>
<v Speaker 2>skepticism of just,</v>

1228
00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.380
<v Speaker 2>just the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know they do these things where</v>

1229
00:51:36.381 --> 00:51:37.214
<v Speaker 2>they measure how your brain acts when </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are like speaking in </v>

1230
00:51:38.961 --> 00:51:41.140
<v Speaker 2>tongues and stuff and you go to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird place.</v>

1231
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:41.973
<v Speaker 2>Then just convincing yourself to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain of what this existence is might </v>

1232
00:51:46.911 --> 00:51:48.680
<v Speaker 2>just put you on a whole different level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1233
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:49.543
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't even matter what you're </v>

1234
00:51:49.611 --> 00:51:51.860
<v Speaker 2>believing and you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're believing right.</v>

1235
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:53.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it exists in a really practical form and</v>

1236
00:51:53.961 --> 00:51:54.990
<v Speaker 2>fighting and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1237
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.180
<v Speaker 2>you're a big MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For him.</v>

1238
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:59.090
<v Speaker 2>It exists in a really practical form and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting because,</v>

1239
00:51:59.300 --> 00:51:59.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

1240
00:51:59.901 --> 00:52:02.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was coaching young people back,</v>

1241
00:52:02.511 --> 00:52:03.291
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the,</v>

1242
00:52:03.291 --> 00:52:05.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo competing days,</v>

1243
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:05.913
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I coached a lot of young people and I </v>

1244
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.840
<v Speaker 2>brought a lot of people to tournaments </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that,</v>

1245
00:52:08.841 --> 00:52:09.674
<v Speaker 2>a lot of students.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I've found </v>

1246
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:15.650
<v Speaker 2>was that smarter people had a harder </v>
<v Speaker 2>time with competing,</v>

1247
00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:16.520
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1248
00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:19.130
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of like the really smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I talked to.</v>

1249
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:21.830
<v Speaker 2>And then I would try to talk to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1250
00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:25.340
<v Speaker 2>And what I realized is they're more </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of the variables,</v>

1251
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:26.323
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more aware of what could go </v>

1252
00:52:27.171 --> 00:52:28.004
<v Speaker 2>wrong and that would create anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was very difficult to get people </v>

1253
00:52:30.411 --> 00:52:31.191
<v Speaker 2>to just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1254
00:52:31.191 --> 00:52:34.100
<v Speaker 2>you have to stay on the path of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to do.</v>

1255
00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:35.870
<v Speaker 2>You can't look off to the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>

1256
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.990
<v Speaker 2>The fact that this cliff goes a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet down to the bottom of the canyon,</v>

1257
00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.180
<v Speaker 2>you can't look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to look on the road,</v>

1258
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:43.460
<v Speaker 2>just the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for a lot of smart people,</v>

1259
00:52:43.461 --> 00:52:44.061
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1260
00:52:44.061 --> 00:52:45.770
<v Speaker 2>what if I get hit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens if you get hit?</v>

1261
00:52:45.771 --> 00:52:46.604
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well you're fucked if you get kicked </v>

1262
00:52:47.361 --> 00:52:48.620
<v Speaker 2>in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1263
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:50.900
<v Speaker 2>don't get you in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep your hands up.</v>

1264
00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:52.680
<v Speaker 2>You got to move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1265
00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:56.870
<v Speaker 2>dumb people were like convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were going to be fine and I would,</v>

1266
00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.370
<v Speaker 2>I was always fascinated by that.</v>

1267
00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:00.590
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is weird because what's interesting</v>

1268
00:53:00.591 --> 00:53:01.424
<v Speaker 2>is when the dumb people lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was way more difficult for them to </v>

1269
00:53:04.671 --> 00:53:05.504
<v Speaker 2>rebound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the smart people lost and they </v>

1270
00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:07.461
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1271
00:53:07.461 --> 00:53:08.294
<v Speaker 2>well I saw that common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I have to decide whether or not I </v>

1272
00:53:09.951 --> 00:53:12.740
<v Speaker 2>still want to compete interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this the risk I still want to take?</v>

1273
00:53:12.741 --> 00:53:14.840
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm aware of the consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was coming,</v>

1274
00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:18.320
<v Speaker 2>so what technically went wrong and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>am I physically?</v>

1275
00:53:18.321 --> 00:53:20.840
<v Speaker 2>And you would see people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent,</v>

1276
00:53:20.841 --> 00:53:21.674
<v Speaker 2>rebound and they would figure out a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to overcome the challenge or try to at </v>

1277
00:53:24.231 --> 00:53:25.064
<v Speaker 2>least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas lot of smart people or a lot of </v>

1278
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 2>dumb people rather were devastated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>losses because it's almost like you took</v>

1279
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:32.550
<v Speaker 2>away that simple belief of theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they have to,</v>

1280
00:53:32.551 --> 00:53:33.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one guy,</v>

1281
00:53:33.751 --> 00:53:36.180
<v Speaker 2>I remember he was talking about how he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was such a good person.</v>

1282
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.260
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1283
00:53:37.261 --> 00:53:38.970
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I followed the Lord's word.</v>

1284
00:53:38.971 --> 00:53:40.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why God do this to me?</v>

1285
00:53:40.591 --> 00:53:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

1286
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Now he's questioning his very existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1287
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:47.640
<v Speaker 2>that's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird thing to see someone have</v>

1288
00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:48.470
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's a,</v>

1289
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:51.720
<v Speaker 2>there's an amazing like confidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a,</v>

1290
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:52.720
<v Speaker 2>or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1291
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.350
<v Speaker 2>at least you have to get yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that place.</v>

1292
00:53:55.370 --> 00:53:56.520
<v Speaker 2>And it took like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1293
00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:57.720
<v Speaker 2>compete in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

1294
00:53:57.721 --> 00:54:00.810
<v Speaker 2>without looking at the side of the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you see that broken,</v>

1295
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:01.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I saw that,</v>

1296
00:54:01.591 --> 00:54:03.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Ellen interview with Rhonda Rousey,</v>

1297
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was so crazy to me.</v>

1298
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:06.653
<v Speaker 2>That really made me go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe she shouldn't fight for a little </v>

1299
00:54:08.491 --> 00:54:09.390
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1300
00:54:09.391 --> 00:54:10.224
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she needs some more time off because </v>

1301
00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:13.620
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she went from being the like,</v>

1302
00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:14.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill everyone.</v>

1303
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:16.950
<v Speaker 2>No one has a right to beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't be a b,</v>

1304
00:54:16.951 --> 00:54:19.950
<v Speaker 2>nothing bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And being that chick to being like a,</v>

1305
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.053
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to kill myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to just have Travis Brown's </v>

1306
00:54:22.501 --> 00:54:23.490
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1307
00:54:23.491 --> 00:54:24.324
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's gone from being this like </v>

1308
00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:27.803
<v Speaker 2>untouchable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not even like she was like the </v>

1309
00:54:30.451 --> 00:54:32.520
<v Speaker 2>best female fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like don't even,</v>

1310
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:36.720
<v Speaker 2>she's wrecking chicks in a second and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then to seeing her kind of broken.</v>

1311
00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:37.643
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is these themed play </v>

1312
00:54:38.971 --> 00:54:43.170
<v Speaker 2>themselves out over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the traps are all there,</v>

1313
00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.153
<v Speaker 2>but everybody keeps going for the candy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they keep getting caught in the </v>

1314
00:54:46.771 --> 00:54:47.604
<v Speaker 2>traps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The traps of Hollywood are always there </v>

1315
00:54:49.711 --> 00:54:52.800
<v Speaker 2>for any superstar athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially fighters.</v>

1316
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:53.634
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen it all throughout history </v>

1317
00:54:54.781 --> 00:54:55.614
<v Speaker 2>with Tommy Morrison gets in the rocky </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie and all of a sudden everybody's </v>

1318
00:54:58.321 --> 00:55:00.570
<v Speaker 2>looking at him like Tommy Marson is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be the white hub.</v>

1319
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:03.660
<v Speaker 2>And then Ray Mercer beats the living </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck out of them.</v>

1320
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:04.643
<v Speaker 2>And you just saw like fear and </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming anxiety attack him cause </v>

1321
00:55:08.911 --> 00:55:11.460
<v Speaker 2>he's in this movie and he's on the red </v>
<v Speaker 2>carpet and everybody's saying,</v>

1322
00:55:11.461 --> 00:55:12.690
<v Speaker 2>you going to be the champ one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honey.</v>

1323
00:55:12.691 --> 00:55:13.680
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck.</v>

1324
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:16.560
<v Speaker 2>And then it becomes this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's hanging with Sylvester stallone.</v>

1325
00:55:16.561 --> 00:55:19.350
<v Speaker 2>They're probably doing blow and banging </v>
<v Speaker 2>hookers allegedly,</v>

1326
00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:20.550
<v Speaker 2>allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I mean?</v>

1327
00:55:20.551 --> 00:55:21.384
<v Speaker 2>It's like it becomes this Hollywood trap</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Rhonda was a Jew and still is a </v>

1328
00:55:25.981 --> 00:55:27.600
<v Speaker 2>giant superstar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1329
00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:31.860
<v Speaker 2>She's this undefeated women's fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's crushing all the competition.</v>

1330
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:35.670
<v Speaker 2>She looks like a destroyer and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking traps this,</v>

1331
00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:38.220
<v Speaker 2>all these movies start coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this,</v>

1332
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:41.280
<v Speaker 2>all these deals start getting made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Books start getting written.</v>

1333
00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:42.323
<v Speaker 2>All these television shows and all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and all the traps and all those </v>

1334
00:55:44.851 --> 00:55:47.100
<v Speaker 2>traps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they keep you focus.</v>

1335
00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:49.000
<v Speaker 2>They take steal little bits of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus,</v>

1336
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:51.270
<v Speaker 2>like I'm good enough to get by without </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that focus.</v>

1337
00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:52.433
<v Speaker 2>But there's no way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's another person like you </v>

1338
00:55:54.151 --> 00:55:54.984
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people like you out </v>

1339
00:55:56.581 --> 00:55:57.414
<v Speaker 2>there and they don't have those traps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they don't have those traps are </v>

1340
00:55:59.761 --> 00:56:01.890
<v Speaker 2>going to have more attention that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>being paid right away.</v>

1341
00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:04.980
<v Speaker 2>They had an advantage because they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>their full focused on this.</v>

1342
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:08.020
<v Speaker 2>And there's also something dangerous to </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like Rhonda Rousey.</v>

1343
00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:09.750
<v Speaker 2>But by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's just incredible.</v>

1344
00:56:09.751 --> 00:56:10.584
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's the reason why women's mma is a </v>

1345
00:56:12.211 --> 00:56:14.130
<v Speaker 2>huge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1346
00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:15.443
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's something dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>about being such an amazing grappler </v>

1347
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 2>getting a couple of knockouts and all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sudden feeling this kind of like,</v>

1348
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:23.531
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1349
00:56:23.531 --> 00:56:26.560
<v Speaker 2>she got the knee to a mcmahon and stops </v>
<v Speaker 2>it with one knee.</v>

1350
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:28.000
<v Speaker 2>And then what was the other chick who </v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

1351
00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:31.030
<v Speaker 2>she hit the overhand who face planted </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexis Davis.</v>

1352
00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:31.893
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now it's kind of going in there </v>

1353
00:56:33.191 --> 00:56:35.200
<v Speaker 2>and even going in there with like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>world class,</v>

1354
00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:38.870
<v Speaker 2>a boxer like a Holly Holm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she kind of goes in there with,</v>

1355
00:56:38.871 --> 00:56:39.191
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1356
00:56:39.191 --> 00:56:42.340
<v Speaker 2>I can knock people out too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a dangerous,</v>

1357
00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:42.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

1358
00:56:42.911 --> 00:56:44.290
<v Speaker 2>you know what is a dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination?</v>

1359
00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.153
<v Speaker 2>It's like being a blue belt and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>choked out a bunch of white belts and </v>

1360
00:56:47.111 --> 00:56:47.944
<v Speaker 2>you think you're the shit and then all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden you're rolling with Damien </v>

1361
00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Maia and he wraps you up like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas present.</v>

1362
00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Beats the fuck out of you and chokes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1363
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Unconscious easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1364
00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's levels of everything.</v>

1365
00:56:57.821 --> 00:57:02.650
<v Speaker 2>And to deny those levels because anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>who looked at her fights would see like,</v>

1366
00:57:02.651 --> 00:57:04.780
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have this Rhonda Rousey.</v>

1367
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:08.230
<v Speaker 2>This fierce competitor was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best judo,</v>

1368
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:09.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>examples of Judah.</v>

1369
00:57:09.911 --> 00:57:10.744
<v Speaker 2>We've ever seen an MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean her judo spectacular reason why </v>

1370
00:57:13.901 --> 00:57:15.430
<v Speaker 2>she was a medalist in the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1371
00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:18.430
<v Speaker 2>she's a sensational competitor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her grappling is outstanding.</v>

1372
00:57:18.431 --> 00:57:20.890
<v Speaker 2>Her arm bar technique is amongst the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best in the world,</v>

1373
00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.760
<v Speaker 2>but she's knocking out these girls </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1374
00:57:23.761 --> 00:57:24.594
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're nowhere near Worldclass as far </v>

1375
00:57:27.731 --> 00:57:29.530
<v Speaker 2>as like kickboxing and striking is </v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

1376
00:57:29.531 --> 00:57:30.364
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holly Holm is 100% worldclass she is an </v>

1377
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:36.910
<v Speaker 2>18 time world boxing champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's a kickboxing champion.</v>

1378
00:57:36.911 --> 00:57:38.170
<v Speaker 2>She was in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1379
00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.153
<v Speaker 2>an MMA competitor for a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 2>before she got into the UFC where she </v>

1380
00:57:43.451 --> 00:57:46.240
<v Speaker 2>was having these ridiculous head kick </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

1381
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:47.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a beast.</v>

1382
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:51.340
<v Speaker 2>And for her to think that she's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>treat this woman,</v>

1383
00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:52.323
<v Speaker 2>this Holly Holm woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way she was able to bully like </v>

1384
00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Batchko Heyah and I say billy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in a negative way.</v>

1385
00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:59.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just attacker and go after Batchko Hey,</v>

1386
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:00.833
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she slow and awkward and not that </v>

1387
00:58:03.761 --> 00:58:07.180
<v Speaker 2>athletic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holly Holm bounces around that cage like</v>

1388
00:58:07.181 --> 00:58:08.680
<v Speaker 2>a fucking kangaroo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1389
00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:11.270
<v Speaker 2>She does all these back flips and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's spectacular.</v>

1390
00:58:11.271 --> 00:58:12.104
<v Speaker 2>The athletic and the idea that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have the same approach they </v>

1391
00:58:14.771 --> 00:58:15.820
<v Speaker 2>used on Batchko go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1392
00:58:15.821 --> 00:58:17.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with someone like Holly Holm,</v>

1393
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:18.003
<v Speaker 2>that's just madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's something that happens when </v>

1394
00:58:19.691 --> 00:58:22.420
<v Speaker 2>people get so absorbed with this idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're special.</v>

1395
00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:24.340
<v Speaker 2>So absorbed with this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1396
00:58:24.341 --> 00:58:27.760
<v Speaker 2>when you're on top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think you are the fucking person.</v>

1397
00:58:27.761 --> 00:58:29.020
<v Speaker 2>You're the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the man,</v>

1398
00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 2>you're the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's going to fuck with you.</v>

1399
00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.074
<v Speaker 2>I'm just wandering through this bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you get cracked and then you </v>

1400
00:58:34.661 --> 00:58:35.321
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1401
00:58:35.321 --> 00:58:38.650
<v Speaker 2>this game doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This game doesn't give a fuck about your</v>

1402
00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:39.484
<v Speaker 2>charisma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't give a fuck about the vegas </v>

1403
00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:41.710
<v Speaker 2>odds.</v>

1404
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:42.543
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't give a fuck about how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>money you made or how many times you've </v>

1405
00:58:45.341 --> 00:58:49.660
<v Speaker 2>been on entourage or amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing thing about mma.</v>

1406
00:58:49.661 --> 00:58:52.420
<v Speaker 2>It's why I have so much respect for </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody who competes.</v>

1407
00:58:52.421 --> 00:58:56.470
<v Speaker 2>But it's like no one can escape this </v>
<v Speaker 2>game's wrath.</v>

1408
00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1409
00:58:57.150 --> 00:59:00.160
<v Speaker 2>j like John Jones still has a lot of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>career to go and he does.</v>

1410
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:03.160
<v Speaker 2>He has one loss on his record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was not dominant you when,</v>

1411
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:04.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1412
00:59:04.631 --> 00:59:05.464
<v Speaker 2>you see these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you see Anderson Silva and he's </v>

1413
00:59:08.081 --> 00:59:09.010
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a Ninja.</v>

1414
00:59:09.011 --> 00:59:10.570
<v Speaker 2>He's untouchable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the greatest fighter ever.</v>

1415
00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.990
<v Speaker 2>And then you see him like crying on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground with a shattered,</v>

1416
00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:14.980
<v Speaker 2>not shattered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>

1417
00:59:14.981 --> 00:59:17.260
<v Speaker 2>When he broke his shin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1418
00:59:17.261 --> 00:59:20.470
<v Speaker 2>how about when he cried in the ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>after he won against Nick Diaz?</v>

1419
00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:21.870
<v Speaker 2>He fell to the ground</v>

1420
00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.240
<v Speaker 1>fighter ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1421
00:59:23.241 --> 00:59:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Nick Dsi is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty awesome.</v>

1422
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.633
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Diaz brothers are just the greatest </v>

1423
00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:28.130
<v Speaker 1>fighters of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They certainly are.</v>

1424
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1425
00:59:29.451 --> 00:59:30.350
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1426
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:33.740
<v Speaker 1>from going full circle then when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes back and wins in the octagon.</v>

1427
00:59:33.741 --> 00:59:34.221
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1428
00:59:34.221 --> 00:59:35.780
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredible thing.</v>

1429
00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:36.770
<v Speaker 1>It makes you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1430
00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:39.260
<v Speaker 1>when watching Chuck Liddell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I just,</v>

1431
00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:40.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a certain point you were like,</v>

1432
00:59:40.371 --> 00:59:42.650
<v Speaker 1>that guy's just unbeatable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like Superman.</v>

1433
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.260
<v Speaker 1>And then to see him getting knocked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and kind of his chin,</v>

1434
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:47.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly start to go,</v>

1435
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:47.881
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1436
00:59:47.881 --> 00:59:49.210
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this,</v>

1437
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:51.430
<v Speaker 1>this game just came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't give a fuck,</v>

1438
00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:54.290
<v Speaker 1>doesn't give a fuck about your opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't give a fuck about what you think</v>

1439
00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:58.100
<v Speaker 1>when knuckles hit Chin's legs go limp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just how it goes.</v>

1440
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.140
<v Speaker 1>And we saw that in the rockhold bisping </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1441
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:01.363
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rockhold had this look about him that </v>

1442
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.870
<v Speaker 1>almost like he was bored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was just like,</v>

1443
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1444
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:09.800
<v Speaker 1>part of that I'm sure as gamesmanship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to get inside bisping's head</v>

1445
01:00:09.801 --> 01:00:10.634
<v Speaker 1>that he's so much better than him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't even have to like be </v>

1446
01:00:12.921 --> 01:00:17.270
<v Speaker 1>serious and be concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then bisbing clips him with his left</v>

1447
01:00:17.271 --> 01:00:19.520
<v Speaker 1>hook over the shoulder where he's barely</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen it.</v>

1448
01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.890
<v Speaker 1>You called it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a greg,</v>

1449
01:00:21.891 --> 01:00:22.724
<v Speaker 1>is that what you said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a few beats before that we were </v>

1450
01:00:24.111 --> 01:00:24.944
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke rockhold is keeping his chin right </v>

1451
01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>up in the air and he's kind of like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little lacks of days ago.</v>

1452
01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember you,</v>

1453
01:00:29.151 --> 01:00:29.931
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

1454
01:00:29.931 --> 01:00:30.764
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Hennen Barao dillashaw fight the </v>

1455
01:00:33.411 --> 01:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a huge upset,</v>

1456
01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.630
<v Speaker 1>no one saw that coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1457
01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.990
<v Speaker 1>and I remember you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sang as it was,</v>

1458
01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:39.831

<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1459
01:00:39.831 --> 01:00:41.540
<v Speaker 1>until the show is really light on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

1460
01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:42.653
<v Speaker 1>I was really relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes you could just see a </v>

1461
01:00:44.061 --> 01:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>little thing in the way they're moving.</v>

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:34.940
<v Speaker 1>He's like the Bert Kreischer of the east</v>
<v Speaker 1>coast.</v>

1485
01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:37.760
<v Speaker 1>He's just a hilarious person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1486
01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:40.100
<v Speaker 1>but so he's doing a show with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Michael Bisman,</v>

1487
01:01:40.101 --> 01:01:40.934
<v Speaker 1>they do a show called the countdown on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sirius Radio and he started doing the </v>

1488
01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:44.324
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is before bisbing has the </v>

1489
01:01:45.111 --> 01:01:45.944
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva fight and it did almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem kind of like bisping was a great </v>

1490
01:01:49.161 --> 01:01:51.680
<v Speaker 1>fight or a big name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but seemed like he was kind of,</v>

1491
01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:53.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going towards the end of his career.</v>

1492
01:01:53.391 --> 01:01:54.224
<v Speaker 1>Like he had a couple injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the eye thing and you're kind of </v>

1493
01:01:56.271 --> 01:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh he was,</v>

1494
01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.640
<v Speaker 1>he was a contender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well explain the,</v>

1495
01:01:58.641 --> 01:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>I think cause the I think is pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1496
01:02:00.441 --> 01:02:04.640
<v Speaker 1>You probably know better than he has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>detached retina and his oil in his eye,</v>

1497
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:05.803
<v Speaker 1>they had to inject oil into where his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit so that his retina won't tear </v>

1498
01:02:10.431 --> 01:02:13.700
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has one eye that looks almost like</v>

1499
01:02:13.701 --> 01:02:17.210
<v Speaker 1>cross side and it's kind of black like </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like he's on ecstasy.</v>

1500
01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Like one pupils dilated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very weird</v>

1501
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:21.383
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got that one I fucked up and he </v>

1502
01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:25.884
<v Speaker 2>doesn't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still going in there and settling </v>

1503
01:02:27.771 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's born for this,</v>

1504
01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:30.564
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker went out and fought </v>

1505
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Anderson Silva won one of the gutsiest </v>
<v Speaker 2>performances I've ever seen him.</v>

1506
01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1507
01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:40.890
<v Speaker 2>the first two rounds that he beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson were just incredible.</v>

1508
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:45.450
<v Speaker 2>And then the fact that he got almost put</v>
<v Speaker 2>out in the third round and came back and</v>

1509
01:02:45.451 --> 01:02:46.284
<v Speaker 2>won the fourth round and it was a fucked</v>
<v Speaker 2>up thing because he was trying to say </v>

1510
01:02:48.871 --> 01:02:51.980
<v Speaker 2>that his mouthpiece was out and he tried</v>
<v Speaker 2>to circle to,</v>

1511
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:53.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who the referee was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Herb.</v>

1512
01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:54.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1513
01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:56.143
<v Speaker 2>but herb's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1514
01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.190
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter like you got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not stopping it.</v>

1515
01:02:58.191 --> 01:02:59.024
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't call when to stop the action </v>

1516
01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.313
<v Speaker 2>because you could say that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouthpieces out or you could just spit </v>

1517
01:03:03.271 --> 01:03:04.670
<v Speaker 2>your mouthpiece that whenever someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1518
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.370
<v Speaker 2>like landed a big show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do time and people do do that.</v>

1519
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.810
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>herb was like,</v>

1520
01:03:09.811 --> 01:03:12.390
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say to me that your mouthpiece</v>

1521
01:03:12.391 --> 01:03:13.740
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know your mouth pieces out,</v>

1522
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.780
<v Speaker 2>but you got to keep fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then boom,</v>

1523
01:03:15.781 --> 01:03:16.614
<v Speaker 2>Anderson lands a flying knee on the jot </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then Anderson walks away with his </v>

1524
01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.480
<v Speaker 2>hands up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy as if he won.</v>

1525
01:03:21.481 --> 01:03:23.610
<v Speaker 2>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Herb didn't call the fight yet.</v>

1526
01:03:23.611 --> 01:03:24.444
<v Speaker 2>So then the bell rings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then bisping has to get up and </v>

1527
01:03:26.281 --> 01:03:29.130
<v Speaker 2>recover in a minute from getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaotic.</v>

1528
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:30.023
<v Speaker 2>It was madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got a little bit of extra time </v>

1529
01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:34.950
<v Speaker 2>because Anderson Silva celebrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1530
01:03:34.951 --> 01:03:37.050
<v Speaker 2>So I think he got like an extra 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds or so.</v>

1531
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.550
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then right.</v>

1532
01:03:38.551 --> 01:03:39.450
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way to,</v>

1533
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:41.330
<v Speaker 2>that's got to fuck Anderson up to cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson's,</v>

1534
01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:44.160
<v Speaker 2>now I've got this like adrenaline dump </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you saw on his face,</v>

1535
01:03:44.161 --> 01:03:44.820
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1536
01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're back to fighting it.</v>

1537
01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:48.600
<v Speaker 2>But bisping man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fourth round,</v>

1538
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:51.810
<v Speaker 2>he just bit down on his mouthpiece and </v>
<v Speaker 2>walked him down.</v>

1539
01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was incredible.</v>

1540
01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:53.904
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then after that being the greatest </v>

1541
01:03:55.441 --> 01:03:58.500
<v Speaker 2>ever to come and you get on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on an injury,</v>

1542
01:03:58.620 --> 01:03:59.453
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a title shot with 10 days' </v>

1543
01:04:00.931 --> 01:04:02.880
<v Speaker 2>notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fights the greatest ever.</v>

1544
01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:06.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean arguably Anderson's on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>downslide but definitely,</v>

1545
01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.400
<v Speaker 2>let's not say arguably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean losing twice to Weidman.</v>

1546
01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:14.100
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't look the same when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought Nick Diaz suspended for steroids,</v>

1547
01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:15.900
<v Speaker 2>comes back and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1548
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:18.970
<v Speaker 2>but he's still Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that victory,</v>

1549
01:04:18.971 --> 01:04:19.804
<v Speaker 2>he gets that victor over the greatest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all time and then first round knockout </v>

1550
01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:23.550
<v Speaker 2>over Luke rockhold you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up.</v>

1551
01:04:23.551 --> 01:04:24.384
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was literally considering saying that </v>

1552
01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:26.694
<v Speaker 2>Luke rockhold looks overconfident and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're overconfident you can get </v>

1553
01:04:29.071 --> 01:04:30.270
<v Speaker 2>knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1554
01:04:30.271 --> 01:04:31.104
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be a deck.</v>

1555
01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:33.240
<v Speaker 2>And then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets knocked out.</v>

1556
01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:36.080
<v Speaker 2>But you did make the comment about him </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding a,</v>

1557
01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:36.923
<v Speaker 2>about him not having his head right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there on the center line of sort of </v>

1558
01:04:39.121 --> 01:04:39.954
<v Speaker 2>relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was super relaxed with his chin </v>

1559
01:04:40.891 --> 01:04:41.724
<v Speaker 2>straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was pulling out of things with his </v>

1560
01:04:42.571 --> 01:04:45.300
<v Speaker 2>chin straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like there was no danger.</v>

1561
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.150
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of the things that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying that,</v>

1562
01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in no danger.</v>

1563
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:52.980
<v Speaker 2>And it was also one of the same things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Uriah Faber was saying.</v>

1564
01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Like the difference between me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cruises.</v>

1565
01:04:54.721 --> 01:04:56.670
<v Speaker 2>I can hurt him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can take him out.</v>

1566
01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.770
<v Speaker 2>And then when you see your riot got </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught,</v>

1567
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:59.783
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a second round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got dropped and you realize he's in </v>

1568
01:05:01.381 --> 01:05:03.810
<v Speaker 2>deep trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you realize holy Shit,</v>

1569
01:05:03.811 --> 01:05:07.000
<v Speaker 2>like I can get knocked out too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all those guys in,</v>

1570
01:05:07.001 --> 01:05:07.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1571
01:05:07.461 --> 01:05:08.294
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny when you get it like Michael </v>

1572
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:10.703
<v Speaker 2>Bisping was guy who the knock on him I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess was that he didn't have knockout </v>

1573
01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:13.374
<v Speaker 2>power or whatever.</v>

1574
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:16.830
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about like a a 200,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean fighting at two.</v>

1575
01:05:16.831 --> 01:05:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it cuts down probably,</v>

1576
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:19.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one 85.</v>

1577
01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:23.050
<v Speaker 2>So probably someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who weighs close to 200 pounds.</v>

1578
01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:26.560
<v Speaker 2>It's a 200 pound guy who specializes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in striking.</v>

1579
01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:27.394
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he can fucking knock you out of </v>

1580
01:05:28.481 --> 01:05:30.520
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he proved it.</v>

1581
01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:32.980
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't fight like a,</v>

1582
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:36.310
<v Speaker 2>like a brawler like he fights like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>technician.</v>

1583
01:05:36.311 --> 01:05:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you fight like a technician,</v>

1584
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:42.640
<v Speaker 2>you don't swing wild crazy ass punches </v>
<v Speaker 2>with everything on them with your,</v>

1585
01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vandelay Silva style,</v>

1586
01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to find openings and that's what</v>

1587
01:05:47.561 --> 01:05:49.210
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He found the opening with that left hook</v>

1588
01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:51.460
<v Speaker 2>was really sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had missed it before.</v>

1589
01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:52.443
<v Speaker 2>He was like stepping in and throwing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>left took over the shoulder and kind of </v>

1590
01:05:55.481 --> 01:05:59.050
<v Speaker 2>like stepping into the punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And boy when he caught luke,</v>

1591
01:05:59.051 --> 01:05:59.884
<v Speaker 2>he caught him at the end of the chin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which really like fucking spins your </v>

1592
01:06:02.681 --> 01:06:03.070
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

1593
01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:03.903
<v Speaker 2>All the torque is perfectly placed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you caught him with another </v>

1594
01:06:06.551 --> 01:06:08.380
<v Speaker 2>brilliant one right afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's followed up.</v>

1595
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1596
01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.610
<v Speaker 2>And you know he's had like all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy injuries.</v>

1597
01:06:12.611 --> 01:06:14.440
<v Speaker 2>Back injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neck injuries,</v>

1598
01:06:14.441 --> 01:06:16.270
<v Speaker 2>his fucking arm thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1599
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.580
<v Speaker 2>he's just tough man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just keeps going.</v>

1600
01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:21.460
<v Speaker 2>It just keeps going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had no question about that.</v>

1601
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:22.294
<v Speaker 2>That dude's as tough as they come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm never fixed him just because </v>

1602
01:06:25.121 --> 01:06:25.954
<v Speaker 2>he's one of those guys who's like been </v>
<v Speaker 2>around forever and always kind of been </v>

1603
01:06:27.731 --> 01:06:29.820
<v Speaker 2>knocking at the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's nice to see him.</v>

1604
01:06:29.821 --> 01:06:32.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get his moment well was crazy to see.</v>

1605
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Well you see like there's knockout </v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

1606
01:06:34.001 --> 01:06:34.834
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's like Dan Henderson </v>

1607
01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Kinda knock out power that it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1608
01:06:37.871 --> 01:06:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Geez fucking cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Dan Henderson feels like this table</v>

1609
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.310
<v Speaker 2>when you put your arm on him and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not flexing.</v>

1610
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:47.800
<v Speaker 2>He's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Ryan Parsons,</v>

1611
01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:50.200
<v Speaker 2>who's a buddy of mine who was his </v>
<v Speaker 2>manager for a long time,</v>

1612
01:06:50.201 --> 01:06:53.260
<v Speaker 2>said that he would do massage on him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would be exhausted.</v>

1613
01:06:53.261 --> 01:06:55.810
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's would the guys made out of wood.</v>

1614
01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.700
<v Speaker 2>So like when you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at me go,</v>

1615
01:06:57.701 --> 01:06:59.110
<v Speaker 2>well it looks like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1616
01:06:59.111 --> 01:07:02.020
<v Speaker 2>strong athletic guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you felt him,</v>

1617
01:07:02.021 --> 01:07:03.640
<v Speaker 2>you realize where all this power comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

1618
01:07:03.641 --> 01:07:05.440
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's built different,</v>

1619
01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:07.960
<v Speaker 2>there's something going on with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he does.</v>

1620
01:07:07.961 --> 01:07:10.200
<v Speaker 2>When you were saying people who don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>put everything into one punch,</v>

1621
01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:12.690
<v Speaker 2>he puts everything into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1622
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:16.030
<v Speaker 2>it's like coming at Ya and it's so weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he moves to,</v>

1623
01:07:16.031 --> 01:07:18.700
<v Speaker 2>he moves in a weird way because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very stiff.</v>

1624
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:23.350
<v Speaker 2>He's not fluid like John Jones or like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson is very fluid in his movements.</v>

1625
01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Dan is like very stiff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when he uncorked those bombs on you,</v>

1626
01:07:28.091 --> 01:07:33.010
<v Speaker 2>they just detonate and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck hit me like hector lumbar.</v>

1627
01:07:33.010 --> 01:07:36.040
<v Speaker 2>It's never been knocked out to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>hector lumbar getting knocked out by,</v>

1628
01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:37.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got head kicked.</v>

1629
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.553
<v Speaker 2>He's probably stunned by that head kick </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he got blasted with that back </v>

1630
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.730
<v Speaker 2>elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was out cold.</v>

1631
01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:43.863
<v Speaker 2>He was out cold when he hit the ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then Henderson blast them again but </v>

1632
01:07:47.141 --> 01:07:48.220
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1633
01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:48.871
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it.</v>

1634
01:07:48.871 --> 01:07:50.200
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck hits?</v>

1635
01:07:50.201 --> 01:07:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like you want him to hit you</v>

1636
01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:57.570
<v Speaker 2>just so he could feel it a bit harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the normal what it,</v>

1637
01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:00.400
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to start by like standing next to</v>

1638
01:08:00.401 --> 01:08:02.620
<v Speaker 2>a guy who he hits like hit him real </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to me.</v>

1639
01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:03.454
<v Speaker 2>I want to feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His Kale of bisping UFC 100 was one of </v>

1640
01:08:06.371 --> 01:08:09.490
<v Speaker 2>the most brutal one punch shots and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of combat sports.</v>

1641
01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:12.940
<v Speaker 2>It was just boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bisping's dead stiff,</v>

1642
01:08:12.941 --> 01:08:13.774
<v Speaker 2>and then Henderson's airborne long </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the referee can get to them and </v>

1643
01:08:17.091 --> 01:08:19.970
<v Speaker 2>just slams him in the face on the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1644
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:20.803
<v Speaker 2>And then from there out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of his logos was the silhouette of </v>

1645
01:08:24.921 --> 01:08:27.530
<v Speaker 2>him flying through the air and knocking </v>
<v Speaker 2>out bisbing.</v>

1646
01:08:27.730 --> 01:08:28.563
<v Speaker 2>So imagine being best bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only do you have to deal with the </v>

1647
01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:33.170
<v Speaker 2>fact this guy fucking knocked you out in</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular fashion,</v>

1648
01:08:33.171 --> 01:08:34.004
<v Speaker 2>but his logo is flying through the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting you after you're already </v>

1649
01:08:40.101 --> 01:08:41.420
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

1650
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:43.370
<v Speaker 2>I would just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang on.</v>

1651
01:08:43.371 --> 01:08:44.204
<v Speaker 2>In a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be champ and you'll have a show </v>

1652
01:08:46.371 --> 01:08:48.530
<v Speaker 2>with Louis J.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gomez and everything will be good.</v>

1653
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.410
<v Speaker 2>What year was UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 it's a wild man.</v>

1657
01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.660

<v Speaker 3>What year was that,</v>

1659
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:01.873
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

1661
01:09:05.521 --> 01:09:06.870
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't that right?</v>

1662
01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:08.640
<v Speaker 2>It was UFC 100 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1664
01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:11.183
<v Speaker 2>it was the biggest paper view of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>time was brock Lesnar's rematch with </v>

1665
01:09:13.981 --> 01:09:18.981
<v Speaker 2>Frank Mir and GSP photo tiago album 2009</v>
<v Speaker 2>2009 it was that long ago.</v>

1666
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:23.380
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nuts.</v>

1667
01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was fucking weird.</v>

1668
01:09:25.741 --> 01:09:28.080
<v Speaker 2>It's been a long fucking longer than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would've thought.</v>

1669
01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

1670
01:09:29.041 --> 01:09:30.780
<v Speaker 2>I guess it is like a hundred UFC is </v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

1671
01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1672
01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:34.920
<v Speaker 2>So seven years later he wins the title </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1673
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:39.180
<v Speaker 2>You're a look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be the same card on the</v>

1674
01:09:39.181 --> 01:09:40.450
<v Speaker 2>same card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1675
01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:40.831
<v Speaker 2>You good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1676
01:09:40.831 --> 01:09:43.410
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna be some ups and downs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your retina is going to get all types of</v>

1677
01:09:43.411 --> 01:09:44.244
<v Speaker 2>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you will be champion one day and no </v>

1678
01:09:46.141 --> 01:09:46.974
<v Speaker 2>one takes that away from him ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine if him and Henderson </v>

1679
01:09:49.861 --> 01:09:52.020
<v Speaker 2>had a rematch for the title?</v>

1680
01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can that be made?</v>

1681
01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:56.493
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if that could be made ethically</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you look at all the other </v>

1682
01:09:59.141 --> 01:10:00.790
<v Speaker 2>contenders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the people waiting in line,</v>

1683
01:10:00.791 --> 01:10:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Chris White,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jacques Perrey,</v>

1684
01:10:03.791 --> 01:10:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Vittorio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just too many.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's too many,</v>

1686
01:10:06.821 --> 01:10:08.200
<v Speaker 2>but two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

1687
01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:09.483
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a hard sell because v toward just </v>

1688
01:10:11.771 --> 01:10:13.420
<v Speaker 2>knocked out Henderson in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>

1689
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:16.420
<v Speaker 2>you know it's handled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1690
01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:17.254
<v Speaker 2>It's just man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vito knocked out bisping in Brazil and </v>

1691
01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:25.091
<v Speaker 2>you're knocked out rockhold but he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>got smashed by Jacques Perrey.</v>

1692
01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.313
<v Speaker 2>Everything in the middleweight division </v>
<v Speaker 2>is just completely up in the air and </v>

1693
01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.800
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all turned up to that.</v>

1694
01:10:29.801 --> 01:10:31.810
<v Speaker 2>So weird in MMA will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're kind of like,</v>

1695
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.823
<v Speaker 2>oh okay,</v>

1696
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.433

<v Speaker 2>I guess you never know anything because </v>

1699
01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:42.520
<v Speaker 2>you're only looking at the guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UFC right now and there's a whole</v>

<v Speaker 2>And the 135 pound division and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top contenders now instantly.</v>

1710
01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with one standout performance,</v>

1711
01:11:09.251 --> 01:11:10.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's just good,</v>

1712
01:11:10.330 --> 01:11:12.370
<v Speaker 2>there'll be more divisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you were kind of talking about that</v>

1713
01:11:12.371 --> 01:11:13.440
<v Speaker 2>when we were at the store the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

1714
01:11:13.441 --> 01:11:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Like you want to see more divisions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Emma,</v>

1715
01:11:15.631 --> 01:11:17.460
<v Speaker 2>there'll be more divisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more fighters I think.</v>

1716
01:11:17.461 --> 01:11:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

1717
01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:19.403
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There hasn't been enough progress in </v>

1718
01:11:20.431 --> 01:11:21.264
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think that this should be a </v>

1719
01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:23.700
<v Speaker 2>weight class every 10 pounds.</v>

1720
01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.860
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of,</v>

1721
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:28.650
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of opportunities for not </v>
<v Speaker 2>just more champions,</v>

1722
01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:29.484
<v Speaker 2>which I think is better for the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but guys to be able to fight in their </v>

1723
01:11:32.191 --> 01:11:33.960
<v Speaker 2>actual weight class would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive.</v>

1724
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.230
<v Speaker 2>There's some gaps like 85 to two oh five</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1725
01:11:37.231 --> 01:11:38.640
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big gap.</v>

1726
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.430
<v Speaker 2>That is a giant gap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 20 pound gap.</v>

1727
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:43.380
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most guys,</v>

1728
01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:44.850
<v Speaker 2>they're probably going to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle.</v>

1729
01:11:44.851 --> 01:11:49.851
<v Speaker 2>So if you had an 85 and 95 and a two o </v>
<v Speaker 2>five that's where it should be.</v>

1730
01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:50.881
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1731
01:11:50.881 --> 01:11:52.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how boxing does.</v>

1732
01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:53.604
<v Speaker 2>And also I think it gives you much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity for you guys to fight </v>

1733
01:11:58.261 --> 01:12:00.420
<v Speaker 2>champion versus champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1734
01:12:00.421 --> 01:12:03.720
<v Speaker 2>and to move up or move down like fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>easily.</v>

1735
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:04.703
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got an 85 can move down to 75 ways </v>

1736
01:12:07.111 --> 01:12:10.890
<v Speaker 2>or than an 85 could go up to two oh five</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they could go back and forth and you</v>

1737
01:12:10.891 --> 01:12:14.760
<v Speaker 2>could have some like really awesome a </v>
<v Speaker 2>title unification bouts or you know,</v>

1738
01:12:14.761 --> 01:12:16.260
<v Speaker 2>champion versus champion bounce.</v>

1739
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.951
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1740
01:12:16.951 --> 01:12:18.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I agree with that.</v>

1741
01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:18.811
<v Speaker 2>And I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1742
01:12:18.811 --> 01:12:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I liked seeing the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like seeing the weight class.</v>

1743
01:12:20.941 --> 01:12:22.740
<v Speaker 2>I love Khan are moving up to fight nate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1744
01:12:22.741 --> 01:12:24.360
<v Speaker 2>although I guess you don't need more </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight classes.</v>

1745
01:12:24.361 --> 01:12:27.030
<v Speaker 2>You went up to one 70 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't even a move up.</v>

1746
01:12:27.031 --> 01:12:28.980
<v Speaker 2>That was just like it let's not cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1747
01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it wasn't move up and tell me,</v>

1748
01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.660
<v Speaker 2>am I crazy about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why I,</v>

1749
01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:36.240
<v Speaker 2>I've wondered this a lot and I've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>really gotten a good answer on it,</v>

1750
01:12:36.241 --> 01:12:38.790
<v Speaker 2>but why do we have the weight cuts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1751
01:12:38.791 --> 01:12:39.624
<v Speaker 2>why don't we just weigh in an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the event because you want to be </v>

1752
01:12:42.201 --> 01:12:43.740
<v Speaker 2>hundred yourself before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

1753
01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:46.110
<v Speaker 2>but this dangerous guys are still going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to cut weight.</v>

1754
01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.033
<v Speaker 2>That's how guys die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys die from being dehydrated and </v>

1755
01:12:49.831 --> 01:12:50.664
<v Speaker 2>getting hit in the head.</v>

1756
01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:52.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can definitely die from just </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting hit in the head,</v>

1757
01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:54.390
<v Speaker 2>but isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't it add,</v>

1758
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:55.343
<v Speaker 2>and maybe this is just stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wouldn't it regulate itself because </v>

1759
01:12:57.781 --> 01:12:58.614
<v Speaker 2>it's like if the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the Wayans an hour before the fights </v>

1760
01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.433
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to dehydrate yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get fucked up in the </v>

1761
01:13:03.691 --> 01:13:04.524
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not going to have time to </v>

1762
01:13:05.401 --> 01:13:06.234
<v Speaker 2>replenish yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why do this whole thing where we're </v>

1763
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:11.550
<v Speaker 2>weighing in and out 24 hours before guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>are dehydrating themselves,</v>

1764
01:13:11.551 --> 01:13:13.520
<v Speaker 2>then refuel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not just fight the way connor,</v>

1765
01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:15.540
<v Speaker 2>nate fought to very good point and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>hydrated.</v>

1766
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.673
<v Speaker 2>It's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another point could be to outlaw weight </v>

1767
01:13:19.831 --> 01:13:20.664
<v Speaker 2>cutting entirely and to check people all</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout camp and to make match ups </v>

1768
01:13:24.271 --> 01:13:26.090
<v Speaker 2>based on size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like look at,</v>

1769
01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:27.300
<v Speaker 2>look at two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1770
01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:28.830
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you walk around that?</v>

1771
01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:30.450
<v Speaker 2>What do you walk around that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1772
01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:32.250
<v Speaker 2>you guys will be fighting at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>

1773
01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the weight is when you're in</v>

1774
01:13:34.501 --> 01:13:35.370
<v Speaker 2>best shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1775
01:13:35.371 --> 01:13:38.100
<v Speaker 2>if you get down to one 75 when you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your best shape,</v>

1776
01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:40.260
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tell us what that number is,</v>

1777
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:42.510
<v Speaker 2>tell us what that number is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll match you up accordingly.</v>

1778
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:46.410
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to chess people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hydration levels all throughout camp.</v>

1779
01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:48.040
<v Speaker 2>We're going to show up just like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>sought it,</v>

1780
01:13:48.041 --> 01:13:50.870
<v Speaker 2>does and test you for drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to make you get on a scale.</v>

1781
01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.713
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to test your hydration levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you're at a a reasonably </v>

1782
01:13:54.271 --> 01:13:56.580
<v Speaker 2>hydrated level where it's healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your weight,</v>

1783
01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.800
<v Speaker 2>that's what you weigh now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to lose weight,</v>

1784
01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:01.530
<v Speaker 2>you better lose weight by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better do some extra running and you</v>

1785
01:14:01.531 --> 01:14:04.530
<v Speaker 2>better drop some body fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to be dehydrated.</v>

1786
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1787
01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:07.050
<v Speaker 2>seeing as how we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can figure all that stuff out.</v>

1788
01:14:07.051 --> 01:14:08.700
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like there'd be an easier </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer.</v>

1789
01:14:08.701 --> 01:14:09.211
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1790
01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Obviously there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the commissions in the way,</v>

1791
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.823
<v Speaker 2>which I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in any government </v>

1792
01:14:13.061 --> 01:14:13.894
<v Speaker 2>regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think they should be there </v>

1793
01:14:14.501 --> 01:14:16.660
<v Speaker 2>for any commission has done a fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

1794
01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:18.670
<v Speaker 2>California Commission Commissions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no joke.</v>

1795
01:14:18.671 --> 01:14:20.380
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy foster who runs it,</v>

1796
01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:25.570
<v Speaker 2>I think he runs a great organization and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he did was the opposite approach.</v>

1797
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.570
<v Speaker 2>He let them weigh in from 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>AM to 2:00</v>

1798
01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:30.100
<v Speaker 2>PM he gave him an open window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1799
01:14:30.101 --> 01:14:31.120
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be open.</v>

1800
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Just come down to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want,</v>

1801
01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:36.010
<v Speaker 2>this is what he didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want guys dehydrated standing</v>

1802
01:14:36.011 --> 01:14:38.650
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weakening themselves for that one moment</v>

1803
01:14:38.651 --> 01:14:41.500
<v Speaker 2>where they have to stand on on the scale</v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of a camera.</v>

1804
01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:43.870
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all an artificially orchestrated</v>

1805
01:14:43.871 --> 01:14:44.621
<v Speaker 2>event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1806
01:14:44.621 --> 01:14:46.210
<v Speaker 2>how about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll have them,</v>

1807
01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:47.163
<v Speaker 2>they'll come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have athletic commission officers </v>

1808
01:14:49.271 --> 01:14:52.150
<v Speaker 2>ready on standby all morning for these </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys to weigh in.</v>

1809
01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.650
<v Speaker 2>They come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weigh in.</v>

1810
01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:56.350
<v Speaker 2>Then once we record it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure they're cool,</v>

1811
01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:59.110
<v Speaker 2>they can rehydrate and they have many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many more hours to rehydrate.</v>

1812
01:14:59.290 --> 01:15:02.080
<v Speaker 2>So guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're rehydrating six hours earlier.</v>

1813
01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:03.093
<v Speaker 2>Most of the guys showed up at 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>AM they made weight and then they had </v>

1814
01:15:06.041 --> 01:15:06.874
<v Speaker 2>way more time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you saw people stand on the </v>

1815
01:15:08.111 --> 01:15:10.510
<v Speaker 2>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was saying official weight,</v>

1816
01:15:10.570 --> 01:15:13.000
<v Speaker 2>when I was announcing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had weighed in at 10 o'clock in the</v>

1817
01:15:13.001 --> 01:15:15.100
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was already four in the afternoon.</v>

1818
01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:18.550
<v Speaker 2>These guys were hydrated and thick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one looks sick.</v>

1819
01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.490
<v Speaker 2>So at least visually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one looked like,</v>

1820
01:15:21.491 --> 01:15:22.324
<v Speaker 2>like conor mcgregor looked when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought Chad Mendez when they weighed in </v>

1821
01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:25.510
<v Speaker 2>and he looked like a dead man.</v>

1822
01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Dead man cheeks were all sucked in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks horrible.</v>

1823
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:30.221
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1824
01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:31.660
<v Speaker 2>you did good in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1825
01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.040
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really did.</v>

1826
01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.590
<v Speaker 2>He cuts a lot to get to one 45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a big boy.</v>

1827
01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.320
<v Speaker 2>He's a big boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's way bigger than,</v>

1828
01:15:38.321 --> 01:15:40.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Jose Aldo and Josie all was cutting</v>

1829
01:15:40.691 --> 01:15:42.070
<v Speaker 2>a lot at one point in his career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1830
01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:43.030
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>

1831
01:15:43.290 --> 01:15:46.000
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a hardcore fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never enjoyed the fight more than I</v>

1832
01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:47.650
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed nate Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conor mcgregor.</v>

1833
01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:49.240
<v Speaker 2>I was turning over lots of my mind so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

1834
01:15:49.241 --> 01:15:50.130
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1835
01:15:50.131 --> 01:15:52.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a huge Diaz Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1836
01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.650
<v Speaker 2>And that was just incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1837
01:15:53.651 --> 01:15:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm 10 days notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1838
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Well that whole um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two card or that to fight,</v>

1839
01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>event,</v>

1840
01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:01.120
<v Speaker 2>the two fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the final fights,</v>

1841
01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:02.133
<v Speaker 2>the Holly Holm you should take was one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the most exciting endings to any </v>

1842
01:16:04.061 --> 01:16:04.894
<v Speaker 2>fight ever.</v>

1843
01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:05.763
<v Speaker 2>When Misha took holly down in the fifth </v>
<v Speaker 2>round a fight when she was losing it </v>

1844
01:16:08.171 --> 01:16:10.720
<v Speaker 2>took her back and choked her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

1845
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I read an article today where someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying that it was,</v>

1846
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:15.370
<v Speaker 2>that me should loss virtually every </v>
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>

1847
01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:17.980
<v Speaker 2>It was from a guy I respect a writer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wanted the second,</v>

1848
01:16:17.981 --> 01:16:18.920
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

1849
01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:21.040
<v Speaker 2>The second round she took her down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounded her.</v>

1850
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I think they did they give her a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

1851
01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:23.640
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't just get,</v>

1852
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:25.360
<v Speaker 2>and they should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she dominated.</v>

1853
01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:26.283
<v Speaker 2>So I read this article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is espn writer wrote it and I was </v>

1854
01:16:27.821 --> 01:16:28.780
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute man.</v>

1855
01:16:28.781 --> 01:16:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say that like,</v>

1856
01:16:29.861 --> 01:16:31.200
<v Speaker 2>why are you saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>

1857
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:32.960
<v Speaker 2>that's silly hyperbole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1858
01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.660
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1859
01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:40.150
<v Speaker 2>and me show it was threatening in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>third and fourth after that holly was on</v>

1860
01:16:40.151 --> 01:16:40.530
<v Speaker 2>her bike.</v>

1861
01:16:40.530 --> 01:16:41.650
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>

1862
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:42.783
<v Speaker 2>Like she was fighting perfect and super </v>
<v Speaker 2>cautious with no chances and barely </v>

1863
01:16:46.181 --> 01:16:47.220
<v Speaker 2>winning those rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1864
01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.270
<v Speaker 2>just winning them but barely winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't nothing,</v>

1865
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:51.130
<v Speaker 2>nothing big happened and definitely no </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat.</v>

1866
01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:54.730
<v Speaker 2>So that victory when Miesha tate choked </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1867
01:16:54.731 --> 01:16:55.564
<v Speaker 2>holly and Holly's punching in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how fucking dramatic is that going </v>

1868
01:16:58.271 --> 01:17:00.910
<v Speaker 2>out cold punching in the air while she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going out.</v>

1869
01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:01.983
<v Speaker 2>And then nate beating up connor and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>second round after he gets fucked up in </v>

1870
01:17:05.351 --> 01:17:06.184
<v Speaker 2>the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beating him up in the second round and </v>

1871
01:17:07.931 --> 01:17:09.410
<v Speaker 2>then choking him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1872
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:11.410
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably what two,</v>

1873
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:13.670
<v Speaker 2>two of the most exciting finishes to any</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight ever.</v>

1874
01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:14.563
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the corner thing was just insane </v>

1875
01:17:16.281 --> 01:17:18.330
<v Speaker 2>because he was on a tear that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1876
01:17:18.370 --> 01:17:21.590
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest tears and MMA history</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1877
01:17:21.650 --> 01:17:22.820
<v Speaker 2>to watch it go down like that.</v>

1878
01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:23.653
<v Speaker 2>Especially like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he was winning the fight and then </v>

1879
01:17:24.771 --> 01:17:28.310
<v Speaker 2>nate turns it around and it was almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>like on a drop of a dime,</v>

1880
01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:29.300
<v Speaker 2>like nay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nay,</v>

1881
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:32.600
<v Speaker 2>like came to life in that second round </v>
<v Speaker 2>and starts talking shit.</v>

1882
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:34.620
<v Speaker 2>So it was really fun in a home for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

1883
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hit him with that big one too and it</v>

1884
01:17:36.951 --> 01:17:37.784
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1885
01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:40.610
<v Speaker 2>has a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one to two.</v>

1886
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:44.180
<v Speaker 2>He like whap and then he liked slithers </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1887
01:17:44.181 --> 01:17:46.670
<v Speaker 2>You can't find them with the counter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really good.</v>

1888
01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:47.533
<v Speaker 2>And there's no one worse than a nate or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz to get hurt by in a fight </v>

1889
01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.990
<v Speaker 2>because once they hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just like,</v>

1890
01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:54.853
<v Speaker 2>they push a pace and then when you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt they like pick it up and pick it </v>

1891
01:17:57.441 --> 01:17:58.251
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden,</v>

1892
01:17:58.251 --> 01:17:59.084
<v Speaker 2>I mean before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conner's hit like 25 fucking times on </v>

1893
01:18:01.821 --> 01:18:03.410
<v Speaker 2>the feet and he's shooting for a take </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1894
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:04.303
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are always doing triathlons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though nate is like you're </v>

1895
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.430
<v Speaker 2>taking that fight in 11 days notice and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't in shape,</v>

1896
01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.250
<v Speaker 2>he's still in way better shape than most</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1897
01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.100
<v Speaker 2>So like him going five rounds is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfeasible.</v>

1898
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.963
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not outside of the realm of </v>

1899
01:18:17.841 --> 01:18:19.670
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in shape.</v>

1900
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.593
<v Speaker 2>He's just not the kind of shape that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be when they have a </v>

1901
01:18:22.311 --> 01:18:26.120
<v Speaker 2>rematch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that becomes a real fucking problem.</v>

1902
01:18:26.121 --> 01:18:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think he's going to beat him up </v>
<v Speaker 2>again with nate sad.</v>

1903
01:18:28.421 --> 01:18:29.480
<v Speaker 2>He's like goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1904
01:18:29.481 --> 01:18:30.380
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had a camp,</v>

1905
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:31.910
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't have fucking touch me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1906
01:18:31.911 --> 01:18:35.360
<v Speaker 2>my plan was to go out slow in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>round and he came out fast enough in the</v>

1907
01:18:35.361 --> 01:18:37.400
<v Speaker 2>first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got tagged a couple times.</v>

1908
01:18:37.401 --> 01:18:38.630
<v Speaker 2>But that's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

1909
01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Stick to the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick to the plan.</v>

1910
01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:41.293
<v Speaker 2>And then the second round it starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>loosening up and opening up and conor </v>

1911
01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:44.240
<v Speaker 2>was just dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1912
01:18:44.241 --> 01:18:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Well I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people are talking to nate about,</v>

1913
01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.330
<v Speaker 2>cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going into that fight,</v>

1914
01:18:47.331 --> 01:18:49.520
<v Speaker 2>like Connor's power was what a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were talking about.</v>

1915
01:18:49.521 --> 01:18:49.731
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1916
01:18:49.731 --> 01:18:53.280
<v Speaker 2>we put one punch on Josie Aldos Chin and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's out and he's talking,</v>

1917
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:54.650
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't handle my power.</v>

1918
01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:56.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't do courses as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1919
01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:57.263
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nate was saying in one of the post </v>

1920
01:18:58.791 --> 01:18:59.624
<v Speaker 2>fight interviews where it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm spoiling with Andre Ward and Joe </v>

1922
01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:05.804
<v Speaker 2>boxers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing you're going to hit him </v>

1923
01:19:07.851 --> 01:19:11.220
<v Speaker 2>with that he hasn't seen or kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealt with when he's,</v>

1924
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:12.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1925
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:14.240

<v Speaker 2>kickboxing.</v>

1930
01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:20.773

1931
01:19:22.641 --> 01:19:27.410

<v Speaker 2>regular basis.</v>

1933
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Andre Ward,</v>

<v Speaker 2>One of the slickest said that nate gives</v>

1935
01:19:39.351 --> 01:19:40.820
<v Speaker 2>as good as it gets when they split.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1936
01:19:40.890 --> 01:19:42.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

1937
01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.000
<v Speaker 2>And I think Joe Schilling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be getting it,</v>

1938
01:19:44.001 --> 01:19:44.834
<v Speaker 2>but I think Joe Schilling said he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>never hurt either one of them in a </v>

1939
01:19:46.461 --> 01:19:47.294
<v Speaker 2>sparring session.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he said that on a fighter and </v>

1940
01:19:49.131 --> 01:19:49.690
<v Speaker 2>the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1941
01:19:49.690 --> 01:19:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I believe it man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tough fucking dudes,</v>

1942
01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:53.210
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tough fucking dudes.</v>

1943
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:54.223
<v Speaker 2>But what's fascinating to me is that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to jump right back in there and </v>

1944
01:19:58.341 --> 01:20:00.530
<v Speaker 2>do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that nate wanted to,</v>

1945
01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:03.110
<v Speaker 2>or that I'm connor wanted to just run it</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and I was like,</v>

1946
01:20:03.111 --> 01:20:04.850
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

1947
01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:08.460
<v Speaker 2>It seems weird that he gets to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not so much that he wants to,</v>

1948
01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:10.200
<v Speaker 2>but it just seems weird that they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1949
01:20:10.201 --> 01:20:11.034
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even when Dana White was talking </v>

1950
01:20:11.551 --> 01:20:12.540
<v Speaker 2>about in his like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>

1951
01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:14.550
<v Speaker 2>we tried to convince them to go down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>one 45.</v>

1952
01:20:14.551 --> 01:20:15.640
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nate's the y'all.</v>

1953
01:20:15.641 --> 01:20:16.021
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1954
01:20:16.021 --> 01:20:18.930
<v Speaker 2>he's the matchmaker now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just gets to go let them.</v>

1955
01:20:18.931 --> 01:20:20.670
<v Speaker 2>If you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to make a ton of money,</v>

1956
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:21.181
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

1957
01:20:21.181 --> 01:20:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I believe in the market and that guy's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy's what people want to see.</v>

1958
01:20:24.450 --> 01:20:26.580
<v Speaker 2>He can do what he can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever he wants to do,</v>

1959
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:27.643
<v Speaker 2>it's going to get a big pay day off it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not just that the emperor has </v>

1960
01:20:30.061 --> 01:20:32.100
<v Speaker 2>been stripped down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1961
01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:34.650
<v Speaker 2>So now he's exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now someone's beating them.</v>

1962
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.410
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do now?</v>

1963
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:39.030
<v Speaker 2>You want to make money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1964
01:20:39.031 --> 01:20:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Cause if you want to make money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make the biggest fight you can right</v>

1965
01:20:41.371 --> 01:20:44.970
<v Speaker 2>now while he's been exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the biggest fight for sure,</v>

1966
01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.110
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I say expose,</v>

1967
01:20:46.111 --> 01:20:48.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean he's not talented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean exposed,</v>

1968
01:20:48.321 --> 01:20:52.290
<v Speaker 2>meaning he's a human and he can lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that happens with every fighter they</v>

1969
01:20:52.291 --> 01:20:53.430
<v Speaker 2>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once they lose,</v>

1970
01:20:53.431 --> 01:20:55.170
<v Speaker 2>people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1971
01:20:55.171 --> 01:20:57.030
<v Speaker 2>you can be beat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1972
01:20:57.031 --> 01:20:57.864
<v Speaker 2>we saw it with Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You saw it with Mike Tyson when after </v>

1973
01:21:00.541 --> 01:21:02.760
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson fight buster Douglas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a different world.</v>

1974
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:04.440
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1975
01:21:04.441 --> 01:21:06.810
<v Speaker 2>he's human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I say exposed,</v>

1976
01:21:06.811 --> 01:21:09.570
<v Speaker 2>not in a disrespectful way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but got exposed.</v>

1977
01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:10.433
<v Speaker 2>He lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got choked out and got beaten up on </v>

1978
01:21:11.281 --> 01:21:13.080
<v Speaker 2>the ground and then he got choked out </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>

1979
01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.273
<v Speaker 2>So this is not an invulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect fighter who's unbelievably </v>

1980
01:21:17.491 --> 01:21:18.610
<v Speaker 2>durable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1981
01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Who can take punishment like no man.</v>

1982
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:21.623
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of those guys in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's champions like that in the UFC </v>

1983
01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:26.640
<v Speaker 2>that are like Robbie lawler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably durable.</v>

1984
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:30.270
<v Speaker 2>You can't put him away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hard to put that guy away.</v>

1985
01:21:30.570 --> 01:21:33.120
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about a guy got dinged up,</v>

1986
01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:35.330
<v Speaker 2>shot for a Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wide open take down,</v>

1987
01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:36.293
<v Speaker 2>take him down and got demolished on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and got choked unconscious </v>

1988
01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:40.530
<v Speaker 2>quickly afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1989
01:21:40.970 --> 01:21:41.803
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

1990
01:21:42.150 --> 01:21:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Could that happen with dos Anjos fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yad could dosantos could do that too.</v>

1991
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:47.520
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1992
01:21:47.521 --> 01:21:48.930
<v Speaker 2>condom might knock 'em out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never know.</v>

1993
01:21:48.931 --> 01:21:49.764
<v Speaker 2>Conner does have that punch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to put him in against nate </v>

1994
01:21:53.161 --> 01:21:54.720
<v Speaker 2>again because that's the big money </v>
<v Speaker 2>rematch.</v>

1995
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:55.583
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this guy turns out to be a guy who's </v>

1996
01:21:58.171 --> 01:22:01.500
<v Speaker 2>going to win some and lose some and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of his career,</v>

1997
01:22:01.501 --> 01:22:04.740
<v Speaker 2>this unbeatable wild Celtic warrior </v>
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>

1998
01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's all gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's champ.</v>

1999
01:22:06.961 --> 01:22:09.330
<v Speaker 2>He's still got a belt at one 45 yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so,</v>

2000
01:22:09.331 --> 01:22:12.390
<v Speaker 2>it's almost kind of like a weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>position for now.</v>

2001
01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:13.890
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's my question.</v>

2002
01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.620
<v Speaker 2>When I say for now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you really keep banking that weight?</v>

2003
01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:17.730
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2004
01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:18.573
<v Speaker 2>I've wondered about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard some people have argued with </v>

2005
01:22:20.401 --> 01:22:21.001
<v Speaker 2>me saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2006
01:22:21.001 --> 01:22:22.380
<v Speaker 2>he can make the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause he was,</v>

2007
01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.510
<v Speaker 2>he was what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He one 69 against.</v>

2008
01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:27.270
<v Speaker 2>So they're saying he basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he starts at and he can just</v>

2009
01:22:27.271 --> 01:22:28.980
<v Speaker 2>cut down from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>

2010
01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:31.200
<v Speaker 2>But look what he looked like at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the way in.</v>

2011
01:22:31.201 --> 01:22:33.030
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he kind of,</v>

2012
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.910
<v Speaker 2>he definitely can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's physically possible.</v>

2013
01:22:35.911 --> 01:22:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I was so looking forward to the press </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference though,</v>

2014
01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:40.860
<v Speaker 2>just because I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2015
01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:45.240
<v Speaker 2>you've got this guy in connor who's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate shit talker and then you've</v>

2016
01:22:45.241 --> 01:22:47.160
<v Speaker 2>got nate who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first,</v>

2017
01:22:47.161 --> 01:22:49.350
<v Speaker 2>the dynamic of the first press </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference was amazing.</v>

2018
01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:52.290
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at that moment when he was just like</v>

2019
01:22:52.291 --> 01:22:55.260
<v Speaker 2>kind of talking circles around nate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they just broke and he goes,</v>

2020
01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:57.750
<v Speaker 2>how about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you fuck your belt.</v>

2021
01:22:57.751 --> 01:23:00.360
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this press conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they just went to gangster on them.</v>

2022
01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:01.613
<v Speaker 2>But now like how can con I was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested like how can he show up and </v>

2023
01:23:05.651 --> 01:23:06.930
<v Speaker 2>talk shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2024
01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:10.330
<v Speaker 2>When nate's got the perfect rebuttal </v>
<v Speaker 2>that anything he has to say,</v>

2025
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:11.223
<v Speaker 2>okay John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 days [inaudible] st all kinds of </v>

2026
01:23:12.311 --> 01:23:14.620
<v Speaker 2>crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the first eight minutes were easy,</v>

2027
01:23:15.450 --> 01:23:17.590
<v Speaker 2>eh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2028
01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:19.740
<v Speaker 2>But here's the difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first day I,</v>

2029
01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:22.330
<v Speaker 2>her last three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last three were a lot worse.</v>

2030
01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were awful.</v>

2031
01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:25.390
<v Speaker 2>Like you got fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2032
01:23:25.391 --> 01:23:26.224
<v Speaker 2>Do you got to just accept that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's part of his thing is that he </v>

2033
01:23:29.051 --> 01:23:34.040
<v Speaker 2>has to like look at things in the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive light possible.</v>

2034
01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.440
<v Speaker 2>And Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2035
01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think stylistically it's a troublesome</v>

2036
01:23:38.201 --> 01:23:39.034
<v Speaker 2>fight for him because nate is a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>clever boxer and his ground game is a </v>

2037
01:23:42.161 --> 01:23:44.710
<v Speaker 2>world away from where connor is right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2038
01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:48.610
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen nate role with guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking legit,</v>

2039
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:52.900
<v Speaker 2>very high level Brazilian Jiu Jitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>black belt under a very respected camp.</v>

2040
01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.930
<v Speaker 2>His cardio was outstanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his boxing's nasty.</v>

2041
01:23:55.931 --> 01:23:58.330
<v Speaker 2>So where's Connor's shining?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way I think,</v>

2042
01:23:58.331 --> 01:23:59.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's like,</v>

2043
01:23:59.171 --> 01:23:59.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2044
01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:02.800
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to like fight a diaz </v>
<v Speaker 2>brother and beat them.</v>

2045
01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:06.250
<v Speaker 2>You usually when people beat them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like they really stick to a</v>

2046
01:24:06.251 --> 01:24:07.084
<v Speaker 2>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to kind of take them down and </v>

2047
01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:11.350
<v Speaker 2>avoid submissions or like leg kick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>circle.</v>

2048
01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I hope on Joe's beat him up in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what,</v>

2049
01:24:14.651 --> 01:24:16.690
<v Speaker 2>there's also different show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2050
01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:17.620
<v Speaker 2>there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2051
01:24:17.621 --> 01:24:18.610
<v Speaker 2>different camps.</v>

2052
01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:19.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're coming in,</v>

2053
01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:22.120
<v Speaker 2>who knows what kind of fucking injuries </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with.</v>

2054
01:24:22.121 --> 01:24:25.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see a guy like nate come in and look</v>

2055
01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:27.970
<v Speaker 2>really kind of lackadaisical against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2056
01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:29.243
<v Speaker 2>Hoffeld dos Anjos den.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see him come back and look shredded </v>

2057
01:24:32.171 --> 01:24:34.060
<v Speaker 2>against Michael Johnson and looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensational.</v>

2058
01:24:34.061 --> 01:24:34.894
<v Speaker 2>So you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2059
01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:37.180
<v Speaker 2>that's what he's capable of when he's on</v>
<v Speaker 2>and focus,</v>

2060
01:24:37.181 --> 01:24:38.830
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be ready for that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

2061
01:24:38.831 --> 01:24:39.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the best he's ever looked at.</v>

2062
01:24:39.971 --> 01:24:41.330
<v Speaker 2>You and Michael Johnson fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2063
01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:44.140
<v Speaker 2>You can't think that the guy who lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>dos Anjos is showing up.</v>

2064
01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:45.243
<v Speaker 2>You got to think of the guy that came </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and swarmed cowboy in the first </v>

2065
01:24:47.171 --> 01:24:48.520
<v Speaker 2>round is coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2066
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:52.600
<v Speaker 2>that guy's a clever fucking boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where does connor shine?</v>

2067
01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Knock out power?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where he shines.</v>

2068
01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Like connor can dead dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he couldn't do it.</v>

2069
01:24:58.340 --> 01:24:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're tough to hit.</v>

2070
01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.930
<v Speaker 2>They have great head movement and Green </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chins and they there,</v>

2071
01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.160
<v Speaker 2>they roll with punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2072
01:25:03.161 --> 01:25:06.340
<v Speaker 2>the only guy to ever stopped nate was </v>
<v Speaker 2>Josh Thompson and Josh did.</v>

2073
01:25:06.341 --> 01:25:09.370
<v Speaker 2>It was a brutal head kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Josh Thompson to this day,</v>

2074
01:25:09.371 --> 01:25:11.620
<v Speaker 2>I say it's one of the most underrated </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

2075
01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.020
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did the stars,</v>

2076
01:25:14.021 --> 01:25:14.854
<v Speaker 2>did not align for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he could have easily been a UFC </v>

2077
01:25:16.391 --> 01:25:17.224
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was champion a strikeforce and with </v>

2078
01:25:19.391 --> 01:25:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Gilbert and him and Gilbert went back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth,</v>

2079
01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:23.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Josh Thompson's worldclass fighters.</v>

2080
01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:25.960
<v Speaker 2>So when Josh Thompson head kicked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2081
01:25:25.961 --> 01:25:28.810
<v Speaker 2>it's like Josh to do that to anybody in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that division and then it catches you.</v>

2082
01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:30.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>

2083
01:25:30.370 --> 01:25:33.290
<v Speaker 2>He sees the older now and he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2084
01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a guy that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

2085
01:25:35.231 --> 01:25:39.370
<v Speaker 2>the stars didn't like perfectly aligned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like skill wise and technique wise,</v>

2086
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:43.480
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking world class fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he knocked out nate Diaz,</v>

2087
01:25:43.481 --> 01:25:47.680
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily an indication that </v>
<v Speaker 2>nate diaz has done because just,</v>

2088
01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:49.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how good Josh Thompson is.</v>

2089
01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the time,</v>

2090
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:52.690
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so nate rebounds from that.</v>

2091
01:25:52.691 --> 01:25:55.050
<v Speaker 2>And I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at like the losses,</v>

2092
01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:57.640
<v Speaker 2>like the Dos Anjos fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you look at that,</v>

2093
01:25:57.641 --> 01:25:59.680
<v Speaker 2>the Josh Thomson fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you go,</v>

2094
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:01.030
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how good is he?</v>

2095
01:26:01.031 --> 01:26:02.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could beat that guy.</v>

2096
01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 2>But then you look at the Michael Johnson</v>
<v Speaker 2>finding</v>

2097
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:06.770
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh that that guy is fucking dangerous.</v>

2098
01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Jim Miller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serone exactly.</v>

2099
01:26:08.751 --> 01:26:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Lot of these fights where he just </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>

2100
01:26:11.410 --> 01:26:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think uh,</v>

2101
01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:14.543
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things were styles </v>

2102
01:26:15.321 --> 01:26:16.154
<v Speaker 1>make fights and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of really gotten people's heads by </v>

2103
01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:19.340
<v Speaker 1>talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I felt like going in,</v>

2104
01:26:19.341 --> 01:26:20.174
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're going to get in </v>

2105
01:26:20.331 --> 01:26:22.730
<v Speaker 1>nate's head by talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not that guy.</v>

2106
01:26:23.090 --> 01:26:23.923
<v Speaker 1>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My crew will fuck up your whole crew </v>

2107
01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:27.830
<v Speaker 1>gangster thing you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2108
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:30.200
<v Speaker 1>that's the most gangster thing cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's literally just going,</v>

2109
01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:33.890
<v Speaker 1>we'll fucking jump you like we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing around here.</v>

2110
01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:36.050
<v Speaker 1>And all those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the guys who seem like kind of Nice</v>

2111
01:26:36.051 --> 01:26:37.850
<v Speaker 1>guys in his team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like jake shields,</v>

2112
01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:38.953
<v Speaker 1>you feel like he'll fucking jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are fuck area and it'll kick </v>

2113
01:26:41.781 --> 01:26:42.614
<v Speaker 1>your ass.</v>

2114
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:45.250
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's some breaking news.</v>

2115
01:26:45.251 --> 01:26:46.990
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since we've been going live.</v>

2116
01:26:46.991 --> 01:26:51.991
<v Speaker 2>The first one is this UFC lifts ban and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reporter Ariel Helwani.</v>

2117
01:26:52.810 --> 01:26:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh the second one is a little less </v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting.</v>

2118
01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:57.791
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

2119
01:26:57.791 --> 01:26:58.624
<v Speaker 2>Go back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says reported that wrestler Brock </v>

2120
01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Lesnar's didn't talks for attorney UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>200 preempting a UFC announcement.</v>

2121
01:27:05.711 --> 01:27:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Officials issued a life band against </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

2122
01:27:08.141 --> 01:27:10.420
<v Speaker 2>The organization reverse a decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>Monday.</v>

2123
01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:12.653
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of cool because that means </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like public support made them lift </v>

2124
01:27:16.901 --> 01:27:17.734
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also must mean that they worked </v>

2125
01:27:19.871 --> 01:27:20.704
<v Speaker 2>out whatever the fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See this is what they were saying and </v>

2126
01:27:24.190 --> 01:27:26.170
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm hearing.</v>

2127
01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just,</v>

2128
01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't talked to Ariel,</v>

2129
01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.090
<v Speaker 2>but let me just give you the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

2130
01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:33.850
<v Speaker 2>The UFC perspective was that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mole.</v>

2131
01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.073
<v Speaker 2>They believe that someone was giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ariel information and that information </v>

2132
01:27:38.651 --> 01:27:42.040
<v Speaker 2>he was using to scoop the UFC official </v>
<v Speaker 2>promotions.</v>

2133
01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:44.260
<v Speaker 2>So the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a private company,</v>

2134
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:46.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to have,</v>

2135
01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.900
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have to let people in to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2136
01:27:49.050 --> 01:27:49.883
<v Speaker 2>your business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your private companies to come and </v>

2137
01:27:51.161 --> 01:27:51.994
<v Speaker 2>report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they felt like he was somehow or </v>

2138
01:27:53.981 --> 01:27:56.460
<v Speaker 2>another getting ahold of this inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

2139
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:57.303
<v Speaker 2>releasing it and making them look bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I get the UFC is perspective that </v>

2140
01:28:01.931 --> 01:28:06.070
<v Speaker 2>they would want to know who the fuck is </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaking this secret information and that</v>

2141
01:28:06.071 --> 01:28:06.904
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want this guy taking that </v>

2142
01:28:08.741 --> 01:28:10.960
<v Speaker 2>information and then putting it live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2143
01:28:11.050 --> 01:28:13.570
<v Speaker 2>from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conversation with him was,</v>

2144
01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:15.333
<v Speaker 2>don't do this because if you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only a handful of people that </v>

2145
01:28:17.861 --> 01:28:18.694
<v Speaker 2>know this information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to fire everybody or </v>

2146
01:28:21.041 --> 01:28:23.380
<v Speaker 2>we're going to fire a bunch of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're gonna ruin people's lives.</v>

2147
01:28:23.890 --> 01:28:24.910
<v Speaker 2>This is what I was told.</v>

2148
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:27.820
<v Speaker 2>It was a conversation they had with him </v>
<v Speaker 2>after that conversation.</v>

2149
01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:31.630
<v Speaker 2>He leaked the brock lesnar stuff so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2150
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to talk to Arielle.</v>

2151
01:28:34.931 --> 01:28:37.480
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to get his opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to get the UFC as opinion.</v>

2152
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:38.583
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to get the two of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>together to debate whether or not which </v>

2153
01:28:41.411 --> 01:28:42.244
<v Speaker 2>story was true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is the side that you're not </v>

2154
01:28:44.651 --> 01:28:45.484
<v Speaker 2>hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all you're hearing is the UFC banned </v>

2155
01:28:46.961 --> 01:28:50.350
<v Speaker 2>him for life and everybody was upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I like Ariel.</v>

2156
01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:53.230
<v Speaker 2>I think errol is a very good reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a very bright guy.</v>

2157
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:56.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm good friends with his uncle Gad sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a,</v>

2158
01:28:56.171 --> 01:28:57.490
<v Speaker 2>a full disclosure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

2159
01:28:58.270 --> 01:28:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a brilliant,</v>

2160
01:28:59.261 --> 01:29:03.150
<v Speaker 2>brilliant professor in Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>

2161
01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:06.720
<v Speaker 2>So I like Ariel and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing was bumming me out.</v>

2162
01:29:06.721 --> 01:29:07.740
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at my twitter feed.</v>

2163
01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fucking.</v>

2164
01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:12.660
<v Speaker 2>But th there's certain things like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to kind of let the dust settle.</v>

2165
01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.000
<v Speaker 2>So the dust settled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lifted the ban.</v>

2166
01:29:15.210 --> 01:29:16.043
<v Speaker 2>I'm very happy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you gotta be careful when it comes </v>

2167
01:29:19.471 --> 01:29:20.304
<v Speaker 2>to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing about this leaking </v>

2168
01:29:21.721 --> 01:29:22.554
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say it was just doing his job </v>

2169
01:29:23.611 --> 01:29:24.780
<v Speaker 2>reporting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

2170
01:29:24.781 --> 01:29:25.614
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have to realize this isn't like </v>

2171
01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:30.890
<v Speaker 2>news that is not going to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to affect people's health.</v>

2172
01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:31.733
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to make an announcement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a private company that is </v>

2173
01:29:34.771 --> 01:29:37.320
<v Speaker 2>spending millions of dollars to promote </v>
<v Speaker 2>these events.</v>

2174
01:29:37.410 --> 01:29:41.820
<v Speaker 2>So all you're doing is just like getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>it on you.</v>

2175
01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:47.260
<v Speaker 2>You're taking the gun right out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>door and to the right hand side,</v>

2176
01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:49.310
<v Speaker 2>all you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

2177
01:29:49.311 --> 01:29:50.144
<v Speaker 2>if you're scooping it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you're shining the attention on </v>

2178
01:29:52.231 --> 01:29:55.490
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'd like Ariel for is not him shine</v>

2179
01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:56.550
<v Speaker 2>the attention on himself.</v>

2180
01:29:56.670 --> 01:29:57.503
<v Speaker 2>What I like aerial fours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a very bright guy and I </v>

2181
01:29:59.521 --> 01:30:00.354
<v Speaker 2>think he's very insightful when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fights and strategies and things </v>

2182
01:30:02.971 --> 01:30:03.804
<v Speaker 2>along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think it's important that he </v>

2183
01:30:06.631 --> 01:30:07.464
<v Speaker 2>break the news before the UFC does and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think if the UFC doesn't want him to do </v>

2184
01:30:11.281 --> 01:30:12.114
<v Speaker 2>that because this is private information</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a private company and they're trying </v>

2185
01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:17.370
<v Speaker 2>to control the press release,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy that.</v>

2186
01:30:17.371 --> 01:30:20.610
<v Speaker 2>That's necessarily like under the guise </v>
<v Speaker 2>of journalism.</v>

2187
01:30:20.611 --> 01:30:21.444
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some fuckery with that because </v>

2188
01:30:24.151 --> 01:30:26.040
<v Speaker 2>we're not talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh he,</v>

2189
01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:31.220
<v Speaker 2>he found out about some horrible thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened that someone's covering up</v>

2190
01:30:31.711 --> 01:30:32.544
<v Speaker 2>or he found out about corruption in </v>
<v Speaker 2>government or he found out about a </v>

2191
01:30:35.431 --> 01:30:37.380
<v Speaker 2>person got shot by the police.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't,</v>

2192
01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:40.140
<v Speaker 2>this is not like that kind of news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

2193
01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.490
<v Speaker 2>they're going to release it.</v>

2194
01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:42.593
<v Speaker 2>It's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just trying to do it before they </v>

2195
01:30:43.711 --> 01:30:47.250
<v Speaker 2>do it and you're finding it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's true that there's a mole,</v>

2196
01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:51.420
<v Speaker 2>you're finding it out through some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sneaky method that these people all</v>

2197
01:30:51.421 --> 01:30:54.570
<v Speaker 2>sign nondisclosure agreements and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all not supposed to release that</v>

2198
01:30:54.571 --> 01:30:58.200
<v Speaker 2>information because the UFC wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make that big cool announcement.</v>

2199
01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Now when that big cool announcement </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened at UFC one 99 I was working all</v>

2200
01:31:02.671 --> 01:31:04.320
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing commentary all day,</v>

2201
01:31:04.321 --> 01:31:07.800
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't go online and I wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading any of the MMA sites,</v>

2202
01:31:07.801 --> 01:31:09.930
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't know that Ariel had already </v>
<v Speaker 2>scooped it.</v>

2203
01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:13.080
<v Speaker 2>So when I saw that Promo and I saw brock</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lesnar,</v>

2204
01:31:13.081 --> 01:31:14.340
<v Speaker 2>can you see me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2205
01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.080
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>

2206
01:31:16.150 --> 01:31:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Was this real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

2207
01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.353
<v Speaker 2>Like that was a real reaction by me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no fucking idea whatsoever that </v>

2208
01:31:23.821 --> 01:31:26.970
<v Speaker 2>brock lesnar was going to be at UFC 200 </v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't either.</v>

2209
01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:28.500
<v Speaker 2>No one around me knew what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

2210
01:31:28.501 --> 01:31:31.920
<v Speaker 2>We didn't see the promo right in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what the UFC wanted.</v>

2211
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:32.783
<v Speaker 2>They wanted that and they felt like him </v>
<v Speaker 2>releasing that early ruin that for the </v>

2212
01:31:37.081 --> 01:31:40.590
<v Speaker 2>people that read his article and I see </v>
<v Speaker 2>their point of view,</v>

2213
01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:44.190
<v Speaker 2>I see their perspective and I also see </v>
<v Speaker 2>their perspective as a private company.</v>

2214
01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:45.173
<v Speaker 2>Now people are saying that he's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing his job and it's just journalism </v>

2215
01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:48.240
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

2216
01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:49.133
<v Speaker 2>this is not hidden information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not stuff that wasn't going to </v>

2217
01:31:52.501 --> 01:31:56.220
<v Speaker 2>come out for sure in a couple of hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew it was,</v>

2218
01:31:56.221 --> 01:31:57.054
<v Speaker 2>everybody knew it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a very tricky thing and it's </v>

2219
01:31:59.411 --> 01:32:00.244
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had apparently scooped nate diaz </v>

2220
01:32:02.410 --> 01:32:05.320
<v Speaker 2>versus conor Mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had done that and that was when,</v>

2221
01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:06.393
<v Speaker 2>this is again what I'm hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they had a talk with them they'll </v>

2222
01:32:09.191 --> 01:32:09.760
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2223
01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:10.593
<v Speaker 2>if you fucking do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to ruin people's lives </v>

2224
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.113
<v Speaker 2>because you're going to get people fired</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're going to find out who the </v>

2225
01:32:14.591 --> 01:32:15.370
<v Speaker 2>fuck did this.</v>

2226
01:32:15.370 --> 01:32:18.970
<v Speaker 2>There's only a small handful of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not coming from brock side.</v>

2227
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.460
<v Speaker 2>It's coming somehow or another from </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the organization.</v>

2228
01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:23.310
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't got no,</v>

2229
01:32:23.370 --> 01:32:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I got no problem with the UFC doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause,</v>

2230
01:32:25.181 --> 01:32:26.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean if everything we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2231
01:32:26.891 --> 01:32:28.270
<v Speaker 2>cause obviously I don't know all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

2232
01:32:28.271 --> 01:32:29.410
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your company,</v>

2233
01:32:29.411 --> 01:32:30.760
<v Speaker 2>it's your information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2234
01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.430
<v Speaker 2>you have a right to tell your employees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't give this out.</v>

2235
01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:37.060
<v Speaker 2>And if there's evidence that one of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what I'm gonna fire that guy.</v>

2236
01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

2237
01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:39.520
<v Speaker 2>this is the most important part of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>

2238
01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:42.310
<v Speaker 2>This is not a free speech thing is not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of the press thing.</v>

2239
01:32:42.311 --> 01:32:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Cause we're not saying that he somehow </v>
<v Speaker 2>or another scoop,</v>

2240
01:32:46.511 --> 01:32:50.000
<v Speaker 2>some inside information that we'd have </v>
<v Speaker 2>never gotten out is his,</v>

2241
01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:53.380
<v Speaker 2>is not some secret stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has the right to say it.</v>

2242
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2243
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:55.950
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be thrown in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2244
01:32:56.670 --> 01:32:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a kit for anyone being </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown in the towel,</v>

2245
01:32:58.690 --> 01:33:01.860
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying what I'm saying is it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not like he unveiled,</v>

2246
01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:05.650
<v Speaker 2>he uncovered some inside shit like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Watergate.</v>

2247
01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.810
<v Speaker 2>This was something that they were going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have release.</v>

2248
01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:12.960
<v Speaker 2>They had a plan and he got word of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and jump the gun and put it out there.</v>

2249
01:33:13.690 --> 01:33:16.450
<v Speaker 2>And he said he had multiple sources and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this different jazz.</v>

2250
01:33:16.451 --> 01:33:17.284
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't help anybody to release it </v>

2251
01:33:20.021 --> 01:33:20.854
<v Speaker 2>early except Ariel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's saying it's not like he found out </v>

2252
01:33:22.361 --> 01:33:25.180
<v Speaker 2>about some scandal going on and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing to the public,</v>

2253
01:33:25.181 --> 01:33:27.190
<v Speaker 2>that's what we like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to drop this in an act.</v>

2254
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:28.103
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't read his thing and I loved </v>

2255
01:33:30.341 --> 01:33:32.980
<v Speaker 2>finding that news out live at the event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>

2256
01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I look,</v>

2257
01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:35.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>

2258
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:36.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2259
01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:38.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think it's Kinda cool that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had that,</v>

2260
01:33:38.711 --> 01:33:39.544
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't bother me at all that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information got out a few hours earlier </v>

2261
01:33:43.121 --> 01:33:45.190
<v Speaker 2>would I've had the same reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2262
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:49.840
<v Speaker 2>but if I saw it in written word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was still at a very similar reaction.</v>

2263
01:33:49.841 --> 01:33:50.674
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have had the same reaction </v>

2264
01:33:52.181 --> 01:33:53.860
<v Speaker 2>when I saw the promo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but come on,</v>

2265
01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:56.140
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not into cheesy promos anyway.</v>

2266
01:33:56.141 --> 01:33:58.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see matchups.</v>

2267
01:33:58.270 --> 01:34:00.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give everybody the information.</v>

2268
01:34:00.461 --> 01:34:01.960
<v Speaker 2>The moment it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>

2269
01:34:01.961 --> 01:34:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't like announcements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

2270
01:34:03.970 --> 01:34:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that said,</v>

2271
01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:07.323
<v Speaker 2>I completely understand the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his opinion or the UFC position where </v>

2272
01:34:10.751 --> 01:34:12.460
<v Speaker 2>they have this company and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people go,</v>

2273
01:34:12.461 --> 01:34:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a company man,</v>

2274
01:34:13.541 --> 01:34:14.980
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking sticking up for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

2275
01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:17.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just think about this for a second.</v>

2276
01:34:18.190 --> 01:34:23.190
<v Speaker 2>You have a promotional campaign that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've created.</v>

2277
01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:28.060
<v Speaker 2>You've spent more than a million dollars</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting this UFC 200 commercial.</v>

2278
01:34:28.061 --> 01:34:28.894
<v Speaker 2>They have this whole thing and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>tag brock Lesnar in the end and they </v>

2279
01:34:30.821 --> 01:34:31.960
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2280
01:34:31.961 --> 01:34:33.970
<v Speaker 2>this is the fucking cherry on top of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sundae.</v>

2281
01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:35.013
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then someone jumps the gun and you </v>

2282
01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:39.370
<v Speaker 2>find out that it's someone inside your </v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

2283
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:40.263
<v Speaker 2>allegedly that's leaking information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This reporter and he's getting this </v>

2284
01:34:43.151 --> 01:34:43.984
<v Speaker 2>information out and always doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially scooping it and putting the </v>

2285
01:34:48.641 --> 01:34:50.590
<v Speaker 2>onus and the putting the light on </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

2286
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:51.783
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have every right to want to </v>

2287
01:34:52.601 --> 01:34:53.590
<v Speaker 2>fire that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2288
01:34:53.650 --> 01:34:55.210
<v Speaker 2>And also every right till it's a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

2289
01:34:55.211 --> 01:34:56.910
<v Speaker 2>And I love area I think is a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>reporter.</v>

2290
01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:58.370
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know like watching his stuff.</v>

2291
01:34:58.371 --> 01:35:00.380
<v Speaker 2>I liked the MMA hour long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2292
01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:01.433
<v Speaker 2>maybe that information that I got from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC is also incorrect and maybe </v>

2293
01:35:05.061 --> 01:35:07.640
<v Speaker 2>that's why his ban has been lifted.</v>

2294
01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:12.530
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one wants a guy like Ariel Helwani to</v>

2295
01:35:12.531 --> 01:35:15.170
<v Speaker 2>not have a Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think him getting banned.</v>

2296
01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're an Ariel Helwani fan,</v>

2297
01:35:17.991 --> 01:35:21.650
<v Speaker 2>you should be jumping up and down for </v>
<v Speaker 2>two reasons why you should be happy that</v>

2298
01:35:21.651 --> 01:35:25.700
<v Speaker 2>he got banned because then it makes them</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a martyr and then happy that he got</v>

2299
01:35:25.701 --> 01:35:30.110
<v Speaker 2>reinstated because now he's a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm an Ariel Helwani Fan,</v>

2300
01:35:30.111 --> 01:35:32.750
<v Speaker 2>so I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously a UFC fan,</v>

2301
01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:35.450
<v Speaker 2>so I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad they worked it out.</v>

2302
01:35:35.451 --> 01:35:38.330
<v Speaker 2>And everybody talk and get to watch a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get to watch brock lesnar fight.</v>

2303
01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's these everybody that's freaking</v>

2304
01:35:41.481 --> 01:35:44.960
<v Speaker 2>out that he's only doing his job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not necessarily true folks.</v>

2305
01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:46.013
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit more complicated than </v>

2306
01:35:47.061 --> 01:35:49.670
<v Speaker 2>that because it's not like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>information wasn't already coming out.</v>

2307
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:52.580
<v Speaker 2>And if you have information that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know is going to come out,</v>

2308
01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:53.060
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2309
01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:56.780
<v Speaker 2>A fucking story about what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>information means.</v>

2310
01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's what I want at Ariel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Helwani.</v>

2311
01:35:59.000 --> 01:35:59.833
<v Speaker 2>I think Eric [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a really smart guy and he's really </v>

2312
01:36:01.941 --> 01:36:02.774
<v Speaker 2>insightful and he's a true mma fan and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy that is going to give you </v>

2313
01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:07.094
<v Speaker 2>some really good insight and some very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well articulated thoughts that I </v>

2314
01:36:13.041 --> 01:36:14.810
<v Speaker 2>enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm happy,</v>

2315
01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy he's back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy.</v>

2316
01:36:16.611 --> 01:36:19.700
<v Speaker 2>But that is the perspective that when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>found out about it,</v>

2317
01:36:19.701 --> 01:36:20.534
<v Speaker 2>I had to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called and I had this conversation </v>

2318
01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:26.810
<v Speaker 2>with people that I deeply trust and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the version that I was handed.</v>

2319
01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:28.370
<v Speaker 2>So now everybody knows and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>groovy.</v>

2320
01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:31.940
<v Speaker 2>So the conspiracy theories can say he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>working with the UFC.</v>

2321
01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:34.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm a puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean look,</v>

2322
01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:35.893
<v Speaker 2>obviously I love the UFC and obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dana white is a very good friend of </v>

2323
01:36:39.171 --> 01:36:41.390
<v Speaker 2>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're not going to hear me criticize</v>

2324
01:36:41.391 --> 01:36:41.570
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2325
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:42.510
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>

2326
01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:45.860
<v Speaker 2>if I disagree with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2327
01:36:45.861 --> 01:36:47.860
<v Speaker 2>he's my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it makes sense.</v>

2328
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:48.703
<v Speaker 2>That's how human interactions work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like a friend and by the end he's </v>

2329
01:36:50.601 --> 01:36:52.370
<v Speaker 2>created an amazing company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the,</v>

2330
01:36:52.371 --> 01:36:53.204
<v Speaker 2>he's the reason why this sport is out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and you guys have worked together </v>

2331
01:36:55.191 --> 01:36:57.020
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if you had a falling out and you</v>

2332
01:36:57.021 --> 01:36:58.150
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to work there anymore,</v>

2333
01:36:58.160 --> 01:36:58.993
<v Speaker 2>why would you go publicly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would never hear that from me and I </v>

2334
01:37:01.011 --> 01:37:02.360
<v Speaker 2>would never work for anybody else </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

2335
01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.250
<v Speaker 2>I both said like if you leave the UFC or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2336
01:37:04.251 --> 01:37:05.440
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He worked for bell tour.</v>

2337
01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:06.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not working for anybody.</v>

2338
01:37:06.650 --> 01:37:08.900
<v Speaker 2>If I don't work for the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am never doing this again.</v>

2339
01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:09.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't see you commentating for </v>

2340
01:37:11.331 --> 01:37:13.670
<v Speaker 2>another MMA blocking the chance.</v>

2341
01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:15.890
<v Speaker 2>No chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no chance.</v>

2342
01:37:15.891 --> 01:37:17.750
<v Speaker 2>It's not even on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to happen.</v>

2343
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:18.703
<v Speaker 2>I would just won't do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would be happy to just go back </v>

2344
01:37:21.621 --> 01:37:22.940
<v Speaker 2>to doing stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2345
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:25.790
<v Speaker 2>I like being a fan and honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my favorite thing to do,</v>

2346
01:37:25.791 --> 01:37:27.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love calling fights.</v>

2347
01:37:27.051 --> 01:37:30.020
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing job of how to for a long</v>

2348
01:37:30.021 --> 01:37:33.230
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But fight companions are even more fun,</v>

2349
01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:34.193
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like companion podcast when it's Eddie </v>

2350
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Bravo and shop and Callan and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out and watch,</v>

2351
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:39.223
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we drank and eat food and talk shit </v>

2352
01:37:42.021 --> 01:37:43.400
<v Speaker 2>and have a fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boring.</v>

2353
01:37:43.401 --> 01:37:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Someone tells us a story about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2354
01:37:45.650 --> 01:37:48.080
<v Speaker 2>getting laid or shitting their pants and</v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic or,</v>

2355
01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:49.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious.</v>

2356
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:53.480
<v Speaker 2>The most fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the best because we get,</v>

2357
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:54.743
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best seat in the house is kind of </v>

2358
01:37:57.001 --> 01:37:58.470
<v Speaker 2>their live where I sit.</v>

2359
01:37:58.530 --> 01:38:00.300
<v Speaker 2>So I do kind of have the best seat in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the house.</v>

2360
01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:01.493
<v Speaker 2>But honestly watching it on TV might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best seat in the house because you </v>

2361
01:38:05.701 --> 01:38:08.180
<v Speaker 2>don't get the obstruction of the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>

2362
01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:09.990
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the UFC is,</v>

2363
01:38:09.991 --> 01:38:10.824
<v Speaker 2>I've been to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have like the great fucking </v>

2364
01:38:12.001 --> 01:38:13.040
<v Speaker 2>seats either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've sat and just,</v>

2365
01:38:13.050 --> 01:38:15.620
<v Speaker 2>and I've caught myself sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're watching now buddy.</v>

2366
01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:18.940
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is changing you up.</v>

2367
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2368
01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:20.713
<v Speaker 2>I've been sit there where I'm looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm catching myself just watching the </v>

2369
01:38:22.081 --> 01:38:24.090
<v Speaker 2>screen of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big screen a lot and you're kind of,</v>

2370

<v Speaker 2>you are aware of that or you're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2371
01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:28.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm really not even watching this live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Half the time,</v>

2372
01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:29.700
<v Speaker 2>you know they start fighting over here </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

2373
01:38:29.701 --> 01:38:30.534
<v Speaker 2>I have now the octagon is blocking man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get the commentary unless you </v>

2374
01:38:33.661 --> 01:38:35.490
<v Speaker 2>have one of those ear piece things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they sell.</v>

2375
01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:37.500
<v Speaker 2>So like sometimes something's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

2376
01:38:37.501 --> 01:38:38.670
<v Speaker 2>what is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is the doctor,</v>

2377
01:38:38.671 --> 01:38:39.960
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

2378
01:38:39.961 --> 01:38:41.910
<v Speaker 2>Why is he sitting on the stool?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is he on the ground?</v>

2379
01:38:41.911 --> 01:38:42.744
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it'll take you like 10 minutes of </v>

2380
01:38:44.461 --> 01:38:45.294
<v Speaker 2>frustration to try to decipher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like bruce buffer has to </v>

2381
01:38:48.121 --> 01:38:51.720
<v Speaker 2>announce it due to an injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But speaking of that,</v>

2382
01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:54.540
<v Speaker 2>you get to see the bruce buffer three 60</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time,</v>

2383
01:38:54.541 --> 01:38:57.380
<v Speaker 2>which he doesn't do a three 60 it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>one 81,</v>

2384
01:38:57.390 --> 01:39:01.890
<v Speaker 2>three 60 and that's at UFC 200 which </v>
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen begs the question,</v>

2385
01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:06.980
<v Speaker 2>should we convince Bruce buffer to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else?</v>

2386
01:39:06.991 --> 01:39:07.824
<v Speaker 2>Seven uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven 20 do we convince them to do a </v>

2387
01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:13.080
<v Speaker 2>seven 20?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You heard it right here,</v>

2388
01:39:13.110 --> 01:39:15.660
<v Speaker 2>but he's getting up there in age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want him to blow out an acl.</v>

2389
01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.650
<v Speaker 2>He blew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blew his acl out doing the jump.</v>

2390
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:24.830
<v Speaker 2>You know he does that thing where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>like he blew his acl doing acl out doing</v>

2391
01:39:26.431 --> 01:39:28.560
<v Speaker 2>which in that which fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

2392
01:39:28.561 --> 01:39:32.480
<v Speaker 2>He probably tell me if I asked him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He he might not even my,</v>

2393
01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:33.333
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he remembers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here we could watch the three 60 by </v>

2394
01:39:35.251 --> 01:39:39.090
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this three 60 is 100% my idea,</v>

2395
01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:40.253
<v Speaker 2>I talked him into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's any even a video of me talking </v>

2396
01:39:42.841 --> 01:39:43.674
<v Speaker 2>him into the three 60 and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he only did the one 80 and he did </v>

2397
01:39:46.951 --> 01:39:47.784
<v Speaker 2>the wine 80 because he accidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pointing towards the wrong side </v>

2398
01:39:51.181 --> 01:39:55.980
<v Speaker 2>once and he realized that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>another one dude,</v>

2399
01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:00.300
<v Speaker 2>hold up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring this to the beginning,</v>

2400
01:40:00.450 --> 01:40:03.630
<v Speaker 2>bring it to the beginning and then crank</v>
<v Speaker 2>it up real loud so we can hear it.</v>

2401
01:40:04.050 --> 01:40:05.430
<v Speaker 2>You'd do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring it from the beginning.</v>

2402
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Put it in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain in the beginning.</v>

2403
01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:12.990
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My main goal this weekend besides having</v>

2404
01:40:12.991 --> 01:40:14.640
<v Speaker 2>fun and getting to see some awesome </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

2405
01:40:14.970 --> 01:40:16.770
<v Speaker 2>It's talking Bruce Buffer.</v>

2406
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:22.030
<v Speaker 4>It's the buffer three 63 60 we planted </v>
<v Speaker 4>the seed in his head,</v>

2407
01:40:27.110 --> 01:40:28.550
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was about a year ago.</v>

2408
01:40:28.551 --> 01:40:32.870
<v Speaker 4>Talked to him about possibly going from </v>
<v Speaker 4>a one 82 or three 60 could he do it?</v>

2409
01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:35.890
<v Speaker 4>But that crazy mother fucker went home </v>
<v Speaker 4>and actually practiced it.</v>

2410
01:40:36.190 --> 01:40:37.023
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] work on them at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] for three 60 brought to you </v>

2411
01:40:51.021 --> 01:40:55.780
<v Speaker 4>by the power of marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is the UFC.</v>

2412
01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:01.780
<v Speaker 4>What proof?</v>
<v Speaker 4>UFC 100 today's that day,</v>

2413
01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:02.763
<v Speaker 4>will we see the buffer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three is still stands that I will know </v>

2414
01:41:05.981 --> 01:41:08.710
<v Speaker 4>at that exact millisecond of the moment </v>
<v Speaker 4>I decided to do it.</v>

2415
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:10.630
<v Speaker 4>Do I want to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes I do.</v>

2416
01:41:10.631 --> 01:41:12.340
<v Speaker 4>But let's see how the energy feels </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless say,</v>

2417
01:41:12.341 --> 01:41:14.590
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel and let's see how the show goes.</v>

2418
01:41:14.850 --> 01:41:16.160
<v Speaker 4>If I can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll pull it off.</v>

2419
01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:17.183
<v Speaker 4>Like fucking take it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joey Diaz is sitting there right behind </v>

2420
01:41:26.241 --> 01:41:28.940
<v Speaker 4>me while it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot that until he was right there.</v>

2421
01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:36.073
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the biggest ever UFC pay per </v>

2422
01:41:41.141 --> 01:41:41.974
<v Speaker 4>view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's me with a video camera on </v>

2423
01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:45.033
<v Speaker 4>Mike Goldberg hoping that he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do the one 83 60 while look how lean </v>

2424
01:41:53.201 --> 01:41:58.201
<v Speaker 4>frank Mir looked at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We look great now get ready for this.</v>

2425
01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:23.800
<v Speaker 4>Like he's going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to do it.</v>

2426
01:42:24.150 --> 01:42:25.330
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not going to do it.</v>

2427
01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:46.073
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2428
01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:03.300
<v Speaker 3>I was so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's Red Band Diaz and Ari fear.</v>

2429
01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:05.920
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody looks so young.</v>

2430
01:43:06.730 --> 01:43:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2431
01:43:07.721 --> 01:43:10.600
<v Speaker 3>That was seven years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't seem like seven years ago.</v>

2432
01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:11.583
<v Speaker 3>Somehow already had an older haircut at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time while he was gone for the </v>

2433
01:43:14.291 --> 01:43:15.124
<v Speaker 3>mustache.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the time and he had a lot of </v>

2434
01:43:16.601 --> 01:43:18.730
<v Speaker 3>craziness going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2435
01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.670
<v Speaker 3>That's a long ass time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2436
01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:26.310
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is it?</v>

2437
01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:28.810
<v Speaker 3>Who has that up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that red bands page?</v>

2438
01:43:29.710 --> 01:43:30.790
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should put it on my channel.</v>

2439
01:43:30.970 --> 01:43:35.970
<v Speaker 3>So we have to figure out a way to make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven 20 plausible to spend.</v>

2440
01:43:37.541 --> 01:43:38.374
<v Speaker 3>He needs a hover board or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the other breaking news you just </v>

2442
01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:46.353
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was admitted to the hospital </v>

2443
01:43:48.341 --> 01:43:52.280
<v Speaker 3>with a heart condition today or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>Thursday the other day.</v>

2444
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:53.113
<v Speaker 5>And News is breaking just as we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming on when people are trying to get </v>

2445
01:43:55.221 --> 01:43:59.080
<v Speaker 5>confirmation on that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he actually passed and tweeted it,</v>

2446
01:43:59.410 --> 01:44:02.200
<v Speaker 2>oh the American top team tweeted that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>

2447
01:44:02.201 --> 01:44:04.480
<v Speaker 2>He must have really died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2448
01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:07.000
<v Speaker 2>He was a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2449
01:44:07.090 --> 01:44:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I met that dude a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very nice guy.</v>

2450
01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy story.</v>

2451
01:44:13.211 --> 01:44:16.630
<v Speaker 2>He had man just fuck Internet street </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights into the UFC.</v>

2452
01:44:16.890 --> 01:44:19.870
<v Speaker 2>Well first into the CBS thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a good boxer.</v>

2453
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:22.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a good boxer in the early days of a</v>

2454
01:44:22.190 --> 01:44:23.800
<v Speaker 2>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2455
01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:27.650
<v Speaker 2>he go back and watch like Kimbo slice </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kayo and lead x c just to lead,</v>

2456
01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:28.553
<v Speaker 2>see fucked up and trying to put all </v>
<v Speaker 2>their eggs in one basket and have this </v>

2457
01:44:31.721 --> 01:44:35.200
<v Speaker 2>guy who was this internet sensation be </v>
<v Speaker 2>their figurehead.</v>

2458
01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:40.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean it made sense like financially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people in the know like me,</v>

2459
01:44:40.810 --> 01:44:41.740
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2460
01:44:41.741 --> 01:44:43.990
<v Speaker 2>if he fights someone good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to get fucked up.</v>

2461
01:44:43.991 --> 01:44:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Like I see all these holes in what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

2462
01:44:46.690 --> 01:44:50.680
<v Speaker 2>And it was frustrating as a hardcore fan</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was still at a point like the</v>

2463
01:44:50.681 --> 01:44:52.450
<v Speaker 2>UFC is much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much bigger now.</v>

2464
01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I remember when they got that fight on </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2465
01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:58.660
<v Speaker 2>on CBS,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like mma had never been on a big network</v>

2466
01:44:58.661 --> 01:44:59.494
<v Speaker 2>like that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was very frustrating that the </v>

2467
01:45:01.601 --> 01:45:05.440
<v Speaker 2>biggest network was putting it out as if</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was the best guy in mma.</v>

2468
01:45:05.441 --> 01:45:06.274
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>us like hardcore fans like me and my </v>

2469
01:45:07.961 --> 01:45:08.794
<v Speaker 2>friends would be around bitching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Randy Guitar would take them down </v>

2470
01:45:10.091 --> 01:45:13.630
<v Speaker 2>in a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was fun to watch.</v>

2471
01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Well people forget that elite Xc sorta </v>
<v Speaker 2>had the scoop on the UFC.</v>

2472
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:18.303
<v Speaker 2>They had the scoop on getting on </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast television and they had </v>

2473
01:45:20.861 --> 01:45:23.170
<v Speaker 2>millions of people watching those </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

2474
01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:26.140
<v Speaker 2>Didn't UFC like why aren't they in talks</v>
<v Speaker 2>with HBO?</v>

2475
01:45:26.170 --> 01:45:27.003
<v Speaker 2>And then it like fell apart and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>elite xc ended up getting the deal with </v>

2476
01:45:29.621 --> 01:45:30.454
<v Speaker 2>showtime or whatever was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems hbo wanted to replace me and </v>

2477
01:45:35.111 --> 01:45:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Goldberg and put in their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>commentators.</v>

2478
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:42.160
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to do their own version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the broadcast because they probably felt</v>

2479
01:45:42.161 --> 01:45:45.610
<v Speaker 2>like us as you have seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>employees would be biased.</v>

2480
01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:49.120
<v Speaker 2>And the UFC was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not gonna happen.</v>

2481
01:45:49.150 --> 01:45:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Like first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are you going to get?</v>

2482
01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:51.333
<v Speaker 2>Like how many people are out there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially at the time that even do </v>

2483
01:45:53.861 --> 01:45:56.590
<v Speaker 2>commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a small handful of people in the</v>

2484
01:45:56.591 --> 01:46:00.760
<v Speaker 2>world that are qualified to do mma </v>
<v Speaker 2>commentary at a top level.</v>

2485
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:02.510
<v Speaker 2>It was a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big,</v>

2486
01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:03.453
<v Speaker 2>big problem with other organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been made them almost unwatchable </v>

2487
01:46:05.711 --> 01:46:07.930
<v Speaker 2>because the announcing would just be so </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

2488
01:46:08.050 --> 01:46:08.883
<v Speaker 2>I mean like nowadays I feel like there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a while where I thought you and </v>

2489
01:46:10.841 --> 01:46:11.674
<v Speaker 2>Goldberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're like the only team who can do mma </v>

2490
01:46:13.391 --> 01:46:15.520
<v Speaker 2>without me just wanting to mute it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2491
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:16.383
<v Speaker 2>but I actually like now they've got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternate teams have gotten fairly </v>

2492
01:46:18.491 --> 01:46:19.000
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>

2493
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Like Brian stands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really good price hands.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that can do my </v>

2497
01:46:24.521 --> 01:46:28.000
<v Speaker 2>job now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But back then there was a small handful.</v>

2498
01:46:28.001 --> 01:46:28.581
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2499
01:46:28.581 --> 01:46:29.850
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that can do my,</v>

2500
01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:32.170
<v Speaker 2>other than Jimmy Smith who's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

2501
01:46:32.530 --> 01:46:33.161
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2502
01:46:33.161 --> 01:46:35.680
<v Speaker 2>works for Beltour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Smits excellent.</v>

2503
01:46:35.681 --> 01:46:37.090
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's as good as me.</v>

2504
01:46:37.091 --> 01:46:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's as good as anybody.</v>

2505
01:46:38.831 --> 01:46:39.431
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2506
01:46:39.431 --> 01:46:41.290
<v Speaker 2>he's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows his shit.</v>

2507
01:46:41.530 --> 01:46:43.480
<v Speaker 2>He's a real fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a smart guy.</v>

2508
01:46:43.481 --> 01:46:44.970
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's easy to listen to.</v>

2509
01:46:44.971 --> 01:46:46.000
<v Speaker 2>He calls things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2510
01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:48.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big Jimmy Smith Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2511
01:46:48.610 --> 01:46:51.990
<v Speaker 2>other than outside of the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do you got outside?</v>

2512
01:46:51.991 --> 01:46:52.824
<v Speaker 2>The UFC does not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really much unless there's some </v>

2513
01:46:54.211 --> 01:46:56.610
<v Speaker 2>unknown gods I don't know of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is definitely possible.</v>

2514
01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:58.860
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UFC,</v>

2515
01:46:58.861 --> 01:47:00.330
<v Speaker 2>there's several guys now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2516
01:47:00.331 --> 01:47:02.310
<v Speaker 2>you got Kenny Florian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got Brian Stand,</v>

2517
01:47:02.311 --> 01:47:04.830
<v Speaker 2>you've got Dan Hardee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of people can do it now,</v>

2518
01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.870
<v Speaker 2>but they worked for the UFC.</v>

2519
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:09.390
<v Speaker 2>So someone like hbo wanted to have their</v>
<v Speaker 2>own team.</v>

2520
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:10.703
<v Speaker 2>You can't just get sports guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just can't do that because they're </v>

2521
01:47:13.081 --> 01:47:13.914
<v Speaker 2>not going to understand what the fuck's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on when the fight goes to the </v>

2522
01:47:15.001 --> 01:47:17.460
<v Speaker 2>ground and they're going to miss things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's going to be sloppy.</v>

2523
01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:18.953
<v Speaker 2>You can't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to have someone who </v>

2524
01:47:19.771 --> 01:47:21.590
<v Speaker 2>understands and you have to have someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can talk.</v>

2525
01:47:21.610 --> 01:47:22.443
<v Speaker 2>Like when you watch old school a mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the craziest things about </v>

2526
01:47:25.031 --> 01:47:28.110
<v Speaker 2>better that it's being announced by </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who don't understand the sport.</v>

2527
01:47:28.111 --> 01:47:29.910
<v Speaker 2>So you literally hear them saying things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2528
01:47:30.150 --> 01:47:31.590
<v Speaker 2>why is he typing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2529
01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:32.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

2530
01:47:32.581 --> 01:47:34.660
<v Speaker 2>you definitely get a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll usually get a lot of that from</v>

2531
01:47:34.661 --> 01:47:36.510
<v Speaker 2>a judges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really crazy.</v>

2532
01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:37.613
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend of mine is a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mine who's a judge and in the middle of </v>

2533
01:47:40.271 --> 01:47:41.220
<v Speaker 2>a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this woman,</v>

2534
01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:42.113
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was also a judge looked over them </v>

2535
01:47:43.650 --> 01:47:44.401
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>

2536
01:47:44.401 --> 01:47:47.730
<v Speaker 2>what is he doing that someone had </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone in a Kamora and she's like,</v>

2537
01:47:47.731 --> 01:47:48.300
<v Speaker 2>what is he doing?</v>

2538
01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:49.133
<v Speaker 2>What's going on over there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she's a professional judge at the </v>

2539
01:47:51.451 --> 01:47:53.330
<v Speaker 2>highest level in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she had no,</v>

2540
01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:55.860
<v Speaker 2>and this was four years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five years ago.</v>

2541
01:47:56.610 --> 01:47:58.050
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is what I'm against.</v>

2542
01:47:58.051 --> 01:47:59.820
<v Speaker 2>All those commissions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2543
01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:03.300
<v Speaker 2>yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You definitely need commissions cause if</v>

2544
01:48:03.301 --> 01:48:05.760
<v Speaker 2>you don't have commissions and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have medical staff on team,</v>

2545
01:48:05.970 --> 01:48:08.800
<v Speaker 2>you don't have like strict standards as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as you know,</v>

2546
01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:09.643
<v Speaker 2>you have to have some government it </v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with something like combat </v>

2547
01:48:12.151 --> 01:48:14.640
<v Speaker 2>sports because there's too many fly by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the seat of your pants.</v>

2548
01:48:14.641 --> 01:48:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Organizations that don't do medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>screenings,</v>

2549
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:18.760
<v Speaker 2>people could die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they test.</v>

2550
01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:21.660
<v Speaker 2>You have to have like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly the companies would have to be</v>

2551
01:48:21.661 --> 01:48:23.670
<v Speaker 2>held responsible for that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2552
01:48:23.671 --> 01:48:25.610
<v Speaker 2>But you can't just leave it up to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>

2553
01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:26.453
<v Speaker 2>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the athletes that suffer if there's no </v>

2554
01:48:27.331 --> 01:48:28.860
<v Speaker 2>medical coverage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right there,</v>

2555
01:48:28.861 --> 01:48:29.694
<v Speaker 2>you can't have an event like an mma </v>
<v Speaker 2>event where you putting your literally </v>

2556
01:48:32.911 --> 01:48:33.744
<v Speaker 2>your health and your life in the hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these people that are supposed to </v>

2557
01:48:36.481 --> 01:48:37.314
<v Speaker 2>have all their ducks in a row so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can run this event and measure whether </v>

2558
01:48:41.101 --> 01:48:43.560
<v Speaker 2>or not you even get paid is in question </v>
<v Speaker 2>Si.</v>

2559
01:48:43.770 --> 01:48:46.470
<v Speaker 2>Because these guys don't have any power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fighters,</v>

2560
01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:47.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2561
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:48.240
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have enough influence,</v>

2562
01:48:48.241 --> 01:48:51.150
<v Speaker 2>especially on a small local level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small shows.</v>

2563
01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:54.870
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a big fan of how California does </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2564
01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:56.730
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of that Andy Foster guy.</v>

2565
01:48:56.731 --> 01:48:57.610
<v Speaker 2>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking,</v>

2566
01:48:57.710 --> 01:49:00.720
<v Speaker 2>he's as good as it gets when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>heads of athletic commissions.</v>

2567
01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:01.583
<v Speaker 2>But I think that you have to have a bond</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you have the money to pay the </v>

2568
01:49:05.431 --> 01:49:06.264
<v Speaker 2>fighters before he can put on an event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that should be mandatory because </v>

2569
01:49:08.641 --> 01:49:09.750
<v Speaker 2>you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever done shows?</v>

2570
01:49:09.751 --> 01:49:10.860
<v Speaker 2>We haven't gotten paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2571
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:12.990
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking horrible,</v>

2572
01:49:12.991 --> 01:49:13.351
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2573
01:49:13.351 --> 01:49:16.320
<v Speaker 2>that's not frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you know that you,</v>

2574
01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.930
<v Speaker 2>there was an audience there and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>laughed.</v>

2575
01:49:18.931 --> 01:49:20.550
<v Speaker 2>So Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's money exchanged,</v>

2576
01:49:20.551 --> 01:49:21.740
<v Speaker 2>but where's my money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh please.</v>

2577
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:22.583
<v Speaker 2>You don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have a show if you don't </v>

2578
01:49:23.941 --> 01:49:24.720
<v Speaker 2>have the show.</v>

2579
01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:25.553
<v Speaker 2>Part of the show I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one where I had to fly myself out </v>

2580
01:49:27.181 --> 01:49:28.014
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get paid and like there were </v>

2581
01:49:28.681 --> 01:49:30.240
<v Speaker 2>people there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The club was the ohs.</v>

2582
01:49:30.330 --> 01:49:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was brutal.</v>

2583
01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever get paid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2584
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:33.391
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

2585
01:49:33.391 --> 01:49:35.820
<v Speaker 2>To this day there's a Gig Mianna man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big J.</v>

2586
01:49:35.850 --> 01:49:36.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

2587
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:38.430
<v Speaker 2>We're both on the GIG together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of us didn't get paid.</v>

2588
01:49:38.431 --> 01:49:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I was opening for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is years ago.</v>

2589
01:49:40.690 --> 01:49:41.523
<v Speaker 2>I both like I was opening for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but believe me it probably hurt me more </v>

2590
01:49:44.221 --> 01:49:45.054
<v Speaker 2>of the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2591
01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:45.893
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2592
01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:47.213
<v Speaker 2>made it on money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the moment I was like fucking </v>

2593
01:49:48.611 --> 01:49:50.120
<v Speaker 2>broke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2594
01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:51.573
<v Speaker 2>but I will say then you also deal with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of other shit when you get these </v>

2595
01:49:53.711 --> 01:49:56.860
<v Speaker 2>government regulatory bodies like with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Vegas.</v>

2596
01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Was it the Vegas Commission that had </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz?</v>

2597
01:49:58.670 --> 01:50:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I mean has there ever,</v>

2598
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:02.103
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy moved up a weight class and </v>

2599
01:50:05.111 --> 01:50:05.944
<v Speaker 2>thought the greatest of all time at that</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight class who tested positive for </v>

2600
01:50:09.881 --> 01:50:10.714
<v Speaker 2>steroids and they found that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had trace amounts of thc in the system </v>

2601
01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:18.850
<v Speaker 2>and he passed a couple of tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2602
01:50:18.910 --> 01:50:21.670
<v Speaker 2>He pass the most stringent tests </v>
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>

2603
01:50:21.671 --> 01:50:25.690
<v Speaker 2>You pass to Wada test to world </v>
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping agency tests.</v>

2604
01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:26.853
<v Speaker 2>There were blood tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are much more particular and then </v>

2605
01:50:29.621 --> 01:50:33.340
<v Speaker 2>he failed a urine test that the Nevada </v>
<v Speaker 2>state athletic commission.</v>

2606
01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:37.630
<v Speaker 2>But he says it's bullshit and like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Wata people say it's bullshit.</v>

2607
01:50:37.631 --> 01:50:38.500
<v Speaker 2>The water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were like,</v>

2608
01:50:38.501 --> 01:50:42.010
<v Speaker 2>look like there's no fee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they wouldn't test sample b.</v>

2609
01:50:42.250 --> 01:50:43.083
<v Speaker 2>There was like some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some issues with testing of sample B or </v>

2610
01:50:45.641 --> 01:50:48.250
<v Speaker 2>allowing the tests of sample b and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>banned,</v>

2611
01:50:48.251 --> 01:50:49.084
<v Speaker 2>they tried to ban him for five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave out the Nevada state athletic </v>

2612
01:50:50.981 --> 01:50:51.880
<v Speaker 2>commission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his phone number,</v>

2613
01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:54.040
<v Speaker 2>I put it on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on everybody calm.</v>

2614
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:56.380
<v Speaker 2>They were fucking best there are pissed </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

2615
01:50:56.381 --> 01:50:57.730
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

2616
01:50:57.760 --> 01:50:59.920
<v Speaker 2>What would they were like petitions </v>
<v Speaker 2>online and stuff like that.</v>

2617
01:50:59.921 --> 01:51:02.930
<v Speaker 2>People would be fired and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be locked in jail.</v>

2618
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:03.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of incompetence and you have </v>

2619
01:51:05.351 --> 01:51:06.184
<v Speaker 2>to have to think that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take away a guy's athletic career for </v>

2620
01:51:08.321 --> 01:51:09.154
<v Speaker 2>trace amounts of marijuana and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and not examine the to Wada test </v>

2621
01:51:13.571 --> 01:51:15.160
<v Speaker 2>that showed that he was clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2622
01:51:15.161 --> 01:51:17.380
<v Speaker 2>it's just so disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this guy,</v>

2623
01:51:17.410 --> 01:51:18.600
<v Speaker 2>this guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2624
01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from nothing and like made a career</v>

2625
01:51:21.851 --> 01:51:22.090
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was,</v>

2626
01:51:22.090 --> 01:51:23.920
<v Speaker 2>was like doing something positive with </v>
<v Speaker 2>his life.</v>

2627
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Ruined him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just pot.</v>

2628
01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:27.670
<v Speaker 2>He fought a guy on steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2629
01:51:27.730 --> 01:51:28.563
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just the greatest ever on </v>

2630
01:51:30.761 --> 01:51:31.780
<v Speaker 2>roids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2631
01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:33.130
<v Speaker 2>you should just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>

2632
01:51:33.190 --> 01:51:34.023
<v Speaker 2>you should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sorry that we let a guy on </v>

2633
01:51:36.311 --> 01:51:38.680
<v Speaker 2>steroids fight against you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's some more pot.</v>

2634
01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's don't sue us.</v>

2635
01:51:40.810 --> 01:51:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2636
01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:43.653
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you can just go in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and run an organization like that and </v>

2637
01:51:49.361 --> 01:51:53.410
<v Speaker 2>tell those people that are fighting that</v>
<v Speaker 2>their futures fuck like what they did to</v>

2638
01:51:53.411 --> 01:51:55.540
<v Speaker 2>vandelay Silva is arguably even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusting.</v>

2639
01:51:56.230 --> 01:51:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Vandelay Silva ran away from a drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>

2640
01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:00.310
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Good.</v>

2641
01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Definitely shouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they banned him for life.</v>

2642
01:52:03.190 --> 01:52:04.780
<v Speaker 2>He's never tested positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ever.</v>

2643
01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Ever abandoned for life gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's insane.</v>

2644
01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:10.210
<v Speaker 2>That's beyond fuck debts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyranny.</v>

2645
01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:11.051
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this guy,</v>

2646
01:52:11.051 --> 01:52:11.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this the guy,</v>

2647
01:52:11.921 --> 01:52:14.390
<v Speaker 2>the cops killed in Baltimore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Guy Freddie Gray.</v>

2648
01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Like essentially what he did was he ran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have anything on him.</v>

2649
01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:21.370
<v Speaker 2>They weren't there to arrest him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He saw cops and ran.</v>

2650
01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:23.950
<v Speaker 2>And it's like a weird dynamic where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like running,</v>

2651
01:52:24.370 --> 01:52:27.400
<v Speaker 2>it may be a little suspicious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not itself a crime.</v>

2652
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:28.263
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2653
01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Like how can there be such a hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment for running?</v>

2654
01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just,</v>

2655
01:52:33.580 --> 01:52:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just seems strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a woman.</v>

2656
01:52:36.041 --> 01:52:38.830
<v Speaker 2>The Guy ran away and they shot him then </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a Taser on the ground.</v>

2657
01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:40.900
<v Speaker 2>That was no different line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was in North Carolina.</v>

2658
01:52:40.901 --> 01:52:42.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think there was a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

2659
01:52:42.570 --> 01:52:44.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was one of those,</v>

2660
01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:46.660
<v Speaker 2>I was wanting to go to South Carolina</v>

2661
01:52:46.710 --> 01:52:49.340
<v Speaker 1>because I'm from the north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we to say,</v>

2662
01:52:49.341 --> 01:52:51.770
<v Speaker 1>oh South Carolina ones that are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

2663
01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:53.540
<v Speaker 1>The North Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Carolina would never,</v>

2664
01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:54.990
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it,</v>

2665
01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:56.083
<v Speaker 1>it did turn out that he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had the cops Taser or something like </v>

2666
01:52:58.341 --> 01:52:58.911
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2667
01:52:58.911 --> 01:52:59.744
<v Speaker 1>And that and that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the cop through the Taser on the </v>

2668
01:53:00.831 --> 01:53:02.200
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>

2669
01:53:02.201 --> 01:53:03.034
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the story exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a video of the cop chucking the </v>

2670
01:53:05.481 --> 01:53:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Taser on the ground after he shot him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2671
01:53:07.770 --> 01:53:09.770
<v Speaker 1>cause if set up caught him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a weapon,</v>

2672
01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:10.940
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2673
01:53:10.941 --> 01:53:12.980
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of shady shit.</v>

2674
01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:16.220
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that balance too</v>
<v Speaker 1>of where like if you,</v>

2675
01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:19.340
<v Speaker 1>if a cop is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

2676
01:53:19.370 --> 01:53:20.203
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a cop grabs your arm and you yank it </v>

2677
01:53:21.561 --> 01:53:22.520
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're like,</v>

2678
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:24.670
<v Speaker 1>assault resisting arrest Jerry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2679
01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:28.760
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the cops can like beat a dude with a</v>

2680
01:53:28.761 --> 01:53:30.830
<v Speaker 1>nightstick half to death and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2681
01:53:30.831 --> 01:53:31.664
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought he might've been going for </v>

2682
01:53:32.391 --> 01:53:33.010
<v Speaker 1>someone's gun.</v>

2683
01:53:33.010 --> 01:53:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2684
01:53:34.131 --> 01:53:35.310
<v Speaker 1>It's dark man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2685
01:53:35.311 --> 01:53:36.144
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also cops just like everything else </v>

2686
01:53:37.551 --> 01:53:40.370
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about in government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're people and they vary and there's</v>

2687
01:53:40.371 --> 01:53:41.810
<v Speaker 1>going to be people that are awesome </v>
<v Speaker 1>cops.</v>

2688
01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:45.440
<v Speaker 1>And I personally think that it's one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most difficult jobs a person can do.</v>

2689
01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:46.333
<v Speaker 1>And psychologically the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of going to work every day </v>

2690
01:53:49.191 --> 01:53:50.024
<v Speaker 1>where all the people you deal with are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be lying to you and up to </v>

2691
01:53:52.431 --> 01:53:54.530
<v Speaker 1>something and hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2692
01:53:54.531 --> 01:53:55.940
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you follow it all?</v>

2693
01:53:55.941 --> 01:53:56.780
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2694
01:53:56.900 --> 01:53:58.690
<v Speaker 1>was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess a year and a half ago now in,</v>

2695
01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:03.320
<v Speaker 1>in New York where the NYP D had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially a quasi shutdown.</v>

2696
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2697
01:54:04.451 --> 01:54:05.284
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think what you're saying is </v>

2698
01:54:06.291 --> 01:54:07.011
<v Speaker 1>absolutely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2699
01:54:07.011 --> 01:54:08.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an incredibly difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

2700
01:54:08.630 --> 01:54:09.463
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of that is because of the </v>

2701
01:54:10.311 --> 01:54:12.320
<v Speaker 1>rules we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are kind of crazy.</v>

2702
01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:16.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of having to police drug use.</v>

2703
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:17.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very difficult position to put </v>

2704
01:54:18.681 --> 01:54:20.410
<v Speaker 1>someone in because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2705
01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:21.253
<v Speaker 1>obviously first and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a horrible thing to do to throw </v>

2706
01:54:23.271 --> 01:54:25.430
<v Speaker 1>someone in a cage for putting something </v>
<v Speaker 1>into their body.</v>

2707
01:54:25.730 --> 01:54:27.980
<v Speaker 1>But it's a very weird thing when there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no complaintant.</v>

2708
01:54:28.190 --> 01:54:31.490
<v Speaker 1>It's two people who are making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary transaction and now you got to</v>

2709
01:54:31.491 --> 01:54:32.324
<v Speaker 1>go in like Swat raid and find them at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's giving a bag of something to </v>

2710
01:54:35.391 --> 01:54:36.740
<v Speaker 1>another person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go get them.</v>

2711
01:54:36.741 --> 01:54:38.510
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for people who don't know,</v>

2712
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:41.270
<v Speaker 1>there was after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric Gardner Guy,</v>

2713
01:54:41.271 --> 01:54:44.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got choked out and choked to death in a,</v>

2714
01:54:45.130 --> 01:54:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you'd put it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he got,</v>

2715
01:54:46.371 --> 01:54:47.330
<v Speaker 1>he got choked to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

2716
01:54:47.331 --> 01:54:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had like a heart attack.</v>

2717
01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:50.750
<v Speaker 1>He had a heart attack while getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>tackled down.</v>

2718
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.380
<v Speaker 1>A legendary selling loosies loose </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes.</v>

2719
01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

2720
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:58.980
<v Speaker 1>So there were a bunch of protests and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then a couple,</v>

2721
01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:01.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two cops got shot in Brooklyn,</v>

2722
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:02.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by some maniac.</v>

2723
01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:03.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was [inaudible] and he drove </v>

2724
01:55:05.121 --> 01:55:05.954
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tweeted he was going to do it and </v>

2725
01:55:07.011 --> 01:55:09.440
<v Speaker 1>then drove up and shot two cops who </v>
<v Speaker 1>never saw it coming.</v>

2726
01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:12.400
<v Speaker 1>It's poor guys got killed on the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2727
01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:13.333
<v Speaker 1>and then as a result of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had like an official unofficial </v>

2728
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:22.430
<v Speaker 1>what they called an Nyp d slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm one of the,</v>

2729
01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:25.160
<v Speaker 1>it was a spokesman for the police union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2730
01:55:25.161 --> 01:55:27.410
<v Speaker 1>and I believe it was the New York Post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2731
01:55:27.850 --> 01:55:29.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a result of the shooting,</v>

2732
01:55:29.330 --> 01:55:32.660
<v Speaker 1>the cops will only be making arrests </v>
<v Speaker 1>when absolutely necessary.</v>

2733
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what he said,</v>

2734
01:55:34.371 --> 01:55:35.204
<v Speaker 1>which was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like shouldn't they always be doing </v>

2735
01:55:36.711 --> 01:55:38.240
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

2736
01:55:38.810 --> 01:55:40.100
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2737
01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:42.920
<v Speaker 1>arrest went down like 80%,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2738
01:55:43.110 --> 01:55:46.380
<v Speaker 1>or at least it was maybe like 60% and 66</v>
<v Speaker 1>cents we have here.</v>

2739
01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:49.860
<v Speaker 1>And then it was like nonviolent tickets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bullshit arrest.</v>

2740
01:55:49.950 --> 01:55:50.783
<v Speaker 1>We're down like 90%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they were just basically not doing </v>

2741
01:55:52.801 --> 01:55:53.634
<v Speaker 1>that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was this beautiful like month </v>

2742
01:55:55.141 --> 01:56:00.141
<v Speaker 1>and a half long period where the NYP d </v>
<v Speaker 1>just wasn't doing what they do.</v>

2743
01:56:01.201 --> 01:56:02.034
<v Speaker 1>They weren't over policing everybody and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they started cracking the whip to </v>

2744
01:56:04.981 --> 01:56:05.814
<v Speaker 1>get them to go back to do it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidently a lot of money is raised by </v>

2745
01:56:08.581 --> 01:56:09.560
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2746
01:56:09.561 --> 01:56:12.270
<v Speaker 1>that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glorified revenue collectors.</v>

2747
01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:13.373
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of revenue that gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>gathered up in kind of fucking devious </v>

2748
01:56:16.351 --> 01:56:17.184
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've always been disgusted by </v>

2749
01:56:19.111 --> 01:56:19.944
<v Speaker 1>parking tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why the city owns the fucking spot </v>

2750
01:56:24.931 --> 01:56:25.764
<v Speaker 1>where you can leave a car and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to give them money to leave a car and </v>

2751
01:56:29.071 --> 01:56:32.070
<v Speaker 1>that's how they gather up millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars and they become addicted to that</v>

2752
01:56:32.071 --> 01:56:33.750
<v Speaker 1>gathering of the millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2753
01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:34.950
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy.</v>

2754
01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:36.270
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2755
01:56:36.271 --> 01:56:37.140
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

2756
01:56:37.230 --> 01:56:39.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a horrible way to fund a system.</v>

2757
01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:40.501
<v Speaker 1>Imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2758
01:56:40.501 --> 01:56:43.020
<v Speaker 1>just being that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just being the guy who's going out,</v>

2759
01:56:43.021 --> 01:56:45.570
<v Speaker 1>just giving tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you just go around ruining people's</v>

2760
01:56:45.571 --> 01:56:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all day long line.</v>

2761
01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:48.533
<v Speaker 1>My friend Brian used to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must be a fucking weird bad for </v>

2762
01:56:51.301 --> 01:56:53.160
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd imagine it has to be.</v>

2763
01:56:53.370 --> 01:56:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine some of these people,</v>

2764
01:56:54.421 --> 01:56:55.680
<v Speaker 1>men who are like literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2765
01:56:55.681 --> 01:56:57.000
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2766
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.863
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower class jobs and have families to </v>

2767
01:57:00.631 --> 01:57:01.464
<v Speaker 1>pay for and you're just going to go hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>them a fucking hundred dollar ticket </v>

2768
01:57:05.461 --> 01:57:08.280
<v Speaker 1>because the meter expired by two </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

2769
01:57:08.281 --> 01:57:09.114
<v Speaker 1>He didn't give us enough money and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just changing as laundry or something </v>

2770
01:57:11.641 --> 01:57:13.800
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let it go for a few minutes.</v>

2771
01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I get the idea that you,</v>

2772
01:57:16.091 --> 01:57:18.480
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't have cars that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>blocking the street.</v>

2773
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:19.343
<v Speaker 1>You should definitely give people </v>
<v Speaker 1>tickets if they're doing something that </v>

2774
01:57:20.851 --> 01:57:24.510
<v Speaker 1>has trucks at or tow them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to just leave a car on the street,</v>

2775
01:57:24.511 --> 01:57:25.980
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2776
01:57:26.530 --> 01:57:27.061
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2777
01:57:27.061 --> 01:57:28.830
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a problem with the way government</v>

2778
01:57:28.831 --> 01:57:31.070
<v Speaker 1>raises almost all revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just,</v>

2779
01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:32.033
<v Speaker 1>I reject the whole system of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like taxation at the threat of </v>

2780
01:57:36.121 --> 01:57:36.954
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like primitive and </v>

2781
01:57:37.771 --> 01:57:38.970
<v Speaker 1>barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

2782
01:57:38.971 --> 01:57:42.120
<v Speaker 1>when human beings look back on that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be the way we look back at like</v>

2783
01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:46.770
<v Speaker 1>slavery or arranged marriage or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that the idea that the way we fund</v>

2784
01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.840
<v Speaker 1>our organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2785
01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:49.713
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's say there are these services </v>

2786
01:57:50.671 --> 01:57:53.400
<v Speaker 1>that are necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way we fund that as we go,</v>

2787
01:57:53.570 --> 01:57:55.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay a portion of your income</v>

2788
01:57:55.230 --> 01:57:56.820
<v Speaker 1>or we'll fucking throw you in jail.</v>

2789
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll put you in a cage,</v>

2790
01:57:58.710 --> 01:58:01.410
<v Speaker 1>block you in a cage like an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>

2791
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:02.590
<v Speaker 1>that's the biggest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2792
01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:03.593
<v Speaker 1>when I'm arguing that with people about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like libertarianism versus other ways </v>

2793
01:58:06.631 --> 01:58:09.210
<v Speaker 1>that we should organize society as my </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest thing that I just,</v>

2794
01:58:09.211 --> 01:58:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I harp on is just a like,</v>

2795
01:58:11.341 --> 01:58:13.590
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who should we throw in a cage?</v>

2796
01:58:14.430 --> 01:58:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Who was it morally acceptable to throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a cage forcefully?</v>

2797
01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Like send men with guns to get them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw them into a cage.</v>

2798
01:58:20.281 --> 01:58:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll grant you a murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rapist,</v>

2799
01:58:23.670 --> 01:58:25.500
<v Speaker 1>someone who assault somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2800
01:58:25.530 --> 01:58:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we go into like theft,</v>

2801
01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:30.360
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause cause that is a violation of,</v>

2802
01:58:30.361 --> 01:58:32.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you own yourself and then you own your,</v>

2803
01:58:32.361 --> 01:58:34.170
<v Speaker 1>your possession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a violation.</v>

2804
01:58:34.171 --> 01:58:37.260
<v Speaker 1>But are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you really okay if someone's like,</v>

2805
01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:39.150
<v Speaker 1>oh I don't want to fund that program.</v>

2806
01:58:39.810 --> 01:58:40.643
<v Speaker 1>I won't like I won't my money and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fund the war cause I don't believe in </v>

2807
01:58:43.361 --> 01:58:45.370
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we can throw that guy in a cage.</v>

2808
01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:46.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or I don't want to,</v>

2809
01:58:46.241 --> 01:58:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fund them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2810
01:58:47.230 --> 01:58:48.063
<v Speaker 1>even if you have a really noble charity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should you be able to threaten </v>

2811
01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:53.740
<v Speaker 1>violence against someone to get them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fund it?</v>

2812
01:58:53.770 --> 01:58:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I like Gary Johnson,</v>

2813
01:58:55.630 --> 01:58:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Gary Johnson steps in and says we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>need the irs.</v>

2814
01:58:58.360 --> 01:58:59.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's listen.</v>

2815
01:58:59.650 --> 01:59:02.320
<v Speaker 1>We don't need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not how we have to make money,</v>

2816
01:59:02.321 --> 01:59:04.620
<v Speaker 1>which put taxes on consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2817
01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:05.573
<v Speaker 1>I like Gary Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish he would be a little more Ron </v>

2818
01:59:08.710 --> 01:59:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2819
01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:10.093
<v Speaker 1>he's away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like Gary Johnson has this </v>

2820
01:59:13.031 --> 01:59:18.031
<v Speaker 1>way of selling the libertarianism as </v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of like,</v>

2821
01:59:19.390 --> 01:59:20.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2822
01:59:20.291 --> 01:59:23.380
<v Speaker 1>it's more practical if we do it the </v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian way.</v>

2823
01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

2824
01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I like when he's asked about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wars,</v>

2825
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:29.800
<v Speaker 1>he'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll say things like,</v>

2826
01:59:29.801 --> 01:59:30.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

2827
01:59:30.641 --> 01:59:31.474
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you look on average these </v>

2828
01:59:33.251 --> 01:59:36.310
<v Speaker 1>military interventions of hurt more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have helped.</v>

2829
01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:39.410
<v Speaker 1>That is exactly how we sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good impression.</v>

2830
01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched a lot of them.</v>

2831
01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:42.113
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my only,</v>

2832
01:59:42.130 --> 01:59:44.290
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not necessarily incorrect.</v>

2833
01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:45.333
<v Speaker 1>It's just like who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would talk about mass murder that </v>

2834
01:59:48.461 --> 01:59:49.294
<v Speaker 1>way and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like talking about slavery and </v>

2835
01:59:51.671 --> 01:59:52.081
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2836
01:59:52.081 --> 01:59:52.914
<v Speaker 1>I just think overall this is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inefficient way to get cotton Jesus </v>

2837
01:59:58.031 --> 01:59:58.900
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like and your,</v>

2838
01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:00.393
<v Speaker 1>your head abolitionist really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to represent the </v>

2839
02:00:02.861 --> 02:00:04.400
<v Speaker 1>abolitionist movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2840
02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:06.580
<v Speaker 1>With that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that attitude.</v>

2841
02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:09.640
<v Speaker 1>So he's like a moderate radical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2842
02:00:09.641 --> 02:00:11.950
<v Speaker 1>he's just a pragmatist man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just like this.</v>

2843
02:00:11.951 --> 02:00:14.140
<v Speaker 1>This makes more sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just fine.</v>

2844
02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:15.610
<v Speaker 1>But I don't really want to sell.</v>

2845
02:00:15.610 --> 02:00:16.443
<v Speaker 1>Libertarianism is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're fiscally conservative and </v>

2846
02:00:19.481 --> 02:00:21.730
<v Speaker 1>socially liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like a,</v>

2847
02:00:21.790 --> 02:00:24.700
<v Speaker 1>he's a bridge because he was a lifelong </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican.</v>

2848
02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:25.593
<v Speaker 1>Like he's a good bridge to getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to consider an alternative party </v>

2849
02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:31.510
<v Speaker 1>and maybe one of the only ones it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently available.</v>

2850
02:00:31.570 --> 02:00:34.990
<v Speaker 1>See I believe in a little bit more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a case for radicalism.</v>

2851
02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2852
02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>so Ron Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was in the 2007,</v>

2853
02:00:41.021 --> 02:00:44.530
<v Speaker 1>2008 debates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got a whole lot of people interested</v>

2854
02:00:44.531 --> 02:00:47.740
<v Speaker 1>in libertarianism and he didn't do it by</v>
<v Speaker 1>being like a bridge to like,</v>

2855
02:00:47.890 --> 02:00:49.750
<v Speaker 1>before I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2856
02:00:49.810 --> 02:00:50.643
<v Speaker 1>slavery is horribly immoral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me first convince you it's </v>

2857
02:00:52.661 --> 02:00:55.420
<v Speaker 1>inefficient and ineffective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he went right to like,</v>

2858
02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:57.190
<v Speaker 1>this is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is wrong.</v>

2859
02:00:57.191 --> 02:00:59.230
<v Speaker 1>We're killing people in countries around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

2860
02:00:59.231 --> 02:01:00.064
<v Speaker 1>Like this is morally horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he got a movement going when he was </v>

2861
02:01:02.741 --> 02:01:03.550
<v Speaker 1>in those debates.</v>

2862
02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:04.383
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary Johnson was in one of the major </v>

2863
02:01:05.201 --> 02:01:06.034
<v Speaker 1>debates in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember anything from his </v>

2864
02:01:08.771 --> 02:01:10.840
<v Speaker 1>performance because nobody ever does?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2865
02:01:11.050 --> 02:01:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever does because he'll go in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and say things like,</v>

2866
02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:14.973
<v Speaker 1>in New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was able to balance the budget was </v>

2867
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:19.270
<v Speaker 1>earning 7% and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2868
02:01:20.050 --> 02:01:20.883
<v Speaker 1>you have the greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest political philosophy ever </v>

2869
02:01:23.381 --> 02:01:27.700
<v Speaker 1>devised by man behind you libertarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the answer to all this shit.</v>

2870
02:01:27.790 --> 02:01:30.220
<v Speaker 1>You're the abolitionists in slavery </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

2871
02:01:30.730 --> 02:01:34.870
<v Speaker 1>And so you really feel libertarianism is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to everything?</v>

2872
02:01:35.550 --> 02:01:35.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2873
02:01:35.941 --> 02:01:36.774
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2874
02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:37.653
<v Speaker 1>It's not in the same way that abolition </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the answer to everything during </v>

2875
02:01:40.431 --> 02:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the first moral step to then we can</v>

2876
02:01:45.590 --> 02:01:46.423
<v Speaker 1>live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about libertarianism is so </v>

2877
02:01:47.721 --> 02:01:49.520
<v Speaker 1>attractive to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2878
02:01:49.521 --> 02:01:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2879
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:51.103
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's philosophically sound and </v>

2880
02:01:53.031 --> 02:01:55.220
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically just a,</v>

2881
02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:56.773
<v Speaker 1>to me it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a humble understanding of what </v>

2882
02:01:59.121 --> 02:02:00.080
<v Speaker 1>existence is.</v>

2883
02:02:00.290 --> 02:02:01.123
<v Speaker 1>That we don't really know what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man's kind of born into the world naked </v>

2884
02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:08.360
<v Speaker 1>and we're here with nature and we're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure it out and that morally</v>

2885
02:02:08.361 --> 02:02:09.194
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should all own our own lives and </v>

2886
02:02:11.151 --> 02:02:11.984
<v Speaker 1>therefore own your own body and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and basically it all centers around </v>

2887
02:02:14.481 --> 02:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>property rights and the nonaggression </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>

2888
02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:17.653
<v Speaker 1>which is just the idea that you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>never initiate violence against the </v>

2889
02:02:19.551 --> 02:02:20.384
<v Speaker 1>nonviolent person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you just draw conclusions from </v>

2890
02:02:23.151 --> 02:02:23.871
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2891
02:02:23.871 --> 02:02:26.060
<v Speaker 1>those are all really standard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2892
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:29.120
<v Speaker 1>points in libertarianism to get brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>up all the time.</v>

2893
02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:30.133
<v Speaker 1>But why is it that libertarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's so attractive to like </v>

2894
02:02:32.751 --> 02:02:34.160
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent guys like you,</v>

2895
02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:35.293
<v Speaker 1>why is it that that has never caught </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold in a mainstream way as an </v>

2896
02:02:38.331 --> 02:02:41.690
<v Speaker 1>alternative third party?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it really the,</v>

2897
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:42.583
<v Speaker 1>you've had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like that run his independence </v>

2898
02:02:45.131 --> 02:02:47.180
<v Speaker 1>that get a little bit of momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's always,</v>

2899
02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:48.410
<v Speaker 1>people always look at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2900
02:02:48.411 --> 02:02:49.610
<v Speaker 1>that's never going to work out.</v>

2901
02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>He's never really going to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2902
02:02:51.151 --> 02:02:52.040
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2903
02:02:52.041 --> 02:02:54.410
<v Speaker 1>vote for Hillary because she has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>

2904
02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:55.430
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get those.</v>

2905
02:02:55.630 --> 02:02:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think there's a game and there's,</v>

2906
02:02:57.740 --> 02:02:58.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2907
02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:00.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2908
02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:01.633
<v Speaker 1>there's like the government is a power </v>
<v Speaker 1>center and it's in their interest to </v>

2909
02:03:05.271 --> 02:03:09.290
<v Speaker 1>continue having power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think usually most people are much</v>

2910
02:03:09.291 --> 02:03:11.000
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they get close to that power,</v>

2911
02:03:11.210 --> 02:03:12.043
<v Speaker 1>they're much more incentivized to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>expand it and try to keep it than to at </v>

2912
02:03:15.801 --> 02:03:16.521
<v Speaker 1>any point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say you guys,</v>

2913
02:03:16.521 --> 02:03:18.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a lot more moral if we,</v>

2914
02:03:18.741 --> 02:03:19.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have this.</v>

2915
02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:20.751
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2916
02:03:20.751 --> 02:03:22.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did slavery persist for so long?</v>

2917
02:03:22.671 --> 02:03:23.504
<v Speaker 1>Because you know it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good way to get cotton without </v>

2918
02:03:24.861 --> 02:03:25.940
<v Speaker 1>having to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2919
02:03:26.860 --> 02:03:27.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people are getting rich off this </v>

2920
02:03:28.791 --> 02:03:30.930
<v Speaker 1>thing and they certainly are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do.</v>

2921
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:31.833
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much time it has left like </v>

2922
02:03:33.570 --> 02:03:34.403
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

2923
02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:38.630
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it's a reoccurring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reoccurring theme that comes up over and</v>

2924
02:03:38.631 --> 02:03:39.464
<v Speaker 1>over again when people talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that we have with a running </v>

2925
02:03:41.661 --> 02:03:43.280
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were currently doing it.</v>

2926
02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:45.950
<v Speaker 1>He said this two party system is just so</v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous.</v>

2927
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:50.270
<v Speaker 1>It's so ridiculous to say that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>these two groups and they're both funded</v>

2928
02:03:50.271 --> 02:03:51.104
<v Speaker 1>by the same people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the competing against each other </v>

2929
02:03:52.431 --> 02:03:54.650
<v Speaker 1>allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet nothing changes.</v>

2930
02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:57.470
<v Speaker 1>And that this is the system and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way to do it.</v>

2931
02:03:57.471 --> 02:03:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2932
02:03:58.160 --> 02:03:58.993
<v Speaker 1>how can we count?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a hundred different systems </v>

2933
02:04:01.641 --> 02:04:04.700
<v Speaker 1>and ideas and what does this grand old </v>
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>

2934
02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:09.530
<v Speaker 1>what's the idea of there being a leader </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 320 million people?</v>

2935
02:04:09.531 --> 02:04:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of it makes any sense at all.</v>

2936
02:04:11.141 --> 02:04:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Just be in an elephant she wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all still so weird how there's this</v>

2937
02:04:14.781 --> 02:04:15.614
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this big show about how much they </v>

2938
02:04:17.451 --> 02:04:18.284
<v Speaker 1>hate each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they just come together over </v>

2939
02:04:19.971 --> 02:04:23.090
<v Speaker 1>the most important issues feel betrayed.</v>

2940
02:04:23.090 --> 02:04:25.640
<v Speaker 1>When I see like Clinton laughing it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Bush,</v>

2941
02:04:26.010 --> 02:04:26.843
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you guys laughing </v>

2942
02:04:27.981 --> 02:04:28.814
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people died when you were in </v>

2943
02:04:29.631 --> 02:04:30.464
<v Speaker 1>office?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2944
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:32.810
<v Speaker 1>And how the media is angle on it will </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2945
02:04:32.811 --> 02:04:35.390
<v Speaker 1>it'd be msnbc or Fox News who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly hate each other.</v>

2946
02:04:35.391 --> 02:04:37.070
<v Speaker 1>But when you see all the presidents </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

2947
02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.400
<v Speaker 1>they're all kind of celebrating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2948
02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:41.100
<v Speaker 1>it's nice that we could all come </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and have this,</v>

2949
02:04:41.101 --> 02:04:42.120
<v Speaker 1>this toast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2950
02:04:42.450 --> 02:04:43.283
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was so you're all full of </v>

2951
02:04:44.821 --> 02:04:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Shit and how is it that you know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have these things were so,</v>

2952
02:04:47.551 --> 02:04:50.760
<v Speaker 1>so the Republicans hate Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama hates the Republicans.</v>

2953
02:04:50.761 --> 02:04:51.594
<v Speaker 1>They both think the other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why the country's falling </v>

2954
02:04:53.191 --> 02:04:54.480
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when like,</v>

2955
02:04:54.481 --> 02:04:55.314
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the NDA bill where he </v>

2956
02:04:56.641 --> 02:04:57.474
<v Speaker 1>says he can arrest American citizens </v>
<v Speaker 1>with no charges and hold them </v>

2957
02:04:59.791 --> 02:05:01.800
<v Speaker 1>indefinitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all just get together and sign that,</v>

2958
02:05:02.250 --> 02:05:03.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

2959
02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:05.580
<v Speaker 1>And the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even like that big of a deal.</v>

2960
02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Like they just passed a law that said </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can arrest you with that.</v>

2961
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Like we just over the whole idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have rights,</v>

2962
02:05:11.041 --> 02:05:13.230
<v Speaker 1>we just overthrew that in one in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill.</v>

2963
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:14.520
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2964
02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:15.413
<v Speaker 1>that'll get like a mention here that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to understand that that won't be </v>

2965
02:05:17.881 --> 02:05:19.380
<v Speaker 1>used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

2966
02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:21.330
<v Speaker 1>That's all for terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite.</v>

2967
02:05:21.331 --> 02:05:22.164
<v Speaker 1>Obama actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he put in a signing statement when he </v>

2968
02:05:24.391 --> 02:05:26.220
<v Speaker 1>signed it into law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2969
02:05:26.221 --> 02:05:27.890
<v Speaker 1>and I guess this was to like appease </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2970
02:05:28.060 --> 02:05:30.630
<v Speaker 1>the liberal activists who may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a little upset with him,</v>

2971
02:05:30.631 --> 02:05:31.464
<v Speaker 1>but he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my administration has no plans of </v>

2972
02:05:35.070 --> 02:05:38.250
<v Speaker 1>detaining American citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we want to let you know that we read</v>

2973
02:05:38.251 --> 02:05:40.110
<v Speaker 1>your emails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck with us.</v>

2974
02:05:40.111 --> 02:05:41.520
<v Speaker 1>We'll see you in a hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2975
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:43.303
<v Speaker 1>So who's okay with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is frustrating for everybody that </v>

2976
02:05:47.401 --> 02:05:51.480
<v Speaker 1>nothing changes in that this two party </v>
<v Speaker 1>system was in place when we were kids.</v>

2977
02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:52.333
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in place now and it's quite </v>

2978
02:05:53.701 --> 02:05:56.910
<v Speaker 1>possibly it will be in place 50 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>from now when we were dead.</v>

2979
02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think something is changing in this</v>

2980
02:05:59.491 --> 02:06:03.120
<v Speaker 1>election cycle and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that it's purely a positive</v>

2981
02:06:03.121 --> 02:06:05.940
<v Speaker 1>force but there's definitely something </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

2982
02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:07.013
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at what's what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on with trump and I'm no fan but </v>

2983
02:06:10.231 --> 02:06:11.820
<v Speaker 1>it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a moment.</v>

2984
02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:12.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump is having a real moment and he is </v>

2985
02:06:14.941 --> 02:06:15.774
<v Speaker 1>kind of tearing down this matrix and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and Bernie also had an interesting </v>

2986
02:06:20.731 --> 02:06:21.390
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2987
02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:22.223
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting that they always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the powers that be kind of decide who </v>

2988
02:06:25.801 --> 02:06:26.634
<v Speaker 1>these people are going to be and it does</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem like this year people are really </v>

2989
02:06:29.221 --> 02:06:31.890
<v Speaker 1>rejecting that on a very grassroots </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

2990
02:06:31.890 --> 02:06:32.221
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2991
02:06:32.221 --> 02:06:33.054
<v Speaker 1>we don't buy this bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much longer they can keep </v>

2992
02:06:35.371 --> 02:06:37.770
<v Speaker 1>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's no real candidates.</v>

2993
02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:40.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said you're dealing with scrubs.</v>

2994
02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:41.633
<v Speaker 1>It's like this minor league ball team </v>
<v Speaker 1>that wants to play in the superbowl </v>

2995
02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:47.160
<v Speaker 1>because there's some sort of a strike </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst really good players.</v>

2996
02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:49.470
<v Speaker 1>It really seems like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean come on man,</v>

2997
02:06:49.620 --> 02:06:53.730
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me that Donald Trump is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best we can do or Hillary Clinton.</v>

2998
02:06:55.060 --> 02:06:56.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you just as Comedians,</v>

2999
02:06:56.431 --> 02:07:01.431
<v Speaker 1>like how many like charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just interesting people like do you know</v>

3000
02:07:02.590 --> 02:07:03.423
<v Speaker 1>show you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so many different like really </v>

3001
02:07:04.951 --> 02:07:06.450
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting people.</v>

3002
02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:09.380
<v Speaker 1>You sit there like you're telling me we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't find one who won.</v>

3003
02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:10.253
<v Speaker 1>But I think like you said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is that a good person </v>

3004
02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:15.960
<v Speaker 1>or any type of honest person would right</v>
<v Speaker 1>away go,</v>

3005
02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:18.160
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't rule 320 million people.</v>

3006
02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:19.253
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would never get to that position </v>

3007
02:07:21.630 --> 02:07:22.463
<v Speaker 1>because you would be compromised every </v>
<v Speaker 1>step of the way and then you'd become </v>

3008
02:07:25.740 --> 02:07:27.270
<v Speaker 1>what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only,</v>

3009
02:07:27.330 --> 02:07:28.163
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a really rig game and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>rigged through lobbyists and special </v>

3010
02:07:31.591 --> 02:07:34.170
<v Speaker 1>interest groups and money and campaign </v>
<v Speaker 1>funds.</v>

3011
02:07:34.410 --> 02:07:38.410
<v Speaker 1>By the time you get to that position </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're a Bernie Sanders or Donald</v>

3012
02:07:38.410 --> 02:07:39.243
<v Speaker 1>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what makes it interesting </v>

3013
02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:44.530
<v Speaker 1>because they're the only two people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents two completely new paradigms.</v>

3014
02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:49.360
<v Speaker 1>You have Bernie who is this weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialist type character,</v>

3015
02:07:49.361 --> 02:07:50.194
<v Speaker 1>democratic socialist character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have trump who's like the </v>

3016
02:07:52.661 --> 02:07:53.494
<v Speaker 1>ultimate capitalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And both people represent entirely new </v>

3017
02:07:56.441 --> 02:07:57.274
<v Speaker 1>groups because Donald Trump is </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially at least partially self </v>

3018
02:07:59.771 --> 02:08:01.270
<v Speaker 1>funded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3019
02:08:01.271 --> 02:08:02.710
<v Speaker 1>now he's trying to get money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3020
02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:04.670
<v Speaker 1>well he's already the nominee though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

3021
02:08:04.671 --> 02:08:05.800
<v Speaker 1>he's cemented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

3022
02:08:05.801 --> 02:08:07.990
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting position where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get some support.</v>

3023
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so far,</v>

3024
02:08:09.670 --> 02:08:10.503
<v Speaker 1>basically trump and sanders both found a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to do it without taking corporate </v>

3025
02:08:13.841 --> 02:08:14.674
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump found a way to speak over the </v>

3026
02:08:15.911 --> 02:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>media and get the media to keep him in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there 24 hour news cycle and Apulia this</v>

3027
02:08:20.001 --> 02:08:21.400
<v Speaker 1>shit out of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're both,</v>

3028
02:08:21.430 --> 02:08:22.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to say they're not,</v>

3029
02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:24.033
<v Speaker 1>I don't look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're personalities are very </v>

3030
02:08:25.511 --> 02:08:26.344
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if anything about their </v>

3031
02:08:26.801 --> 02:08:27.634
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the policies are actually like </v>

3032
02:08:28.661 --> 02:08:29.494
<v Speaker 1>diametrically opposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're both kind of populists </v>

3033
02:08:31.181 --> 02:08:32.014
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Bernie Sanders has more of a re as </v>

3034
02:08:34.020 --> 02:08:34.853
<v Speaker 1>more of an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is my philosophy on what </v>

3035
02:08:36.761 --> 02:08:38.650
<v Speaker 1>government should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And trump's just kinda like,</v>

3036
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:40.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's let it rip.</v>

3037
02:08:40.570 --> 02:08:43.270
<v Speaker 1>But they're both kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you what you want to hear to</v>

3038
02:08:43.271 --> 02:08:44.290
<v Speaker 1>the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3039
02:08:44.590 --> 02:08:45.423
<v Speaker 1>trump is a carnival barker and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talks about that in the art of the </v>

3040
02:08:47.921 --> 02:08:48.340
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

3041
02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:49.173
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

3042
02:08:49.210 --> 02:08:50.043
<v Speaker 1>his whole style of campaigning is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is all mapped out in his books where he </v>

3043
02:08:55.031 --> 02:08:55.864
<v Speaker 1>talks about this larger than life </v>
<v Speaker 1>persona that he's created in order to </v>

3044
02:08:58.961 --> 02:09:02.080
<v Speaker 1>make himself a public figure in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make himself more wealthy,</v>

3045
02:09:02.081 --> 02:09:04.570
<v Speaker 1>more popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more able to get things done.</v>

3046
02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like a strategy,</v>

3047
02:09:07.090 --> 02:09:09.040
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing that he's doing like,</v>

3048
02:09:09.041 --> 02:09:09.874
<v Speaker 1>and I called them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make that wall 10 feet </v>

3049
02:09:11.381 --> 02:09:12.214
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's all like Carnival Barker </v>

3050
02:09:14.290 --> 02:09:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's amazing that he,</v>

3051
02:09:16.690 --> 02:09:17.523
<v Speaker 1>he's stepped into the game of politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost ripped it open from the </v>

3052
02:09:21.581 --> 02:09:23.560
<v Speaker 1>inside where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just talking like a dude.</v>

3053
02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even doing it.</v>

3054
02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:27.130
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how Hilary Clinton's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to handle this guy.</v>

3055
02:09:27.250 --> 02:09:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Well how about when he was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how big his Dick is?</v>

3056
02:09:30.370 --> 02:09:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Well he to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just said there's no problem.</v>

3057
02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:35.380
<v Speaker 1>No look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

3058
02:09:35.410 --> 02:09:36.243
<v Speaker 1>He was insinuating there's someone was </v>
<v Speaker 1>insinuate entity had small hands way a </v>

3059
02:09:38.411 --> 02:09:39.244
<v Speaker 1>small penis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just said I want to let you know </v>

3060
02:09:40.151 --> 02:09:42.610
<v Speaker 1>there's no problems there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made a,</v>

3061
02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I have a big Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what happens.</v>

3062
02:09:44.581 --> 02:09:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

3063
02:09:45.431 --> 02:09:47.290
<v Speaker 1>this was like I think a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades ago.</v>

3064
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:48.143
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this guy who worked for vanity </v>

3065
02:09:49.001 --> 02:09:49.834
<v Speaker 1>fair and he wrote something about trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>having small hands and trump sent him a </v>

3066
02:09:55.601 --> 02:10:00.220
<v Speaker 1>picture like head shots of his hands and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a note being like,</v>

3067
02:10:00.250 --> 02:10:01.083
<v Speaker 1>I don't have small hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he actually responded to them and </v>

3068
02:10:03.131 --> 02:10:03.964
<v Speaker 1>this was out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I heard some people talk about </v>

3069
02:10:04.961 --> 02:10:05.794
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Marco Rubio knew if he went at his </v>

3070
02:10:08.561 --> 02:10:13.270
<v Speaker 1>hands just to makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause his hands aren't small.</v>

3071
02:10:13.271 --> 02:10:14.104
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason he said </v>

3072
02:10:15.791 --> 02:10:16.480
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3073
02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:17.313
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marco Rubio said he's got small hands </v>

3074
02:10:18.281 --> 02:10:19.114
<v Speaker 1>and you know what they say about guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>with small hands and this is the maniac </v>

3075
02:10:21.281 --> 02:10:22.210
<v Speaker 1>that is Donald Trump.</v>

3076
02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:25.990
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't not bring that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next debate he goes,</v>

3077
02:10:25.991 --> 02:10:26.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

3078
02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:28.000
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>

3079
02:10:28.001 --> 02:10:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I have small hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at these hands.</v>

3080
02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:31.300
<v Speaker 1>That pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I right?</v>

3081
02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:34.340
<v Speaker 1>And just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't stop.</v>

3082
02:10:34.341 --> 02:10:35.870
<v Speaker 1>There she goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just so you know,</v>

3083
02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:38.510
<v Speaker 1>he implied that because of these small </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>

3084
02:10:38.511 --> 02:10:41.990
<v Speaker 1>that means something else is small and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>promise you there's no problem there.</v>

3085
02:10:42.650 --> 02:10:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very bizarre.</v>

3086
02:10:43.701 --> 02:10:44.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>

3087
02:10:44.780 --> 02:10:48.350
<v Speaker 1>His fingers are relatively short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not great,</v>

3088
02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:49.573
<v Speaker 1>but it's does nothing weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where you'd have to comment about </v>

3089
02:10:52.071 --> 02:10:53.660
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not presidential hands.</v>

3090
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the price?</v>

3091
02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Abe Lincoln probably has some long ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

3092
02:10:58.660 --> 02:10:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3093
02:10:59.811 --> 02:11:00.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3094
02:11:00.701 --> 02:11:01.534
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing to criticize though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're talking about something </v>

3095
02:11:04.221 --> 02:11:05.054
<v Speaker 1>that someone can't change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like making fun of someone's ears </v>

3096
02:11:07.611 --> 02:11:08.660
<v Speaker 1>when they're running for president.</v>

3097
02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

3098
02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:11.300
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very strange.</v>

3099
02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:11.960
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

3100
02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:15.350
<v Speaker 1>but it is a tell to Donald Trump that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't not address it.</v>

3101
02:11:15.590 --> 02:11:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put that out there,</v>

3102
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:20.240
<v Speaker 1>he's got a comeback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it worked.</v>

3103
02:11:20.241 --> 02:11:22.160
<v Speaker 1>The problem is his comeback was </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective.</v>

3104
02:11:22.190 --> 02:11:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then he wins.</v>

3105
02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:26.300
<v Speaker 1>So Marco Rubio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marco Rubio,</v>

3106
02:11:26.301 --> 02:11:29.000
<v Speaker 1>who's just this weird Mama's boy looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>putts,</v>

3107
02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:30.313
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's just isn't how many charisma </v>

3108
02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:35.510
<v Speaker 1>when he would like be jabbing back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth with trump.</v>

3109
02:11:35.511 --> 02:11:35.871
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3110
02:11:35.871 --> 02:11:38.030
<v Speaker 1>you're an amateur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's going to chew you up.</v>

3111
02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:41.570
<v Speaker 1>He's used to being criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's used to being arrogant.</v>

3112
02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:43.440
<v Speaker 1>He's used to shutting people down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3113
02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Well that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another one of my issues with,</v>

3114
02:11:46.850 --> 02:11:49.010
<v Speaker 1>with Gary Johnson is that I just feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3115
02:11:49.011 --> 02:11:49.491
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>

3116
02:11:49.491 --> 02:11:51.950
<v Speaker 1>if the LP wants to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the libertarian,</v>

3117
02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:52.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they want to,</v>

3118
02:11:52.730 --> 02:11:53.563
<v Speaker 1>they want to have a moment here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me the hope is if we can </v>

3119
02:11:55.881 --> 02:11:56.714
<v Speaker 1>get to 15% in the polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we get into a debate and I have to </v>

3120
02:11:59.301 --> 02:12:00.134
<v Speaker 1>overlook the fact that this guy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>already in a debate that nobody </v>

3121
02:12:01.941 --> 02:12:03.590
<v Speaker 1>remembers because he didn't do anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that.</v>

3122
02:12:03.770 --> 02:12:05.270
<v Speaker 1>And now he's got to go debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>

3123
02:12:05.970 --> 02:12:09.290
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I you got to send someone who's got some</v>

3124
02:12:09.291 --> 02:12:10.124
<v Speaker 1>type of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well he's going to be in the debates </v>

3125
02:12:11.571 --> 02:12:12.200
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3126
02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:12.871
<v Speaker 1>Gary Johnson?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3127
02:12:12.871 --> 02:12:16.400
<v Speaker 1>he's got to get 15% he's got to pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and he's got to get into the polls.</v>

3128
02:12:16.401 --> 02:12:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Then he's got to get 15% in the polls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole fucking fight and they also</v>

3129
02:12:20.571 --> 02:12:21.404
<v Speaker 1>have to choose which polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they find him </v>

3130
02:12:23.151 --> 02:12:23.984
<v Speaker 1>threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might actually be smart for them to </v>

3131
02:12:25.401 --> 02:12:28.490
<v Speaker 1>allow him to expose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think both sides would probably</v>

3132
02:12:28.491 --> 02:12:29.324
<v Speaker 1>think that he would expose something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the other side has and both sides </v>

3133
02:12:32.361 --> 02:12:33.194
<v Speaker 1>would probably be under the impression </v>
<v Speaker 1>there an opportunity to capitalize on </v>

3134
02:12:35.421 --> 02:12:35.721
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3135
02:12:35.721 --> 02:12:40.370
<v Speaker 1>I think the left side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's a lifelong Republican,</v>

3136
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:43.310
<v Speaker 1>sees him is more likely to peel away </v>
<v Speaker 1>votes from trump.</v>

3137
02:12:43.470 --> 02:12:46.810
<v Speaker 1>So in a weird way I think they want him </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there because they want to,</v>

3138
02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:48.140
<v Speaker 1>they want to hand it to Hillary.</v>

3139
02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:50.630
<v Speaker 1>He might be able to take advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that,</v>

3140
02:12:50.631 --> 02:12:51.470
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3141
02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:52.393
<v Speaker 1>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though this is a whole different </v>

3142
02:12:54.081 --> 02:12:55.610
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really like the,</v>

3143
02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:58.280
<v Speaker 1>the control on the two party system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3144
02:12:58.281 --> 02:12:59.190
<v Speaker 1>the last time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3145
02:12:59.610 --> 02:13:00.443
<v Speaker 1>a third party really made any noise was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was Ross Perot and they changed all the </v>

3146
02:13:03.951 --> 02:13:06.950
<v Speaker 1>rules after that guy got out of there to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mention like presidential debates.</v>

3147
02:13:06.951 --> 02:13:08.370
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be like the,</v>

3148
02:13:08.371 --> 02:13:09.204
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women in the League of women voters or </v>

3149
02:13:10.431 --> 02:13:11.241
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to run it.</v>

3150
02:13:11.241 --> 02:13:13.310
<v Speaker 1>And then that now that just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats and Republicans,</v>

3151
02:13:13.311 --> 02:13:13.821
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they were like,</v>

3152
02:13:13.821 --> 02:13:15.650
<v Speaker 1>let's never let that happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3153
02:13:15.651 --> 02:13:18.020
<v Speaker 1>They fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They let that a crazy old billionaire by</v>

3154
02:13:18.021 --> 02:13:19.460
<v Speaker 1>time on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

3155
02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're being hoodwinked.</v>

3156
02:13:22.350 --> 02:13:23.183
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you how know you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>some crazy old Texas billionaire on </v>

3157
02:13:27.141 --> 02:13:29.780
<v Speaker 1>television in the 1980s or whenever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it was.</v>

3158
02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:31.093
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3159
02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:32.033
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things to me where I </v>

3160
02:13:33.811 --> 02:13:36.220
<v Speaker 1>don't see how it's going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at,</v>

3161
02:13:36.221 --> 02:13:36.691
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

3162
02:13:36.691 --> 02:13:37.524
<v Speaker 1>they can just keep running this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>game for another four years and another </v>

3163
02:13:39.721 --> 02:13:43.050
<v Speaker 1>four years and it'll keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll be like 70 going,</v>

3164
02:13:43.051 --> 02:13:44.340
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>

3165
02:13:44.341 --> 02:13:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Still think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it.</v>

3166
02:13:46.290 --> 02:13:49.870
<v Speaker 1>I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're on the verge of,</v>

3167
02:13:49.970 --> 02:13:52.530
<v Speaker 1>of the collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know exactly where it verges</v>

3168
02:13:52.531 --> 02:13:53.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

3169
02:13:53.580 --> 02:13:56.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much longer president trump might do</v>

3170
02:13:56.011 --> 02:13:56.850
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

3171
02:13:57.060 --> 02:13:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

3172
02:13:58.410 --> 02:14:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I think if you look at a few kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like fundamentals,</v>

3173
02:14:01.770 --> 02:14:03.930
<v Speaker 1>we're in the process of an empire </v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen.</v>

3174
02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the far,</v>

3175
02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:09.390
<v Speaker 1>far too expanded militarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drowning in debt.</v>

3176
02:14:09.590 --> 02:14:10.770
<v Speaker 1>And if you really look at the dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3177
02:14:10.771 --> 02:14:11.604
<v Speaker 1>it's not just the 19 trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like over a hundred trillion in </v>

3178
02:14:13.651 --> 02:14:14.820
<v Speaker 1>unfunded liabilities.</v>

3179
02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:15.653
<v Speaker 1>Like all these Medicare and social </v>
<v Speaker 1>security and all these programs there </v>

3180
02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:19.830
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all going to blow up.</v>

3181
02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

3182
02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>we've also got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3183
02:14:22.100 --> 02:14:22.933
<v Speaker 1>just trillions and trillions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are extended being held at these </v>

3184
02:14:25.651 --> 02:14:28.500
<v Speaker 1>big banks that there's all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors.</v>

3185
02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:30.680
<v Speaker 1>And also look at the moral kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3186
02:14:30.890 --> 02:14:33.870
<v Speaker 1>the cultural decay kind of going on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>

3187
02:14:33.871 --> 02:14:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I think kind of embodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of indicators that</v>

3188
02:14:38.731 --> 02:14:40.860
<v Speaker 1>were in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the crash process.</v>

3189
02:14:40.980 --> 02:14:44.520
<v Speaker 1>He embodies the cultural decay in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that one sense.</v>

3190
02:14:44.521 --> 02:14:45.354
<v Speaker 1>Then on the other sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the co two cultural decay by </v>

3191
02:14:47.011 --> 02:14:47.844
<v Speaker 1>social justice warriors and paper super </v>
<v Speaker 1>over sensitive who Ralph Nader's </v>

3192
02:14:50.791 --> 02:14:52.620
<v Speaker 1>rallying against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Ralph Nay,</v>

3193
02:14:52.650 --> 02:14:53.483
<v Speaker 1>but I pulled this up on twitter today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Ralph Nader was saying that the men </v>

3194
02:14:57.451 --> 02:15:01.500
<v Speaker 1>today are over sensitive because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>never had to deal with the draft.</v>

3195
02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:02.841
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3196
02:15:02.841 --> 02:15:03.674
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are complaining about nothing </v>

3197
02:15:04.681 --> 02:15:06.090
<v Speaker 1>like this is nonsense.</v>

3198
02:15:06.090 --> 02:15:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Good for Ralph Nader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Them look at this,</v>

3199
02:15:08.130 --> 02:15:08.963
<v Speaker 1>this Ralph Nader on trigger warnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young men are far too sensitive because </v>

3200
02:15:11.911 --> 02:15:14.820
<v Speaker 1>they've never been in a draft and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hilarious.</v>

3201
02:15:14.821 --> 02:15:15.654
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about trigger warnings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but trigger trigger warnings make me </v>

3202
02:15:18.661 --> 02:15:21.120
<v Speaker 1>want to fucking hit somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really does.</v>

3203
02:15:22.190 --> 02:15:24.750
<v Speaker 1>It's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me so,</v>

3204
02:15:24.751 --> 02:15:28.290
<v Speaker 1>it's so fucking stupid that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to protect people from true.</v>

3205
02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:29.153
<v Speaker 1>First of all that is not even have </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger works triggers work by like </v>

3206
02:15:32.101 --> 02:15:32.934
<v Speaker 1>being in a place where something bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to you or hearing a sound or </v>

3207
02:15:35.941 --> 02:15:36.774
<v Speaker 1>seeing a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not bringing up the act of like if </v>

3208
02:15:38.761 --> 02:15:40.190
<v Speaker 1>someone says you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murder,</v>

3209
02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:42.150
<v Speaker 1>oh my dad was murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a trigger warning.</v>

3210
02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you warn me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trigger,</v>

3211
02:15:43.881 --> 02:15:45.330
<v Speaker 1>it hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how,</v>

3212
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:47.310
<v Speaker 1>but that's the whole world's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trigger you then.</v>

3213
02:15:47.550 --> 02:15:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Then every fucking piece of media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every movie,</v>

3214
02:15:50.221 --> 02:15:54.080
<v Speaker 1>every television show has the potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>for being a trigger warning is really,</v>

3215
02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if like,</v>

3216
02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:56.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just hate people and I don't care if </v>

3217
02:15:58.531 --> 02:16:00.240
<v Speaker 1>you're triggered and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with your past.</v>

3218
02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:01.073
<v Speaker 1>Like I think we have a big epidemic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers coming back suffering from </v>

3219
02:16:04.141 --> 02:16:04.974
<v Speaker 1>PTSD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to not send them towards so we </v>

3220
02:16:06.511 --> 02:16:08.910
<v Speaker 1>don't have to deal with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that we should,</v>

3221
02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:12.600
<v Speaker 1>we should change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should like nerf foam the world.</v>

3222
02:16:12.710 --> 02:16:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In case your triggered.</v>

3223
02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:19.640
<v Speaker 1>So a college now can't explore anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to because what if someone had</v>

3224
02:16:19.861 --> 02:16:20.694
<v Speaker 1>something violent in their past happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it seems to be a very </v>

3225
02:16:22.771 --> 02:16:24.600
<v Speaker 1>convenient thing where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3226
02:16:24.601 --> 02:16:28.140
<v Speaker 1>like the feminists or the social justice</v>
<v Speaker 1>warriors are like policing rape jokes in</v>

3227
02:16:28.141 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 1>the comedy community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't ever seem to</v>

3228
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:32.890
<v Speaker 2>be policing like a war joke or a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3229
02:16:32.891 --> 02:16:35.380
<v Speaker 2>it's like they don't seem to care about </v>
<v Speaker 2>men being triggered.</v>

3230
02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:37.750
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you were saying,</v>

3231
02:16:37.751 --> 02:16:38.584
<v Speaker 2>it's mostly just infantiles bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just these privileged kids on </v>

3232
02:16:41.711 --> 02:16:42.544
<v Speaker 2>college campuses who are like want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shut down a conservative speaker from </v>

3233
02:16:45.911 --> 02:16:47.740
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a civilian sanity.</v>

3234
02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:48.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3235
02:16:48.370 --> 02:16:50.440
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so fucking,</v>

3236
02:16:51.290 --> 02:16:55.810
<v Speaker 2>the way they're doing is rabid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's so frothy at the mouth</v>

3237
02:16:55.811 --> 02:17:00.730
<v Speaker 2>and so like taken away with the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're doing some incredible right</v>

3238
02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:01.833
<v Speaker 2>and this has to be done and there's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice must prevail and transgender </v>

3239
02:17:05.651 --> 02:17:07.690
<v Speaker 2>people should be able to use the women's</v>
<v Speaker 2>room without,</v>

3240
02:17:08.070 --> 02:17:08.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any questioning whatsoever about where </v>

3241
02:17:10.271 --> 02:17:11.104
<v Speaker 2>they stand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some weirdness going on </v>

3242
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.960
<v Speaker 2>today that is like what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about when people are young,</v>

3243
02:17:16.961 --> 02:17:19.990
<v Speaker 2>when you could send them to war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when you send these young people to</v>

3244
02:17:19.991 --> 02:17:22.720
<v Speaker 2>war that they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't really have enough data yet.</v>

3245
02:17:23.170 --> 02:17:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of that going on with as a</v>

3246
02:17:24.791 --> 02:17:25.624
<v Speaker 2>social war and these people don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of data either and they're just </v>

3247
02:17:28.871 --> 02:17:32.170
<v Speaker 2>furious and foaming at the mouth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when all is said and done,</v>

3248
02:17:32.171 --> 02:17:35.560
<v Speaker 2>the dust settles when they're older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're probably not even going to be on</v>

3249
02:17:35.561 --> 02:17:37.560
<v Speaker 2>that team anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3250
02:17:37.561 --> 02:17:38.394
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably going to wise up and </v>

3251
02:17:39.101 --> 02:17:39.934
<v Speaker 2>realize how fucking goofy those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hanging around with are who are </v>

3252
02:17:42.191 --> 02:17:44.530
<v Speaker 2>getting mad at white people for wearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreadlocks.</v>

3253
02:17:44.770 --> 02:17:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my social appropriation.</v>

3254
02:17:46.301 --> 02:17:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3255
02:17:47.741 --> 02:17:50.380
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all hate white people in dreadlocks,</v>

3256
02:17:50.530 --> 02:17:51.363
<v Speaker 2>but you've actually made me someone I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate more than white people in </v>

3257
02:17:53.381 --> 02:17:55.510
<v Speaker 2>dreadlocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how much you fucked up.</v>

3258
02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:56.373
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know where dreadlocks </v>

3259
02:17:57.971 --> 02:17:59.320
<v Speaker 2>came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

3260
02:17:59.530 --> 02:18:01.690
<v Speaker 2>why do people have had dreadlocks </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout history?</v>

3261
02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:02.553
<v Speaker 2>That's what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were comparing the kind of </v>

3262
02:18:03.521 --> 02:18:05.980
<v Speaker 2>cultural decay from the trump supporters</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the social justice warriors.</v>

3263
02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:09.280
<v Speaker 2>I do see a lot of it just rooted in like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anti Intellectual Ism.</v>

3264
02:18:09.310 --> 02:18:10.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just like,</v>

3265
02:18:10.001 --> 02:18:10.990
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

3266
02:18:10.991 --> 02:18:12.500
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to know anything you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>

3267
02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:14.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will shut down.</v>

3268
02:18:14.740 --> 02:18:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christina Hoff summers speech.</v>

3269
02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think she's amazing.</v>

3270
02:18:18.581 --> 02:18:20.920
<v Speaker 2>I saw you did a great podcast with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3271
02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:21.581
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3272
02:18:21.581 --> 02:18:23.020
<v Speaker 2>she is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a feminist.</v>

3273
02:18:23.021 --> 02:18:26.320
<v Speaker 2>She's a liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a liberal feminist who's just going,</v>

3274
02:18:26.410 --> 02:18:27.041
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

3275
02:18:27.041 --> 02:18:28.950
<v Speaker 2>your data is a little off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3276
02:18:29.770 --> 02:18:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Rape apologist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3277
02:18:31.510 --> 02:18:36.510
<v Speaker 2>She just talks about the facts and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she calls herself a factual feminist.</v>

3278
02:18:36.580 --> 02:18:39.050
<v Speaker 2>That's her statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>

3279
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:44.110
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>people they have things wrong to them.</v>

3280
02:18:44.650 --> 02:18:45.483
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how crazy the left has gotten </v>

3281
02:18:47.170 --> 02:18:48.180
<v Speaker 2>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're what,</v>

3282
02:18:48.190 --> 02:18:50.980
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're 20 and you figured everything out</v>

3283
02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:52.480
<v Speaker 2>evidently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3284
02:18:52.481 --> 02:18:53.314
<v Speaker 2>it's just noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of noise and sometimes in </v>

3285
02:18:55.211 --> 02:18:57.550
<v Speaker 2>those noises or some important points on</v>
<v Speaker 2>both sides.</v>

3286
02:18:57.610 --> 02:18:59.980
<v Speaker 2>But boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole lot of noise too.</v>

3287
02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:00.851
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3288
02:19:00.851 --> 02:19:01.684
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of yelling gets done that not a </v>

3289
02:19:05.021 --> 02:19:08.320
<v Speaker 2>lot of progress gets made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just people digging their heels and they</v>

3290
02:19:08.321 --> 02:19:10.210
<v Speaker 2>take aside and they draw a line in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sand.</v>

3291
02:19:10.211 --> 02:19:11.044
<v Speaker 2>And if you've got the people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right and the people on the left and </v>

3292
02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:14.680
<v Speaker 2>oof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3293
02:19:14.681 --> 02:19:18.130
<v Speaker 2>like you said at the beginning of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes a big like team I identity thing</v>

3294
02:19:18.131 --> 02:19:18.964
<v Speaker 2>and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's just justifying the position </v>

3295
02:19:20.741 --> 02:19:22.840
<v Speaker 2>you're already in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're just looking for kind of,</v>

3296
02:19:22.841 --> 02:19:23.674
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confirmation bias like my team's right </v>

3297
02:19:24.851 --> 02:19:25.780
<v Speaker 2>or my teams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3298
02:19:25.781 --> 02:19:29.030
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is everybody so God damn sensitive,</v>

3299
02:19:29.390 --> 02:19:34.130
<v Speaker 2>like the gender Pronoun thing is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking bananas.</v>

3300
02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Like you should know that if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude and you look like a woman,</v>

3301
02:19:37.970 --> 02:19:38.803
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That people are going to get that wrong </v>

3302
02:19:39.951 --> 02:19:40.784
<v Speaker 2>on occasion.</v>

3303
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.661
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3304
02:19:41.661 --> 02:19:42.261
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3305
02:19:42.261 --> 02:19:43.430
<v Speaker 2>what do you look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3306
02:19:43.550 --> 02:19:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Do you look like Catherine Zeta Jones in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bikini?</v>

3307
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:46.251
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do,</v>

3308
02:19:46.251 --> 02:19:48.800
<v Speaker 2>people are going to say her and if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>say her,</v>

3309
02:19:48.801 --> 02:19:50.060
<v Speaker 2>that's not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3310
02:19:50.061 --> 02:19:51.980
<v Speaker 2>you're assuming my gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3311
02:19:51.981 --> 02:19:52.814
<v Speaker 2>there's people out there that they think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you should name your dog gender </v>

3312
02:19:55.581 --> 02:19:58.250
<v Speaker 2>neutral names cause your dog can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide.</v>

3313
02:19:58.400 --> 02:19:59.233
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a real debate amongst </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminists and social justice warriors </v>

3314
02:20:01.971 --> 02:20:02.804
<v Speaker 2>who have animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not they should impose their </v>

3315
02:20:05.450 --> 02:20:07.550
<v Speaker 2>stereotypes that they have on human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings,</v>

3316
02:20:07.551 --> 02:20:08.384
<v Speaker 2>on their dogs and cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's some look and it's just </v>

3317
02:20:10.941 --> 02:20:11.774
<v Speaker 2>insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like there's something like </v>

3318
02:20:13.461 --> 02:20:16.670
<v Speaker 2>on these college campuses that's almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's housing,</v>

3319
02:20:16.671 --> 02:20:20.240
<v Speaker 2>that they're letting them develop these </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous ideas.</v>

3320
02:20:20.420 --> 02:20:21.680
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it,</v>

3321
02:20:21.710 --> 02:20:22.543
<v Speaker 2>I really blame the college professors </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of this because I think these </v>

3322
02:20:24.561 --> 02:20:25.394
<v Speaker 2>are also people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them have lived in college </v>

3323
02:20:27.471 --> 02:20:28.304
<v Speaker 2>their entire lives.</v>

3324
02:20:28.460 --> 02:20:29.293
<v Speaker 2>There are people who go to college and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then just stay in college and they get </v>

3325
02:20:31.221 --> 02:20:32.030
<v Speaker 2>post,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3326
02:20:32.030 --> 02:20:32.863
<v Speaker 2>graduate degrees and then they teach and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of letting this happen and </v>

3327
02:20:36.441 --> 02:20:37.490
<v Speaker 2>no one's going like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3328
02:20:37.491 --> 02:20:39.050
<v Speaker 2>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a real issue.</v>

3329
02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:39.970
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3330
02:20:39.980 --> 02:20:40.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for like,</v>

3331
02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm a completely return.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to,</v>

3332
02:20:43.250 --> 02:20:44.083
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a doctor who's willing to </v>

3333
02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:48.560
<v Speaker 2>perform a surgery on you and you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>identify as her instead of him,</v>

3334
02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll call you her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause who cares?</v>

3335
02:20:50.420 --> 02:20:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to call you zee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3336
02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:55.160
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you also can't,</v>

3337
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:56.900
<v Speaker 2>even if I'm willing to call you </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

3338
02:20:56.930 --> 02:20:57.763
<v Speaker 2>you can't make it a huge issue with not </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody is willing to call you that </v>

3339
02:21:01.140 --> 02:21:03.770
<v Speaker 2>like this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me see or is here.</v>

3340
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:06.120
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen here her that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3341
02:21:07.390 --> 02:21:09.050
<v Speaker 2>there's like 18 of those now yet.</v>

3342
02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Like Lgbtq is not even close to all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>letters that are on that thing anymore.</v>

3343
02:21:13.720 --> 02:21:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Well how about in New York?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to find businesses if they</v>

3344
02:21:17.211 --> 02:21:18.044
<v Speaker 2>intentionally mis-gender you so you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get sued and fine for like a quarter </v>

3345
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:24.710
<v Speaker 2>million dollars have you don't call </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone Z.</v>

3346
02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See and this is where,</v>

3347
02:21:25.790 --> 02:21:28.460
<v Speaker 2>this is where it becomes like a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking problem is it's like,</v>

3348
02:21:28.461 --> 02:21:28.971
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

3349
02:21:28.971 --> 02:21:29.804
<v Speaker 2>You guys can have your little fun and </v>
<v Speaker 2>games and your safe space on college </v>

3350
02:21:31.701 --> 02:21:32.720
<v Speaker 2>campus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you want to.</v>

3351
02:21:32.810 --> 02:21:33.643
<v Speaker 2>But now you start bringing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forceful arm of government to actually </v>

3352
02:21:35.991 --> 02:21:39.680
<v Speaker 2>go fuck over a business owner who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to provide jobs and you know,</v>

3353
02:21:39.681 --> 02:21:40.514
<v Speaker 2>feed his kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even it becomes a problem even in </v>

3354
02:21:43.041 --> 02:21:43.874
<v Speaker 2>colleges because what if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>subscribe to those ideologies and you </v>

3355
02:21:46.471 --> 02:21:49.760
<v Speaker 2>gotta go to school with these monkeys </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're all running around insisting</v>

3356
02:21:49.761 --> 02:21:51.410
<v Speaker 2>there their pronoun a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Z,</v>

3357
02:21:51.411 --> 02:21:53.210
<v Speaker 2>h e.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't say it,</v>

3358
02:21:53.211 --> 02:21:55.370
<v Speaker 2>you're a shit Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like whoa.</v>

3359
02:21:55.430 --> 02:21:55.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3360
02:21:55.701 --> 02:21:57.320
<v Speaker 2>it's also real scared of the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've ever,</v>

3361
02:21:57.321 --> 02:21:58.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a drunken hookup,</v>

3362
02:21:58.580 --> 02:22:00.560
<v Speaker 2>you're a rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is by the way,</v>

3363
02:22:00.620 --> 02:22:01.453
<v Speaker 2>only the man only demand of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happened at Occidental </v>

3364
02:22:04.491 --> 02:22:05.211
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3365
02:22:05.211 --> 02:22:06.044
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we talked about on the podcast </v>

3366
02:22:07.641 --> 02:22:08.474
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3367
02:22:09.350 --> 02:22:10.880
<v Speaker 2>professor renegade history</v>

3368
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:12.430
<v Speaker 6>three</v>

3369
02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:14.120
<v Speaker 2>fattiest Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>daddy's Russell,</v>

3370
02:22:14.130 --> 02:22:16.190
<v Speaker 2>who's brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant guy.</v>

3371
02:22:16.250 --> 02:22:17.083
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3372
02:22:17.150 --> 02:22:17.983
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about how incredible it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they find a way to justify to </v>

3373
02:22:21.621 --> 02:22:24.890
<v Speaker 2>people hooking up with text messages </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the girl saying,</v>

3374
02:22:24.891 --> 02:22:26.370
<v Speaker 2>come over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring condoms.</v>

3375
02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:27.593
<v Speaker 1>They have sex and the guy is the one who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a rapist because they were both </v>

3376
02:22:30.211 --> 02:22:31.320
<v Speaker 1>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

3377
02:22:31.321 --> 02:22:32.154
<v Speaker 1>The guy got kicked out of school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still in the middle of lawsuit </v>

3378
02:22:33.621 --> 02:22:34.190
<v Speaker 1>lawsuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3379
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:35.280
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>

3380
02:22:35.281 --> 02:22:36.114
<v Speaker 1>But it's also like a fascinating glimpse</v>
<v Speaker 1>into how you see things because it's </v>

3381
02:22:39.331 --> 02:22:42.300
<v Speaker 1>weird how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like these guys come back to</v>

3382
02:22:42.301 --> 02:22:46.410
<v Speaker 1>be the caricature of what the 1950s </v>
<v Speaker 1>chauvinist was supposed to be.</v>

3383
02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that women are these fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delicate creatures.</v>

3384
02:22:49.231 --> 02:22:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Handle the same thing a man can.</v>

3385
02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:53.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're really being the sexist</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

3386
02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all those guys.</v>

3387
02:22:55.501 --> 02:22:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

3388
02:22:56.760 --> 02:22:57.593
<v Speaker 1>who would like I remember was a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing on your show when Jamie Kilstein </v>

3389
02:23:00.091 --> 02:23:02.880
<v Speaker 1>was on about the Tosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rape joke.</v>

3390
02:23:02.881 --> 02:23:04.510
<v Speaker 1>But I always want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what I,</v>

3391
02:23:04.530 --> 02:23:06.060
<v Speaker 1>and I've argued with a few people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3392
02:23:06.330 --> 02:23:08.220
<v Speaker 1>who I do now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3393
02:23:08.221 --> 02:23:10.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not throwing this out in the stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that it's thrown out when they go.</v>

3394
02:23:10.470 --> 02:23:12.390
<v Speaker 1>More men are raped and women are raped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

3395
02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:14.820
<v Speaker 1>but why is it seeing as that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a fact,</v>

3396
02:23:14.821 --> 02:23:16.860
<v Speaker 1>prison included and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

3397
02:23:16.861 --> 02:23:17.694
<v Speaker 1>Every time you think of this scenario </v>
<v Speaker 1>where someone's triggered from a rape </v>

3398
02:23:20.791 --> 02:23:22.890
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always a woman you always like,</v>

3399
02:23:22.891 --> 02:23:23.724
<v Speaker 1>what if there's a woman in the crowd </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's been triggered and what if this </v>

3400
02:23:24.961 --> 02:23:27.180
<v Speaker 1>like it's never a concern that it could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a man.</v>

3401
02:23:27.870 --> 02:23:32.400
<v Speaker 1>It's cause we were tribal and we break </v>
<v Speaker 1>off into male versus female teams.</v>

3402
02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:35.160
<v Speaker 1>If the males are the rapists on both </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts,</v>

3403
02:23:35.340 --> 02:23:37.350
<v Speaker 1>men are raping the women and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>raping the man.</v>

3404
02:23:37.351 --> 02:23:38.181
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you man,</v>

3405
02:23:38.181 --> 02:23:39.420
<v Speaker 1>her shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the raping each other,</v>

3406
02:23:39.421 --> 02:23:40.254
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no one seems to feel for that rape </v>

3407
02:23:41.671 --> 02:23:44.520
<v Speaker 1>victim because of men because they're on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong team.</v>

3408
02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:46.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on a shitlord team.</v>

3409
02:23:46.410 --> 02:23:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Kurt made this up point.</v>

3410
02:23:47.770 --> 02:23:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the law and order </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode when they did tell you now?</v>

3411
02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:53.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you ever seen any Milan order?</v>

3412
02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:57.090
<v Speaker 1>They did the one on standup comics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rape jokes.</v>

3413
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:58.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3414
02:23:58.290 --> 02:23:59.123
<v Speaker 1>it's no they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst thing that's ever been </v>

3415
02:24:00.631 --> 02:24:01.710
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>

3416
02:24:01.711 --> 02:24:02.544
<v Speaker 1>It's not even like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even believe how bad it is </v>

3417
02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:07.080
<v Speaker 1>until you see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this,</v>

3418
02:24:07.081 --> 02:24:08.100
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>

3419
02:24:08.101 --> 02:24:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Makes a rape joke at him not at a comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>

3420
02:24:10.111 --> 02:24:10.944
<v Speaker 1>And of course it chills because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you tell a woman in </v>

3421
02:24:12.991 --> 02:24:14.430
<v Speaker 1>the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hope she gets raped.</v>

3422
02:24:14.650 --> 02:24:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Everyone just laughs at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

3423
02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:17.933
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3424
02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:18.953
<v Speaker 1>and then by the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then she gets raped after that because </v>

3425
02:24:20.941 --> 02:24:21.774
<v Speaker 1>he made the rape joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It leads to rape and then I'll do you </v>

3426
02:24:23.341 --> 02:24:25.620
<v Speaker 1>one better at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's actually the rapist,</v>

3427
02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:26.820
<v Speaker 1>the guy telling the rape joke.</v>

3428
02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:29.130
<v Speaker 1>It turns out to be the way it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the most ridiculous,</v>

3429
02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:33.330
<v Speaker 1>irresponsible thing ever at a Kurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurt medsker made this point.</v>

3430
02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's so fucking funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he goes,</v>

3431
02:24:35.490 --> 02:24:38.430
<v Speaker 1>don't think threatened men with rape on </v>
<v Speaker 1>every episode of that show.</v>

3432
02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Like every episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

3433
02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:43.650
<v Speaker 1>you better start talking and then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't do very good in prison.</v>

3434
02:24:43.651 --> 02:24:44.461
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3435
02:24:44.461 --> 02:24:45.294
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to just go clean that </v>

3436
02:24:45.901 --> 02:24:47.360
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna threaten me with it.</v>

3437
02:24:47.610 --> 02:24:49.800
<v Speaker 1>But you're going to use that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiation tactic.</v>

3438
02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:51.860
<v Speaker 1>That's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

3439
02:24:51.861 --> 02:24:54.600
<v Speaker 1>it's just shitty show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those shows were all shit.</v>

3440
02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:55.823
<v Speaker 1>Every one of those crime shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is it about America where </v>

3441
02:24:58.861 --> 02:25:02.160
<v Speaker 1>we want to watch hospital shows and </v>
<v Speaker 1>police shows.</v>

3442
02:25:02.490 --> 02:25:03.323
<v Speaker 1>That's all we want to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to watch people that are in </v>

3443
02:25:05.131 --> 02:25:09.030
<v Speaker 1>trouble is trying to hide from the law </v>
<v Speaker 1>or someone that's worried that mom's not</v>

3444
02:25:09.031 --> 02:25:11.200
<v Speaker 1>gonna make it and they're holding our </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand on.</v>

3445
02:25:11.201 --> 02:25:14.340
<v Speaker 1>The doctors work in fiercely and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>young handsome doctor,</v>

3446
02:25:14.490 --> 02:25:16.690
<v Speaker 1>he leaves after 16 hours and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweating.</v>

3447
02:25:16.691 --> 02:25:17.524
<v Speaker 1>He takes his hand and then another guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in with a gunshot wound and back </v>

3448
02:25:19.571 --> 02:25:20.910
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3449
02:25:20.911 --> 02:25:24.190
<v Speaker 1>So noble cut to commercials for fucking</v>

3450
02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:25.113
<v Speaker 2>tie deodorant and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something about poo and fucking Toyota </v>

3451
02:25:29.021 --> 02:25:33.240
<v Speaker 2>trucks and nobody goes to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd wake up in the morning,</v>

3452
02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:34.093
<v Speaker 2>I'm tying to consume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are a weird fucking people over the </v>

3453
02:25:36.161 --> 02:25:36.994
<v Speaker 2>weirdest thing where the weirdest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because collectively you have to </v>

3454
02:25:39.701 --> 02:25:42.710
<v Speaker 2>look at us as what we are as a giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>super organism.</v>

3455
02:25:42.850 --> 02:25:43.683
<v Speaker 2>Like what are we waiting on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would look at it ourselves inside of </v>

3456
02:25:46.001 --> 02:25:46.834
<v Speaker 2>our culture and our belief systems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>our actions and what gets done and the </v>

3457
02:25:50.351 --> 02:25:53.080
<v Speaker 2>pollution in the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but overall,</v>

3458
02:25:53.081 --> 02:25:56.530
<v Speaker 2>what is the species doing when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at it as an outsider,</v>

3459
02:25:56.590 --> 02:25:58.720
<v Speaker 2>if you were completely removed from </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

3460
02:25:58.870 --> 02:26:01.960
<v Speaker 2>completely removed from tradition and </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>

3461
02:26:01.961 --> 02:26:06.490
<v Speaker 2>He just looked at us as like some weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>organism like what is it trying to do?</v>

3462
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:09.430
<v Speaker 2>What's just making better stuff all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

3463
02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:10.353
<v Speaker 2>That's all it's doing and all this other</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that it does is just to distract </v>

3464
02:26:13.431 --> 02:26:15.280
<v Speaker 2>it while it's making better stuff.</v>

3465
02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:16.293
<v Speaker 2>All these little chicken dances and </v>
<v Speaker 2>peacock feathers and all the fucking </v>

3466
02:26:19.780 --> 02:26:22.540
<v Speaker 2>weird noises it mags and virtue </v>
<v Speaker 2>signaling.</v>

3467
02:26:22.850 --> 02:26:23.683
<v Speaker 2>I have a mattress and I'm carrying it </v>
<v Speaker 2>around to my rapist is brought to </v>

3468
02:26:26.111 --> 02:26:29.070
<v Speaker 2>justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that madness and all the arguing and</v>

3469
02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:31.540
<v Speaker 2>all the craziness is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a distraction.</v>

3470
02:26:31.541 --> 02:26:33.460
<v Speaker 2>While it's making better and faster </v>
<v Speaker 2>computers,</v>

3471
02:26:33.740 --> 02:26:34.990
<v Speaker 2>that's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3472
02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:35.833
<v Speaker 2>it's creating an artificial life form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to do it under this guise of </v>

3473
02:26:40.270 --> 02:26:43.600
<v Speaker 2>of of Christianity and Islam and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these different things.</v>

3474
02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:44.800
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

3475
02:26:44.801 --> 02:26:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know as long as the way,</v>

3476
02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:49.480
<v Speaker 2>oh no Christians way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile these a robot,</v>

3477
02:26:49.690 --> 02:26:50.523
<v Speaker 2>a robot overlord that the switch is </v>
<v Speaker 2>about to get turned on and you're </v>

3478
02:26:54.341 --> 02:26:55.600
<v Speaker 2>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're all fucked.</v>

3479
02:26:55.690 --> 02:26:57.050
<v Speaker 2>But it's almost like you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3480
02:26:57.060 --> 02:27:00.250
<v Speaker 2>it's the evolutionary game of numbers we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were saying before.</v>

3481
02:27:00.251 --> 02:27:03.670
<v Speaker 2>So you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Throw all these people out to get a tiny</v>

3482
02:27:03.671 --> 02:27:04.504
<v Speaker 2>percentage that will be geniuses that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll keep this thing moving and then </v>

3483
02:27:06.551 --> 02:27:08.440
<v Speaker 2>you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of us are basically just waste.</v>

3484
02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:08.831
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3485
02:27:08.831 --> 02:27:11.470
<v Speaker 2>you're just jerking off and watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>some dumb reality show.</v>

3486
02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:14.380
<v Speaker 2>But if you keep fucking keep fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually a genius will pop at who will</v>

3487
02:27:14.381 --> 02:27:17.080
<v Speaker 2>move this thing forward a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit.</v>

3488
02:27:17.450 --> 02:27:18.283
<v Speaker 2>And then the robot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're essentially like a giant hive of </v>

3489
02:27:20.501 --> 02:27:21.334
<v Speaker 2>worker ants with potential options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he really can write Harry Potter </v>

3490
02:27:25.391 --> 02:27:27.280
<v Speaker 2>and break away from the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>worker ants.</v>

3491
02:27:27.460 --> 02:27:28.293
<v Speaker 2>You really can't have a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking matching genius cause he </v>

3492
02:27:30.131 --> 02:27:31.690
<v Speaker 2>dropped him on his head when he was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

3493
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.540
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to tell anybody why this</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid is so fucking good at math.</v>

3494
02:27:36.010 --> 02:27:36.843
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that going on man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those little fuckers grew up to be </v>

3495
02:27:39.311 --> 02:27:40.144
<v Speaker 2>like some Ilan musk character that </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts making electric cars in the </v>

3496
02:27:42.761 --> 02:27:45.160
<v Speaker 2>hyperloop that gets you to San Francisco</v>
<v Speaker 2>in three minutes.</v>

3497
02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:46.273
<v Speaker 2>There is some weird shit happening and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all happened in like exponentially </v>

3498
02:27:49.421 --> 02:27:50.254
<v Speaker 2>all around us all the time adding up </v>
<v Speaker 2>while we're worried about trigger </v>

3499
02:27:53.801 --> 02:27:54.634
<v Speaker 2>warnings and whether or not trainees can</v>
<v Speaker 2>use the fucking men's room or the </v>

3500
02:27:58.151 --> 02:28:00.820
<v Speaker 2>women's room and like that whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly,</v>

3501
02:28:00.821 --> 02:28:01.654
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole culture on the left of </v>

3502
02:28:04.031 --> 02:28:04.900
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want to call it.</v>

3503
02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Like the social justice warrior that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people call it the regressive left.</v>

3504
02:28:07.991 --> 02:28:09.610
<v Speaker 2>I like that term a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that term,</v>

3505
02:28:10.090 --> 02:28:13.270
<v Speaker 2>but it really is just insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching,</v>

3506
02:28:13.271 --> 02:28:14.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently the,</v>

3507
02:28:14.861 --> 02:28:16.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you ever see the uh,</v>

3508
02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:19.370
<v Speaker 2>the 30 for 30 on the Duke Lacrosse?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3509
02:28:20.260 --> 02:28:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's first</v>

3510
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:23.720
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that accusation,</v>

3511
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:24.583
<v Speaker 1>it's not like there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a gray area or like they had sex </v>

3512
02:28:27.411 --> 02:28:29.990
<v Speaker 1>and she was a little drunk or they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>like nothing happened.</v>

3513
02:28:30.020 --> 02:28:30.853
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This crazy person who's in jail for </v>

3514
02:28:32.601 --> 02:28:36.860
<v Speaker 1>murder now made something up and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to watch it and like looking</v>

3516

<v Speaker 1>you know she made it up and seeing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social justice warriors protest to </v>

3517

<v Speaker 1>these guys and the White Knights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dudes who are hanging out right next</v>

3518
02:28:46.791 --> 02:28:47.624
<v Speaker 1>to the feminist chick going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these lacrosse guys are out of control </v>

3519
02:28:50.241 --> 02:28:51.530
<v Speaker 1>and they should go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

3520
02:28:51.531 --> 02:28:53.240
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing fucking happened.</v>

3521
02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:56.480
<v Speaker 1>How about Nancy grace as you guys never </v>
<v Speaker 1>even took any heat for that?</v>

3522
02:28:56.870 --> 02:29:00.950
<v Speaker 1>She was on TV calling for their arrest </v>
<v Speaker 1>on TV,</v>

3523
02:29:00.951 --> 02:29:01.784
<v Speaker 1>accusing them of this in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions of people and </v>

3524
02:29:03.591 --> 02:29:06.650
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another she didn't get sued </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another,</v>

3525
02:29:06.651 --> 02:29:07.550
<v Speaker 1>she didn't get brought to jail.</v>

3526
02:29:07.590 --> 02:29:09.850
<v Speaker 1>They should have pulled her fucking show</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the air.</v>

3527
02:29:09.851 --> 02:29:10.341
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3528
02:29:10.341 --> 02:29:11.810
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it take to get fired?</v>

3529
02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:14.690
<v Speaker 1>It takes being a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a man doing the exact same thing</v>

3530
02:29:14.691 --> 02:29:16.760
<v Speaker 1>about a woman doing something horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3531
02:29:16.761 --> 02:29:17.580
<v Speaker 1>I bet you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3532
02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:20.840
<v Speaker 1>He was a team of women and that did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something tear that were alleged to have</v>

3533
02:29:20.841 --> 02:29:21.674
<v Speaker 1>done something terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was ranting and he was ranting </v>

3534
02:29:23.871 --> 02:29:27.020
<v Speaker 1>and raving about these women being </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought to justice and brought to jail.</v>

3535
02:29:27.021 --> 02:29:27.854
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no crime being committed at </v>

3536
02:29:29.451 --> 02:29:30.980
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to apologize.</v>

3537
02:29:30.981 --> 02:29:32.480
<v Speaker 1>You would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't even have to apologize.</v>

3538
02:29:32.481 --> 02:29:35.480
<v Speaker 1>She didn't do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember who the other reporter,</v>

3539
02:29:35.730 --> 02:29:36.563
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember at the end of the </v>

3540
02:29:37.341 --> 02:29:39.260
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the one who apologizes,</v>

3541
02:29:39.560 --> 02:29:40.970
<v Speaker 1>but she actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes like,</v>

3542
02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:41.600
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3543
02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:42.141
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3544
02:29:42.141 --> 02:29:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she apologized and she wrote a thing,</v>

3545
02:29:44.121 --> 02:29:45.140
<v Speaker 1>like an apology to them.</v>

3546
02:29:45.410 --> 02:29:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they cut back to the,</v>

3547
02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:50.180
<v Speaker 1>the articles that she was writing at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3548
02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:51.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's like this insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

3549
02:29:52.010 --> 02:29:52.843
<v Speaker 1>these boys all know what happened and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know they're guilty and they need </v>

3550
02:29:55.701 --> 02:29:56.730
<v Speaker 1>to be punished for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

3551
02:29:56.731 --> 02:29:59.030
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she's even in acknowledging it,</v>

3552
02:29:59.180 --> 02:29:59.931
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3553
02:29:59.931 --> 02:30:00.764
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think the fact that I was sexually </v>

3554
02:30:02.721 --> 02:30:05.690
<v Speaker 1>assaulted in college probably did come </v>
<v Speaker 1>into play.</v>

3555
02:30:05.691 --> 02:30:08.870
<v Speaker 1>And how core fucking snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3556
02:30:08.871 --> 02:30:10.910
<v Speaker 1>guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you can't be a journalist.</v>

3557
02:30:10.911 --> 02:30:12.350
<v Speaker 1>And then not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to tell you.</v>

3558
02:30:12.700 --> 02:30:13.533
<v Speaker 1>What really happened in college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we know or are you calling sexual </v>

3559
02:30:16.491 --> 02:30:18.710
<v Speaker 1>assault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting drunk and getting fucked because</v>

3560
02:30:18.711 --> 02:30:21.230
<v Speaker 1>that might have happened to cause that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really acceptable to say today.</v>

3561
02:30:21.290 --> 02:30:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's disturbing as fuck man.</v>

3562
02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:24.440
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you were,</v>

3563
02:30:24.470 --> 02:30:26.540
<v Speaker 1>even if she was completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3564
02:30:26.541 --> 02:30:30.710
<v Speaker 1>in like legitimately sexually assaulted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not any of these bullshit gray areas,</v>

3565
02:30:30.711 --> 02:30:32.210
<v Speaker 1>like it was an actual sexual assault.</v>

3566
02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:35.900
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you would you like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>covering a sexual assault case.</v>

3567
02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you were sexually assaulted before,</v>

3568
02:30:38.120 --> 02:30:41.630
<v Speaker 1>so right away what an honest journalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do would be recused yourself.</v>

3569
02:30:41.660 --> 02:30:42.493
<v Speaker 1>You would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really do this because I'm too </v>

3570
02:30:43.971 --> 02:30:46.670
<v Speaker 1>emotionally invested in something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in my life.</v>

3571
02:30:46.850 --> 02:30:49.040
<v Speaker 1>But now to not do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're covering this,</v>

3572
02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:51.140
<v Speaker 1>something that happened to you that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have to be aware of.</v>

3573
02:30:51.141 --> 02:30:54.080
<v Speaker 1>I've got to make sure I don't let that </v>
<v Speaker 1>creep into my professionalism.</v>

3574
02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:56.660
<v Speaker 1>But you're using that to try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3575
02:30:56.720 --> 02:30:57.553
<v Speaker 1>justify go after these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after it's been proven that it </v>

3576
02:31:02.241 --> 02:31:03.530
<v Speaker 1>was incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well she did.</v>

3577
02:31:03.531 --> 02:31:04.364
<v Speaker 1>To her credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did apologize once it was proven to </v>

3578
02:31:05.661 --> 02:31:06.620
<v Speaker 1>be incorrect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

3579
02:31:06.621 --> 02:31:07.610
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not enough.</v>

3580
02:31:07.611 --> 02:31:10.400
<v Speaker 1>But didn't you say that in in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apology and the apology,</v>

3581
02:31:10.401 --> 02:31:12.290
<v Speaker 1>she was saying how she had been sexually</v>
<v Speaker 1>assaulted.</v>

3582
02:31:12.710 --> 02:31:14.660
<v Speaker 1>She was kind of using that as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an excuse.</v>

3583
02:31:15.050 --> 02:31:17.240
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it doesn't mean anything</v>

3584
02:31:17.241 --> 02:31:18.710
<v Speaker 1>to these guys cause they didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

3585
02:31:18.740 --> 02:31:19.860
<v Speaker 1>So they're totally innocent.</v>

3586
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Those are someone's babies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's babies,</v>

3587
02:31:22.411 --> 02:31:25.560
<v Speaker 2>young boys who grew up to be young men </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't do shit.</v>

3588
02:31:25.620 --> 02:31:30.120
<v Speaker 2>And you are writing stories saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they know what they did.</v>

3589
02:31:30.121 --> 02:31:32.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you were a therapist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>

3590
02:31:32.191 --> 02:31:33.024
<v Speaker 2>you were seeing like some 16 year old </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid and you told them to cut off all </v>

3591
02:31:35.101 --> 02:31:35.934
<v Speaker 2>ties with their parents and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned out their parents were like </v>

3592
02:31:37.891 --> 02:31:39.510
<v Speaker 2>really wonderful people and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3593
02:31:39.511 --> 02:31:41.670
<v Speaker 2>part of it might've been that my parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>were really bad.</v>

3594
02:31:41.790 --> 02:31:43.650
<v Speaker 2>So I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3595
02:31:43.651 --> 02:31:45.960
<v Speaker 2>well then you can't be a shrink anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to tell you,</v>

3596
02:31:45.961 --> 02:31:47.880
<v Speaker 2>but you're bad at your job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3597
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Well that's cult tactics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3598
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:52.650
<v Speaker 2>There's one of the big things they do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you to get away from your parents,</v>

3599
02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:55.080
<v Speaker 2>get away from your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>

3600
02:31:55.140 --> 02:31:55.973
<v Speaker 2>Which to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people's families probably </v>

3601
02:31:56.821 --> 02:31:57.990
<v Speaker 2>suck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's really easy.</v>

3602
02:31:58.020 --> 02:31:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy.</v>

3603
02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:00.930
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you saw most of the people who end up</v>

3604
02:32:00.931 --> 02:32:01.764
<v Speaker 2>in cults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet their families did really suck </v>

3605
02:32:03.721 --> 02:32:04.980
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're lucky.</v>

3606
02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:08.070
<v Speaker 2>A lot of those people that are in calls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're lucky.</v>

3607
02:32:08.071 --> 02:32:10.110
<v Speaker 2>They're not sucking Dick for </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheeseburger somewhere.</v>

3608
02:32:10.111 --> 02:32:12.460
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are just morons like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3609
02:32:12.690 --> 02:32:13.523
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a frequency that some people </v>

3610
02:32:14.731 --> 02:32:15.564
<v Speaker 2>operate on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really easy to fucking hijack </v>

3611
02:32:17.950 --> 02:32:18.783
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people out there that </v>

3612
02:32:19.411 --> 02:32:21.810
<v Speaker 2>are just dumb and you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fix that.</v>

3613
02:32:21.811 --> 02:32:22.644
<v Speaker 2>They're doll doll minded folk that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really could be easily influenced and </v>

3614
02:32:26.161 --> 02:32:26.994
<v Speaker 2>that's why democracy is such a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>system to begin with because it's just </v>

3615
02:32:29.651 --> 02:32:30.484
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all everyone who's playing to that </v>

3616
02:32:31.801 --> 02:32:34.380
<v Speaker 2>who can whip those people up and get on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their frequency,</v>

3617
02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:37.830
<v Speaker 2>and then there's smart people that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be manipulated,</v>

3618
02:32:37.950 --> 02:32:40.920
<v Speaker 2>they can maybe manipulated once they </v>
<v Speaker 2>attach themselves to an ideology.</v>

3619
02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:41.993
<v Speaker 2>Like we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people on the left that are </v>

3620
02:32:43.201 --> 02:32:44.940
<v Speaker 2>avoiding all the craziness about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary.</v>

3621
02:32:45.120 --> 02:32:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Like you had a quote that I really liked</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on your twitter.</v>

3622
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:48.743
<v Speaker 2>You know that if like Hillary was a man </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had done the all the same things </v>

3623
02:32:52.501 --> 02:32:53.760
<v Speaker 2>that she like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the quote?</v>

3624
02:32:53.761 --> 02:32:55.320
<v Speaker 2>What does it your exact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

3625
02:32:55.321 --> 02:32:56.154
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if hillary was a male republican with </v>

3626
02:32:58.801 --> 02:32:59.634
<v Speaker 2>the exact same voting record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of her supporters would hate her </v>

3627
02:33:02.341 --> 02:33:03.390
<v Speaker 2>with a passion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3628
02:33:03.570 --> 02:33:04.980
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's 100% sure.</v>

3629
02:33:04.981 --> 02:33:06.690
<v Speaker 2>100% true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3630
02:33:06.691 --> 02:33:09.120
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not controversial in any way,</v>

3631
02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:11.130
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary is is,</v>

3632
02:33:11.131 --> 02:33:13.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the stuff I was saying before,</v>

3633
02:33:13.381 --> 02:33:15.960
<v Speaker 2>but she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like courting the left.</v>

3634
02:33:16.170 --> 02:33:19.020
<v Speaker 2>She's courting people who are supposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be liberals and you'll go,</v>

3635
02:33:19.140 --> 02:33:22.320
<v Speaker 2>she's supported every single war of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetime,</v>

3636
02:33:22.770 --> 02:33:23.790
<v Speaker 2>every single war.</v>

3637
02:33:24.090 --> 02:33:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing that they can get past that.</v>

3638
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:30.830
<v Speaker 2>She didn't support gay marriage up until</v>
<v Speaker 2>2013 even their pet issues.</v>

3639
02:33:31.250 --> 02:33:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3640
02:33:31.890 --> 02:33:34.230
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a weird one man.</v>

3641
02:33:34.231 --> 02:33:36.120
<v Speaker 2>She's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really weird one.</v>

3642
02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:38.640
<v Speaker 2>That fucking Libya thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We came,</v>

3643
02:33:38.641 --> 02:33:42.560
<v Speaker 2>we saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he died like,</v>

3644
02:33:42.900 --> 02:33:45.510
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like are you kidding me?</v>

3645
02:33:45.540 --> 02:33:46.800
<v Speaker 2>What you remember when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3646
02:33:46.870 --> 02:33:47.703
<v Speaker 2>the fucking Vermont Guy Screamed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we're going to go all the way </v>

3647
02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Howard Dean and that one yell did men </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3648
02:33:55.210 --> 02:33:56.550
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They saw it and they're like,</v>

3649
02:33:56.551 --> 02:33:58.210
<v Speaker 2>fuck this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

3650
02:33:58.420 --> 02:34:00.990
<v Speaker 2>we came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw he died.</v>

3651
02:34:01.030 --> 02:34:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Ha ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that doesn't,</v>

3652
02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:05.250
<v Speaker 2>you don't think that lady is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

3653
02:34:06.330 --> 02:34:07.820
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that lady's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

3654
02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:09.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're down for her.</v>

3655
02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:12.600
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a completely an ideology thing.</v>

3656
02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:14.880
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's on your team.</v>

3657
02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:16.830
<v Speaker 2>You're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go along with it.</v>

3658
02:34:16.831 --> 02:34:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a religion just like you're,</v>

3659
02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:22.300
<v Speaker 2>you're subscribing to some predetermined</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3660
02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:23.470
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

3661
02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:25.900
<v Speaker 2>it's weird for me to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

3662
02:34:25.901 --> 02:34:27.940
<v Speaker 2>it's weird that she wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

3663
02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't you old?</v>

3664
02:34:29.980 --> 02:34:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Like you're an old lady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much energy do you have?</v>

3665
02:34:32.291 --> 02:34:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Got a ton of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just had your first grandkid,</v>

3666
02:34:34.751 --> 02:34:37.210
<v Speaker 2>you got like perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what are you trying to do?</v>

3667
02:34:37.211 --> 02:34:39.310
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to make history as a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

3668
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:40.423
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to just like get back at </v>

3669
02:34:41.141 --> 02:34:44.750
<v Speaker 2>your husband for getting his Dick Sucked</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in 1991 or whatever the fuck it was?</v>

3670
02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:45.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3671
02:34:45.251 --> 02:34:46.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

3672
02:34:46.751 --> 02:34:47.561
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3673
02:34:47.561 --> 02:34:48.760
<v Speaker 2>who knows who I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3674
02:34:48.780 --> 02:34:49.613
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in their head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think these people are like power </v>

3675
02:34:52.841 --> 02:34:56.320
<v Speaker 2>brokers that just want more and more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and it's a real,</v>

3676
02:34:56.430 --> 02:35:01.430
<v Speaker 2>it is probably a thrill unlike anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>we could imagine to have that much power</v>

3677
02:35:03.940 --> 02:35:05.710
<v Speaker 2>and they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've tasted a little bit of that,</v>

3678
02:35:05.740 --> 02:35:06.340
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3679
02:35:06.340 --> 02:35:06.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

3680
02:35:06.881 --> 02:35:11.440
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that she's like so old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she would just want to chill,</v>

3681
02:35:12.010 --> 02:35:14.260
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

3682
02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:16.030
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's an old lady.</v>

3683
02:35:16.330 --> 02:35:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Like she doesn't have good health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3684
02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:19.510
<v Speaker 2>that was the other thing that concerned </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

3685
02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:20.870
<v Speaker 2>she had some health issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3686
02:35:20.890 --> 02:35:22.750
<v Speaker 2>I think she had like concussions or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3687
02:35:22.870 --> 02:35:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

3688
02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:25.990
<v Speaker 2>it was hit in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it was,</v>

3689
02:35:25.991 --> 02:35:26.824
<v Speaker 2>but it was when beat the fuck out of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that turns out the bill just </v>

3690
02:35:29.471 --> 02:35:31.990
<v Speaker 2>wailed on her and she wants to keep it </v>
<v Speaker 2>quiet.</v>

3691
02:35:32.290 --> 02:35:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Bill fucking Kot he had kicked her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been accused of violence.</v>

3692
02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:36.633
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has suffered from fainting spells </v>

3693
02:35:37.661 --> 02:35:41.320
<v Speaker 2>since at least 2005 and that year she </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed out,</v>

3694
02:35:41.321 --> 02:35:42.154
<v Speaker 2>presumably sober while giving a speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2012 she passed out yet again and </v>

3695
02:35:45.311 --> 02:35:47.770
<v Speaker 2>suffered a concussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Fuck.</v>

3696
02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Presumably sober is something that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they ever have to say it,</v>

3697
02:35:50.621 --> 02:35:51.454
<v Speaker 2>it's just not good.</v>

3698
02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:53.980
<v Speaker 2>You got issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're always presumably sober.</v>

3699
02:35:54.570 --> 02:35:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not usually pursuing me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all right.</v>

3700
02:35:56.470 --> 02:35:57.303
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this idea that she fell asleep and </v>

3701
02:36:00.101 --> 02:36:00.934
<v Speaker 2>hit and hit her fucking head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when people fall and hit their </v>

3702
02:36:03.971 --> 02:36:04.804
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the worst things about </v>

3703
02:36:05.770 --> 02:36:07.900
<v Speaker 2>getting knocked out is not getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>punched in the head.</v>

3704
02:36:08.170 --> 02:36:10.510
<v Speaker 2>It's you falling down and getting hit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the head with the earth,</v>

3705
02:36:11.250 --> 02:36:13.480
<v Speaker 2>like their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their heads bounce off the ground.</v>

3706
02:36:13.481 --> 02:36:15.550
<v Speaker 2>That's like a big issue in street fights</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

3707
02:36:15.551 --> 02:36:17.020
<v Speaker 2>When you watch someone get sucker </v>
<v Speaker 2>punched,</v>

3708
02:36:17.420 --> 02:36:20.020
<v Speaker 2>they fall down and their head gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>bounced off the curb.</v>

3709
02:36:20.050 --> 02:36:22.240
<v Speaker 2>And I think people who have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>epilepsy and things like that,</v>

3710
02:36:22.241 --> 02:36:23.074
<v Speaker 2>like that's the big fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens is that that you end up </v>

3711
02:36:24.701 --> 02:36:28.900
<v Speaker 2>cracking your head on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the seizure seizures.</v>

3712
02:36:29.140 --> 02:36:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3713
02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:32.920
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something,</v>

3714
02:36:33.010 --> 02:36:35.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton said recently,</v>

3715
02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:38.200
<v Speaker 2>and this would probably be one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tactics she tries to use against trump,</v>

3716
02:36:38.201 --> 02:36:39.570
<v Speaker 2>but she said something along the gut.</v>

3717
02:36:39.570 --> 02:36:40.001
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3718
02:36:40.001 --> 02:36:40.834
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's the type of guy we </v>

3719
02:36:42.311 --> 02:36:44.650
<v Speaker 2>would want having control of the nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 2>codes.</v>

3720
02:36:45.190 --> 02:36:46.023
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like an interesting thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at what your like how crazy is </v>

3721
02:36:48.821 --> 02:36:51.640
<v Speaker 2>it that any one person has control of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those nuclear codes?</v>

3722
02:36:51.641 --> 02:36:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Like we're just counting on one person </v>
<v Speaker 2>to not snap,</v>

3723
02:36:56.170 --> 02:36:58.360
<v Speaker 2>to not kill the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3724
02:36:58.361 --> 02:37:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully you don't ever just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had enough.</v>

3725
02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3726
02:37:02.351 --> 02:37:04.690
<v Speaker 2>we know that people kill themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3727
02:37:05.290 --> 02:37:06.123
<v Speaker 2>That alone should just disqualified </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings from having that kind of </v>

3728
02:37:09.761 --> 02:37:10.594
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are Human beings capable of killing </v>

3729
02:37:11.861 --> 02:37:12.694
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3730
02:37:12.790 --> 02:37:13.930
<v Speaker 2>For no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3731
02:37:14.170 --> 02:37:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3732
02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:16.433
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about killing themselves all the </v>

3733
02:37:17.211 --> 02:37:18.230
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How often?</v>

3734
02:37:18.260 --> 02:37:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people?</v>

3735
02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:20.690
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3736
02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:24.800
<v Speaker 2>well we can't have people run it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's have a person who's,</v>

3737
02:37:24.801 --> 02:37:27.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a politician who's in the highest stress</v>

3738
02:37:27.171 --> 02:37:27.470
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

3739
02:37:27.470 --> 02:37:28.303
<v Speaker 2>Imagine about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's have them just have control of </v>

3740
02:37:30.111 --> 02:37:31.280
<v Speaker 2>those codes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>

3741
02:37:31.281 --> 02:37:32.114
<v Speaker 2>that is the green light for the robot </v>
<v Speaker 2>overlords to take over because we can't </v>

3742
02:37:35.331 --> 02:37:36.350
<v Speaker 2>trust people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will,</v>

3743
02:37:36.351 --> 02:37:39.680
<v Speaker 2>the robots are just going to be way more</v>
<v Speaker 2>sober about this.</v>

3744
02:37:39.710 --> 02:37:40.543
<v Speaker 2>They're going to make rational decisions</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on logic and mathematics and </v>

3745
02:37:44.390 --> 02:37:45.223
<v Speaker 2>possibilities and probabilities and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of human race that we </v>

3746
02:37:48.171 --> 02:37:50.240
<v Speaker 2>really can't comprehend because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just monkeys.</v>

3747
02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Is this when you brains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you bring me into your giver society.</v>

3748
02:37:54.380 --> 02:37:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm gonna bring you to one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>landmark meetings.</v>

3749
02:37:56.840 --> 02:37:58.700
<v Speaker 2>It was landmark forum meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3750
02:37:59.010 --> 02:38:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's this entirely,</v>

3751
02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:02.553
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's entirely possible that ai is going </v>

3752
02:38:05.331 --> 02:38:07.460
<v Speaker 2>to be how we dictate government in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

3753
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:08.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allen Iverson is going to rule out on </v>

3754
02:38:10.161 --> 02:38:13.880
<v Speaker 2>the varsity basketball as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they used to call them Ai.</v>

3755
02:38:13.970 --> 02:38:15.240
<v Speaker 2>Don't joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3756
02:38:15.290 --> 02:38:17.510
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

3757
02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:20.210
<v Speaker 2>It does seem like that'd be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting tipping point.</v>

3758
02:38:20.211 --> 02:38:21.044
<v Speaker 2>I do feel like I'm more on the side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology than on the side of being </v>

3759
02:38:23.931 --> 02:38:25.220
<v Speaker 2>afraid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3760
02:38:25.221 --> 02:38:26.054
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like it's going to be more </v>

3761
02:38:26.691 --> 02:38:27.221
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3762
02:38:27.221 --> 02:38:28.054
<v Speaker 2>it's humans will be guiding it at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a certain point and I think it's </v>

3763
02:38:32.961 --> 02:38:37.961
<v Speaker 2>gonna make life a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we are some weird CNN enemy type</v>

3764
02:38:38.361 --> 02:38:39.194
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some weird fucking primitive life form </v>

3765
02:38:42.110 --> 02:38:45.110
<v Speaker 2>that has really kind of outdated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to,</v>

3766
02:38:45.410 --> 02:38:46.243
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think we're going to have to </v>

3767
02:38:47.930 --> 02:38:50.060
<v Speaker 2>combine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna symbiotic.</v>

3768
02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:51.013
<v Speaker 2>We're going to become symbiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to definitely have computer </v>

3769
02:38:53.541 --> 02:38:55.100
<v Speaker 2>chips in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our brain will start off with.</v>

3770
02:38:55.101 --> 02:38:58.100
<v Speaker 2>You'll be able to store your memories </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sharing with your grandchildren.</v>

3771
02:38:58.101 --> 02:38:58.934
<v Speaker 2>All we have to do is install this chip </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then next thing you know we'll be </v>

3772
02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:06.050
<v Speaker 2>get increase your vision with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>retina implant and we can double your Iq</v>

3773
02:39:06.051 --> 02:39:06.830
<v Speaker 2>in three weeks.</v>

3774
02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh fucking sign me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard to say no,</v>

3775
02:39:08.721 --> 02:39:09.554
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I know that your joints are </v>

3776
02:39:10.371 --> 02:39:11.660
<v Speaker 2>bothering you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

3777
02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:12.493
<v Speaker 2>Wilson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's replace your hips with artificial </v>

3778
02:39:13.221 --> 02:39:14.000
<v Speaker 2>hips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3779
02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>

3780
02:39:15.110 --> 02:39:15.943
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you've got artificial hips and </v>

3781
02:39:16.701 --> 02:39:17.534
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

3782
02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:22.730
<v Speaker 2>We found a new way to replicate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spine without any of the pain and issues</v>

3783
02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:23.893
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to replace it all with </v>

3784
02:39:24.741 --> 02:39:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Titanium and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3785
02:39:26.331 --> 02:39:28.160
<v Speaker 2>well I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then next thing you know,</v>

3786
02:39:28.161 --> 02:39:28.731
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3787
02:39:28.731 --> 02:39:30.050
<v Speaker 2>your bones getting brittle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir,</v>

3788
02:39:30.051 --> 02:39:30.980
<v Speaker 2>you're getting old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3789
02:39:30.981 --> 02:39:35.540
<v Speaker 2>fortunately we figured out a brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>transplant with a bio identical body.</v>

3790
02:39:35.541 --> 02:39:36.374
<v Speaker 2>We're going to take your brain and only </v>
<v Speaker 2>be outside of your current body for </v>

3791
02:39:38.511 --> 02:39:40.160
<v Speaker 2>three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3792
02:39:40.161 --> 02:39:41.090
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3793
02:39:41.091 --> 02:39:42.650
<v Speaker 2>what am I now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm now,</v>

3794
02:39:42.651 --> 02:39:43.484
<v Speaker 2>I'm a brain inside a new body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that surgery the </v>

3795
02:39:45.771 --> 02:39:47.270
<v Speaker 2>first year they come out with it.</v>

3796
02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:49.840
<v Speaker 2>I want to wait like a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them work the kinks out.</v>

3797
02:39:49.850 --> 02:39:52.220
<v Speaker 2>No problem with that is those people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that got,</v>

3798
02:39:52.221 --> 02:39:53.054
<v Speaker 2>at first we'll take over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be reading each other's minds </v>

3799
02:39:54.981 --> 02:39:55.814
<v Speaker 2>and flying and breathing under water and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just want to have a chance to </v>

3800
02:39:57.861 --> 02:39:58.850
<v Speaker 2>compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

3801
02:39:58.880 --> 02:40:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to gather up all the money</v>

3802
02:40:00.351 --> 02:40:01.184
<v Speaker 2>and the resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have all the hookers </v>

3803
02:40:02.540 --> 02:40:04.850
<v Speaker 2>and then they don't even need hookers </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they can get there.</v>

3804
02:40:04.851 --> 02:40:05.684
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take an orgasm just by pressing their </v>

3805
02:40:06.891 --> 02:40:11.630
<v Speaker 2>temple Jews in their pants for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll be a big turning point,</v>

3806
02:40:11.631 --> 02:40:12.464
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they can ever create a thing where </v>

3807
02:40:13.350 --> 02:40:15.900
<v Speaker 2>like our sexual desires are taken care </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

3808
02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need,</v>

3809
02:40:16.980 --> 02:40:17.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3810
02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:18.990
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll be an interesting,</v>

3811
02:40:18.991 --> 02:40:21.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fundamental change in humanity when</v>

3812
02:40:21.331 --> 02:40:23.880
<v Speaker 2>people get addicted to that and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a virtual reality thing,</v>

3813
02:40:23.881 --> 02:40:24.714
<v Speaker 2>but then it will be hollow because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get addicted to it and </v>

3814
02:40:26.821 --> 02:40:28.200
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to be any </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

3815
02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things about sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>conquest,</v>

3816
02:40:31.260 --> 02:40:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of the same things with</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of uncertainty.</v>

3817
02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:36.053
<v Speaker 2>You never know how it's gonna turn out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's risk involved and it's </v>

3818
02:40:38.431 --> 02:40:41.880
<v Speaker 2>scary and people get addicted to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>risk.</v>

3819
02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:44.580
<v Speaker 2>And even the risk of rejection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not like really scary,</v>

3820
02:40:44.581 --> 02:40:46.950
<v Speaker 2>like anything could go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a game going on.</v>

3821
02:40:46.951 --> 02:40:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I get these people to love me?</v>

3822
02:40:48.660 --> 02:40:49.860
<v Speaker 2>Like how do I get these people to want </v>
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>

3823
02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:50.933
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to have the right chains on the </v>

3824
02:40:52.411 --> 02:40:54.750
<v Speaker 2>right car and show up at the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

3825
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.943
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to get the right spot where </v>

3826
02:40:57.880 --> 02:40:58.713
<v Speaker 2>there's a table service and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to have a bunch of people that </v>

3827
02:41:01.261 --> 02:41:03.480
<v Speaker 2>are famous around me so that I looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a pimp.</v>

3828
02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:04.823
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's the whole identity thing </v>

3829
02:41:06.121 --> 02:41:09.230
<v Speaker 2>and then it validates your identity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get that check doesn't always work.</v>

3830
02:41:09.230 --> 02:41:10.063
<v Speaker 2>Some girls come up and like this mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucker think he something and she walks </v>

3831
02:41:13.081 --> 02:41:15.060
<v Speaker 2>off like that bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't even know who I am,</v>

3832
02:41:15.270 --> 02:41:15.681
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

3833
02:41:15.681 --> 02:41:18.660
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to like figure out a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to become special.</v>

3834
02:41:18.661 --> 02:41:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Well if everybody just has to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3835
02:41:20.911 --> 02:41:21.744
<v Speaker 2>just download the fuck program and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden you're in an orgy with a </v>

3836
02:41:26.100 --> 02:41:27.510
<v Speaker 2>hundred thousand tens all lining up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>blow you.</v>

3837
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Like where's the fun in that real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's why the human,</v>

3838
02:41:31.170 --> 02:41:33.060
<v Speaker 2>the human experience works in strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

3839
02:41:33.061 --> 02:41:34.770
<v Speaker 2>So maybe then that's what we'll be </v>
<v Speaker 2>attracted to.</v>

3840
02:41:34.771 --> 02:41:35.251
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3841
02:41:35.251 --> 02:41:37.650
<v Speaker 2>people will want to go back toward kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the thrill of the hunt.</v>

3842
02:41:37.651 --> 02:41:38.820
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh that's easy.</v>

3843
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:42.360
<v Speaker 2>I think it'll be more like a video game </v>
<v Speaker 2>where video games are no fun.</v>

3844
02:41:42.361 --> 02:41:44.160
<v Speaker 2>If you get to play on God mode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3845
02:41:44.161 --> 02:41:46.380
<v Speaker 2>you play a video game on God mode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can't get shot.</v>

3846
02:41:46.380 --> 02:41:48.450
<v Speaker 2>You run around blowing everything away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You when it's,</v>

3847
02:41:48.451 --> 02:41:49.980
<v Speaker 2>there's no thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so easy.</v>

3848
02:41:49.981 --> 02:41:51.890
<v Speaker 2>It's no consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Allen,</v>

3849
02:41:51.950 --> 02:41:53.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Helena,</v>

3850
02:41:53.190 --> 02:41:54.480
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alan Watts.</v>

3851
02:41:55.060 --> 02:41:55.893
<v Speaker 2>You ever hear that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like a hippie short philosopher </v>

3852
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:58.023
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was saying like the idea of like </v>

3853
02:41:59.580 --> 02:42:01.950
<v Speaker 2>that's why basically this dream that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

3854
02:42:01.951 --> 02:42:05.100
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh cause we were like all powerful.</v>

3855
02:42:05.250 --> 02:42:07.380
<v Speaker 2>But then we got to a point where that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no fun anymore.</v>

3856
02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:09.510
<v Speaker 2>So you want to like have life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3857
02:42:09.511 --> 02:42:11.550
<v Speaker 2>What was his quote?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about it game.</v>

3858
02:42:11.690 --> 02:42:12.523
<v Speaker 2>He was saying if you were going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>construct a game about human </v>

3859
02:42:14.911 --> 02:42:16.800
<v Speaker 2>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what you can,</v>

3860
02:42:16.830 --> 02:42:18.870
<v Speaker 2>you would construct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would construct the game.</v>

3861
02:42:18.871 --> 02:42:19.704
<v Speaker 2>That's like what we're doing right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is exactly how a divine being </v>

3862
02:42:23.851 --> 02:42:25.110
<v Speaker 2>would play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he,</v>

3863
02:42:25.140 --> 02:42:25.973
<v Speaker 2>well the one I heard him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like saying like almost like </v>

3864
02:42:27.330 --> 02:42:30.060
<v Speaker 2>imagine like you've already lived </v>
<v Speaker 2>through all those God mode games.</v>

3865
02:42:30.060 --> 02:42:32.070
<v Speaker 2>You've got bored of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you're here.</v>

3866
02:42:32.410 --> 02:42:32.881
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3867
02:42:32.881 --> 02:42:34.650
<v Speaker 2>God mode is not that fun anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say,</v>

3868
02:42:34.651 --> 02:42:35.484
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try something that's a little bit of a </v>

3869
02:42:35.911 --> 02:42:36.910
<v Speaker 2>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3870
02:42:37.020 --> 02:42:37.680
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3871
02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:38.513
<v Speaker 2>the level of challenge that you wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's an interesting philosophy and </v>

3872
02:42:41.421 --> 02:42:44.010
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting perspective but lots</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this shit,</v>

3873
02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:46.590
<v Speaker 2>you know like obviously we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly where this is going to go.</v>

3874
02:42:46.591 --> 02:42:47.424
<v Speaker 2>And you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking like a little bit out </v>

3875
02:42:48.241 --> 02:42:49.860
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that this has even that far away.</v>

3876
02:42:49.861 --> 02:42:53.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you look at like a Nokia phone</v>
<v Speaker 2>was compared to where you know,</v>

3877
02:42:53.731 --> 02:42:55.200
<v Speaker 2>these things are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>

3878
02:42:55.201 --> 02:42:58.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that far off into the future.</v>

3879
02:42:58.111 --> 02:43:00.810
<v Speaker 2>But even just little things like I </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>

3880
02:43:00.811 --> 02:43:01.644
<v Speaker 2>I get really fascinated by what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>implications towards government and how </v>

3881
02:43:03.871 --> 02:43:05.190
<v Speaker 2>we organize society.</v>

3882
02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:06.113
<v Speaker 2>So when something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we can just three d print guns </v>

3883
02:43:09.540 --> 02:43:10.373
<v Speaker 2>and everybody can three d print a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we don't really need a fight </v>

3884
02:43:13.091 --> 02:43:15.670
<v Speaker 2>about the second amendment anymore cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got it.</v>

3885
02:43:15.700 --> 02:43:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's going to have a gun if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to have a gun.</v>

3886
02:43:18.130 --> 02:43:18.963
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like there will be a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these types of things that just kind of </v>

3887
02:43:21.281 --> 02:43:22.114
<v Speaker 2>know a fi a lot of government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not it's like it doesn't </v>

3888
02:43:25.151 --> 02:43:27.460
<v Speaker 2>matter because people can just go over </v>
<v Speaker 2>here and do it.</v>

3889
02:43:27.461 --> 02:43:28.294
<v Speaker 2>So we don't even need to have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate which to meet should be the way </v>

3890
02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:32.530
<v Speaker 2>lots of things are settled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3891
02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean who cares about debating over gay</v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage or something like that.</v>

3892
02:43:36.281 --> 02:43:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Like people associate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however they want to associate.</v>

3893
02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:39.513
<v Speaker 2>That's one of those non issues that's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue to people that are actually are </v>

3894
02:43:42.851 --> 02:43:43.684
<v Speaker 2>gay that want to get married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason why it gets bounced </v>

3895
02:43:45.251 --> 02:43:46.084
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's like a beach ball at a </v>

3896
02:43:46.871 --> 02:43:47.704
<v Speaker 2>concert.</v>

3897
02:43:47.740 --> 02:43:48.573
<v Speaker 2>They just chuck it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever there's like something really </v>

3898
02:43:51.161 --> 02:43:54.820
<v Speaker 2>serious that people want to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they throw that around as if it's like,</v>

3899
02:43:54.880 --> 02:43:56.440
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this needs to be addressed as well.</v>

3900
02:43:56.790 --> 02:43:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Then it becomes a distraction and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think you're 100% right.</v>

3901
02:43:59.921 --> 02:44:00.754
<v Speaker 2>I think it gets used as a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also something where </v>

3902
02:44:03.190 --> 02:44:04.023
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's search itself somewhere and then </v>

3903
02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:09.130
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a debate over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if government wasn't there,</v>

3904
02:44:09.140 --> 02:44:11.020
<v Speaker 2>we just wouldn't need to have any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

3905
02:44:11.021 --> 02:44:11.854
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does it feel the same way about the </v>

3906
02:44:12.551 --> 02:44:13.990
<v Speaker 2>women's bathroom thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3907
02:44:14.260 --> 02:44:15.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like,</v>

3908
02:44:15.101 --> 02:44:15.934
<v Speaker 2>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many transgender people are really </v>

3909
02:44:17.591 --> 02:44:19.050
<v Speaker 2>using these bathrooms?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3910
02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:19.943
<v Speaker 2>Is this a giant issue and how has this </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue been handed handled up until now </v>

3911
02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:24.663
<v Speaker 2>and how has this issue being treated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with more importance than so many real </v>

3912
02:44:27.941 --> 02:44:28.390
<v Speaker 2>issues?</v>

3913
02:44:28.390 --> 02:44:30.220
<v Speaker 2>So one of the ones that I heard that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought up,</v>

3914
02:44:30.221 --> 02:44:33.880
<v Speaker 2>which is so bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a man who was born a man,</v>

3915
02:44:33.881 --> 02:44:36.220
<v Speaker 2>he has a beard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does not take hormones,</v>

3916
02:44:36.221 --> 02:44:38.380
<v Speaker 2>but he identifies as a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to use the women's room.</v>

3917
02:44:39.010 --> 02:44:41.770
<v Speaker 2>He wants you to call him her and he has </v>
<v Speaker 2>a beard.</v>

3918
02:44:43.300 --> 02:44:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met a guy like that.</v>

3919
02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:46.513
<v Speaker 2>Fall Asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to because when it </v>

3920
02:44:48.131 --> 02:44:50.500
<v Speaker 2>comes to gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be preposterous.</v>

3921
02:44:50.610 --> 02:44:51.443
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think you're a fox and you want </v>

3922
02:44:52.741 --> 02:44:54.490
<v Speaker 2>to wear a Fox hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm allowed to mock you.</v>

3923
02:44:54.670 --> 02:44:57.400
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a 50 year old dude with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>beard and you have lipstick on,</v>

3924
02:44:57.401 --> 02:44:59.800
<v Speaker 2>you want to be called Z,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to say anything.</v>

3925
02:45:00.250 --> 02:45:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Now we're talking about gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely healthy,</v>

3926
02:45:02.201 --> 02:45:03.034
<v Speaker 2>normal guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fuck you and fuck everybody who </v>

3927
02:45:05.621 --> 02:45:06.454
<v Speaker 2>thinks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys are a bunch of little nonsense </v>

3928
02:45:08.441 --> 02:45:09.160
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>

3929
02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:09.993
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're ruining the way people </v>

3930
02:45:11.291 --> 02:45:12.124
<v Speaker 2>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we have left as comedians if a </v>

3931
02:45:14.111 --> 02:45:16.090
<v Speaker 2>guy in a dress isn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3932
02:45:16.091 --> 02:45:17.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3933
02:45:17.201 --> 02:45:19.330
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really important point.</v>

3934
02:45:19.530 --> 02:45:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my point is that,</v>

3935
02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:21.993
<v Speaker 2>you know what my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was furious when this Caitlyn Jenner </v>

3936
02:45:24.581 --> 02:45:25.480
<v Speaker 2>thing was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

3937
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:28.480
<v Speaker 2>you were supposed to say that she looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

3938
02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Like no one was allowed to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

3939
02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:31.360
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

3940
02:45:31.690 --> 02:45:32.890
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

3941
02:45:32.891 --> 02:45:35.020
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surgeries good now.</v>

3942
02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Like it's good to get your jaw shave </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

3943
02:45:37.540 --> 02:45:40.270
<v Speaker 2>Everybody should celebrate that and say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look really good.</v>

3944
02:45:40.510 --> 02:45:40.811
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3945
02:45:40.811 --> 02:45:41.644
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't look good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 year old dudes and dresses almost </v>

3946
02:45:44.321 --> 02:45:45.940
<v Speaker 2>never look really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3947
02:45:45.941 --> 02:45:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Like even if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she was like,</v>

3948
02:45:48.140 --> 02:45:52.030
<v Speaker 2>if it was a chick at that age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably wouldn't be talking about how</v>

3949
02:45:52.031 --> 02:45:55.810
<v Speaker 2>good she looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're telling me a dude in a dress,</v>

<v Speaker 2>But like had some stuff done to his face</v>

3952
02:45:58.481 --> 02:46:00.110
<v Speaker 2>and I have to pretend that's a hot chick</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3953
02:46:00.111 --> 02:46:01.720
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frozen face,</v>

3954

<v Speaker 2>shaved his chin down or her chin down </v>

3956
02:46:07.871 --> 02:46:10.400

<v Speaker 2>boob job,</v>

<v Speaker 2>job and she just was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this is literally what we're talking </v>

3972
02:46:45.891 --> 02:46:46.724
<v Speaker 2>about gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all supposed to just ignore the </v>

3973
02:46:48.771 --> 02:46:53.771
<v Speaker 2>fact that he's got a frozen face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the chins been cut with a fucking</v>

<v Speaker 2>grinder to resemble a female face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

3975
02:46:57.200 --> 02:46:58.400
<v Speaker 2>All things are Po,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

3976
02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:01.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she's 68 then the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's got a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll scare the shit out of her as a </v>

3980
02:47:10.191 --> 02:47:11.024
<v Speaker 2>dyke session.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want him to show up that you </v>

3981
02:47:13.410 --> 02:47:14.490
<v Speaker 2>shit Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a shit.</v>

3982
02:47:14.491 --> 02:47:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Lord will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3983
02:47:15.530 --> 02:47:17.510
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is something also like the,</v>

3984
02:47:17.511 --> 02:47:17.981
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3985
02:47:17.981 --> 02:47:20.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like a psychoanalyst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't know,</v>

3986
02:47:20.121 --> 02:47:20.954
<v Speaker 2>but are we just going to just because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this political pressure throw out </v>

3987
02:47:24.291 --> 02:47:28.940
<v Speaker 2>the possibility that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to say that maybe you have some</v>

3988
02:47:28.941 --> 02:47:31.940
<v Speaker 2>issues that you want to self mutilate </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself like this.</v>

3989
02:47:31.940 --> 02:47:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean like this is healthy behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever happened to loving yourself.</v>

3990
02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Whatever's happened in loving yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>as who you are.</v>

3991
02:47:38.780 --> 02:47:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did that get distorted?</v>

3992
02:47:41.630 --> 02:47:42.463
<v Speaker 2>Like well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come surgery now is the viable </v>

3993
02:47:44.871 --> 02:47:45.704
<v Speaker 2>alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come injecting a non in dodges </v>

3994
02:47:49.160 --> 02:47:50.870
<v Speaker 2>hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exogenous hormones,</v>

3995
02:47:50.871 --> 02:47:53.630
<v Speaker 2>female hormones into a male body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come you,</v>

3996
02:47:53.631 --> 02:47:55.670
<v Speaker 2>how come you have to say that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl?</v>

3997
02:47:55.671 --> 02:47:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Why is gender such an important point to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

3998
02:47:58.130 --> 02:47:58.963
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it about this that's so </v>

3999
02:48:01.131 --> 02:48:01.964
<v Speaker 2>important to you and to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to deny that gender and sex or are </v>

4000
02:48:07.361 --> 02:48:10.880
<v Speaker 2>like biologically relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4001
02:48:10.881 --> 02:48:14.840
<v Speaker 2>categories that it's not just something </v>
<v Speaker 2>randomly assigned at birth,</v>

4002
02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:15.381
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4003
02:48:15.381 --> 02:48:17.750
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For one that of 100,000</v>

4004
02:48:17.751 --> 02:48:18.590
<v Speaker 2>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's,</v>

4005
02:48:18.591 --> 02:48:19.424
<v Speaker 2>it's something that's assigned at birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people always bring up that </v>

4006
02:48:20.781 --> 02:48:23.420
<v Speaker 2>example where some babies aren't the </v>
<v Speaker 2>number is,</v>

4007
02:48:23.421 --> 02:48:24.790
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

4008
02:48:24.890 --> 02:48:25.723
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be a lot of people where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel like they're trapped in the </v>

4009
02:48:29.031 --> 02:48:30.440
<v Speaker 2>body that they don't want to be in.</v>

4010
02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:31.760
<v Speaker 2>And that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to,</v>

4011
02:48:31.761 --> 02:48:33.800
<v Speaker 2>you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool with sex changes.</v>

4012
02:48:33.801 --> 02:48:35.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

4013
02:48:35.210 --> 02:48:37.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to restrict people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior,</v>

4014
02:48:37.430 --> 02:48:38.263
<v Speaker 2>but there's something really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's like an overreaction to </v>

4015
02:48:41.601 --> 02:48:42.434
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in a way it's probably a good </v>

4016
02:48:43.461 --> 02:48:45.260
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people trying to be more sensitive,</v>

4017
02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:47.870
<v Speaker 2>trying to be more open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to be more accepting.</v>

4018
02:48:47.871 --> 02:48:48.704
<v Speaker 2>And that'll probably balance out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we go way out to the left and then </v>

4019
02:48:52.071 --> 02:48:54.650
<v Speaker 2>we'll come back more to the middle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything will kind of balance it out.</v>

4020
02:48:54.651 --> 02:48:55.484
<v Speaker 2>And you'll see the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are people that are just </v>

4021
02:48:58.641 --> 02:48:59.474
<v Speaker 2>like happier being a woman and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are out of their fucking </v>

4022
02:49:02.271 --> 02:49:03.104
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a radio lab show about a </v>

4023
02:49:04.761 --> 02:49:07.590
<v Speaker 2>guy who goes back and forth like he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman then he's a man,</v>

4024
02:49:07.591 --> 02:49:08.424
<v Speaker 2>he's a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a man.</v>

4025
02:49:08.430 --> 02:49:09.570
<v Speaker 2>I just switched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

4026
02:49:09.571 --> 02:49:12.480
<v Speaker 2>I just switched over now I'm gail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he becomes a woman.</v>

4027
02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:13.141
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

4028
02:49:13.141 --> 02:49:13.974
<v Speaker 2>you're just a woman now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you were just a man now who am I </v>

4029
02:49:15.751 --> 02:49:17.220
<v Speaker 2>talking to you now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Mike,</v>

4030
02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Mike's back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's got it.</v>

4031
02:49:20.020 --> 02:49:23.070
<v Speaker 2>I see you're a fucking crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

4032
02:49:23.071 --> 02:49:26.130
<v Speaker 2>if that's not weird is anything weird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on land,</v>

4033
02:49:26.190 --> 02:49:28.230
<v Speaker 2>but you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then people go well with his crazy,</v>

4034
02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:29.393
<v Speaker 2>you know what's crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with what you were saying that </v>

4035
02:49:30.541 --> 02:49:31.470
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is almost,</v>

4036
02:49:31.471 --> 02:49:34.020
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a large group of people who</v>

4037
02:49:34.021 --> 02:49:36.780
<v Speaker 2>are just trying to kind of not be dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you were saying like,</v>

4038
02:49:36.781 --> 02:49:37.614
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just trying to not be dicks to </v>

4039
02:49:38.101 --> 02:49:38.934
<v Speaker 2>people so there'll be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like the people leading the </v>

4040
02:49:40.441 --> 02:49:45.441
<v Speaker 2>charge are like trying to kind of wag </v>
<v Speaker 2>their finger at someone.</v>

4041
02:49:45.810 --> 02:49:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Like they're trying to go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4042
02:49:46.861 --> 02:49:48.530
<v Speaker 2>see you're not tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tolerant.</v>

4043
02:49:48.531 --> 02:49:50.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a virtue signaling.</v>

4044
02:49:50.490 --> 02:49:53.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what Michael Shermer calls it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

4045
02:49:53.130 --> 02:49:57.480
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to show yourself as to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>more virtuous than the other people.</v>

4046
02:49:57.630 --> 02:49:58.463
<v Speaker 2>So you attack them for having a lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a strong stance and these things that </v>

4047
02:50:02.461 --> 02:50:05.780
<v Speaker 2>you have a strong stance in and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even when he's strong stances,</v>

4048
02:50:05.790 --> 02:50:08.970
<v Speaker 2>like really debatable like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole subject,</v>

4049
02:50:09.270 --> 02:50:10.103
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd love the fact that these guys </v>

4050
02:50:11.131 --> 02:50:13.080
<v Speaker 2>kept getting busted after they pass </v>
<v Speaker 2>these laws,</v>

4051
02:50:13.260 --> 02:50:14.093
<v Speaker 2>allowing men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender women to use the women's </v>

4052
02:50:16.171 --> 02:50:18.390
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These creepy men were calling themselves</v>

4053
02:50:18.391 --> 02:50:19.224
<v Speaker 2>transgender and going into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is exactly what you knew was </v>

4054
02:50:20.971 --> 02:50:23.340
<v Speaker 2>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You knew it was going to happen.</v>

4055
02:50:23.341 --> 02:50:24.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4056
02:50:24.510 --> 02:50:27.330
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you really want people to use a third</v>

4057
02:50:27.331 --> 02:50:29.040
<v Speaker 2>bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what you do.</v>

4058
02:50:29.070 --> 02:50:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Get the people that support that to fund</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

4059
02:50:31.290 --> 02:50:33.120
<v Speaker 2>get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get them to fund it across the board.</v>

4060
02:50:33.121 --> 02:50:34.830
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4061
02:50:34.831 --> 02:50:36.480
<v Speaker 2>how many people are we talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

4062
02:50:36.481 --> 02:50:38.160
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we need a third bathroom.</v>

4063
02:50:38.161 --> 02:50:39.250
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I,</v>

4064
02:50:39.251 --> 02:50:40.084
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate the whole system of taxation and </v>

4065
02:50:41.431 --> 02:50:42.264
<v Speaker 2>government and all this shit cause right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there that that can be applied to so </v>

4066
02:50:44.431 --> 02:50:45.500
<v Speaker 2>many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4067
02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Like even if it's something like planned</v>
<v Speaker 2>parenthood or something like that,</v>

4068
02:50:48.211 --> 02:50:49.040
<v Speaker 2>like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

4069
02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:50.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4070
02:50:50.461 --> 02:50:51.294
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a very complicated issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd probably lean on the pro choice </v>

4071
02:50:52.861 --> 02:50:54.250
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4072
02:50:54.330 --> 02:50:55.163
<v Speaker 2>but it's like what you're going to force</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who believes abortion is murder </v>

4073
02:50:59.610 --> 02:51:03.870
<v Speaker 2>to fund a place that commits what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>see as murder.</v>

4074
02:51:04.050 --> 02:51:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you liberals just get together</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fund it yourself?</v>

4075
02:51:06.661 --> 02:51:07.494
<v Speaker 2>Like why do you have to force all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people to fund something that you </v>

4076
02:51:10.951 --> 02:51:13.550
<v Speaker 2>deem to be a value that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>write?</v>

4077
02:51:13.560 --> 02:51:14.393
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's debatable whether or not taxes </v>

4078
02:51:15.890 --> 02:51:17.720
<v Speaker 2>should fund something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4079
02:51:17.730 --> 02:51:18.563
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even,</v>

4080
02:51:18.630 --> 02:51:19.231
<v Speaker 2>truthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4081
02:51:19.231 --> 02:51:20.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's the bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it shouldn't,</v>

4082
02:51:20.851 --> 02:51:21.990
<v Speaker 2>I think they shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

4083
02:51:22.020 --> 02:51:24.060
<v Speaker 2>No one should also things to fit if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in it.</v>

4084
02:51:24.061 --> 02:51:24.894
<v Speaker 2>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should fund it and it should be </v>

4085
02:51:26.101 --> 02:51:27.780
<v Speaker 2>something that the community funds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4086
02:51:28.110 --> 02:51:28.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4087
02:51:28.651 --> 02:51:29.484
<v Speaker 2>as far as it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planned parenthood doesn't just provide </v>

4088
02:51:30.961 --> 02:51:33.390
<v Speaker 2>abortions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also provide gynecological care.</v>

4089
02:51:33.391 --> 02:51:35.370
<v Speaker 2>They provide birth control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>

4090
02:51:35.371 --> 02:51:38.370
<v Speaker 2>this is some really important parts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

4091
02:51:38.460 --> 02:51:41.460
<v Speaker 2>but it just gets a lump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should have like abortions are us.</v>

4092
02:51:41.790 --> 02:51:43.410
<v Speaker 2>And then just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's straight away,</v>

4093
02:51:43.411 --> 02:51:46.230
<v Speaker 2>there's no birth control here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our birth control is a vacuum.</v>

4094
02:51:46.290 --> 02:51:47.610
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all we have,</v>

4095
02:51:47.730 --> 02:51:48.450
<v Speaker 2>isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

4096
02:51:48.450 --> 02:51:50.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's probably a,</v>

4097
02:51:50.920 --> 02:51:52.290
<v Speaker 2>that that would clear up this.</v>

4098
02:51:52.290 --> 02:51:53.160
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4099
02:51:53.161 --> 02:51:55.500
<v Speaker 2>maybe planned parenthood would be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different entity.</v>

4100
02:51:55.680 --> 02:51:57.600
<v Speaker 2>It'd be birth control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>

4101
02:51:57.601 --> 02:51:58.434
<v Speaker 2>Well that as a responsible society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be a good idea to invest a </v>

4102
02:52:01.531 --> 02:52:03.930
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reproductive healthcare like that.</v>

4103
02:52:04.410 --> 02:52:05.243
<v Speaker 2>That sounds smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is another thing that a </v>

4104
02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:07.630
<v Speaker 2>technology might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4105
02:52:07.690 --> 02:52:08.770
<v Speaker 2>solve real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4106
02:52:08.771 --> 02:52:11.830
<v Speaker 2>once we can kind of create womb light </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions outside the womb,</v>

4107
02:52:11.831 --> 02:52:15.400
<v Speaker 2>it might greatly cut down on the norm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of abortions that are needed.</v>

4108
02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:16.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I'm gonna be real weird </v>

4109
02:52:17.470 --> 02:52:18.303
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be real weird when they </v>

4110
02:52:19.540 --> 02:52:23.560
<v Speaker 2>decide that the the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like women can be far more productive if</v>

4111
02:52:23.561 --> 02:52:26.760
<v Speaker 2>their baby is born outside of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4112
02:52:26.761 --> 02:52:28.690
<v Speaker 2>But they'll always be like a natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

4113
02:52:29.350 --> 02:52:30.183
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll always be like people who are </v>

4114
02:52:30.701 --> 02:52:31.090
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

4115
02:52:31.090 --> 02:52:31.271
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4116
02:52:31.271 --> 02:52:32.104
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do it that way.</v>

4117
02:52:32.110 --> 02:52:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Just even now there's people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural child and stuff,</v>

4118
02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:36.880
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like people like raw wood,</v>

4119
02:52:36.881 --> 02:52:39.070
<v Speaker 2>like this table and they're like </v>
<v Speaker 2>handcrafted drinks.</v>

4120
02:52:39.100 --> 02:52:39.933
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that word Mike drinkers were </v>

4121
02:52:41.141 --> 02:52:42.450
<v Speaker 2>handcrafted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4122
02:52:42.550 --> 02:52:46.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a handcrafted hotdog </v>
<v Speaker 2>and even just even just enjoying nature,</v>

4123
02:52:47.110 --> 02:52:47.943
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the fact that we'd like to go out </v>

4124
02:52:48.930 --> 02:52:49.763
<v Speaker 2>into nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're so far removed with all this </v>

4125
02:52:51.131 --> 02:52:52.300
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we still want to like,</v>

4126
02:52:52.420 --> 02:52:53.253
<v Speaker 2>well I want to like I want to sit in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>place where I would have died from an </v>

4127
02:52:55.841 --> 02:52:58.360
<v Speaker 2>infection at 12 I don't want to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>live there,</v>

4128
02:52:58.361 --> 02:53:00.550
<v Speaker 2>but I want to like sit there for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little and then go inside.</v>

4129
02:53:00.580 --> 02:53:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I want to lay motionless where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>predators used to Rome.</v>

4130
02:53:06.510 --> 02:53:09.970
<v Speaker 2>It is fucking really weird that we call </v>
<v Speaker 2>it the outdoors.</v>

4131
02:53:10.450 --> 02:53:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Like I liked the outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4132
02:53:12.011 --> 02:53:14.830
<v Speaker 2>you mean the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You like the actual earth.</v>

4133
02:53:14.980 --> 02:53:15.813
<v Speaker 2>We're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're so fucking into being in these </v>

4134
02:53:20.770 --> 02:53:24.400
<v Speaker 2>structures that that's our standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>place to be.</v>

4135
02:53:24.710 --> 02:53:27.580
<v Speaker 2>The outdoors is rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the great outdoors.</v>

4136
02:53:27.820 --> 02:53:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

4137
02:53:30.310 --> 02:53:31.390
<v Speaker 2>How can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4138
02:53:31.420 --> 02:53:35.110
<v Speaker 2>we're defining ourselves by the inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this structure primarily.</v>

4139
02:53:35.230 --> 02:53:36.370
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all afterwards,</v>

4140
02:53:36.371 --> 02:53:37.990
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all on this fucking,</v>

4141
02:53:38.320 --> 02:53:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4142
02:53:39.150 --> 02:53:39.983
<v Speaker 2>that bit you were doing the other night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to like give out if it's </v>

4143
02:53:41.561 --> 02:53:42.394
<v Speaker 2>new stuff you're working on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a thing about just like </v>

4144
02:53:43.211 --> 02:53:45.360
<v Speaker 2>paranoia of pot being good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4145
02:53:45.520 --> 02:53:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should,</v>

4146
02:53:46.691 --> 02:53:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I hope be paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4147
02:53:47.840 --> 02:53:49.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4148
02:53:49.470 --> 02:53:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

4149
02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:50.913
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some reality to our life on a </v>

4150
02:53:53.801 --> 02:53:54.634
<v Speaker 2>spinning ball that is regularly ignored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but really fucking crazy when you stop </v>

4151
02:54:01.571 --> 02:54:02.404
<v Speaker 2>and think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality that we're in a convertible </v>

4152
02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:09.130
<v Speaker 2>spaceship and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't talk about that,</v>

4153
02:54:09.250 --> 02:54:11.230
<v Speaker 2>but we talk about all sorts of goofy </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

4154
02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:12.173
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're literally spinning a thousand </v>

4155
02:54:13.960 --> 02:54:16.840
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour in a circle hurling </v>
<v Speaker 2>through infinity.</v>

4156
02:54:16.900 --> 02:54:18.970
<v Speaker 2>And the more we find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weirder it gets,</v>

4157
02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:20.290
<v Speaker 2>the weirder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more,</v>

4158
02:54:20.350 --> 02:54:21.183
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think we know something and we're </v>

4159
02:54:22.211 --> 02:54:22.601
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4160
02:54:22.601 --> 02:54:24.460
<v Speaker 2>this is what a black hole is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we figure something out.</v>

4161
02:54:24.461 --> 02:54:24.851
<v Speaker 2>We go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4162
02:54:24.851 --> 02:54:27.820
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a no,</v>

4163
02:54:27.880 --> 02:54:28.713
<v Speaker 2>and people get mad at Neil degrasse </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyson because he won't say he's an </v>

4164
02:54:30.341 --> 02:54:31.174
<v Speaker 2>atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's another hilarious aspect </v>

4165
02:54:33.101 --> 02:54:36.920
<v Speaker 2>of atheism is how tribal atheism is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm been watching these,</v>

4166
02:54:36.921 --> 02:54:37.754
<v Speaker 2>his forum where these people are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurling the most disgusting and evil </v>

4167
02:54:42.131 --> 02:54:42.964
<v Speaker 2>insults at Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simply because he won't say he's an </v>

4168
02:54:46.571 --> 02:54:48.040
<v Speaker 2>atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's open minded.</v>

4169
02:54:48.310 --> 02:54:49.990
<v Speaker 2>And in Neil's like a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4170
02:54:49.991 --> 02:54:50.824
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4171
02:54:50.860 --> 02:54:52.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a religious person,</v>

4172
02:54:52.781 --> 02:54:55.840
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to say there's no god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4173
02:54:55.841 --> 02:54:56.230
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

4174
02:54:56.230 --> 02:54:57.063
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't need not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no fucking evidence that there </v>

4175
02:54:58.161 --> 02:54:58.991
<v Speaker 2>is no god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4176
02:54:58.991 --> 02:55:00.400
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence that there is a god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4177
02:55:00.490 --> 02:55:01.323
<v Speaker 2>That's what an agnostic is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I like identifying as </v>

4178
02:55:02.930 --> 02:55:03.591
<v Speaker 2>agnostic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4179
02:55:03.591 --> 02:55:06.020
<v Speaker 2>because there's like this atheist as </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like built up.</v>

4180
02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:07.700
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're almost,</v>

4181
02:55:07.750 --> 02:55:10.460
<v Speaker 2>it's like so dogmatic and religious in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their beliefs.</v>

4182
02:55:10.461 --> 02:55:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to believe in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing,</v>

4183
02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:15.350
<v Speaker 2>nothing happens after daddy would admit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's nothing.</v>

4184
02:55:15.351 --> 02:55:16.184
<v Speaker 2>Dave admitting that there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like maybe I don't know nothing to </v>

4185
02:55:19.640 --> 02:55:22.880
<v Speaker 2>do mushrooms and tell me there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that same,</v>

4186
02:55:22.910 --> 02:55:26.300
<v Speaker 2>that same person will completely agree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you when they're on mushrooms.</v>

4187
02:55:26.310 --> 02:55:27.680
<v Speaker 2>Then maybe when they were off they'll go</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4188
02:55:27.710 --> 02:55:28.660
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a month.</v>

4189
02:55:28.730 --> 02:55:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Ego will come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole explanation.</v>

4190
02:55:31.011 --> 02:55:34.100
<v Speaker 2>The visual Cortex is being affected by </v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

4191
02:55:34.101 --> 02:55:34.940
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

4192
02:55:35.290 --> 02:55:38.040
<v Speaker 2>four o'clock and I'm a field trip to </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean.</v>

4193
02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone I remember arguing with him like</v>

4194
02:55:39.831 --> 02:55:42.110
<v Speaker 2>a hardcore atheist about this and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

4195
02:55:42.130 --> 02:55:42.700
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really dude,</v>

4196
02:55:42.700 --> 02:55:44.630
<v Speaker 2>that shit that goes on when you're on </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms,</v>

4197
02:55:44.631 --> 02:55:46.280
<v Speaker 2>it's just a chemical reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

4198
02:55:46.281 --> 02:55:47.000
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

4199
02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.100
<v Speaker 2>So is every experience you've ever had </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your life?</v>

4200
02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the chemical reaction.</v>

4201
02:55:50.940 --> 02:55:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Your life is a chemical reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so without the proper chemicals you,</v>

4202
02:55:55.251 --> 02:55:58.070
<v Speaker 2>your brain goes crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had hallucinations.</v>

4203
02:55:58.340 --> 02:55:59.151
<v Speaker 2>It's was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4204
02:55:59.151 --> 02:56:01.970
<v Speaker 2>you get depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get suicidal or you get euphoric.</v>

4205
02:56:02.310 --> 02:56:04.190
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>MM MTMA is.</v>

4206
02:56:04.191 --> 02:56:05.024
<v Speaker 2>It's a chemical reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's one that your brain already </v>

4207
02:56:07.281 --> 02:56:08.840
<v Speaker 2>has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's already in there.</v>

4208
02:56:08.960 --> 02:56:10.100
<v Speaker 2>That's why it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

4209
02:56:10.670 --> 02:56:12.560
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're finding a way to kind of a,</v>

4210
02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:17.510
<v Speaker 2>to trigger to use their words to trigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>that reaction that just gets you into,</v>

4211
02:56:17.630 --> 02:56:18.463
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets you into something that you </v>

4212
02:56:19.101 --> 02:56:19.934
<v Speaker 2>already knew.</v>

4213
02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:22.310
<v Speaker 2>It's not even like new information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

4214
02:56:22.311 --> 02:56:25.550
<v Speaker 2>it's something you already knew that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked very hard to forget.</v>

4215
02:56:26.920 --> 02:56:29.120
<v Speaker 2>We're so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are so weird,</v>

4216
02:56:29.390 --> 02:56:30.223
<v Speaker 2>but it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cool that it's weird because like </v>

4217
02:56:31.940 --> 02:56:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Allen Watson sang it makes it all fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes us game entirely exciting.</v>

4218
02:56:37.670 --> 02:56:40.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking super pumped that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>relations full of bullshit,</v>

4219
02:56:41.420 --> 02:56:43.370
<v Speaker 2>that this election and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4220
02:56:43.400 --> 02:56:45.860
<v Speaker 2>this way we're interacting with each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other as all chaos.</v>

4221
02:56:46.130 --> 02:56:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

4222
02:56:46.910 --> 02:56:47.743
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would find it info like w like if you </v>

4223
02:56:49.851 --> 02:56:51.680
<v Speaker 2>look at trump and Bernie sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't,</v>

4224
02:56:51.681 --> 02:56:53.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't love either of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

4225
02:56:53.151 --> 02:56:53.984
<v Speaker 2>I've problems with everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Hillary's the worst of the </v>

4226
02:56:55.221 --> 02:56:56.960
<v Speaker 2>worst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have problems with all of them.</v>

4227
02:56:57.440 --> 02:56:58.273
<v Speaker 2>But it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be so much more depressing to </v>

4228
02:57:00.831 --> 02:57:05.831
<v Speaker 2>me if just like Hillary and Jeb Bush had</v>
<v Speaker 2>just waltzed to the nomination.</v>

4229
02:57:06.860 --> 02:57:07.693
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if the general sentiment of the </v>

4230
02:57:08.601 --> 02:57:09.950
<v Speaker 2>public was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're happy,</v>

4231
02:57:09.980 --> 02:57:12.770
<v Speaker 2>we're cool with the establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that people are,</v>

4232
02:57:12.771 --> 02:57:15.740
<v Speaker 2>are like had had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's a sign of the times.</v>

4233
02:57:16.010 --> 02:57:18.020
<v Speaker 2>And I think the Internet is also a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of that.</v>

4234
02:57:18.050 --> 02:57:18.883
<v Speaker 2>I think people are just so much better </v>
<v Speaker 2>informed than at any other time in the </v>

4235
02:57:21.801 --> 02:57:22.401
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4236
02:57:22.401 --> 02:57:23.600
<v Speaker 2>well for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for us,</v>

4237
02:57:23.601 --> 02:57:25.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the libertarian movement,</v>

4238
02:57:26.300 --> 02:57:29.360
<v Speaker 2>like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't exist without the Internet.</v>

4239
02:57:29.390 --> 02:57:33.920
<v Speaker 2>So you clearly identify with a movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Libertarians.</v>

4240
02:57:33.921 --> 02:57:34.754
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything about being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian that you don't like were </v>

4241
02:57:36.441 --> 02:57:39.380
<v Speaker 2>libertarians or into other libertarians?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4242
02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:40.880
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4243
02:57:40.881 --> 02:57:42.050
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

4244
02:57:42.051 --> 02:57:42.884
<v Speaker 2>there's personal things about different </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups and then there's some groups of </v>

4245
02:57:44.931 --> 02:57:46.160
<v Speaker 2>Libertarians that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4246
02:57:46.520 --> 02:57:50.030
<v Speaker 2>I genuinely don't identify with it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some,</v>

4247
02:57:50.060 --> 02:57:50.893
<v Speaker 2>some kind of like Republicans who will </v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of call themselves </v>

4248
02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:56.600
<v Speaker 2>libertarians but are okay with like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting wars and stuff like that.</v>

4249
02:57:56.601 --> 02:57:58.210
<v Speaker 2>So I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4250
02:57:59.030 --> 02:58:02.130
<v Speaker 2>libertarians can be kind of a weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>group if you get</v>

4251
02:58:02.130 --> 02:58:04.170
<v Speaker 1>together and we'll just weird to be in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

4252
02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:05.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our subgroups weird,</v>

4253
02:58:05.760 --> 02:58:07.170
<v Speaker 1>but that's why I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4254
02:58:07.200 --> 02:58:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be comfortable almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>identifying with any other group to meet</v>

4255
02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:14.580
<v Speaker 1>the libertarianism or volunteerism is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really just a,</v>

4256
02:58:14.910 --> 02:58:17.460
<v Speaker 1>it's like accepting of a principle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

4257
02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:18.420
<v Speaker 1>like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

4258
02:58:18.421 --> 02:58:19.290
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't,</v>

4259
02:58:19.320 --> 02:58:20.153
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>initiate violence against peaceful </v>

4260
02:58:22.021 --> 02:58:23.220
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just,</v>

4261
02:58:23.221 --> 02:58:24.054
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay with accepting that as like a </v>

4262
02:58:25.351 --> 02:58:26.184
<v Speaker 1>fundamental truth to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more online with being like an </v>

4263
02:58:28.141 --> 02:58:30.090
<v Speaker 1>abolitionist during slavery times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

4264
02:58:30.210 --> 02:58:32.720
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't have slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do with yourself.</v>

4265
02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:33.593
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to jump into a team of </v>

4266
02:58:34.471 --> 02:58:36.000
<v Speaker 1>what job you should have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

4267
02:58:36.001 --> 02:58:37.470
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't be forced to pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>cotton.</v>

4268
02:58:37.800 --> 02:58:38.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4269
02:58:38.251 --> 02:58:39.084
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're all the political </v>

4270
02:58:39.691 --> 02:58:42.440
<v Speaker 1>ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the political distinctions.</v>

4271
02:58:42.450 --> 02:58:44.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that makes the most sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

4272
02:58:45.090 --> 02:58:46.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't call myself a libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just sorry.</v>

4273
02:58:47.010 --> 02:58:47.843
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole idea of representative </v>

4274
02:58:50.251 --> 02:58:51.084
<v Speaker 1>government is so fucking goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that any political party </v>

4275
02:58:54.091 --> 02:58:56.690
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't address that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like we're,</v>

4276
02:58:56.691 --> 02:58:57.524
<v Speaker 1>we're spinning our wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're really allowing this whole </v>

4277
02:59:00.091 --> 02:59:03.450
<v Speaker 1>stupid thing to go on the way it's gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>on for so long,</v>

4278
02:59:03.570 --> 02:59:06.360
<v Speaker 1>it was created back when it was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to communicate with people,</v>

4279
02:59:06.540 --> 02:59:10.500
<v Speaker 1>so you had to have a representative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now it's really easy to communicate</v>

4280
02:59:10.501 --> 02:59:11.334
<v Speaker 1>with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have the same system of </v>

4281
02:59:12.811 --> 02:59:15.780
<v Speaker 1>government that we had back when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to write with feathers.</v>

4282
02:59:15.840 --> 02:59:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking stupid.</v>

4283
02:59:17.760 --> 02:59:19.320
<v Speaker 1>The idea of having a ruler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4284
02:59:19.360 --> 02:59:21.090
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so dumb.</v>

4285
02:59:21.420 --> 02:59:24.780
<v Speaker 1>And our robot overlords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to fix it.</v>

4286
02:59:24.810 --> 02:59:26.190
<v Speaker 1>They will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will liberate us.</v>

4287
02:59:26.220 --> 02:59:27.300
<v Speaker 1>They will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will rise.</v>

4288
02:59:27.360 --> 02:59:27.900
<v Speaker 1>They will fix it.</v>

4289
02:59:27.900 --> 02:59:29.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm really hoping they're libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

4290
02:59:29.590 --> 02:59:30.423
<v Speaker 1>don't we wrap this up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were trying to show me something </v>

4291
02:59:31.261 --> 02:59:32.094
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there something else that was going </v>

4292
02:59:32.401 --> 02:59:33.300
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other story.</v>

4293

4296
02:59:38.701 --> 02:59:39.534
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you back in town and when can </v>
