1
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.850
Experience,

2
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.610
<v 1>everybody.
My guest today,</v>

3
00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:23.870
if you've ever seen the movie Gasland or gas land to the man who made it,

4
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.970
<v 2>created it and uh,
the,
the best friend of the oil industry,</v>

5
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.480
Josh Fox,
ladies and gentlemen,
what's up dude,
thanks for doing this.

6
00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:33.160
I really appreciate it.
I'm happy to be here.

7
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.190
<v 1>You know,
I uh,
I put on Twitter and I put on a,
you know,
online on my message</v>

8
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.480
<v 2>board people were talking about this Josh Fox from gas land movie and you either</v>

9
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:47.481
have people who love you who are so happy for what you're doing or there's

10
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:52.890
people and even people that don't even have a vested interest in the oil

11
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:57.891
business that get really aggressive about like debunking your claims or calling

12
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:05.850
you a liar or calling you fraudulent.
I think those people are mostly not people.

13
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.290
I think they're from the oil industry really.
I mean if you really look into it,

14
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.460
a lot of those Twitter accounts,

15
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.380
they have like 10 followers or five followers or zero followers and then they

16
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.290
are,
or you have like hyper conservative Twitter people who,
who like echo those.

17
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.630
It's,
it's,
it's a pro oil lobby,
echo chamber.
Well,

18
00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:28.980
the hyper conservative peep that is,
that's a thing that people do do.

19
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:32.470
That's like the same people that deny climate change,
the same people to deny,

20
00:01:32.471 --> 00:01:36.610
you know,
the direct link there.
You see the climate change deniers now having in,

21
00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:40.650
in this whole new fracking denial,
uh,
camp,
right?

22
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.980
And that's been a sustained campaign for the last six years.

23
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.120
But it's not so surprising considering that when we first heard from the oil

24
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:52.970
industry,
everything they said was untrue.
So when they first came to my backyard,

25
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.900
right in Pennsylvania to lease our land,

26
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:57.720
to lease the land of all my neighbors to come to the Delaware River basin,

27
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.500
their whole claim was that this was completely environmentally friendly.

28
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:02.334
And you know,

29
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.390
we probably won't even drill here and you should just take this free money.

30
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:09.430
And they didn't let anyone know what the real consequences of this stuff was.

31
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.010
Did they know what the real consequences where you think so?
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

32
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:18.090
Well,
there's a number of ways to prove that.
They know.
I mean they,

33
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.330
they disclose to their shareholders when they're courting for you dollars in the

34
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:30.231
financial world that there is the possibility of spills and have these kinds of

35
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.470
things have water contamination.
So they,

36
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.740
they make their investors aware of the fact that they could be sued down the

37
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.680
line or something like that.
So that's one way that we know that they know,

38
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.630
but they know,
I mean,
they know what they're doing.
They have,
um,
uh,

39
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.830
reports that we show in gas.
Then part two,

40
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.910
partially because of their denialism that show their own investigations into

41
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:55.290
their leaks,
into their contamination.

42
00:02:55.291 --> 00:03:00.130
Because when they leak oil and gas into an aquifer,
they're not

43
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.210
<v 3>recovering that oil or gas.
So that means it's a profit loss for them.
Right?</v>

44
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.140
They're not investigating this because at some they want to not contaminate

45
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:12.940
water supplies.
They investigated it because,
um,
it's,
it's loss of product.

46
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.230
So when that oil or gas leaks out the side of their gas wells for oil wells,

47
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:20.590
which they've punctured through the aquifers,
they're at a loss.

48
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.280
And currently one of their studies,
you know,
oil industry,

49
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:28.240
his own studies shows that about 40% of the oil and gas wells in the Gulf of

50
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:32.500
Mexico are leaking,
um,
that they have very,
very high leakage rates,
um,

51
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.330
in horizontal wells,
like 60 to 70% in studies that they did in Alberta.

52
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.480
And these are studies that were done by Conoco Phillips 60 to 70%.
Yup.
Yup.

53
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.960
Jesus clubs,
the wells,
not saying that they're,
the wells are leaking 67%,

54
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.180
but that 60 to 70% of them are leaking.
Oh Wow.
Currently so,
so,

55
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.030
um,
society,
petroleum engineers,
uh,

56
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.590
did a report on this 2012,
I think,

57
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.980
and their PowerPoint slides were leaked to me in which they said 35% of all oil

58
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.060
and gas wells in the world.

59
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.010
And there are 1.8 million of them are currently leaking.
So they know,

60
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:14.980
well,
they know what's going on.
Um,
so,
you know,

61
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:17.110
to go out there and do this kind of vicious

62
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.840
attack campaign against the films is just that it's the same thing that the

63
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:23.860
tobacco industry did.

64
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.590
And the same thing that they're all industry did with climate change.

65
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.630
<v 4>Little different than the tobacco industry of course,</v>

66
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:33.631
because the idea is that there is some benefit to this fracking that sort of

67
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:38.350
cancels out the environmental concerns.
There were benefits to smoking.

68
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:42.640
That's what they say.
Yeah.
But I mean,
financial benefits of smoking,

69
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:44.470
smoking makes you feel good.
Yeah.
But I mean,

70
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:48.220
finance cost benefits to communities that,
uh,
you know,
employ these people.

71
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.100
I mean,
that's a lot of the pressure.
I know in Canada,

72
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.260
like I've talked to people about the oil industry in Canada and they're very,

73
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.040
there's two sides.
There's the people who greatly benefit from the oil industry.

74
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:01.690
There's so many people that have jobs up there.

75
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.880
And then there's so many people that have seen those,
um,
overhead photos.

76
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.390
You've seen those a when they fall out past Edmonton,

77
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.630
when they fly over these areas where they just decimated large chunks of,

78
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.733
<v 3>that's incredible.</v>

79
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.040
And you see that I just flew from Houston to La Cause I was coming back from

80
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:25.740
this trip where we were shooting in the Amazon,
in the,
in the,

81
00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:27.800
in the jungle investigating oil spills,

82
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.780
investigating deforestation for this new film on Climate Change.

83
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.100
But when you fly from Houston to La for the first hour leaving Texas,

84
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:36.390
you go through the Eagle Ford Shale,

85
00:05:36.391 --> 00:05:40.380
you go through a lot of oil exploration areas.
Those places are decimated.

86
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.760
I mean it is unbelievable.

87
00:05:41.761 --> 00:05:46.020
You look at out the window of the plane and you see Justin gas well pad after

88
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.520
scorched landscape after,
I mean it's just wild apocalyptic.
It's really um,

89
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.890
I myself have never taken that route.

90
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.980
I've seen a lot of the new fracking fields as you go.

91
00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:58.940
Like if you would go for from Salt Lake City to fort worth or something,

92
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.810
you'll see your capacity.
A lot of them in Colorado,
but I was,

93
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:04.880
my jaw was on the floors looking at these yesterday.

94
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.640
<v 4>It's,</v>

95
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.640
it's very weird how many people are willing to sacrifice like big chunks of,

96
00:06:10.801 --> 00:06:14.560
of natural landscape and environments in order to profit.
There's like,

97
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.210
there's like this point of like d there's a point of diminishing returns.

98
00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:21.780
Like if you could ruin like the up like a,

99
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.630
say a small patch of land where a house is,
if that,

100
00:06:25.631 --> 00:06:27.250
if you knew that's all it's going to be ruined.

101
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.560
This is one spot and not have that spot.

102
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.250
We're going to get enough oil to power Los Angeles period.

103
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.190
You know everybody be cool.
Yeah.
That's the only one lot.
Fuck it.

104
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.880
<v 3>Well look,
I mean so much of this is a discovery and a learning process,
right?</v>

105
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.650
I mean we learned that smoking was bad for us.

106
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.270
We learned that climate change was happening.

107
00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:47.380
We were learning that fracking is devastating to water supplies in air and then

108
00:06:47.381 --> 00:06:50.470
it has a huge effect on the climate,

109
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.070
not only because of the gas burned and the CO2 burned from the gas,

110
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.600
but also because of the methane leakage,
which is a huge other piece of this all.

111
00:06:58.601 --> 00:07:01.630
Because when you're drilling all these holes in the ground and you're running

112
00:07:01.631 --> 00:07:04.370
pipelines for natural gas,
you're going to be leaking a lot.
Right?

113
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.250
And what they're discovering is that methane is,
you know,
um,

114
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.620
about 80 to a hundred times more potent than co two is in the atmosphere.

115
00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:15.610
Carbon dioxide as a warming agent.

116
00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:19.240
So it's like if see o two is one blanket methane is a hundred blankets,

117
00:07:19.241 --> 00:07:21.970
so you're that much hotter by,
by leaking methane,

118
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.980
which means if you're at anywhere,

119
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.810
you know more than one to 3% of that methane is leaking into the atmosphere as

120
00:07:28.811 --> 00:07:29.644
Ron Methane,

121
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.090
then you're worse than or on a par with like coal,

122
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.590
which is the worst of the fossil fuels.
Currently in Los Angeles,

123
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.090
they do both production and transportation and consumption of natural gas and

124
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.860
methane in that whole cycle in Los Angeles,

125
00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:48.400
the measurement was 17% of it was leaking into the atmosphere.

126
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.520
So this drilling for natural gas,
um,
you know,

127
00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:56.521
is on a par or way worse than coal in terms of effects for climate.

128
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.220
But what I'm saying is that that,
you know,
we have to,

129
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.790
the overall message here is not okay,
we're going to ban fracking here.

130
00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:04.900
We had to keep it out of this place.

131
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:07.210
We care to keep these things a localized effects.

132
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.050
The overall message is starting to become very clearly.
We are,

133
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.050
we have to start living much more sustainably,

134
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.270
which doesn't necessarily mean a whole sale change in the way that we do things.

135
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.570
Um,
we can still have,
you know,
podcasts,
computers,

136
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.330
we just have to start to switch our energy source.
I mean,

137
00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:28.660
if you can imagine the technology that's sitting in front of you right now,

138
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.750
you know,
what would be the equivalent of that a hundred years ago?

139
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.310
An abacus and a bull horn or something?
Well,

140
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.360
actually if you never changed the,
your technology,
well that's the same stuff.

141
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.420
That's the,
these are the same fuels that we were using a hundred years ago.
Oh,

142
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.290
we have new fuel sources.
We have solar,
we have wind power.
Um,

143
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:51.490
they have tons of energy innovations,
but we have left are we have,

144
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:54.220
because of the power of the oil and gas industry and the coal industry,

145
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.010
we have let sector of

146
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.380
<v 2>our technological development be completely inhibited and,
and,</v>

147
00:09:00.381 --> 00:09:04.710
and doesn't Prague progress.
But now you're starting to see it just the have,

148
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.750
they have so much money to too much money,
so much power.

149
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.670
Now when you see these responses to your documentary,

150
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:12.241
I mean,

151
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:16.980
even the New York Times had some sort of a negative response to two documentary.

152
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.970
What did New York Times was really mixed?
Um,
in fact,

153
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.540
a year after the documentary came out,

154
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:27.120
it was the day after the Oscars that we didn't,

155
00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:29.730
when we were nominated for best documentary for gasoline,
part one,

156
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:34.530
the day after a front page article ran about,
um,
uh,

157
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.940
gas drilling contamination hitting rivers and contaminating water supplies.

158
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.160
And that was the first in a series of about 10 articles by Ian or being an inner

159
00:09:43.161 --> 00:09:45.770
being and one of the best investigative reporters for the Times.

160
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.370
And he was actually,
he told me later a year later did,

161
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:54.960
he was asked to investigate all these claims of fracking contamination because

162
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:58.410
they wanted to find out if my film was true.
And you know,

163
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:02.010
because obviously there was this gigantic smear campaign is still is against the

164
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:04.320
films.
And um,
he came back with,

165
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.430
with even more evidence than we had turned up that fracking was contaminated

166
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:12.090
water supplies that it was doing,
do an addendum who,

167
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.400
what in the New York Times like Combo.

168
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:17.880
You can look up the drilling down series right now.
Right.
But what,

169
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.560
what they wrote about your,

170
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.100
your documentary was he was fairly critical when I remember,

171
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.860
I don't read reviews.
If it was the film review,
I don't read reviews.
Oh,
I'm,

172
00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:30.180
I'm interested in what their political reporting as though,
well,
I mean,

173
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:34.050
I just think that was the New York Times.
I mean,

174
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:37.290
there's one of these headlines Gasland debunked even in New York Times.

175
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:41.490
This was on one of the websites that I write,
but that's probably not the truth.

176
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.920
That's probably a headline written by the oil and gas industry pointing to align

177
00:10:46.921 --> 00:10:50.310
in the New York Times.
It may be as critical about from one point or another,

178
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.230
but this is the thing that they do.

179
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.430
They will take a sentence out of context because sentences that I've said and

180
00:10:56.431 --> 00:11:00.540
put them out of context and then say,
I said this,
you know what I mean?
Or said.

181
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:01.500
The New York Times said this.

182
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.450
There's very little checking up on all of that stuff.
But the bottom line,

183
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.770
Joe is,
um,

184
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:14.180
New York state of New York just did exhaustive seven year process of

185
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:17.430
environmental review and a two year health study.

186
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.330
I'm not an activist,
he kind of government,

187
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:25.770
they were extraordinarily cautious about doing this over a period of seven years

188
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.300
and they just came back with a complete and total ban on fracking.
Yeah.

189
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.820
Indicates everything that we've been doing and all the reporting that we've been

190
00:11:32.821 --> 00:11:36.930
doing because they just said,
look,
this isn't about activism.
We,
we,
we got,
yeah,

191
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.420
obviously the protestors got our attention,

192
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.710
but this was about a scientific review.
And when you look at a scientific review,

193
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.270
the health commissioner in New York state said,

194
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:47.910
I wouldn't want my kids living there this period.
End of story.

195
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.330
What have been the criticisms though?
And what,
I mean,
if you,

196
00:11:51.331 --> 00:11:54.250
if you broke down what you've heard,
that people

197
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.980
<v 3>try to debunk about your film.
Like what,</v>

198
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.970
what the oil industry or whoever was behind it,
the far right wing

199
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:07.180
ultra conservative groups that decided to attack,
what would their criticism,

200
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.043
well,
their mom,

201
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:13.110
their mantra in spite of this preponderance of evidence is,

202
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:14.200
you know,

203
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.550
hydraulic fracturing has never contaminated water supplies that sound over and

204
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:21.430
over and over.
That seems to be impossible.
It's crazy.
Yeah.

205
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.680
But it's like saying smoking doesn't cause lung cancer.

206
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.360
It's like saying smoking is not good for it.
Smoking is good for you.
You know,

207
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:32.020
it's crazy.
Right?
But see the point of this,
and I put out a short film,

208
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.710
um,
a couple of years back and it was,
it was in rolling stone and it was,

209
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:36.940
it's online,
you can watch it for free.

210
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:40.390
It's called the sky is pink and that's at pink sky.

211
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.900
And why.com so pink sky and wine.com and sky is pink.

212
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.210
The point is not to make a plausible argument in this case,
right?

213
00:12:49.211 --> 00:12:51.580
Smoking is good for you.
Climate change doesn't exist.

214
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:53.290
There's no such thing as fracking water contamination.

215
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.000
The point is simply to create the appearance that there's a debate.

216
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.270
Okay?
So if you go on,
if you and I go on the news,
right,

217
00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:05.470
and you're from New Orleans street and I'm a scientist and I go out and I say

218
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.750
the sky is blue and the oil industry says no,
this guy is actually pink.

219
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.860
Nine Times out of 10,
the anchor sitting there is going to go,
well,

220
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.910
the facts are being debated.
So it gives,
instead of going outside and looking,

221
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.610
this is specialized information.

222
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:23.560
So you don't necessarily know who's telling the truth,
right?

223
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:27.100
You have to do a lot of research to figure out or watch these films to figure

224
00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:30.940
out who's telling you the chance to experience that.
There's a debate,

225
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.740
gives the public,
the public gets confused and says,
oh,

226
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.910
well maybe the science isn't really in now.
Maybe we don't know enough.

227
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:44.560
So that staves off regulation and this was the tobacco industries,
um,

228
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.510
strategy for decades.
And it worked.

229
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.430
They funded bogus science at university saying smoking was good for you and all

230
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:54.320
these kinds of things.
And this is what's worked with climate as well.
The Cha,

231
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.820
you know,
99% of scientists or something like this,

232
00:13:57.821 --> 00:14:02.530
97% of scientists say that climate change is,

233
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.050
um,
uh,
a manmade occurrence.

234
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.660
And then there's 3% of scientists that say from the,

235
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:10.060
that work for the oil industry that say dough,
it's all fake.

236
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:13.030
And that that does exacerbated by human beings.

237
00:14:13.031 --> 00:14:15.850
They're not saying that it's caused by human beings are saying that it's a

238
00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:20.700
natural sort of state of constantly,
there's a cycle of,
of climate change.
And we,

239
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.490
yeah,
we should be,
we can't predict.
Right.

240
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.860
But it seems to be accelerating because of human beings.
Oh yeah.
I mean,

241
00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:31.060
but that's the scientific consensus.
And what just came out on fracking.
Um,

242
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:36.300
there are 400 plus scientific peer reviewed studies that have come out and we're

243
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:39.550
hitting a point of an explosion of the scientific research on fracking.

244
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.970
One paper a day is coming out right now.
Now,

245
00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.570
remember in 2008 when I started this,

246
00:14:46.571 --> 00:14:49.900
there were no scientific peer reviewed studies really on the effects of

247
00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:51.560
hydraulic fracturing at this level.

248
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:56.630
Now you're seeing one come out a day and 98% of them are saying there are health

249
00:14:56.631 --> 00:15:01.320
effects,
uh,
problems.
95% of them are saying air problems.
Um,

250
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.780
76% of them are saying like water contamination,
or,

251
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.660
or I may be off by one or two percentages here,
but this is the basics.
Um,

252
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.320
and if you,
uh,
look at a very dry,

253
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:16.550
boring website called physicians,
scientists and engineers for healthy energy,

254
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.620
all those,
um,
peer reviewed scientific papers on fracking and their effects.

255
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:25.010
And there are many different categories,
right?
Earthquakes,
health effects,
air,

256
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:29.510
water contamination,
um,
social costs.
Uh,

257
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.590
these,
you can see a cross referencing of those peer reviewed scientific studies.

258
00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:38.591
So when you actually do your work and you get away from what is this atmosphere

259
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:44.630
within a media where anybody could say anything and it is a goes untested,
right?

260
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:49.080
Anything that isn't refuted is all of a sudden true.
So when you read an in,

261
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.870
in on a website,
oh,

262
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:55.370
gas and debunked by this source or whatever and you don't go and find out,

263
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:55.881
and they do,

264
00:15:55.881 --> 00:15:59.680
they go to great lengths to kind of hide where this information or that headline

265
00:15:59.681 --> 00:16:04.370
or this thing is coming from.
Um,
you know,
it,
it casts an aura of doubt.

266
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.010
And that idea that the facts are in doubt,

267
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:09.830
that there's a debate going on is very,
very useful to them,

268
00:16:09.831 --> 00:16:13.220
to stave off regulation,
to intimidate politicians,

269
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:17.370
to quell the public's fears,
all sorts of things that are,
um,

270
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.140
would be useful in terms of movement.
Now,
why would,
we'll have so many fans.

271
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.970
It's because you got millions of people right now in America right now,

272
00:16:25.971 --> 00:16:30.740
15 million people live within one mile of a gas wall.
And the proposal is to,

273
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.810
you know,
double,
triple,
quadruple that you know,
or even more,
um,

274
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.640
those people know that these films are telling the truth because their lives

275
00:16:40.641 --> 00:16:42.710
depend on doing that research,
right?

276
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:47.740
If you live in an area that's about to be fracked and you don't know what to do,

277
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.750
you're going to do your homework because all of a sudden your entire property

278
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:51.710
values are going to go down.

279
00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.890
Your kids are going to be living in an area that's potentially unsafe.

280
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.240
Your water could go south.

281
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.120
So you're going to go and do that research and gas sign is going to be really

282
00:16:59.121 --> 00:17:02.930
good starting point for you on our website costs in the movie.com is going to be

283
00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:03.950
a good starting point for you.

284
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.160
So when you've dug into it and you know that the safety of your neighborhood and

285
00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:14.780
the conditions in which you currently live depend on you having knowledge and

286
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:18.500
using that knowledge to campaign,
um,
in a government,

287
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:23.660
in a situation where the oil and gas industry has a budget times more resources

288
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:24.830
than you do,
right?

289
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.920
Then you're going to hold up these phones is something which are groundbreaking

290
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:29.150
and that,
that are helpful to you.

291
00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:30.950
And that was the whole point of them in the first place,
right?

292
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.320
The point of these films,
you know,

293
00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:37.670
like a guy like me who's never made a documentary before with a budget of like

294
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.520
$5,000 in a beat up 90 to Camry traveling around the country,

295
00:17:41.521 --> 00:17:44.950
you're talking about an issue that nobody ever talked about.
This was not,

296
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:50.010
this was not,
uh,
um,
uh,
the ambition that I,
with not to,

297
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.040
<v 2>uh,
Jen and HBO and make it to the Oscars or do all this stuff.</v>

298
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:56.580
It was just to basically educate my community because I was scared.

299
00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.480
Who ever thought that this film would become popular.

300
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:04.590
It's ridiculous even to imagine it.
What did you think when you were making this?

301
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:09.030
And nobody had had covered this subject before and you were making this and as

302
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:11.900
it's going along,
you know your lighting people's water on fire and,

303
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.030
and I've even seen that attempted to be debunked,

304
00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:17.340
which I found really fascinating when people were saying,

305
00:18:17.341 --> 00:18:21.060
well you know you could like people's water on fire before all of this.

306
00:18:21.061 --> 00:18:22.800
Like okay,
maybe,

307
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:27.720
maybe one or two fucked up places where some sort of gas had leaked into the

308
00:18:27.721 --> 00:18:28.051
water.

309
00:18:28.051 --> 00:18:30.990
But I mean you're talking about people that didn't use to be able to do it then

310
00:18:30.991 --> 00:18:33.650
there was fracking.
Now they can like their water on fire.
Yes.

311
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.280
I mean that's a weird thing.

312
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:39.360
Lighting your water on fire is a fucking weird thing for anybody to like poo poo

313
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:41.040
that and make it look like it's no big deal.

314
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:46.610
It goes along with that whole climate denial sort of right wing attitude,

315
00:18:47.221 --> 00:18:49.320
this weird team thing.

316
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.920
It's idealistic or I idealogue idea.

317
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.380
We know what these ideologies that people subscribe to,

318
00:18:55.381 --> 00:18:58.560
whether it's pro progressive or conservative,

319
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:03.830
they get locked into these things and they just say what the talking points are

320
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.640
and that's one of them.
You know,
the,

321
00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.660
the real reason is because to admit that climate change is a problem and admit

322
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:13.230
the oil and gas is a problem,

323
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:17.550
would upend their entire political and economic philosophy.

324
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.840
So they have kind of cornered themselves into it denial.

325
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:27.110
But it's because the truth of it is that when we have these types of,

326
00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.930
uh,
energy structures and political structures and economic structures,

327
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:36.180
you know what the answer is,
is public sector development,

328
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.090
the answer is collective responsibility.

329
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.360
The answer is how do we take on these ideas of sustainability as a,

330
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.720
as a society.
Now,
all of those things are,

331
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.340
are anathema to rampant,
deregulated,
international,
global,

332
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.950
Mega Corporation capitalism,
right?

333
00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.300
That system wants you to go to Walmart to drive there.
You know,

334
00:20:00.301 --> 00:20:05.301
to use a lot of resources to never really invest in the public space to make

335
00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:08.400
sure that corporations have deregulated,
um,

336
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.370
the workforce so that we pay people less and less.

337
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:16.350
All of these things that so called conservatives are married to.

338
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.760
Um,
the underpinning of a lot of those values is

339
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.670
you have to deny climate change.

340
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.820
You have to deny that there's things that are being people who are being harmed

341
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:31.110
by this system.
And that's not unusual.
Like,
you know,

342
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.340
we live in a place,

343
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.240
we live in a society of increasing social and economic inequality.

344
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.470
A lot of that inequality is underpinned by a basic economic philosophy that's

345
00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:43.200
created an oil and gas is a huge part of that.

346
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:48.040
So you can't listen to the science at a certain point because your entire other

347
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.120
<v 3>world will fall apart at that moment.
So it's kind of,</v>

348
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.810
it's kind of sad,
you know?
Um,

349
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:59.800
because now you've got people with cell phones in their pockets,
right?

350
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.640
Whose entire lives depend on science working,

351
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:06.280
denying science every single day.

352
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:11.790
And that's crazy because you want science to work so that your tires don't

353
00:21:11.921 --> 00:21:15.520
explode on your car when you're driving down the highway at 65 miles an hour.

354
00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:19.930
You want science to work,
um,
the aerodynamics of your vehicle.

355
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:23.110
You want to make sure your plane doesn't crash.
You want your cell phone to work.

356
00:21:23.111 --> 00:21:26.950
You want your modern medicine to keep you in your relatives healthy and alive.

357
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.810
And yet when it comes to the other effects of fracking,

358
00:21:31.811 --> 00:21:34.120
contamination,
climate change,
all of these things,

359
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:38.590
all of a sudden science can't,
doesn't matter.
Well,

360
00:21:38.591 --> 00:21:41.950
I don't think it's a coincidence that the right wing is also connected

361
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.890
inexorably with religious fundamentalism.
I mean,

362
00:21:44.891 --> 00:21:49.450
and the religious fundamentalism is also a denial of science and a lot of ways,

363
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.111
I mean,
you're,

364
00:21:50.111 --> 00:21:54.160
you're looking at sort of the same sort of car compartmentalize thinking that

365
00:21:54.161 --> 00:21:57.880
allows people to think that the earth was made in 10,000 years ago in six days.

366
00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:58.743
Well,
I think that there's,

367
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:03.640
I think that there's definitely a correlation between some of the things in the

368
00:22:03.641 --> 00:22:08.620
past,
you know,
um,
uh,
Galileo,
Copernicus,
these were challenged,

369
00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.800
challenged is putting it mildly in prison.

370
00:22:11.801 --> 00:22:15.190
But if you look at what the pope is saying right now,
he's a different Dude,
Huh?

371
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.170
Unbelievable.
He's roaming.
He's so,
these don't think,

372
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.950
these don't have to be in conflict,
right?
The pope is saying,
well,
yeah,
we've,

373
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.840
science is the way that God created things and he's just showing us how that

374
00:22:25.841 --> 00:22:29.340
works.
Now,
whether you believe that or not,
there's always a,
uh,

375
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.180
a way to absorb these things.
And,
and I,
I think that,
you know,

376
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.270
or when you look at something like Fritjof capra is work the Tao of physics,

377
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.850
when you're looking at,
you know,

378
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.930
extreme eastern philosophies and how they connect with what physicists are doing

379
00:22:43.931 --> 00:22:47.290
at the deepest level.
So you don't have,
it doesn't have to be that way.

380
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.730
I just think that,
um,

381
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.720
I don't know what motivates people to deny science.

382
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.330
I couldn't crawl inside that mental space.
Um,

383
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.070
but I do know what causes people,
um,

384
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.120
to,
to,
uh,

385
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.990
to need science and to need information.

386
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.110
And that's a very profound impulse I think in people.

387
00:23:11.111 --> 00:23:13.510
And I think that that you need to have cross referencing.

388
00:23:13.511 --> 00:23:15.400
You need to have multiple sources.
You need to,
I mean,

389
00:23:15.401 --> 00:23:20.200
every single one of these scenes in these films,
Hbo,
you know,

390
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:24.820
and their lawyers checked out and we had to submit thousands and thousands of

391
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:29.821
pages of references to other work and to the science to clear all of these

392
00:23:30.551 --> 00:23:34.840
scenes.
We were actually nominated for an Emmy for research,

393
00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:37.720
for gas and air port to has anything been challenged legally?
I mean,

394
00:23:37.721 --> 00:23:41.590
the things that you guys have said,
nope.
Nothing.
No.
Well,
that's kind of zero.

395
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.350
That says a lot,
doesn't it?
I mean this,
this,

396
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.420
and this day age where people will sue over almost anything.

397
00:23:47.421 --> 00:23:49.790
It would seem like they would just start dragging you in a court just to fuck

398
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:53.060
with you.
Well,
um,
they've done that to some filmmakers.
I'm very,

399
00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:54.620
I feel very fortunate that that hasn't happened.

400
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:58.850
How come it hasn't happened to you?
Well,
you work in for that.
My legal team,
my,

401
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.740
my legal advice that we got through the,
you know,
the,
uh,

402
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.620
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to repeat this kind of thing,
but they said,

403
00:24:06.621 --> 00:24:07.341
you know,
if they did that,

404
00:24:07.341 --> 00:24:10.490
it would be like Gaslamp three on steroids because we would have to discovery

405
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.220
into their work.
Oh,
I see.
So if I wanted to go into you,

406
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:19.690
you would be able to go dig deep and find out how much they actually know.
Yeah.

407
00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.420
Um,
and I think that it was interesting because the first film,

408
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:28.580
they did crazy stuff.
They,
they attack the Oscars for giving us a nomination.

409
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.650
This practically handed us the Oscar.

410
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.070
We had no chance in hell of winning the Oscar,
you know,

411
00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:36.110
I mean it was clear that one of the other films was going to win.

412
00:24:36.111 --> 00:24:37.380
Like we were the underdog,
you know,

413
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:40.430
and then they started to attack the Oscars and all of a sudden we were like,

414
00:24:40.431 --> 00:24:44.510
oh my God,
my publicist was screaming up and down going,
you can't pay for it,

415
00:24:44.511 --> 00:24:49.220
but like this,
it's like,
you know,
all the attacks on the film.

416
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.270
And the first film caused,
I think an enormous amount of interest in the movie.

417
00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:57.440
Um,
and the second film they backed off.
They didn't attack it hardly at all.

418
00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:02.810
We got one day where Grover Norquist and Glenn back and a bunch of people sort

419
00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:05.370
of lined up and said some stuff.
But it was,
yeah,

420
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:10.370
it was Kinda nice to get still enough to,
that's nice.
Did he cry?
Um,
I don't,

421
00:25:10.371 --> 00:25:14.720
I don't,
I just cried.
I mean,
it's best way.
I think if somebody said,
you know,

422
00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:18.350
you're judged,
your life should be judged by the measure of your enemies.

423
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:22.340
So if Glenn Beck and these other crazy people are are,
are against me,

424
00:25:22.341 --> 00:25:26.000
I kind of feel like that's all right.
Yeah,
that's a good sign.
Or if,
well,

425
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.270
he's just one of those guys where it's like,

426
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:33.840
he's in such a weird spot now that kinda anything he says,
you know,

427
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:37.610
automatic Oh,
fucking Glenn Beck said that like,
ah,
you know,

428
00:25:37.611 --> 00:25:41.210
it's like a Nancy grace type thing.
Like,
Oh Nancy grace is talking shit about.

429
00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:46.130
Yeah,
it's sad.
It's really sad that we have,
uh,
provided airspace.
But,
you know,

430
00:25:46.131 --> 00:25:48.560
look,
honestly,

431
00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.910
I don't think the films were popular because,
um,

432
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.390
you know,
all of a sudden this was like,
uh,
well,
I mean,

433
00:25:56.391 --> 00:25:59.750
I think that some of the visual scenes,
you know,

434
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:03.740
of letting water on fire in both films,
you know,
did a lot.

435
00:26:03.741 --> 00:26:08.150
But I do think that the real reason that films were popular is because so many

436
00:26:08.151 --> 00:26:10.760
places are under siege from the oil and gas industry.

437
00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:15.050
This is a moment where the oil and gas industry is trying to expand in a way

438
00:26:15.051 --> 00:26:18.380
that they domestically onshore in a way that they haven't ever.

439
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.360
So that same uh,
Society of Petroleum Engineers,
PowerPoint that I talked about,

440
00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:29.140
it said also that the oil and gas industry plans to drill more oil and gas wells

441
00:26:30.051 --> 00:26:34.760
in the next 10 years than they've drilled in the last hundred years.
Okay?

442
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:40.090
So that means they want to drill 2 million more oil and gas wells in the United

443
00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.413
States.

444
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:46.420
That's a state of insanity that's drilling the United States into Swiss cheese.

445
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.660
Do you know that Exxon Mobile,

446
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:53.810
Exxon Mobil one company spends $100 million a day looking for new oil and gas?

447
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:00.810
That's 100 million a day,
a day.
Now we want a renewable energy economy.

448
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.190
We wanted solar and wind.
You know,
you could do it.
In fact,

449
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.760
in the new climate agreement between the United States and China,

450
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:14.570
China committed to building 800 to a thousand gigawatts of renewable energy

451
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:20.910
power in China by 2030.
So that's 15 years from now,
right?

452
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:26.270
800 to a thousand gigawatts is the amount of energy that the United States uses

453
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.393
for his power grid.

454
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:33.620
So if we want it to do all of our power and renewable energy in 15 years,

455
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.370
we would,
we could do it.
We would simply have to do what the Chinese are doing.

456
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.470
We're,
we're,
we're,
we're,

457
00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.530
we're not in a state where we can't get out of this problem.

458
00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:45.450
We can get out of this problem.

459
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.160
The bigger problem is how much control the oil and gas industry exerts upon our

460
00:27:50.161 --> 00:27:51.280
government and our media.

461
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:56.550
That is the resources you're talking about are so staggering.

462
00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.580
$100 million a day just looking forward to new oil and gas.

463
00:28:01.621 --> 00:28:04.830
And that's just one company,
a lot of companies,
right?

464
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.270
And the fact of the matter is,
um,
some very smart scientists,

465
00:28:09.271 --> 00:28:11.850
and this was pointed out by bill McKibben,
um,

466
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:17.610
did calculations for how much more oil and gas we could burn.

467
00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:20.280
Um,
because you know,
there's a,

468
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:25.260
there's a sort of budget in the atmosphere for how much carbon dioxide we can

469
00:28:25.261 --> 00:28:30.261
put into the atmosphere and methane and what they came up with is 565 gigatons.

470
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:35.660
We can burn approximately 565 more gigatons worth of carbon dioxide into the

471
00:28:36.121 --> 00:28:39.750
atmosphere if we're going to stay below two degrees of warming.

472
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.560
Now we're near one degree of warming now and that's already wreaking havoc on

473
00:28:43.561 --> 00:28:47.370
climate system.
Superstorms droughts,
floods,
you know,

474
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:51.120
if to two degrees though is the limit,
um,

475
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.200
that a lot of governments have agreed to try to keep global warming under two

476
00:28:55.201 --> 00:28:58.530
degrees if we want to keep it under two degrees and two degrees is bad.

477
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.740
Like at two degrees,
you lose 30% of the species on the planet.

478
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.370
Two degrees is bad.
But if we want to keep it below two degrees,

479
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.610
our carbon budget is 565 gigatons.

480
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:13.260
Now currently proven reserves that the oil and gas and coal industry has said,

481
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:16.010
we have these reserves in the ground because I want,

482
00:29:16.011 --> 00:29:18.090
and gas and coal industries have two bank accounts.

483
00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.790
They have money in the bank and they have oil and gas and coal in the ground.

484
00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.270
Now,
if you take all the oil and gas and coal that's in the ground,

485
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:28.770
not including fracking and all these unconventional resources,

486
00:29:28.771 --> 00:29:33.771
but what they say that we have that that amounts to 2,765 gigatons or sudden

487
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:37.350
change,

488
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:42.160
so almost 2,800 almost five times the amount that we're allowed to burn.

489
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.380
<v 2>So even so,
they're looking for more,
right?</v>

490
00:29:44.381 --> 00:29:46.360
They're spending $100,000 a day looking for more.

491
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.590
But we already know that if they burned everything that they say they have,

492
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.170
we'd be talking about six,
seven,
eight degrees warming.

493
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.680
This is like telling the oil and gas world that they have to write down 80% of

494
00:29:59.051 --> 00:29:59.884
their assets.

495
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:04.840
They're just gone because either their business model fails or the planet fails.

496
00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.400
So is it just denying this because it's convenient because there's still

497
00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:14.020
extracting money and because they know that if they keep going right now,

498
00:30:14.021 --> 00:30:17.290
they're fine and a certain point,
maybe they'll deal with it in the future.

499
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.020
I mean,
what is,
what's the thought process behind it?
They address it at all.

500
00:30:20.021 --> 00:30:22.810
It's called Rex Tillerson,
the CEO of Exxonmobil,
and ask him,

501
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.020
he doesn't take calls.
He doesn't take calls.
He's too busy,
but you know what he,

502
00:30:26.021 --> 00:30:27.700
you know,
recently he just did.

503
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:33.210
He actually sued his town because they were going to put a fracking water tower

504
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:38.430
and the view of his a ranch mansion in Texas for 5 million.

505
00:30:38.861 --> 00:30:43.390
I heard about that.
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
He's,
he's making,

506
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:48.400
I think it's something like $100,000 an hour,
but the man can't.
The man can't.

507
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:53.710
The man can't grasp the irony of him trying to keep fracking out of his own

508
00:30:53.711 --> 00:30:57.140
backyard.
We probably just thought it would never come up.
There's con,

509
00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.460
but you see what I'm trying to get at here.

510
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:05.800
The connectivity of this moment and future planning is not adding up.

511
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.780
He's not,
he's not going,
oh,

512
00:31:07.781 --> 00:31:11.050
maybe the press would find out about this and rose to me for like a week.

513
00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:15.520
He's not fighting.
He's not saying that to himself.
What?
He's in the same way.

514
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.350
He's not saying,
Oh,

515
00:31:17.351 --> 00:31:21.820
maybe we should stop producing this stuff because we're going to rose the planet

516
00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:26.470
for centuries.
You know,
like,
this is the problem.
Um,
or it's,

517
00:31:26.471 --> 00:31:27.304
is part of the problem,

518
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:32.370
the main argument against it is that we need this oil that we don't have enough,

519
00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.131
uh,

520
00:31:33.131 --> 00:31:38.131
alternative energy sources right now to live the life that we're living to power

521
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:40.090
our cities.
Is that not true?
Not True.

522
00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:46.420
We actually oil right now because,
because,
well,
you have to phase it out.
Okay.

523
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:49.480
But definitely in terms of the unconventional sources,
right?
Fracked gas,

524
00:31:49.481 --> 00:31:53.500
fracked oil,
tar sands development,
mountain top removal for coal,

525
00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:57.490
all of these new expansions.
DEF definitely,
definitely not necessary.

526
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.030
But I asked the same question several years ago because I didn't want to be a

527
00:32:01.031 --> 00:32:04.160
hypocrite.
I didn't want to say,
oh,
well,
we can't do this.

528
00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:07.510
So just because it's in my backyard,
you know.
So,
um,

529
00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.480
myself and the wonderful actor,

530
00:32:10.481 --> 00:32:15.080
Mark Rufallo and some renewable energy bankers who live in California.
Um,

531
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:20.050
we asked a guy named Mark Jacobson who worked at Stanford University if he would

532
00:32:20.051 --> 00:32:22.590
please look into a heat.

533
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:26.280
Stanford Mark Jacobson at Stanford had done a report that said,
um,

534
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:28.330
we could get off of all,
uh,

535
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:33.310
all fossil fuels for all purposes by 2030 and he mapped out how to do it.

536
00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:37.480
The problem with solar and the problem with wind is that they're intermittent,

537
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.950
right?
So the wind doesn't blow and sun doesn't

538
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.090
<v 3>always shine.
And if,</v>

539
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.580
unless you want to have massive storage batteries or something,

540
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.470
you kind of need to deal with that problem.

541
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.880
But what he's discovered was that there was a curve for when solar worked and

542
00:32:49.881 --> 00:32:53.990
occur for when wind work and that they inverted so that if you bundled wind and

543
00:32:53.991 --> 00:32:55.280
solar together,

544
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:59.510
you would solve the intermittency problem up to something like 95%.

545
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.440
So when the sun is not shining,
the wind is often blowing,
right?

546
00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:05.720
When there's clouds,
you're going to have a windier day.

547
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.460
The wind blows harder at night.

548
00:33:07.461 --> 00:33:12.461
So you have this ability to bundle wind and solar in a way that gets you past

549
00:33:12.861 --> 00:33:16.100
this problem.
And he mapped this out for the whole world.
So we asked him,

550
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:20.840
could he please map it just for one state,
for New York state.
Um,
and he said,

551
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:22.070
absolutely,
let's do that.

552
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:25.400
He devoted and Stanford doors and resources and they came out with a peer

553
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:28.850
reviewed study that shows how New York state could get off of all fossil fuels,

554
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:33.350
all fossil fuels for all purposes,
transportation,
everything.

555
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.680
And that work is@thewebsitecalledthesolutionsproject.org.

556
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.940
You can see for every state they've done a map for every state,

557
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:47.720
how to get off of all oil,
coal and natural gas.

558
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:52.270
And there's an invite in massive amounts of public transportation to people who

559
00:33:52.271 --> 00:33:56.010
have the same freedom to talking about electric cars.
You're talking about,
um,

560
00:33:56.450 --> 00:34:00.940
fuel cells.
You're talking about a technology that exists today.
So it's,

561
00:34:00.941 --> 00:34:03.210
it's a question of doing the transfer.
Um,

562
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.190
and what's really interesting is you save billions of dollars in healthcare

563
00:34:07.191 --> 00:34:09.950
costs because we don't realize it,

564
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:15.260
but you're breathing in fossil fuel exhaust all the time and that causes huge

565
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:19.820
amounts of death and illness in the United States.
So,
um,

566
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.640
I mean if you could pull it up solutions project,
I don't have it in front of me,

567
00:34:22.641 --> 00:34:27.641
but you save billions of dollars per state in avoided mortality costs.

568
00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.690
And that's just one benefit.

569
00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.420
<v 4>I read a study recently that was talking about people that live in,</v>

570
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:37.460
in urban environments live 10 years less than people that live in suburbs or in

571
00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:43.410
rural areas just because of air quality.
Yeah.
And when Tom too,

572
00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.070
not just the death rate,
but it's also birth defects and other things like,
um,

573
00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:50.080
brake dust.
There's a lot of things that people aren't thinking about.

574
00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:52.570
Brake dust is huge apparently in cities.

575
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.560
Like when you clean your car and you noticed that black stuff around your wheel,

576
00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.350
it doesn't just stick to your fucking wheels.
That stuff gets in the air.

577
00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.340
And if you're in like New York City to us,
right.
I don't,

578
00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:05.380
I don't think it's as best as,
I don't think breakdown.
I mean,
I,
I'm not,

579
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:08.890
I'm not an expert on it.
I don't know what me,
man,
that final brake dust,

580
00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.640
the fuck brake dust and made out of Jamie.
But,
um,
when you,

581
00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:15.340
when you look at New York City for example,

582
00:35:15.341 --> 00:35:18.550
and you see just fucking hundreds of thousands of cabs back and forth,

583
00:35:18.551 --> 00:35:21.880
stop and go traffic,
they're just breaking constantly breaking,

584
00:35:21.881 --> 00:35:25.450
kinda that stuff creates,
it obviously creates dust that gets on the wheels,

585
00:35:25.451 --> 00:35:29.920
but it also gets in the air and shit is our production studio was right next to

586
00:35:29.921 --> 00:35:33.420
the BQE.
I think about this a lot.
Oh,
it's cause it's so bad for you,
man.

587
00:35:33.421 --> 00:35:36.640
I'm queens expressway.
Why don't you guys go to the suburbs somewhere?

588
00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.130
Well mean I,
I live

589
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:41.490
<v 3>there.
I live at least half the time in my house in Pennsylvania,
which is where,</v>

590
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.250
you know where it all started,
right?
Yeah.
No,

591
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:47.070
I mean like fucked up is that area now.
It's beautiful.
It's nothing.
We won.

592
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:48.990
You want told anyone so no one.

593
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.991
And we wanted the Delaware River Basin in two 2013.

594
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:59.550
Um,
we want to political moratorium at the Delaware River is,

595
00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.610
and the Dell and the New York City watershed is this interconnected watershed

596
00:36:02.611 --> 00:36:07.140
system that brings water to 15 million people in New York City and Philadelphia

597
00:36:07.141 --> 00:36:09.450
and southern New Jersey.
It's a pristine watershed.

598
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.780
It's one of the last pristine rivers like that on earth.

599
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:17.550
And the Delaware River basin is,
since it's a border,

600
00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:21.120
is the border between New York and Pennsylvania,
between Pennsylvania and jersey,

601
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:26.310
the the river basin.
The river itself is controlled by this five member body,

602
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:31.050
the governors of New York,
Pennsylvania,
Delaware and New York,
Pennsylvania,

603
00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.210
Delaware and New Jersey.

604
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:38.040
And a representative from the federal government in 2011 we campaigned hard to

605
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:41.400
make sure that they,
they didn't pass regulations.

606
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.720
We won that fight when Delaware and New York both said,
we're unsure about this.

607
00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:48.960
The Republican Governors of Pennsylvania and New Jersey,

608
00:36:48.961 --> 00:36:53.310
Chris Christie and Tom Corbett wanted to frack the world's largest unfiltered

609
00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:55.520
water supply.
They were like,
we don't care.
Um,

610
00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.300
but we managed to create enough information going towards the Democrats,
um,

611
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:01.260
that they paused.

612
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:06.350
Now that meant we had a political moratorium in 2013 about 10 days after gassing

613
00:37:06.351 --> 00:37:09.420
and two came out.
Um,
in my area,

614
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.890
there were a hundred thousand acres leased by the oil and gas industry.

615
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.360
They canceled the leases.

616
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.400
Now that was a day like I've never experienced like to realize that they just

617
00:37:20.401 --> 00:37:24.360
left a hundred thousand acres worth of leads and I was surrounded by people who

618
00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:28.110
at least we had 20 acres,
you know,
and my,
all my neighbors,

619
00:37:28.111 --> 00:37:31.410
a lot of my neighbors had had least,
um,
you know,

620
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.770
and that was an amazing day when the oil and gas company just said,

621
00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.350
we're out of here.
Um,

622
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.300
now what added to that New York state just passed this band?

623
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.830
It's a ban on primetime volume hydraulic fracturing,

624
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.820
which means that their vote on the Delaware River Basin Commission will

625
00:37:50.821 --> 00:37:53.910
permanently be no right until that band has overturned.

626
00:37:53.911 --> 00:37:55.050
If it were to ever be overturned,

627
00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:59.670
I don't think it will be because the conditions under which that bag was created

628
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.690
are very complicated.
Like you had a six year environmental impact study,

629
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.910
you had a two year health review.

630
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.480
The health review says something very interesting and unusual and says that the

631
00:38:12.061 --> 00:38:14.970
oil and gas industry now has to prove that they're safe.

632
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:20.220
That's a reversal of the burden of proof.
What would it normally is,

633
00:38:20.221 --> 00:38:22.590
is the citizens were being contaminated,

634
00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:25.890
have to prove that they were made ill or their water was contaminated air.

635
00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:28.590
That's a very hard thing for individual citizens to do.

636
00:38:28.591 --> 00:38:31.890
Scientists have to do that.
Universities have to do that,
labs have to do that.

637
00:38:31.891 --> 00:38:36.070
It's extremely costly.
So the fact that that New York state has just said,
no,

638
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.710
<v 2>actually oil and gas industry,
you guys are the ones who have to prove it.</v>

639
00:38:38.711 --> 00:38:42.190
You're safe when there's this huge preponderance of evidence that they're not

640
00:38:42.191 --> 00:38:44.350
safe,
that they can never be safe,

641
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.930
that they're injecting chemicals into the ground and into the air.

642
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:52.060
So that's a huge thing.
So,
um,
the Delaware River basin is a national treasure.

643
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:56.910
You know,
it's an amazing place.
The Catskills go visit if you ever had no,

644
00:38:56.911 --> 00:38:59.950
I've been there.
Yeah.
My parents used to live in Pennsylvania.
Okay.
Yeah.

645
00:38:59.951 --> 00:39:03.730
So I've been there.
It's gorgeous.
I was inviting the listeners too.
Oh yeah,

646
00:39:03.731 --> 00:39:07.060
you should go.
Yeah.
It's,
no,
it's gorgeous that,
that part of the world is amazing.

647
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.840
The reason why everybody used to go vacation in the Catskills.
Sure.
Fantastic.

648
00:39:10.841 --> 00:39:13.720
I mean it's a lot of summer camps.
Yeah.
It gives you this reset,
you know,

649
00:39:13.721 --> 00:39:16.570
and just get out into nature and you see what it's like.
Again,
the,

650
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:21.870
is there's any sort of method or is there any sort of preparation for cleanup

651
00:39:23.171 --> 00:39:24.220
for these things?
Is there,

652
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:28.900
if they ever come up with a way to remove these,
uh,

653
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:32.260
like these areas that have been contaminated to remove the contaminants from the

654
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:36.970
water and the wells?
Well,
but the way this has been described to me,
um,

655
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.160
is under the ground,
right?

656
00:39:39.161 --> 00:39:43.810
If you have a fracking leak or a benzene leak under the ground,

657
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:45.740
this is extremely hard to clean.

658
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.850
You can treat the water once it comes to the surface,

659
00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:54.430
but getting the contaminants that are stuck to particles within the aquifers,

660
00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:59.510
almost every scientist or every scientist I've ever said is,
it's almost ver,

661
00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.960
it's virtually impossible.
So once you fuck it up,
if that's the,

662
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:07.060
the real problem right now with all this stuff,
it's not just fracking wells,

663
00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:10.810
but it's also injection wells.
We do a lot of waste injection in America.

664
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:15.430
What does that mean?
We inject,
um,
toxic waste into the ground.

665
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.940
And we have been doing this for decades to just to get rid of it,

666
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.900
to get rid of it.
So like Nevada does with nuclear waste,

667
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:27.950
they just sort of theory several decades ago was if we inject it deep enough,

668
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:33.190
we'll never see it again because water aquifers are generally between 400 and

669
00:40:33.191 --> 00:40:34.660
1200 feet.
They're pretty shallow.

670
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.560
These deep injection wells can be 10,000 feet deep,
right?

671
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.780
But what we're discovering,

672
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:45.340
and there's an a really jarring scientific American article about this,

673
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:49.460
um,
by a guy named Abrahm Lustgarten who was also investigating fracking.
Oh,

674
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:53.020
we worked on a lot of these things,
not together,

675
00:40:53.021 --> 00:40:57.250
but on parallel tracks for years.
Um,
shows that,
well,
whoops,

676
00:40:57.251 --> 00:41:00.040
we made a mistake.
There are,
you know,
Artesian Springs,

677
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:01.230
there are hot springs that,

678
00:41:01.231 --> 00:41:06.231
that water travels under the ground and we've been injecting all sorts of toxic

679
00:41:07.001 --> 00:41:08.410
waste,
not just the oil and gas industry,

680
00:41:08.411 --> 00:41:12.460
although that is one of the bigger shares of this injection process,
right?

681
00:41:12.461 --> 00:41:15.730
Produced water,
all these chemical,
um,
you know,

682
00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:20.950
influenced or infused waters and,
but just from the chemists,
chemical industry,

683
00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:24.950
the energy industry you're using when you have liquid,
toxic ways,

684
00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.700
there are places all over the United States where you can just inject it into

685
00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:32.590
the ground.
The problem is that those injection wells are leaking,
um,

686
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.160
at rates higher

687
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.540
<v 3>even than the oil and gas wells.</v>

688
00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:42.140
They leak it to surface that they break down 10,000 feet and they get to the

689
00:41:42.141 --> 00:41:45.440
surface.
Yeah,
that's what they're sharing.
That's what they're saying.

690
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:50.240
That this one EPA scientist was bonkers.
He,
in this article,
he said,
you know,

691
00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:52.280
look,
this has been,
this is a terrible policy.

692
00:41:52.281 --> 00:41:55.670
We're going to discover that all of our groundwater's polluted between now and a

693
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.880
hundred years from now.

694
00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.730
So it's sort of the environmental equivalent to picking up the carpet and

695
00:41:58.731 --> 00:42:00.390
sweeping shit under the rug.
Kind of,

696
00:42:00.391 --> 00:42:05.391
except that comes right through the carpet and starts kind of carpet after

697
00:42:05.421 --> 00:42:08.110
awhile.
It's like in poltergeist when they may be old,

698
00:42:08.111 --> 00:42:11.780
the whole subdivision onto the and the Indian burial ground in the grave start

699
00:42:11.781 --> 00:42:15.610
coming up through the suburban basement.
That's,
that's the,
that's the,

700
00:42:15.611 --> 00:42:19.310
that's like the metaphorical equivalent.
Um,
but you know,
look,

701
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.160
it doesn't even take hiding this stuff underground.

702
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
We are distanced from natural environments to a great degree and that we miss a

703
00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:31.100
lot of this.
You know,

704
00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.150
there is no agency for reporting spills,

705
00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:40.820
onshore oil and gas bills in America,
but energy wire,

706
00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.310
a good,
another amazing reporter named Mike Sora.

707
00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:46.370
Han Did ran all these records for one year,
2012.

708
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.940
What did he found by plumbing?
The depths of state agencies,

709
00:42:49.941 --> 00:42:54.560
records and all this kind of stuff was that there were 6,000 oil and gas bills

710
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:59.840
onshore in the United States in 2012 alone spilling more oil,

711
00:42:59.841 --> 00:43:04.770
gas of wastewater and uh,
other fracking fluids and stuff.
Um,

712
00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:09.740
they spilled 16 million gallons,
which was five,
four more gallons,

713
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:13.490
4 million more gallons than the entire Exxon Valdez spill.

714
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:17.870
And when you're unsure now as people are people noticing this?
I mean,

715
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.310
they probably are where they are at.
Is it being reported in the media?
Not a lot.

716
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:23.720
It wasn't a groundbreaking story from me.

717
00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:28.721
It's astonishing to know that we had 6,000 oil and gas bills in 2012 spilling

718
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.630
more oil,
gas and waste water by a third.
Then the Exxon Valdez spill.

719
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:35.030
It's mind boggling.
So we're,

720
00:43:35.031 --> 00:43:38.510
we're in a state where we're kind of distanced from how this actually all

721
00:43:38.511 --> 00:43:43.130
affects the,
the natural systems that keep us alive.
Um,

722
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:46.730
and you know,
what's,
what's,
uh,
always amazing,

723
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:51.790
wonderful to me about going home after being on tour or being on a shoot or

724
00:43:51.951 --> 00:43:55.970
something,
is that I go home and have confidence in the water.
Like I know,

725
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:59.180
I know what it kind of tastes like.
I know that it's in good shape.

726
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:03.320
I know that by and large it's not going to be contaminated.

727
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:06.800
And that is something that in the northeast of the United States is

728
00:44:06.801 --> 00:44:11.000
extraordinarily precious resource and has a price tag on it for New York City.

729
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.520
Um,
it's,
you know,

730
00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.740
worth billions and billions and billions of dollars per year to have that

731
00:44:15.741 --> 00:44:17.900
pristine watershed in New York City tries to protect it.

732
00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:22.901
And that is to a large degree why this fracking fight has gone all over and has

733
00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:27.350
become such a huge thing in the media.
So,
correct me if I'm wrong,

734
00:44:27.351 --> 00:44:32.040
but I think your idea is by,
by

735
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.600
<v 4>doing this and what you've sort of gained from exploring this and,</v>

736
00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.550
and creating these documentaries is,

737
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:43.380
is this argument that we can't keep going the way we're going.

738
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:45.210
There is no way there's no,

739
00:44:45.211 --> 00:44:49.650
we eventually will pollute everything and that there has to be some sort of

740
00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:51.450
acknowledgement and recognition to this.

741
00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:56.690
And some steps have to be taken and there's a huge blow back or push back from

742
00:44:56.821 --> 00:45:00.210
that,
from the people that are extracting money by doing things the way they are.

743
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:03.130
And I think that's one of the things that people are arguing that our pro

744
00:45:03.131 --> 00:45:05.340
fracking,
even people that aren't even in the industry,

745
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.270
there are those folks that tend to leave to lean towards conservative ideas

746
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:12.570
cause they go,
hey,
we need jobs.
Hey,
we need,
you know,
industry.

747
00:45:12.571 --> 00:45:16.560
It's good for business and what you're saying I think,

748
00:45:16.561 --> 00:45:20.670
and I think it's pretty hard to argue that ultimately if we keep doing what

749
00:45:20.671 --> 00:45:25.170
we're doing,
pumping shit into the ground and fracking and you know,

750
00:45:25.171 --> 00:45:27.210
all the waste it's getting into the oceans.

751
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:30.300
Like ultimately we've only been doing this for a couple of hundred years.

752
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:34.080
If you go back less,
yeah,
less.
But let's be really conservative.

753
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:35.280
Let's say 200 years,

754
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:39.540
200 years ago there was so much less pollution,

755
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:44.490
so much less waste.
There was no nuclear waste.
There was,
you know,
no fracking,

756
00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:46.940
there was the oil wells that existed where you,

757
00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.770
it was a totally different sort of a setup than we have today.

758
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.180
The things that they're doing now with these offshore oil rigs like Jesus

759
00:45:54.181 --> 00:45:56.310
fucking Christ,
like the amount of waste,

760
00:45:56.311 --> 00:45:59.820
the amount of actual pollutants that get into environments,
the,

761
00:45:59.821 --> 00:46:03.360
the things that we're doing in these third world countries where they just go in

762
00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:03.780
and,

763
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:07.740
and all that economic hitman shit where they take over these environments and

764
00:46:07.741 --> 00:46:11.460
you know,
and give these people loans that they can't possibly pay back and then,

765
00:46:11.461 --> 00:46:15.090
well we will just extract your resources then won't they set up this credit

766
00:46:15.091 --> 00:46:18.750
system that is impossible to sustain and then they use it as just sort of a

767
00:46:18.751 --> 00:46:23.430
method to get in and start extracting at a certain point in time that it's got

768
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:28.260
fuck up everything.
Like if it goes on another 200 years or another 500 years,

769
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:33.710
how much longer can it be done to deny that there is some sort of a process in,

770
00:46:34.621 --> 00:46:38.100
in,
in place that has to be mitigated,

771
00:46:38.101 --> 00:46:40.110
that has to be slowed down seems kind of crazy.

772
00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:45.080
<v 3>Yeah.
I have to realize that.
I mean,
we don't,
uh,
yeah.</v>

773
00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:47.530
You're,
you're going to have a epidemic of health problems.

774
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:52.210
Isn't it crazy that a guy like you,
you just a regular dude makes a,

775
00:46:52.211 --> 00:46:56.860
a documentary and it's one of the leading voices.
I think it's surprising.

776
00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.280
It's very sad.
But I feel like I had no choice.
You know,

777
00:47:00.281 --> 00:47:03.130
it felt like it was a life and death issue to me.

778
00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.860
And I think that's why we're seeing so many victories.

779
00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.560
I mean this is astonishing what's happened.

780
00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:12.130
A grassroots movement kept the oil,

781
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.810
the most powerful corporations in the history of money out of an entire state of

782
00:47:16.811 --> 00:47:19.660
New York,
out of France,
out of the Netherlands.
Oh,

783
00:47:19.661 --> 00:47:22.720
out of huge sections of Australia.
I would have a lot of South Africa.

784
00:47:22.721 --> 00:47:24.730
I mean we're racking up win after win after win.

785
00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.050
The reason is because people are trying,

786
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:32.080
I mean we're also losing a lot of places,
no question like say,

787
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:35.860
I mean that we're winning anywhere is kind of incredible.

788
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:40.570
But it's because I think people understand this as a life or death issue and,

789
00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:45.040
and it's not that big of a leap.
And this is the point of all this new thoughts.

790
00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:47.590
Like I'm working on this new film,
which is not fracking.

791
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:51.440
It's about climate change.
It's about how people fight in general and,

792
00:47:51.441 --> 00:47:55.480
and it's about values,
but it's not that big of a leap to go,
oh,
you know what?

793
00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:58.390
I don't want a fracking.
Well my backyard.

794
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:04.440
But even if I win and I don't have the fracking wells in my backyard in 20 years

795
00:48:05.771 --> 00:48:08.740
from climate change,
I could lose everything I love about my backyard.

796
00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:11.470
So this can't just be about my own place.

797
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.540
There's got to be all about all over the place.

798
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.350
And it all of a sudden everyone's on the front line because when you,

799
00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:21.670
when you take into account that you have fracking in 34 states,
right?

800
00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:26.200
Proposed for huge amounts of area,
and then you take into account,
well,

801
00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:31.480
if you look at some of the maps on sea level rise,
you lose like all of Florida.

802
00:48:31.481 --> 00:48:34.210
You lose most of our coastal cities on the east coast,
right?

803
00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:35.320
Those people are on the front line.

804
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:38.230
If you look at the keystone XL pipeline running through the middle of the

805
00:48:38.231 --> 00:48:40.030
country,
those people are on the front line.

806
00:48:40.031 --> 00:48:43.630
If you look at the people who are fighting Tar Sands Development in Utah or

807
00:48:43.631 --> 00:48:47.860
mountain top removal and long one wall mining in Appalachia or fracking in

808
00:48:47.861 --> 00:48:51.490
California for that matter.
Um,
you know,

809
00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:56.500
all of these things do start to add up and become one fight.

810
00:48:56.950 --> 00:49:01.390
And we have,
um,
an amazing,
a convergence of purpose.
I think,
you know,

811
00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.400
when you look at people who are in the fracking movement,

812
00:49:03.401 --> 00:49:04.810
look at people who are in the climate change movement,

813
00:49:04.811 --> 00:49:07.240
looking at people who are fighting Cole,
um,

814
00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:11.320
or people who are basically trying to deal with health like public health,

815
00:49:11.321 --> 00:49:15.110
like what you're talking about in terms of pollution standards in cities.
Um,

816
00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:18.970
these things are adding up.
Uh,
and the,
the fight for,

817
00:49:18.971 --> 00:49:23.830
I think social and economic and equality are bound together.
Um,
you know,

818
00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:27.620
there was an a brilliant,
a piece that I just read about,
um,

819
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.990
Eric Gardner and I think it was in Salon and why environmentalist should be

820
00:49:31.991 --> 00:49:36.991
interested in the fact that Eric Gardner was killed by a police in New York

821
00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:39.820
City.
Well,
he had asthma.

822
00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:45.930
Asthma is a consequence of inner city black people living in impoverished,

823
00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:49.750
bad environmental conditions.

824
00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:54.430
When you look at the black neighborhoods that are near coal fire power plants or

825
00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:58.720
in bad you have do you have asthma rates that are much higher than in white

826
00:49:58.721 --> 00:50:01.690
neighborhoods,
which are more affluent.
These things are tied together.

827
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:05.440
So what we're seeing when I'm,
when I look out and go,
okay,
yeah you're right,

828
00:50:05.441 --> 00:50:08.170
we have a crisis.
The fracking might be,

829
00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:12.400
my might've been my way into understanding this crisis or someone else's

830
00:50:12.401 --> 00:50:13.270
might've been climate.

831
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:17.710
Someone else's might've been how the Rockaways were submerged under Hurricane

832
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:21.340
Sandy.
Someone else's might've been Eric Garner's death and going,
Oh wow,

833
00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:24.520
this man might have survived had he not had asthma,

834
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:29.480
had that not been an environmental indicator for people in rural communities of

835
00:50:29.481 --> 00:50:33.380
color.
I mean urban communities of color.
So yeah,
there's a thing that's,

836
00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:37.030
that's starting to wake up here and I'm,

837
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:40.520
it's very exciting to watch.
So cause once you're inside of it,

838
00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:43.430
it's like a different system.
You know,
you're,
you're,

839
00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:45.200
you have a lot of mutual support,

840
00:50:45.201 --> 00:50:49.310
like people who were in the Anti fracking movement.
If the do you know,

841
00:50:49.311 --> 00:50:54.311
you meet somebody who's from Wyoming or from South America or from California or

842
00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:55.160
New York,

843
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:59.870
you're immediately in a sort of kinship situation where now your brothers,

844
00:50:59.871 --> 00:51:02.930
your family,
your,
your friends were working on this.

845
00:51:02.931 --> 00:51:06.740
We're working on trying to fix this problem and you see a different system of

846
00:51:06.741 --> 00:51:09.020
values start to get engaged.
Um,

847
00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:14.110
and recently just down in the Amazon with these incredible Quichua of people and

848
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:18.260
in places we're part of the Amazon.
While I was in two places,

849
00:51:18.261 --> 00:51:22.050
I was in the Peruvian Amazon,
um,
along the [inaudible] river where you,

850
00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:25.610
we saw devastating oil spills in the middle of the jungle just from pipeline

851
00:51:25.611 --> 00:51:29.330
ruptures.
And then another place called,
sorry,
Yakut in Ecuador,

852
00:51:29.331 --> 00:51:32.990
which had actually successfully fought off the oil and gas industry and one

853
00:51:32.991 --> 00:51:35.900
reparations from them,
uh,
and got rid of them.

854
00:51:35.901 --> 00:51:38.600
So we kind of like went to the Pennsylvania of the Amazon,
which,

855
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:43.460
and to the New York.
Um,
and,
uh,
I read a paper,
it interestingly,

856
00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:47.720
uh,
by a guy in,
I'm in Massachusetts,
peer reviewed scientific paper,

857
00:51:47.721 --> 00:51:52.280
which showed that indigenous values protecting the forest protecting

858
00:51:52.281 --> 00:51:57.281
deforestation are actually something that should be rewarded financially because

859
00:51:57.351 --> 00:52:01.160
they're the ones who are protecting the earth from climate change.

860
00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:05.060
So their values of respecting the forest,
not cutting it down,

861
00:52:05.061 --> 00:52:10.061
all of these kinds of things actually has a current price tag on it that says,

862
00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:14.120
you know,
these people are keeping carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

863
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:18.620
These people are,
um,
cause the Amazon without the Amazon we'd be screwed.

864
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:19.483
You know,
like we,
we,

865
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:24.490
the Amazon breathes in so much of the carbon dioxide that we export and breathes

866
00:52:24.501 --> 00:52:28.340
it back out into the world as oxygen.
If you've seen an inconvenient truth,

867
00:52:28.341 --> 00:52:30.920
you see Al Gore's line that staggers up and down.

868
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:35.710
That's because summertime in the Amazon breeds in all of our,
uh,
CO2,

869
00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:38.570
um,
and brings it back out as oxygen.

870
00:52:38.571 --> 00:52:43.100
So these people are actually protecting when simply because of the value system

871
00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.790
are protecting us in the way that we're doing things.

872
00:52:46.791 --> 00:52:49.980
So there is something to be gained from looking at,
um,

873
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.880
now I'm not saying you got to live in the middle of the jungle and he barks
bugs,

874
00:52:52.881 --> 00:52:55.160
lizards and leaves.
And not saying that,

875
00:52:55.580 --> 00:53:00.140
but that there is something of a conversation that has to happen and it's

876
00:53:00.141 --> 00:53:03.800
happening right now between,
you know,
what do we really,

877
00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:07.490
what really makes you feel,
you know,
what is really the point,
right?

878
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:11.330
Is it just to consume as much as we possibly can and burn up all these resources

879
00:53:11.331 --> 00:53:13.840
and live in this incredibly wasteful way?
Or is or,

880
00:53:13.841 --> 00:53:18.830
or do we have to start to have a conversation about what does all this mean?

881
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:22.910
What are we doing as life on the planet and can we move towards more sustainable

882
00:53:22.911 --> 00:53:24.050
ways of being?

883
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:28.950
And the science and the economics from every standpoint says,
absolutely,

884
00:53:28.951 --> 00:53:31.620
we have to phase out oil and gas.
And by the way,

885
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.600
the great thing about this is we can,

886
00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:39.180
and if we actually want to continue to live in a democracy,
which is our values,

887
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.560
right?
We have to,

888
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:44.370
we have no choice because oil and gas is currently destroying our ability to

889
00:53:44.371 --> 00:53:48.900
have demo democracy in America.
And so by the way,
is the banking industry,
um,

890
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:52.680
you know,
there was this study that too much influence,
too much power.
Well,

891
00:53:52.681 --> 00:53:54.000
I mean,
Princeton University,

892
00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:59.130
Princeton University did a peer reviewed study that asked this kind of naive

893
00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:03.540
question,
hmm,
what form of government does America actually have?

894
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.710
And they did all this research and looked at all these public policy questions

895
00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:11.280
and they came back with a result.
Lo and behold,
America is not a democracy.

896
00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:13.800
America isn't oligarchy currently,

897
00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:16.950
which is why you can have 90% of people want,
you know,

898
00:54:16.951 --> 00:54:19.680
background checks for people buying AK 47 [inaudible] and we don't get it.

899
00:54:19.681 --> 00:54:23.780
And 80% of people can,
um,
you know,
want,
uh,
uh,
you know,

900
00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:25.710
a minimum wage hike and we don't get it.

901
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:30.150
Or 75% of people want Kurt curtailing of global greenhouse gas emissions and we

902
00:54:30.151 --> 00:54:34.020
don't get it.
It's because we're not in a democracy that actually are voting.

903
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:39.440
And our opinions don't have an influence on the things that mattered the most to

904
00:54:39.481 --> 00:54:41.880
us right now.
Unless you're an oligarch,

905
00:54:41.881 --> 00:54:44.250
unless you have $1 billion and you can play that game.

906
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:48.180
So the answer to what form of government America has right now is not a

907
00:54:48.181 --> 00:54:48.871
democracy,

908
00:54:48.871 --> 00:54:53.871
which means our democracy has been destroyed by those people who are currently

909
00:54:53.881 --> 00:54:57.240
taking it away from us.
And if we want to have those democratic values,

910
00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:59.790
we have to start to take back the power,

911
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:03.690
which means you have to start to organize and you have to do all the things that

912
00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.450
happens when you know we don't have democracy anymore.

913
00:55:06.451 --> 00:55:08.940
And if you look back in history,
well,

914
00:55:08.941 --> 00:55:11.730
could you really say that America was a democracy when black people couldn't

915
00:55:11.731 --> 00:55:16.080
vote,
when women couldn't vote,
you know?
Um,
no.

916
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:18.240
In fact,
looking back at American history,

917
00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:22.710
American wasn't a democracy most of the time it was a democracy of some.
But Ma,

918
00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:27.030
Ma most and right now that some is getting smaller and smaller and smaller to

919
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:29.550
the 1% who have control of the reins of power.

920
00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.500
And if we want to take that stuff back,

921
00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:35.310
then you have to start to realize that you have to do every single thing that

922
00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.340
all of those very potent social movements have done throughout history.

923
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:43.140
What did black people do to,
to,
to fight everything?
We made movies.

924
00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:47.720
He made protests,
we did lobbying,
we created organizations.
Um,

925
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:51.890
we fought,
uh,
uh,
in,
in all the creative ways made films,

926
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.780
made a cold culture of resistance.
Um,

927
00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:55.970
if you're talking about the women's movement,

928
00:55:55.980 --> 00:56:00.450
if you're talking about the movement of black people and the same thing is

929
00:56:00.451 --> 00:56:03.990
happening.
I,
I say I see this in the current crisis,

930
00:56:03.991 --> 00:56:05.870
whether your insurance point is occupied,

931
00:56:05.871 --> 00:56:08.580
Wall Street is looking at banking and your entrance point is environmentalism.

932
00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:13.090
Um,
your entrance point could be public health,
your entrance point,
um,

933
00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:14.670
could be gun control.
You know,

934
00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:18.630
you're starting to see people really do that organizing in democratic work.

935
00:56:18.631 --> 00:56:22.950
And what's amazing to me is that that means democracy is alive and well in

936
00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.793
America.

937
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:28.800
It's working too to some degree and we're seeing that this is our tools,

938
00:56:29.831 --> 00:56:30.371
our culture,

939
00:56:30.371 --> 00:56:35.260
our tools or information or tools are radio shows like this,
you know,

940
00:56:35.261 --> 00:56:35.680
to,

941
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.680
to talk about where we need to go as a society because currently it's not just

942
00:56:40.691 --> 00:56:43.360
the environment that is being destroyed,

943
00:56:43.361 --> 00:56:48.361
contaminated and havoc as being wrought upon it is our system of government.

944
00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:52.160
<v 4>Yeah.
I think that what we're dealing with now,</v>

945
00:56:52.161 --> 00:56:55.400
what we're dealing with now is the amount of information that we can get on a

946
00:56:55.401 --> 00:57:00.110
regular basis is so far above and beyond anything that's ever existed in human

947
00:57:00.111 --> 00:57:04.700
history that these old systems that were in place where they kind of deny facts

948
00:57:04.701 --> 00:57:09.701
or distort truths or keep extracting money and keep certain certain structures,

949
00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:16.700
influential structures in place there,
they're slowly but surely being exposed.

950
00:57:16.701 --> 00:57:19.340
And ultimately I,
I mean I really,

951
00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:23.900
I'm a huge fan of technology and when I follow technological trends and you pay

952
00:57:23.901 --> 00:57:27.200
attention to these transhumanists and futurists and you look at what they're

953
00:57:27.201 --> 00:57:29.480
projecting as far as like the next few decades,

954
00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:32.090
there's gonna come a point in time where we were literally going to be able to

955
00:57:32.091 --> 00:57:33.590
read each other's minds and you're,

956
00:57:33.591 --> 00:57:38.390
you're going to have full disclosure of virtually everything that everyone does.

957
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.180
That's kind of scary.
It's terrifying.
But in a,
in a,

958
00:57:41.181 --> 00:57:45.680
in a sense it's not because I mean it's terrifying because we value privacy.

959
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:47.480
We valued the idea that we can,

960
00:57:47.481 --> 00:57:51.620
but privacy also equals secrecy when it comes to corporations and that's one of

961
00:57:51.621 --> 00:57:55.370
the things that they're doing.
And the,
the,
even,

962
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:59.450
even though we know how much influence oil and gas companies have banking

963
00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:03.800
industry has on politics and lobbyists,
we know all that.

964
00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:06.860
We only know it in this sort of kind of peripheral sense.

965
00:58:06.861 --> 00:58:09.860
You've got to kind of really dig deep to find out the actual facts and what the

966
00:58:09.861 --> 00:58:11.690
fuck has the time to do the research.

967
00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:15.200
Like we were talking about the seven year study that New York state,

968
00:58:15.201 --> 00:58:16.940
it's exhaustive study that they had to do.

969
00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:19.430
I mean that's a little Dodick God damn work.

970
00:58:19.431 --> 00:58:22.550
And these people had to be hired to do that.
It had to be their job.

971
00:58:22.551 --> 00:58:26.000
That's what they did.
Yeah,
they were.
It was a functioning democracy,

972
00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.280
a lot of digging,
a lot of fucking digging.

973
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.240
<v 3>Part of that,
part of that though was entered,</v>

974
00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:36.040
was tapping into collective willpower and collective research because part of

975
00:58:36.041 --> 00:58:40.660
the study in New York was public comments,
public hearings.

976
00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:44.050
Right.
So the people,
I,
I w you had two minutes,

977
00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.940
you get went and got up in front of the department,

978
00:58:45.941 --> 00:58:48.730
environmental conservation and you said your two minutes,
you know,

979
00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:52.120
and EPA did the same thing when they did their scoping process on fracking.

980
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.420
So it wasn't just,
um,
government people getting paid.

981
00:58:55.421 --> 00:58:56.770
It was also public participation,

982
00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:00.700
which meant that it was a democratic process that was at work there.

983
00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:05.650
We are collectively so much smarter than any one of us and so much more

984
00:59:05.651 --> 00:59:07.750
motivated than any one of us.
So when you're doing,

985
00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.930
I'm going early on and I'm very naive days of,

986
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:14.590
of taping stuff for uh,

987
00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.350
for whatever I was making or doesn't even know if it was a whole film at that

988
00:59:17.351 --> 00:59:22.280
point.
Six hours of public testimony do two minutes

989
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.520
<v 2>per person,
you know,
and just going on and on and on.</v>

990
00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:30.550
But this is what ended up actually creating the fracking ban because in each one

991
00:59:30.801 --> 00:59:32.420
of these environmental review periods,

992
00:59:32.421 --> 00:59:37.280
there were a chance for the public to comment the most,
um,

993
00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.890
uh,
public comments that had ever been recorded.

994
00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:43.130
Pre fracking on one of these environmental impact studies was a thousand.

995
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:47.090
And in the first fracking review,
I think it was 2009,

996
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:51.710
they submitted 13,000 public comments.
In his second review,

997
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.650
they submitted 74,000 public comments.

998
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:59.150
And in the final review they submitted,
or I've saved they,
but I mean,

999
00:59:59.151 --> 01:00:04.151
the movement in New York submitted 204,000 public comments on an environmental

1000
01:00:04.731 --> 01:00:07.760
impact study.
Now for the Dec to do its job,

1001
01:00:07.761 --> 01:00:11.360
it's required by law to respond to every one of those

1002
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.560
200,000 to 4,000.
Yeah.

1003
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:20.090
Which means that that democratic process,
yeah,

1004
01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:23.810
it delayed the review by years and years,
which is part of the point,

1005
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:29.290
but it also meant that this issue was so important to people that they actually

1006
01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:33.760
did public comments on a environmental impact study and went out.

1007
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:37.230
This is like way more than like when move on sends you a petition petitioner,

1008
01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.061
you just click yes,

1009
01:00:38.061 --> 01:00:40.820
this is like doing your homework and getting out and doing all those kinds of

1010
01:00:40.821 --> 01:00:44.150
things.
Um,
you know,
so,
so that was really significant.

1011
01:00:44.151 --> 01:00:48.680
But that was a democratic process.
That was New York sang to its citizens.

1012
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:51.110
We don't really know what this process is.

1013
01:00:51.111 --> 01:00:53.450
What are your concerns and how do we address them?

1014
01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.400
It's the opposite of what Pennsylvania did.

1015
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:59.510
It's the opposite of what a lot of Ohio did.
Um,
oh,
they just opened the door.

1016
01:00:59.511 --> 01:01:01.360
I said,
all right,
come on in.
You want to frack.
Go.

1017
01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:06.050
What's the worst offenders when it comes to the allowing of fracking,

1018
01:01:06.051 --> 01:01:10.730
the allowing of environmentally damaging extraction methods?
Well,

1019
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.860
I mean you just,
South Dakota's off the charts,
right?
Dakota,
North Dakota,

1020
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:19.220
North Dakota.
Bakken shale is a disaster area.
They're going crazy.

1021
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.820
I was just up there and over the summer it is one of the worst.
I mean,

1022
01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:27.460
you've got flaring,
frack pits,
emissions,
um,
criminals,

1023
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:30.890
the Wazoo from all over the country on a criminal background.
Checks get a job,

1024
01:01:30.891 --> 01:01:35.600
make a hundred grand in a year,
dig holes,
light him on fire.
A lot of 'em mad max.

1025
01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.930
No,
but actually there are reports aren't food and Water Watch did a report on

1026
01:01:38.931 --> 01:01:41.960
social costs and found that all of these indicators,
social costs,

1027
01:01:41.961 --> 01:01:46.460
indicators go up in fracking areas,
truck traffic,
socially transmitted diseases,

1028
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:48.680
domestic violence,
arrests,
you know,

1029
01:01:48.681 --> 01:01:53.450
everything that where you're going to have a dislocated young male population

1030
01:01:53.451 --> 01:01:56.780
living in camps in these places.
Those kinds of things go up and you're right,

1031
01:01:56.781 --> 01:01:59.690
there weren't any background checks and you had sex offenders and had all this

1032
01:01:59.691 --> 01:02:00.210
kinds of stuff.

1033
01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:02.870
It sounds like a party they did bringing in people from all over the country,

1034
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.740
aren't they?
The,
when you go to the boxes,

1035
01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:10.760
you can see the Bakken shale from space.
NASA was like,
wait a minute.

1036
01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:14.600
Did we built?
It's brighter than Chicago.
It was brighter than Chicago.

1037
01:02:14.601 --> 01:02:19.010
Brighter than Minneapolis from space because they're flaring off.
Guess what?

1038
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.640
<v 3>The place that the product that tyrannized my area of Pennsylvania natural gas</v>

1039
01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:31.440
is being wasted and flared off and burned off on all these oil wells in the

1040
01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:34.410
Bakken shale because they have no method for transporting natural gas.

1041
01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.900
Why is that?
Well,
when you're doing this drilling,

1042
01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:41.820
you're getting both oil and gas.
Right now.
Oil is worth something.

1043
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:45.360
The gas isn't worth as much.
Dry Gas right now on the market is very low,

1044
01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:48.840
so they're not capturing the gas at all.
So when you drill an oil well,

1045
01:02:48.841 --> 01:02:51.990
you're going to get some part of it,
which is oil.
And another huge part of it,

1046
01:02:51.991 --> 01:02:56.880
which is the gas,
the gas on the site will be burned off first of all,

1047
01:02:56.881 --> 01:03:00.270
because it's exploding at the photos.
So you have like,
oh,
it's behind.
Yeah,

1048
01:03:00.271 --> 01:03:02.370
there you go.
Take a buck and family formation.

1049
01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:06.210
So that's all that means that every like 500 feet,

1050
01:03:06.211 --> 01:03:10.200
there's a huge natural gas fire in the middle of a field that's enormous.

1051
01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:13.860
And that is fucking crazy.
It is bigger,
bigger than Minneapolis.
Yeah.

1052
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.520
That's bigger than Chicago.
But NASA was like,
wait a minute,
what is that?

1053
01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:21.280
And I just went up there,
this is going to be in the new film.
Um,
and,

1054
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:25.650
and we saw not only these huge flare stacks,
but we saw,
um,

1055
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:31.200
uh,
through a flir camera,
which is this camera that captures gas,

1056
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:34.140
that raw methane,
even though they're burning it all off,

1057
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:37.020
it's escaping from a lot of the infrastructure up there.

1058
01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:42.120
So there's always people breeding that shit in.
So the massive fucking oh,

1059
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.850
breathing that shit.
I've seen pictures of workers,

1060
01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:48.160
there's FRAC sand,
right?
So they,
they,

1061
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.540
when they inject the water and the chemicals into the gas wells to,

1062
01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:55.920
they need fresh sand to,
to keep the,
it's a proppant.

1063
01:03:55.921 --> 01:04:00.020
It keeps opening the cracks.
Frac sand is actually made of Silica Silica.

1064
01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:04.110
It gives you silicosis.
It's really deadly lung disease.
Um,

1065
01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:06.600
I've,
I've seen these dudes,

1066
01:04:06.601 --> 01:04:11.350
so it's call this like frac sand spill or a spill off sand like um,

1067
01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:15.390
the [inaudible] beach and like hanging out on the frac sand,
like swimming in it,

1068
01:04:15.391 --> 01:04:19.530
making jokes and stuff like this.
What these workers have no idea.
I'm just,

1069
01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:21.320
well there's a new piece that we just,
um,

1070
01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:24.300
I just did on workers in the oil and gas industry and we don't know where it's

1071
01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:27.510
going to land yet and we've seen a face bureau wants it and maybe there are

1072
01:04:27.511 --> 01:04:28.560
other channels that want it,

1073
01:04:28.561 --> 01:04:31.980
but a lot of these workers are not told what their further handling and there's

1074
01:04:31.981 --> 01:04:36.780
an epidemic of really serious illnesses among the fracking workers,

1075
01:04:36.810 --> 01:04:39.450
whether they're in Pennsylvania or in the Bakken shale or in New Orleans or

1076
01:04:39.451 --> 01:04:41.280
wherever.
And I mean Louisiana ones,

1077
01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:45.730
the BP oil spill cleanup people they brought in prisoners,
right?

1078
01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.170
They were also told that they weren't allowed to wear a respirator.

1079
01:04:49.171 --> 01:04:53.670
Masks and all sorts of stuff.
That is it.
I mean like inhaling,

1080
01:04:53.671 --> 01:04:57.120
volatile organic compounds is bad for you.
It gives you headaches,

1081
01:04:57.121 --> 01:05:00.840
it can give you a peripheral neuropathy.
It can also give you longterm effects.

1082
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:05.520
Um,
the great,
uh,
Theo Colborn,

1083
01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:09.330
who just passed away a couple of weeks ago,
who was one of my teachers,
um,

1084
01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:14.830
she was in her late eighties.
She discovered all the fracking chemicals.
Um,

1085
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:19.000
she started off talking to workers and the workers would come to her and say,

1086
01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:21.280
do you know anything about these chemicals?
These,
she's,
Oh,
yes,
I do.

1087
01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.340
And she at her website,
Tedx,
the endocrine disruption exchange,

1088
01:05:25.341 --> 01:05:29.380
t e d [inaudible] dot org.
You can see,
um,

1089
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:34.660
uh,
all of the fracking chemicals and their corresponding health effects.
Okay.

1090
01:05:34.661 --> 01:05:39.550
So you've got damage to every system in the,
in the body.
Um,
uh,
from,

1091
01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:43.720
you know,
uh,
you know,
respiratory to,
um,
uh,

1092
01:05:43.721 --> 01:05:48.070
reproductive too,
you know,
cancer to,
um,
all sorts of things.

1093
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:51.280
And you can look at the list there,
but onsite,

1094
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:54.400
these workers are not told that they're handling toxic chemicals.

1095
01:05:54.401 --> 01:05:57.070
These workers are not told that they're drilling into formations that are

1096
01:05:57.071 --> 01:06:01.960
radioactive.
These workers are not told,
don't get that stuff on your clothes.

1097
01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:06.760
Um,
don't expose your hands to it.
Don't,
you know,
breathe it in.

1098
01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:10.440
They're not given these kinds of protections on.
Um,

1099
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.940
currently if you're working in the oil and gas industry,

1100
01:06:12.941 --> 01:06:17.941
the fatality rate is seven times the national average for other industries.

1101
01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:20.980
So you,
some times you have a lot of guys too.

1102
01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:25.190
Well disease or no,
most of that stuff is all longterm.

1103
01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:29.260
This is immediate and fatalities or are a lot of accidents.
Um,

1104
01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:34.090
gas and oil wells explode.
Uh,
but the majority is,
um,

1105
01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:38.710
truck accidents and heavy equipment accidents because truck drivers in the oil

1106
01:06:38.711 --> 01:06:43.420
and gas fields are not subject to the same truck driving laws.
I mean,

1107
01:06:43.421 --> 01:06:46.450
I know I keep going on and on about how awful is it,
but it's all true.

1108
01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.900
Truck driving laws in the United States say you can't drive,

1109
01:06:49.901 --> 01:06:54.610
I think it's more than 12 hours.
Um,
but if you're an oil field truck driver,

1110
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.330
there's something called oil field exempt,
you're oilfield exempt,

1111
01:06:58.331 --> 01:07:01.550
which means you can travel six hours to get to your oil.
Well,

1112
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:04.060
but let's say the load isn't ready there yet.

1113
01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:08.590
So you can sit on location for six hours and then still have to drive another

1114
01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:12.760
six hours.
And now or,
and so you can sit on different locations and not,

1115
01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:16.150
that doesn't count.
So it was one worker put it to me.

1116
01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:20.020
You're 25 hours into a 24 hour day.
And guess what?

1117
01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:25.200
You're driving a big rig around in western Pa perhaps or North Dakota.

1118
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:29.380
It's full of toxic fluid in the back of your thing.

1119
01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:33.100
And then you're so tired that you drive off the road and into a creek and that's

1120
01:07:33.101 --> 01:07:36.270
how you have a big spill or you're so tired that you flip your truck onto

1121
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:40.650
somebody's vehicle.
As was when it happened to a,
uh,
a good friend of mines,

1122
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:44.630
close friend,
uh,
um,
the truck flipped over,
uh,

1123
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.880
killed the person in the driver's seat and the person in the passenger seat was

1124
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:53.300
not killed.
I mean,
you've seen traffic accidents on the rise.
Um,

1125
01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:57.810
and so there's a great article and interveners,
uh,
um,

1126
01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:02.890
drilling down series in the New York Times about truck truck accidents and the

1127
01:08:02.891 --> 01:08:05.790
piece that we're doing,
um,
uh,

1128
01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:08.860
talks about the chemicals and the workers that are exposed to chemicals with

1129
01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.770
several workers who were made very ill on the,

1130
01:08:11.771 --> 01:08:14.480
on the job site by being exposed to,
they're,

1131
01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:19.600
they're told to squeegee off the top of the chemical that's on the top of the

1132
01:08:19.701 --> 01:08:24.230
well pad site and then put it into their trucks and they get it all over

1133
01:08:24.231 --> 01:08:29.150
themselves.
And then other,
um,
workers are killed because the sites are not safe.

1134
01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.380
So this is a new piece that we,

1135
01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:35.000
I hope will be coming out in the next month or two,
um,

1136
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:37.980
about the work in the gas fields.
Okay.

1137
01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:38.900
<v 4>That the,</v>

1138
01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:42.440
the driving thing is terrifying to me because you're on the road right next to

1139
01:08:42.441 --> 01:08:42.860
him.

1140
01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:46.820
You see those guys driving trucks and everybody's heard the stories about guys,

1141
01:08:46.821 --> 01:08:47.930
I'm truck driver math.

1142
01:08:47.931 --> 01:08:51.440
And they mean they make more money if they can get there quicker.

1143
01:08:51.441 --> 01:08:55.010
So they've put regulations in to make sure that drivers are not allowed to drive

1144
01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:58.400
certain hours.
But you always hear about people violating those.

1145
01:08:58.401 --> 01:08:59.340
Like the guy that uh,

1146
01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:02.630
gotten that car accident that killed Tracy Morgan's friend and hurt him.

1147
01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:05.610
The Guy who was driving that truck for a Walmart,
is that what it was?
Yeah.

1148
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.770
Was it Walmart?
Yeah.

1149
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:09.830
I mean that guy was driving more than the limit when more than one it was

1150
01:09:09.831 --> 01:09:13.290
supposed to do and he fell asleep,
fell asleep and crashed into their limo,
um,

1151
01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:17.470
<v 3>asleep behind the wheel.
When you're driving a huge oil and gas truck truck,</v>

1152
01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.260
common and perilous situation in these fracking areas.

1153
01:09:20.261 --> 01:09:24.910
And it's one of the things exemption,
I think it happened in the 60s where they,

1154
01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:28.060
where they argued that they needed more flexibility.
I mean,
look,

1155
01:09:28.061 --> 01:09:32.360
you look into every single environmental law that's on the books right now I'm

1156
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:36.580
in America,
there are attempts or full out exemptions.

1157
01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:40.660
The oil and gas in the fracking industry is exempt from the safe drinking water

1158
01:09:40.661 --> 01:09:41.494
act.

1159
01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:45.250
The safe drinking water act is a primary public health protection law for our

1160
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:47.410
groundwater.
Right.
It says,

1161
01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.350
if you're going to inject toxic material under the ground,

1162
01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:54.160
you need a permit from EPA or you need to ask if you need a permit.

1163
01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:59.640
Fracking in 2005 was made explicitly exempt from the safe drinking water act in

1164
01:09:59.651 --> 01:10:04.150
the 2005 energy bill,
which was Dick Cheney's a project.
Um,

1165
01:10:04.810 --> 01:10:07.270
it was their number one thing that they were after says to,

1166
01:10:07.271 --> 01:10:10.870
to this huge fracking explosion.
Um,
and uh,

1167
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:14.890
they're currently still exempt from the safe drinking water act.
In fact,

1168
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:19.000
there are exemptions for the oil and gas industry from most of our major

1169
01:10:19.001 --> 01:10:23.730
environmental laws.
The clean water act,
which is about surface water,
the safe,
uh,

1170
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:26.770
the clean air act,
which is,
uh,
what,
what,
uh,

1171
01:10:26.771 --> 01:10:30.880
Obama Administration is choosing to enforce new rules.
Um,
the Super Fund Act,

1172
01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.930
the superfund act is the like,
uh,

1173
01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.710
a fund that oil and gas was supposed to pay into,
to do environmental cleanup,

1174
01:10:39.010 --> 01:10:43.480
right?
So that was a signed in I think 1980 by Jimmy Carter in 1979.

1175
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:47.890
And the only reason we have a superfund act is because there was a little horse

1176
01:10:47.891 --> 01:10:51.760
trading.
And Congress that to get the superfund to act passed,

1177
01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:53.200
guess what they did?

1178
01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:58.620
They suspended environmental impact studies in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore

1179
01:10:58.841 --> 01:10:59.674
drilling.

1180
01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:05.120
So that's why you have this huge amount of offshore drilling on the Gulf of

1181
01:11:05.321 --> 01:11:07.360
Mexico and not for example in the Atlantic coast,

1182
01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.210
cause they don't have to do an environmental impact study down there.
Why?

1183
01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:15.240
Because they want it to pass the Super Fun to do toxic cleanup onshore in

1184
01:11:15.241 --> 01:11:19.830
America.
Now
30 years for 35 years later,

1185
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:24.060
they oil and gas industry has completely weaseled out of their obligations to

1186
01:11:24.061 --> 01:11:25.380
pay into the Super Fund to act.

1187
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.800
So they're exempt from the super fund regulations.
Um,

1188
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:33.070
for fracking and every single fracking well pad site would be considered a super

1189
01:11:33.071 --> 01:11:35.880
fund site because there's not much,
how does it work?

1190
01:11:35.881 --> 01:11:39.750
Does that continuing go as Princeton?
And they still get subsidized as well,

1191
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:42.750
which is even crazier.
Oh well this is what I'm trying to explain here.

1192
01:11:43.290 --> 01:11:47.280
I'm not talking about abstract concepts are abstract influence.

1193
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:52.420
You can trace these things really clearly.
You can see the,
you know,
if you,

1194
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.150
if you read your history,
in fact,

1195
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:58.500
a lot of this stuff is in the presidential report on the deep water horizon

1196
01:11:58.501 --> 01:12:02.820
spill.
It's a fascinating document.
It reads kind of like a spy novel.
You can,

1197
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:07.800
you know,
like the,
the,
the,
the rig explodes.
People jump off into the world,

1198
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:11.460
but you're also get the history right there of how all this stuff happened.

1199
01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.050
And one of the conclusions in that presidential report was that the oil and gas

1200
01:12:16.051 --> 01:12:17.850
industry was in fact two big,

1201
01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:21.360
more powerful than any branch of government that ever tried to regulate it.

1202
01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.810
So what you're seeing right now is that they're not more powerful,
however,

1203
01:12:24.811 --> 01:12:29.310
then citizens working together.
And this is what keep campaigning,

1204
01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:31.910
keeps saying that the answer here is the grassroots.

1205
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.940
The answer here is us working together,
um,
as a grassroots movement.

1206
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:37.320
And you've seen this in California.

1207
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:42.720
Californians against fracking was started I think when we,
we,
we,

1208
01:12:42.721 --> 01:12:45.340
we did the press conference kickoff here in,
um,

1209
01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:49.200
in La and a 2013.
Um,

1210
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:54.090
and we've started a new thing called solutions grassroots,
which is,
you know,

1211
01:12:54.091 --> 01:12:57.050
the solutions project did the science on how to do,
uh,

1212
01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:58.530
renewable energy solutions.

1213
01:12:58.531 --> 01:13:02.790
Grassroots is actually putting the tools to develop renewable energy at a

1214
01:13:02.791 --> 01:13:06.480
grassroots level in the people's hands.
So at our website,

1215
01:13:06.481 --> 01:13:10.260
which is solutions grassroots.com,
and we're doing a solutions grassroots tour,

1216
01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:15.090
we're going town to town to build renewable energy resources at a democratic

1217
01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:19.650
level.
So when you go into a town,
well,
we do like a presentation,

1218
01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:23.520
whether it's,
we actually had a play going for a,
we sometimes do concerts,

1219
01:13:23.521 --> 01:13:27.030
we do talks.
Um,
and then we go into the citizenship and say,
look,

1220
01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.450
do you want solar on your roof?
Here are these companies that will do it.

1221
01:13:30.451 --> 01:13:33.270
Do you want to buy locally sourced wind power?
Well,

1222
01:13:33.271 --> 01:13:37.930
here's how you can do it in certain states,
right?
Do you want to create,
uh,

1223
01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:41.400
an energy collective in your town?
Here's the resources for it.

1224
01:13:41.401 --> 01:13:44.580
So it's a lot of times it's just giving people information right then and there

1225
01:13:44.581 --> 01:13:45.690
and saying,
you know,

1226
01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.470
getting people riled up and excited and giving them the support to do it.
So,
um,

1227
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.600
we're going to do about a 40 city tour of solutions grassroots in New York state

1228
01:13:56.940 --> 01:14:01.140
in February and March.
So we'll do like three or four towns a day.
Um,
and I'll,

1229
01:14:01.141 --> 01:14:05.540
I'll be doing that with Zephyr Teachout who was incredibly popular,
um,

1230
01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:09.840
candidate for governor who won 35% of the vote against Andrew Cuomo and his last

1231
01:14:09.841 --> 01:14:12.010
election.
Um,
and a number of

1232
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.460
<v 2>musical guests.
I think we're going to be doing that in February and March.</v>

1233
01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:19.660
We'd love to do the solutions grassroots tour in California,
um,

1234
01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:23.290
love to do it in other states.
So you can go to solutions,
grassroots.com.

1235
01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:24.590
You can sign up there,
you can,
there,

1236
01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:29.590
there are links that directly you can buy solar.
Uh,
you can buy wind power,

1237
01:14:29.591 --> 01:14:33.160
you can do all that at a consumer level.
But more importantly,

1238
01:14:33.161 --> 01:14:36.520
what we're trying to do with solutions grassroots is getting grassroots,
um,

1239
01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:40.930
energy movement towards,
um,
getting ourselves off fossil fuels.

1240
01:14:40.931 --> 01:14:42.070
Because you know this,

1241
01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:46.800
even though like you can map this out at Stanford and you have these great,

1242
01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:50.080
amazing celebrities all talking about renewable energy,

1243
01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:54.760
the people have to get it done.
We have to get it done.
We have to say,

1244
01:14:54.761 --> 01:14:55.091
you know what?

1245
01:14:55.091 --> 01:15:00.091
I don't want to buy oil and gas and coal to heat my home to power my home

1246
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:04.390
anymore.
I didn't want to do that anymore.
I want to get off of it.
You know.
Um,

1247
01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:06.760
some of the resources are very expensive,

1248
01:15:06.761 --> 01:15:09.760
like buying an electric car that's out of the range for a lot of people.

1249
01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:14.560
But getting solar on your roof actually is economic.
Um,
it makes sense.

1250
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:18.760
Getting a buying locally sourced wind power is possible in a lot of states.

1251
01:15:18.761 --> 01:15:22.300
It's not in California,
I don't think,
but it is in New York state it,

1252
01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:25.120
there's a company called ethical electric that we have a link

1253
01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:28.540
to@ourwebsitesolutionsgrassroots.com.
Or you can just basically say,

1254
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:28.901
you know what?

1255
01:15:28.901 --> 01:15:32.650
I'm going to buy wind power instead of buying electricity from coal or oil or

1256
01:15:32.651 --> 01:15:37.120
gas.
And um,
you know,
you've done a huge amount right there.

1257
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:42.190
But the biggest thing that we've done in terms of all this stuff,
New York,

1258
01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:47.610
by stopping fracking kept the equivalent of 57 million cars off the road just by

1259
01:15:49.331 --> 01:15:50.830
keeping that stuff in the ground there.

1260
01:15:51.370 --> 01:15:56.370
And I think the equivalent of taking 72 coal fire power plants offline for a

1261
01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:00.940
year,
the movement is actually going to help solve these things.
Um,

1262
01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:06.220
so it's,
it's like how do you get people together?
Well,
we just get together.

1263
01:16:06.330 --> 01:16:09.250
We have a film screening.
There are a lot of great films on this stuff.

1264
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:13.690
We have a tour,
we have a talk and you start organizing locally.

1265
01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.750
And while this is going on,
you still got North Dakota,

1266
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:20.930
but it's just going off the rails.
You do.
But I have how much light environment,

1267
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:23.650
mental impact is the burning of that you were getting into that,

1268
01:16:23.651 --> 01:16:26.900
but the burning of that natural gas.
Well,
I mean I don't,
I don't know.

1269
01:16:26.901 --> 01:16:29.170
I don't have direct figures for that.
But what,

1270
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:34.060
what I do know is that's a lot of these new unconventional resources have to be

1271
01:16:34.061 --> 01:16:37.930
stopped.
So Bakken shale is actually unconventional oil.
It's shale gas,

1272
01:16:37.931 --> 01:16:41.950
it's fracked oil,
the tar sands for example,
in our,
in Canada,

1273
01:16:41.951 --> 01:16:43.600
which you mentioned the keystone XL pipeline.

1274
01:16:43.601 --> 01:16:45.280
This is another unconventional source.

1275
01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:50.320
So without a doubt we have to rule out unconventional new sources of these

1276
01:16:50.410 --> 01:16:54.040
fossil fuels.
Um,
and then we have to start to phase out the other ones.

1277
01:16:54.041 --> 01:16:55.180
But you know,
um,

1278
01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:59.870
do I have a direct figure for how much damage I don't on,

1279
01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:00.940
I don't have it in my head.

1280
01:17:00.941 --> 01:17:05.740
I just know that someone just did the math on the New York band and that you can

1281
01:17:05.741 --> 01:17:06.161
research.

1282
01:17:06.161 --> 01:17:10.100
I think it's an oil change international cause it website change international,

1283
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:14.060
um,
or dirty energy.
money.com I think links to a dirty energy.

1284
01:17:14.061 --> 01:17:17.510
money.com is an amazing website where you can actually plug punch in your

1285
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:21.320
senator or congressman or congresswoman and find out how much money they took

1286
01:17:21.321 --> 01:17:24.610
from the oil and gas lobby.
Um,
and where it came from.
Um,

1287
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:28.520
but I think oil change or are,
I mean,
I might have it on my phone,

1288
01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.680
but there was an article I read recently about the Duke University pro fracking,

1289
01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:33.500
uh,

1290
01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:37.730
study that they put out and the influence that the oil industry had on that and

1291
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:42.750
they traced it back to the money that was involved in oil industry that had

1292
01:17:45.321 --> 01:17:47.780
something to do with Duke University and then had an influence on the flat

1293
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:52.160
fracking study.
Again,
the template,
again,
the template is the tobacco industry.

1294
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:55.910
When you have these places like North Dakota where you know,
you don't,

1295
01:17:55.911 --> 01:17:57.830
you have so much momentum,
there's so much money,

1296
01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:01.340
so many people who have a vested financial interest in keeping it going and so

1297
01:18:01.341 --> 01:18:03.170
many people are benefiting from it.
Like,

1298
01:18:03.171 --> 01:18:05.480
how the fuck do you stop something like that.

1299
01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:10.310
Like how is it even possible to slow that monster down?
Um,

1300
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:11.323
you know,

1301
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:16.220
I have to believe in the same things that have worked over the last eight years

1302
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:17.300
with the fracking movement.

1303
01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:22.020
And I have to believe in the things that have created social and economic change

1304
01:18:22.021 --> 01:18:24.170
in the past.
You know,
um,

1305
01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:29.510
I don't think there is any other answer then organizing,
mobilizing,

1306
01:18:29.511 --> 01:18:34.280
and that is,
you know,
um,
we can point to New York as this great example.

1307
01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:38.240
We can also point to the Obama campaign in 2008.

1308
01:18:38.241 --> 01:18:40.490
It's this incredible grassroots mobilization.

1309
01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.120
It's about neighbor talking to neighbor.
It's about canvassing.

1310
01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:48.920
It's about being involved at a local level.
I really think that that's the case.

1311
01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:52.100
Um,
I think you have to make more responsible energy decisions personally,

1312
01:18:52.190 --> 01:18:56.120
obviously.
Um,
and there are ways to do that and like gave the website out.

1313
01:18:56.121 --> 01:18:58.310
But I think the most important thing to do,
I mean,

1314
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.150
you're going to have states which are very challenging.
I mean,

1315
01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:05.330
in Florida right now,
the sunshine state,

1316
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:10.190
it is illegal to have a home off the grid.
Yeah.
Isn't that hilarious?

1317
01:19:10.690 --> 01:19:12.240
It's like,
how'd that happen?

1318
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:18.380
All the conservative people or government there decided that they wanted to keep

1319
01:19:18.381 --> 01:19:23.280
everyone totally addicted to oil and gas.
What the fuck?
I mean,

1320
01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:27.770
but the hilarious taken do that though.
Yeah.
I mean it's,
it's um,

1321
01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:31.940
you,
you,
you,
uh,
I think the,
the,

1322
01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:37.240
the good news is that you're seeing fracking really be a game changer.

1323
01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:41.030
Not In the way that the oil and gas industry thought it was.

1324
01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:44.240
They thought this was a game changer for their continued world domination.

1325
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:47.630
I think it's a game changer for how we're going to start to change all of this

1326
01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:50.900
because there's so many people involved.
Well,
because it's so,

1327
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:54.650
it's also the impact is so fucking devastating.

1328
01:19:54.651 --> 01:19:58.650
So it's so obvious.
You can see it and you can,
and you look at it,

1329
01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:00.500
you could look at it.

1330
01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:03.440
You do not want to live in one of these areas and that's about in line.

1331
01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.980
And you have enough people who are saying,
not in my backyard,
across the,

1332
01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:08.460
you have a movement,

1333
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:13.440
but you have enough also know people like that are going to North Dakota because

1334
01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:16.680
of the money.
I mean,
they,
they're like,
fuck this.
You know,
I can make some money.

1335
01:20:16.681 --> 01:20:19.510
I can retire,
I can do this.
I could do that.
I can have a life for myself.

1336
01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.030
Give me that opportunity.

1337
01:20:21.031 --> 01:20:25.170
That oil is going to be more expensive than solar and wind at a certain point.

1338
01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:30.420
So it means that you get solar and wind ramped up.
Um,

1339
01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:35.190
you're going to be able to undercut them in the marketplace.
But what,

1340
01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:38.940
what one thing I have to tell you is these are creating conditions that are

1341
01:20:38.941 --> 01:20:41.010
created by the government.

1342
01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:46.490
If you invest $1 million in oil or coal or gas,

1343
01:20:47.071 --> 01:20:50.130
you get about three jobs,
3.8 jobs.

1344
01:20:50.131 --> 01:20:52.680
If you invest $1 million in wind and solar,

1345
01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:55.350
you get 9.5 and 9.8 jobs respectively.

1346
01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:59.460
So you get much more jobs out of doing renewable energy.

1347
01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.570
It's just the math.
I'm like,
that's not,

1348
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:05.700
and by the way,

1349
01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:10.380
you would not do that job in the Bakken shale.

1350
01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:15.240
You are bathing in oil and fracking chemicals.
You are your job.

1351
01:21:15.241 --> 01:21:18.770
There is extraordinarily short lived,
not just in the Bakken shale.

1352
01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:20.650
We should particularly harsh conditions,
right?

1353
01:21:20.651 --> 01:21:23.940
Because you might be living in a trailer that's costing you a huge amount of

1354
01:21:23.941 --> 01:21:28.941
money per month with no you no running water and you know it's freezing there

1355
01:21:29.371 --> 01:21:32.730
and people die.
Just trying to go there and live there.
Um,

1356
01:21:32.970 --> 01:21:36.930
or you might be living in like a man camp,
you know,
like,
like Whoa,

1357
01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:40.660
really bad working conditions.
They're called man can camp.

1358
01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.920
You don't want to live in a man.
Good.
You don't want to live in Vancouver.

1359
01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:47.970
But what I'm saying is these jobs are not good for workers.

1360
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:52.470
They're not good for the environment and at a certain point,
and Van Jones,

1361
01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:56.370
he says this in our worker piece,
I'm Van Jones as we,
you know,

1362
01:21:56.371 --> 01:22:00.100
like you could create jobs by chopping the heads off of small kittens if you,

1363
01:22:00.101 --> 01:22:03.180
when you could call it a judge,
they don't stop doing that.
It's a job.

1364
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:06.420
But at a certain point you have to have a moral standard.
That is true.
Right.

1365
01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:09.710
That is an interesting thing like the creating of jobs,
but at what cost?

1366
01:22:09.711 --> 01:22:10.260
Like what?

1367
01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:14.280
When can you stop saying it's creating jobs and start saying that you're

1368
01:22:14.281 --> 01:22:18.420
profiting off of fucking up a spot forever like that where they're at right now

1369
01:22:18.421 --> 01:22:21.060
in North Dakota.
How long would it take to clean that up?
You can't just,

1370
01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:24.150
you can't just pass everything just because,
oh,
it's a job,

1371
01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:26.970
therefore we don't have to look at what the job is.

1372
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.010
Can you put like a big Britta filter along the whole state?
And,

1373
01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:35.040
and the truth is that a lot of that land is,
um,
first nation's land.

1374
01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:39.510
Um,
you know,
and uh,
we met an amazing,

1375
01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:42.720
a kid who was,
I think it was 19 or 20,
his name was lance.

1376
01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:46.500
He was running for tribal council in the Bakken Shale.

1377
01:22:46.501 --> 01:22:49.380
And his whole plan was to implement wind.

1378
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:54.270
Do you know that North Dakota is the windiest place on earth like UN in the

1379
01:22:54.271 --> 01:22:56.670
United States?
Not on earth like there,

1380
01:22:56.970 --> 01:23:01.500
it's been said 20 years ago or more,
that just three states,

1381
01:23:01.501 --> 01:23:02.670
North Dakota,
Kansas,

1382
01:23:02.671 --> 01:23:07.671
and Texas can provide all of America's energy needs with their wind resource for

1383
01:23:10.211 --> 01:23:10.600
all of them,

1384
01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:15.250
including the fleet of 300 million just from wind in three states,

1385
01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:17.710
North Dakota,
Kansas,
and Texas.

1386
01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:22.430
Would they have to cover the states in these stupid fucking windmills?
No,
no,
no,

1387
01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:26.020
no.
And by the way,
a lot of those places,
our farmlands,
right,
which very,

1388
01:23:26.021 --> 01:23:27.310
very sparsely populated,

1389
01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:30.160
and you can actually do farming and wind at the same time.

1390
01:23:30.161 --> 01:23:33.190
You have a wind tower in the middle of the feminine and you don't know that.

1391
01:23:33.191 --> 01:23:33.701
We'll be fine.

1392
01:23:33.701 --> 01:23:37.190
You probably wouldn't even notice if your corner or whatever it was came from

1393
01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:37.991
where a wind farm was.

1394
01:23:37.991 --> 01:23:41.770
But if you were having a fracking pad in the middle of a farm with all those

1395
01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:43.840
toxic emissions,
um,

1396
01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:46.840
you'd probably be a little worried about what you were eating.

1397
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:51.870
So essentially they could shut down those fracking sites that are fucking up

1398
01:23:52.091 --> 01:23:55.120
everything and then set up in those same places.

1399
01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:58.290
Wind towers that would provide more energy.
Um,

1400
01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:00.700
not just more energy in the moment,

1401
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:03.820
but when you think about wind and solar,

1402
01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:07.720
you're tapping a resource that is unlimited,
unlimited,

1403
01:24:07.721 --> 01:24:08.910
completely sustainable forever.

1404
01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:12.370
Forever is a really crazy word when you think about energy,

1405
01:24:12.371 --> 01:24:17.290
because we always think about energy as finite oil,
gas.
It's got to run out.

1406
01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:22.180
Your gas is going to run out in your tank.
Think about wind.
Yeah,
it's,

1407
01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:24.160
you're not going to tap the wind.
You're not.

1408
01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:29.400
And when you think about where the resources at the offshore off of the North

1409
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:32.740
Atlantic coast,
you,
um,
uh,

1410
01:24:32.770 --> 01:24:35.560
have an enormous wind resource in the North Atlantic.

1411
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:38.400
So setting off offshore wind,
I mean,
you could have a,

1412
01:24:38.410 --> 01:24:41.810
all of the northeast powered by wind power,
um,
off of,
uh,

1413
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:45.700
Long Island and they could be so far out that you would hardly even see them

1414
01:24:45.701 --> 01:24:49.500
from the beach.
Wow.
That's a,
that's a thing.
That future don't think about.

1415
01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:52.780
You think that's what it is.
You think wind or solar and wind?
Well,
it's both.

1416
01:24:52.781 --> 01:24:56.500
It's all of them.
It's distributed generation,
distributed generation of power.

1417
01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:58.930
So that we're not having,
we're not dependent.
I mean,
look,

1418
01:24:59.290 --> 01:25:02.380
you're going to have more superstorms.
The places on the Rockaways waste,

1419
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:05.110
it's still had power were the ones that had solar.
You know,

1420
01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:08.530
you have these storms and all these things knock out the grid and then you have

1421
01:25:08.531 --> 01:25:11.830
big blackouts all over the place.
This is a bad system.
You're losing,

1422
01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:13.240
it's not efficient.

1423
01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:17.890
It's not close to its vulnerable when we're talking about offshore wind.

1424
01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.750
Absolutely.
In fact,

1425
01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:24.580
there's this study also by Mark Jacobson that suggests huge amounts of wind.

1426
01:25:24.850 --> 01:25:29.040
Offshore wind turbines actually dampen hurricane winds.
Um,

1427
01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.390
they slow down the winds and they dampen the storm surge.

1428
01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:36.660
So you are talking about building $30 billion wind walls in like a wind.

1429
01:25:38.231 --> 01:25:41.830
Uh,
I mean,
sorry seawalls around a lot of major cities like New York,

1430
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:45.310
but you could build it as a wind farm instead.
Um,

1431
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:47.470
and you actually make your money back.

1432
01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.320
Now it's an enormous amount of wind turbans,

1433
01:25:49.321 --> 01:25:51.190
70,000 wind turbines for something like this.

1434
01:25:51.191 --> 01:25:54.100
And they would say that you would lessen the storm surge,
for example,

1435
01:25:54.101 --> 01:25:58.580
for a Katrina or sandy by 50% or more.
Um,

1436
01:25:59.290 --> 01:26:04.290
but when you consider the fact that Pennsylvania projections 200,000 to 600,000

1437
01:26:05.571 --> 01:26:07.370
gas wells,
you know,

1438
01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.970
70,000 wind turbines sounded like quite so much anymore.

1439
01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:14.600
But this is the future.
We know that the future is going to be renewable energy.

1440
01:26:14.710 --> 01:26:19.010
We know that that's the,
that's the way it's going to go.
Um,
the question is,

1441
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:24.130
will we be able to prevent oil and gas right now from a next era of

1442
01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.180
contamination and destruction?

1443
01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.220
So it's just the momentum of the system that's in place.
Yeah.

1444
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:30.740
The amount of money that's involved,

1445
01:26:30.741 --> 01:26:33.680
the amount of influences from all [inaudible] and the amount of people that

1446
01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:36.470
depend upon those industries for jobs.

1447
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:41.600
And so slowly sort of transitioning out of that.
Well,
we have to,

1448
01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:43.850
I mean there's,
there's,
there's simply,

1449
01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:48.580
there's a moral issue and an environmental and health imperative to doing so.
Um,

1450
01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:50.090
David,
if we do,
it's,

1451
01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.580
it's going to be really difficult to mitigate the damage that's already been

1452
01:26:52.581 --> 01:26:56.060
done.
For sure.
That's true.
And also,
um,
even if we do,

1453
01:26:56.061 --> 01:26:59.610
we're still going to experience a great deal of climate change warming.
Um,

1454
01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.920
it's going to be very difficult to reverse a lot of those effects co carbon

1455
01:27:03.921 --> 01:27:08.210
dioxide last hundreds of years in the atmosphere.
So we're going to have trouble.

1456
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:09.710
It's going to be tough.

1457
01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:15.140
And that's why we need resilient values that are different than every man,

1458
01:27:15.141 --> 01:27:18.770
every woman for himself and every SUV for itself.

1459
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:22.640
That's why when this,
when we're talking about fracking,

1460
01:27:22.641 --> 01:27:23.990
we're talking about global warming.

1461
01:27:23.991 --> 01:27:26.510
We're talking about a movement to try to change these things.

1462
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:30.680
It can't simply be checked this box.
Now I have wind power on good.

1463
01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:35.570
We're in for some things that are going to be rough and they're going to require

1464
01:27:35.571 --> 01:27:37.660
us.
I mean,
they're rough now.
I mean,

1465
01:27:37.661 --> 01:27:40.600
when you look at all the things that are happening,
um,

1466
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:44.030
to greater pop proportion of our population in the United States,

1467
01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:47.570
we're out in the world are suffering from illness or suffering from a

1468
01:27:47.571 --> 01:27:49.640
disenfranchisement of one kind or another.

1469
01:27:49.641 --> 01:27:53.090
We have to start to move in a direction where we're,
um,
you know,

1470
01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:56.360
we're working together a bit more and there's some weird trends that we're

1471
01:27:56.361 --> 01:27:58.520
seeing here in California that really freaked me out.

1472
01:27:58.521 --> 01:28:02.090
Like the fact that we're in the worst drought of some point 1200 years,

1473
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:03.860
some fucking crazy number.

1474
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:08.040
They throw out 11 trillion gallons of water we would need to make up for the,
um,

1475
01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:11.540
the amount of drought we've had over the last three years,
just three years.

1476
01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:13.850
Like that's weird man.

1477
01:28:13.851 --> 01:28:17.240
And it makes you think like you're living in this place that doesn't have any

1478
01:28:17.241 --> 01:28:20.420
water coming in.
You've got to get all your water from somewhere else.

1479
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:23.750
It's a double whammy to,
because you're,
you're the Colorado River,

1480
01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:28.460
which is supplying a lot of the south west is also dry getting,

1481
01:28:28.461 --> 01:28:31.970
getting running out of water.
Yeah.
They're having droughts in Colorado as well.

1482
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.380
So you're,
you're talking about things that are getting,
you know,
uh,
worse.
And if,

1483
01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:41.360
if it look,
if it was up to Coca Cola,
they would just tell you every last drop.

1484
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:45.560
I mean,
you know,
and,
but is that what we want?

1485
01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:49.190
I think what we need to do is figure out a way to take the salt out of the ocean

1486
01:28:49.191 --> 01:28:53.510
and that bitch is right.
There seems like a lot of water.
Like I,
I don't know.

1487
01:28:53.511 --> 01:28:56.660
But what I do know is that like without getting too strength,

1488
01:28:56.661 --> 01:28:58.220
too far down the path,

1489
01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:02.550
I think over and over again what we've seen work are social movements that are

1490
01:29:02.551 --> 01:29:06.150
built on neighbors and community ties working together.

1491
01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:10.010
Do you know anything about desalination plants or any of that shit?
I don't know.

1492
01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:13.020
It seems like something that could be done right.
I mean,
I know it can be done.

1493
01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:16.470
They've already heard that they built a car in Europe,
the breads out salt water.

1494
01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:20.220
Yes.
Yes they have.
Yeah.
That was pretty fascinating.
I want to,
I want to,

1495
01:29:20.490 --> 01:29:23.940
how dope would that be?
Can go like,
it's like a lotus or something.

1496
01:29:23.941 --> 01:29:27.690
It's like as fast as fuck.
It's beautiful too.
So you know about,
yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

1497
01:29:27.691 --> 01:29:30.240
it's like these cars that they're coming out with,

1498
01:29:30.241 --> 01:29:34.770
these electric cars are really amazing and fascinating.
Like the Tesla,

1499
01:29:34.771 --> 01:29:36.540
all the stuff that Elon Musk is putting out.

1500
01:29:36.690 --> 01:29:40.740
He's got a new Tesla roadster that can go 400 miles now,
which is the new limit.

1501
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:43.800
And that's pretty incredible.
Yeah,
they're really expensive.
Yeah.

1502
01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:48.150
They're very sense.
And,
and,
and um,
mark,
uh,
challenged.

1503
01:29:48.150 --> 01:29:53.070
Mark Rafflo challenged him to make one that's under $30,000,
I think,

1504
01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:57.730
and two in the next couple of years because that's the real barrier,
right?

1505
01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:00.150
I always charging,
I have to stay it.

1506
01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:05.130
Like when somebody gets up and like we do a lot of interactive,
you know,

1507
01:30:05.131 --> 01:30:07.890
whether it's speeches or public or screenings and Q and.
A,

1508
01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:09.660
there's always somebody who gets up and goes,

1509
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:14.370
well I have solar panels on my roof and I have a Tesla and I'm always like,

1510
01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.530
and you're rich.
Right?

1511
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:20.610
So these can't just be about individual solutions.
I mean I love,

1512
01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:21.700
I mean obviously you,

1513
01:30:21.730 --> 01:30:26.410
Elon Musk is like way making amazing stuff and he's showing the world that is

1514
01:30:26.411 --> 01:30:30.120
possible.
At the same time,
like these need to be affordable solutions for people.

1515
01:30:30.630 --> 01:30:34.920
Well,
right now,
you know,
what's the cheapest car you can get?
Like an economy car,

1516
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:38.910
like a regular car.
Like you can get a car for 20 grand,
right?
Like really?
Yeah,

1517
01:30:38.911 --> 01:30:41.850
you can get a car for weight.
But I mean a new never had a car.

1518
01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:44.250
I've never bought a new car.
I don't know.
But if you bought a new car,

1519
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:49.060
I like playing.
What's that?
13,000 probably for like a really,

1520
01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:53.310
well,
even if it's not shitty,
just doesn't have anything in it.

1521
01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:58.380
Just real base,
very small car without not a lot of horsepower,

1522
01:30:58.381 --> 01:30:59.300
skinny tires.

1523
01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:03.690
I bought a Camry hybrid 2007 for 11,008 life.

1524
01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:08.550
What do you know it was?
Wait,
what's wrong with that?
What do you have?

1525
01:31:08.890 --> 01:31:13.050
Just dry.
It's boring.
You know the,
the,
the beautiful thing about [inaudible],

1526
01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:16.170
it's not boring at all.
Camry hybrids.
Not Boring at all.

1527
01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:19.380
Who are you and almost scarfs from another planet and almost slid off the road

1528
01:31:19.381 --> 01:31:21.690
lecture.
Well,
you know it's not going to split off the road.

1529
01:31:21.691 --> 01:31:24.150
That's why it's not boring.
It doesn't handle well.
No,

1530
01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.910
it makes me exciting cause he want to know what you want to know.
What's,

1531
01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:29.790
what's not boring,
but where you drive it.

1532
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:35.460
Where are you driving or are you driving it?
Well,
I mean you won't off roading.

1533
01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:40.030
Your Camry hybrid.
No,
dude,
when I tried to say it upset about,

1534
01:31:40.290 --> 01:31:43.050
I don't know what you're saying,
it's not boring,

1535
01:31:43.051 --> 01:31:45.030
but you're not giving me any reasons why it's not boring.

1536
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:48.030
The car doesn't make it boring.

1537
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:53.010
What you doing with your life is what makes it boring or not.
I'm sorry.

1538
01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.350
That's total nonsense to say,

1539
01:31:55.410 --> 01:32:00.060
my life is more exciting because I have exciting car.
That's,
no,
no,

1540
01:32:00.150 --> 01:32:03.880
I'm not the one that makes sense.
Well that's what you do with your life matters.

1541
01:32:03.881 --> 01:32:07.120
You don't need a car to have an exciting life.
Very well what I'm saying at all.

1542
01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:11.260
I'm saying you do know engineering automotive engineering is,
to me,

1543
01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:15.310
I'm a huge fan.
Pouring is watching and if it's not pouring on,

1544
01:32:15.311 --> 01:32:20.260
the Camry is watching how much money you're not spending on gas because you can

1545
01:32:20.261 --> 01:32:23.950
see how much gas mileage is you're getting on their little onboard computer,

1546
01:32:24.630 --> 01:32:27.100
you know?
No,
I understand what you're saying in that term,

1547
01:32:27.101 --> 01:32:31.870
but it's as far as like the kind of car it is,
it's a boring car.

1548
01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:36.110
It's got a sunroof.
That's exciting too.
And uh,
you know,
like I,

1549
01:32:36.490 --> 01:32:39.550
I can put on in lots of like awesome music.
Well,

1550
01:32:39.551 --> 01:32:41.410
I mean those are good things for sure.

1551
01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:45.010
What does that sound versus 12,800 wow.

1552
01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:49.740
That's not a bad looking car either.
12,000 bucks,
cheap car.

1553
01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.880
I honestly,
if you want my real opinion,

1554
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:54.940
I think all the cars are pouring right now.
All cars are born.

1555
01:32:54.941 --> 01:32:59.260
These cars are boring.
Like I like me to call on the 70s yeah,
those were cool.

1556
01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:02.410
Yeah.
Oh for sure.
You bought the sixties really?

1557
01:33:02.411 --> 01:33:06.370
the 70s I started dealing with seventies in the 70s it became weird because the

1558
01:33:06.371 --> 01:33:07.204
gas crisis,

1559
01:33:07.330 --> 01:33:10.720
they started developing these really shitty shapes and really cheap cars and

1560
01:33:10.721 --> 01:33:15.250
competing with Japan and the 60s I saw like a seventies continental on the

1561
01:33:15.251 --> 01:33:19.300
street yesterday.
It was mind boggling.
Beautiful.
25 feet long,

1562
01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:22.840
short seventies Cadillacs to those.
I had a couple,

1563
01:33:22.841 --> 01:33:27.660
I had a seven 92 79 t bird,
uh,
with,
with uh,
with uh,

1564
01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.590
uh,
tee tops that I drove.

1565
01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:34.360
I drove all across America and in 1994 and 95 and man,

1566
01:33:34.361 --> 01:33:38.080
I loved that car so much.
It was the most like awkward.

1567
01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:41.290
It never went above 65 miles an hour.
Like whatever.
It didn't matter.

1568
01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:45.160
Like this was 1994 and it was removable glass roof,

1569
01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:50.380
Bright Green for not,
I called it the emerald city.
It.
Tee tops kind of went away,

1570
01:33:50.381 --> 01:33:54.460
man.
He tops are awesome.
They were big with like smokey and the bandit.

1571
01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.160
Remember that.
But I agree with you though to a degree because like I went,

1572
01:33:57.190 --> 01:34:01.060
I met the people who worked for Toyota at the Environmental Media Association

1573
01:34:01.061 --> 01:34:04.900
awards that the Prius was a sponsor of.
And I said,

1574
01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:08.080
I'm not ever going to buy a Prius until you make one with a sunroof.

1575
01:34:08.650 --> 01:34:11.940
I was like exactly the same thing.
I was like,
why do you hate life wide?

1576
01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:16.570
Why can't I wear the sun?
Right.
Cause it's like you're right there is this,

1577
01:34:16.571 --> 01:34:17.980
this idea that they're boring.

1578
01:34:17.981 --> 01:34:22.170
But if you've ever gotten behind the wheel of a Tesla Dude,
oh I have.
Yeah,

1579
01:34:22.171 --> 01:34:25.320
there isn't real.
The engineering's phenomenal.
Yeah.

1580
01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:28.510
You hit the accelerator and your head just,
yeah,

1581
01:34:29.170 --> 01:34:32.860
I guess the bat and it's like a rush.
You can go zero to 60 in like two seconds.

1582
01:34:32.861 --> 01:34:35.440
Something crazy like that.
Well it's not quite that,
but it's close.

1583
01:34:35.441 --> 01:34:38.440
I mean it's a three something,
three say no.
And this is the new one.

1584
01:34:38.441 --> 01:34:40.600
That's all wheel drive.
I mean the,
the,
the,

1585
01:34:40.601 --> 01:34:42.700
the engineering that they're coming out with with these things,

1586
01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:47.780
there's a new company that I was just communicating with them,
uh,
online,
uh,

1587
01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:52.420
a couple of days ago that has some fucking crazy new sports car,

1588
01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:56.110
uh,
Renoco where Novo Murray Motors,

1589
01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:58.040
it's kind of counterintuitive because it only

1590
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.050
<v 4>goes a hundred miles on a charge,</v>

1591
01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:04.550
but what they're doing is they're essentially creating like an electric viper.

1592
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:07.820
I mean,
it's just this fucking ridiculous.
His a hundred,

1593
01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:12.530
a thousand foot pounds of Torque,
which is unheard of.

1594
01:35:12.710 --> 01:35:16.460
So kind of like Philly,
what they're doing is just creating,

1595
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:20.990
like I,
I'm,
I'm huge fan of engineering.
I'm a geek for technology.

1596
01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:23.570
So when I see someone just say,
okay,
what can,

1597
01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.300
what can be done now with everything we have,

1598
01:35:26.301 --> 01:35:30.020
what is the best version of this we can make,
you know?
Yeah.

1599
01:35:30.021 --> 01:35:34.460
It's not reasonable.
It's not affordable for almost anybody.

1600
01:35:34.461 --> 01:35:37.220
I can't afford one to half a million dollars.
One of these fucking things.

1601
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:40.750
That's the car right there.
Crazy.
It's insane.
But it's good looking too.

1602
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:44.520
Almost like a sixties.
Yeah,
it's beautiful.
Aston Martin or something like that.

1603
01:35:44.521 --> 01:35:47.590
It's beautiful,
beautiful car.
The shape is awesome,
the spearmint,

1604
01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:49.460
but a hundred miles.
I mean,
dude,
fuck

1605
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:53.490
<v 2>driving.
I drove.
I've driven in every single state.</v>

1606
01:35:53.530 --> 01:35:57.810
The one contradiction here is that gasoline and movies are road movies.
Like

1607
01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:04.470
I am,
I am,
I love being out on the open road in a car.

1608
01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:09.090
I will disappear for months.
I mean,
like,
there's nothing more exciting to me now.

1609
01:36:09.091 --> 01:36:09.331
I mean,

1610
01:36:09.331 --> 01:36:14.070
I made gas and guessing at two in [inaudible] 92 Camry and 93 Camry and like

1611
01:36:14.071 --> 01:36:17.010
slept by the side of the road and just,
you know,
I mean,

1612
01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:19.530
New Mexico just pull off,

1613
01:36:19.531 --> 01:36:23.040
just go to sleep under the stars like Wyoming next to the hoback river.

1614
01:36:23.041 --> 01:36:26.070
Like on your way up to Yosemite.
You know,
these,

1615
01:36:26.071 --> 01:36:28.470
this is the most amazing thing about America.

1616
01:36:28.471 --> 01:36:32.700
I mean like America is those roads out in the west.
And I just,

1617
01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:36.780
I'm in love with it.
Like I hate flying with a passion.

1618
01:36:36.810 --> 01:36:41.810
I'm actually going to take the train back from here because I want to film it.

1619
01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:44.850
I want to figure out what it's like to take the train.
Um,

1620
01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:47.940
but you want to talk about infrastructure development,

1621
01:36:47.941 --> 01:36:52.050
why don't we have high speed trains to take us from La to New York and Elan Musk

1622
01:36:52.051 --> 01:36:54.620
ridiculous working on that.
Right.
And the the,
but,

1623
01:36:54.630 --> 01:36:56.940
but what I'm saying is that like,
I just,
you know,

1624
01:36:57.060 --> 01:37:00.360
I think it's an amazing thing and it's definitely has to be worked out because

1625
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:01.051
you know,

1626
01:37:01.051 --> 01:37:03.720
and that's what's going to take the transition because you buy a new car right

1627
01:37:03.721 --> 01:37:06.690
now,
it's going to last you 10.
It's going to be on the road for 10 or 15 years.

1628
01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:09.730
<v 4>There's another environmental impact that we're not thinking about when it comes</v>

1629
01:37:09.731 --> 01:37:11.770
to planes.
The people that lived near airplanes there,

1630
01:37:11.771 --> 01:37:13.210
they're showing all these studies now,

1631
01:37:13.211 --> 01:37:17.530
the lung diseases and all sorts of health risks that people have to just live

1632
01:37:17.531 --> 01:37:20.860
near airports because the burning of these fossil fuels,

1633
01:37:20.861 --> 01:37:22.810
I can massive amounts,

1634
01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:27.400
just jet engines burning off untold millions of gallons.
Okay.

1635
01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:31.410
<v 2>So fuels per year.
And you know,
the,
the airline industry is,
um,</v>

1636
01:37:31.650 --> 01:37:35.730
would be equivalent to a medium size,
you know,
country in terms of admissions.

1637
01:37:35.731 --> 01:37:38.610
And I think you're meeting besides European country.
I'm don't quote,

1638
01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.370
well I just said it,
but you know,
it's,
it's,

1639
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:45.000
it's a big sector of emissions and especially since you consider a lot of these

1640
01:37:45.001 --> 01:37:48.960
flights are going over Alaska and going over the Poles,

1641
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:50.580
they're depositing their emissions there.

1642
01:37:50.581 --> 01:37:55.581
So you actually have a greater amount of CO2 in the up in the polar ice cap

1643
01:37:57.241 --> 01:38:01.500
where we actually need it to be colder because it's reflecting a lot of the,
uh,

1644
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:06.590
of the Sun's light going back out into space because of the white ice sheets up

1645
01:38:07.231 --> 01:38:11.790
there.
So you want them to be,
um,
uh,
go cold.

1646
01:38:12.210 --> 01:38:14.190
Um,
but basically up in the,

1647
01:38:14.191 --> 01:38:18.930
in the polls you have more emissions because a lot of the flights are crossing

1648
01:38:18.931 --> 01:38:21.480
over the top there cause they're going from the,
you know,
you know,

1649
01:38:21.481 --> 01:38:23.250
I say see Europe,
United States to Asia.

1650
01:38:23.310 --> 01:38:27.030
Those are going to be polar routes isn't one of the big concerns with these

1651
01:38:27.031 --> 01:38:31.620
electric vehicles.
The actual material of the batteries themselves.

1652
01:38:31.650 --> 01:38:35.930
Like a lot of it is coming from story called conflict minerals.
And you know,

1653
01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:40.830
a lot of us coming from these places like the Congo or Afghanistan is a big

1654
01:38:40.831 --> 01:38:45.830
source of lithium for Lithium Ion batteries really?
Well.

1655
01:38:45.850 --> 01:38:49.290
It's one of the huge discoveries that they had a few years back that there's

1656
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:53.520
more lithium in Afghanistan and like almost anywhere in the world.

1657
01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:57.780
Yeah.
It's trillions of dollars of lithium that they're going to pull out of the

1658
01:38:57.781 --> 01:38:59.730
ground to make batteries with.

1659
01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:04.260
And that's one of the reasons why they believe the United States had a vested

1660
01:39:04.261 --> 01:39:06.280
interest in staying in Afghanistan.
All sorts of,

1661
01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:10.850
but there's a huge on the gas pipeline.
Sure.
A natural gas pipeline,

1662
01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:16.070
which was what was being fought over during the Russian and Afghany the,

1663
01:39:16.271 --> 01:39:18.840
the whole mujahideen situation.

1664
01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:21.480
But when you look at these batteries that are in these cars,

1665
01:39:21.481 --> 01:39:25.380
they're really like kinda inefficient and issue.
It's a big issue or no question.

1666
01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:27.780
And that's why I'm saying like,
again,

1667
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:30.990
the answer to these problems is trying to take some kind of collective

1668
01:39:30.991 --> 01:39:35.970
responsibility when we go through our regular daily life.
Um,
we don't,

1669
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:40.770
you know,
I mean like people say,
oh,
I recycle.
And I think that's all fine.

1670
01:39:40.771 --> 01:39:42.750
That's all good.
That should be just like no brainer.

1671
01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:46.500
But what we're talking about is trying to make these types of decisions where we

1672
01:39:46.501 --> 01:39:49.710
know of the consequences and we have to be able to process them.

1673
01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:55.320
But we do know that one of the big things that is,
um,
from,

1674
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:58.020
from the standpoint of all of these issues that you're bringing up,

1675
01:39:58.170 --> 01:40:01.170
there is no question that oil and gas is at the top of the list,

1676
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:03.900
both in terms of climate change and global warming,

1677
01:40:03.901 --> 01:40:06.930
but also in terms of these localized pollution effects which are getting less

1678
01:40:06.931 --> 01:40:10.150
and less local,
right?
Everyone's downstream from something.
Um,

1679
01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:14.610
but you're absolutely 100% right.
Solar farm,

1680
01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:16.530
solar panel manufacturing.

1681
01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.560
When manufacturing extractive though all those industries don't get a pass just

1682
01:40:22.111 --> 01:40:23.280
because their renewable energy,

1683
01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:28.700
they have to be subject to very vigorous laws that control the damage that they

1684
01:40:28.861 --> 01:40:31.530
do as well.
Otherwise,
you're going to repeat the cycle with a new industry.

1685
01:40:31.710 --> 01:40:35.850
And in fact,
if you don't actively oppose oil and gas,

1686
01:40:35.851 --> 01:40:40.170
if you don't say we have to keep the oil in the ground.
Okay,
let's say you ban,

1687
01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:43.770
uh,
or you shut down all the coal fire power plant in the United States.

1688
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:46.350
If we don't,
what we're going to do,

1689
01:40:46.351 --> 01:40:51.351
if we don't stop it is export the coal and we're exporting tons of coal right

1690
01:40:51.691 --> 01:40:54.010
now out of the United States where we're using,
we want

1691
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:56.350
<v 3>to export the gas even if we don't use the gas here.</v>

1692
01:40:56.351 --> 01:40:59.050
So it's gotta be about keeping it in the ground.
Um,

1693
01:40:59.590 --> 01:41:02.740
there's another problem which is that if you create more energy,

1694
01:41:03.010 --> 01:41:06.310
all of a sudden people go,
oh,
there's energy,
it's great.

1695
01:41:06.311 --> 01:41:07.930
I can just use lots of energy.

1696
01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:11.320
So you end up building more of everything.

1697
01:41:11.650 --> 01:41:14.470
So you might end up in a situation where energy becomes cheaper and then people

1698
01:41:14.471 --> 01:41:16.630
use more of it.
And we haven't actually made any progress.

1699
01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:22.050
So it is a question of making those kinds of limitations on keeping the oil or

1700
01:41:22.090 --> 01:41:23.710
coal and gas in the ground and live,

1701
01:41:23.730 --> 01:41:27.040
not just multiplying it so that you end up using more.

1702
01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:31.260
<v 4>And there's plenty of examples of countries that don't have any regulation on</v>

1703
01:41:31.261 --> 01:41:33.600
environments like look at what the fuck is going on in China.

1704
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:36.210
When you see these cities that are just toxic cities.

1705
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:41.510
There's cities in China where they have just gray skies from pollution and

1706
01:41:41.761 --> 01:41:43.470
people wearing masks.
Like was it,

1707
01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:46.420
<v 3>and B we're going to be on,</v>

1708
01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:49.630
I'm going to go out there at some point in the next six months I think,
but in,

1709
01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:53.980
I haven't been there yet,
but I cause that all coal a coal,
um,

1710
01:41:54.110 --> 01:41:57.500
they're starting to try to frack in China,
but they don't have a lot of water.
Um,

1711
01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:01.820
you know,
China,
but China just made this enormous commitment,
right?
Like I said,

1712
01:42:01.821 --> 01:42:05.900
800 to a thousand gigawatts of renewable energy.
Um,
but yeah,
in Beijing,

1713
01:42:05.901 --> 01:42:08.750
it so bad that they broadcast,
I think on televisions,

1714
01:42:08.751 --> 01:42:12.900
the sunset in certain places they broadcast the sunset cause you can't see it.

1715
01:42:12.901 --> 01:42:16.790
You can't say,
I want to see that.
I want to take it.

1716
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:20.590
<v 4>Well,
there's the,
I mean,
I just think that there's examples,</v>

1717
01:42:20.591 --> 01:42:24.040
like we get to see this spectrum of,
of,
you know,

1718
01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:28.600
places where it's like completely sustainable and beautiful and natural.
I mean,

1719
01:42:28.601 --> 01:42:32.500
you can go to the Colorado Rockies and see how beautiful and clean fresh the

1720
01:42:32.501 --> 01:42:34.900
areas and they didn't go to Beijing and you could say,

1721
01:42:34.930 --> 01:42:37.420
oh well people are capable of this too.
You know,

1722
01:42:37.421 --> 01:42:39.520
you can go to a place like boulder that doesn't let anybody build in the

1723
01:42:39.521 --> 01:42:41.230
mountains.
Like they have a very strict

1724
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:46.170
<v 3>go 10 miles away in weld county,
which is frack to hell too.
You know,</v>

1725
01:42:46.230 --> 01:42:49.320
so you have the first world in the third world and the third world in the first

1726
01:42:49.321 --> 01:42:54.250
world.
That's just the way it is.
And what defines what defines,
um,

1727
01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:58.770
the poverty of those locations is,
I think the health of their environment.

1728
01:42:59.230 --> 01:43:03.670
<v 4>It's not,
the scary thing too is that people are doing things that can they,
the,</v>

1729
01:43:03.710 --> 01:43:04.150
the,
the,

1730
01:43:04.150 --> 01:43:08.170
the thing that freaks me out about fracking and the feeling like when I see the

1731
01:43:08.230 --> 01:43:10.930
pros and the cons and I see the arguments for and against,

1732
01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:15.700
the one thing that seems to be undeniable is that you can't clean it up.

1733
01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:19.990
It's like it gets to the per,
is it gets to a certain point where,
you know,

1734
01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:24.590
<v 3>we don't want to be in a place where,
um,
the entire plants on life support.</v>

1735
01:43:24.591 --> 01:43:29.150
And what I mean by that is you have to purify and treat every single drop of

1736
01:43:29.151 --> 01:43:32.540
water that you found.
You don't want to get there.
No,

1737
01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:37.600
we're not that far from there though.
Um,
but the truth is that,
yeah,
you,

1738
01:43:37.601 --> 01:43:40.470
you're making a good point that a lot of these,
it's the,

1739
01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:44.690
I say at the end of gasoline to environmental victories are always temporary,

1740
01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:49.550
but the loss is always seemed to be permanent.
You can't restore,
you know,

1741
01:43:49.551 --> 01:43:52.310
some of these incredibly by,
um,
you know,

1742
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:55.780
biologically diverse areas by replanting with,
you know,

1743
01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:57.140
something else that there's,

1744
01:43:57.170 --> 01:44:01.940
there's a bottom line to what nature has made that needs to at this point

1745
01:44:01.941 --> 01:44:06.770
actually have rights and be precise,
be preserved.
Um,
you know,
and,

1746
01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:09.970
uh,
that's,
that's a big part of all of this.
But I,

1747
01:44:09.971 --> 01:44:14.780
I do I got to say that in the midst of all of this incredibly negative,

1748
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:19.610
difficult information,
I'm very positive about it.
I'm very,

1749
01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:22.930
um,
I have,
I have,
I,

1750
01:44:23.050 --> 01:44:26.270
I'm not gonna say I'm optimistic because I don't really know,
you know,

1751
01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:31.250
but I do feel a real positive charge from being involved.
And that's the thing,

1752
01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:35.420
like,
you feel better about being involved with this,
right?

1753
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:37.670
When it first came to my backyard,
I have to,

1754
01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:41.540
I spent three weeks sleepless nights.
Could not sleep,
could not,

1755
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:45.650
it was terrified and never felt more alone.
You know,

1756
01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:48.500
th thinking like,
oh my God,
you know,

1757
01:44:48.501 --> 01:44:52.840
cause when you live in a beautiful area like that,
this environmentally,
um,
uh,

1758
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:56.240
pristine,
you're always kind of waiting for the ax to fall.

1759
01:44:56.340 --> 01:45:00.320
Know whether it's going to be like a mega casino or a Walmart or a oil and gas

1760
01:45:00.330 --> 01:45:02.540
was too nice.
Someone's going to fuck it up.
You know,
cause yeah.

1761
01:45:02.541 --> 01:45:06.320
Cause unlike a lot of other places,
um,
but you know,

1762
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:10.790
I never felt more alone.
I mean nowadays,
you know,

1763
01:45:10.791 --> 01:45:13.220
like I mentioned,
if you're involved in this,

1764
01:45:13.221 --> 01:45:15.350
you can go anywhere and have friends.
It's,

1765
01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:20.270
it's a wonderful feeling to know that you're connected on that level.
I mean,

1766
01:45:20.271 --> 01:45:23.180
I've toured in addition to putting these films on Hbo,

1767
01:45:23.181 --> 01:45:24.350
which is a massive exposure,

1768
01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:27.690
a couple of million people each time we do that with the films.
Um,

1769
01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:30.340
we've toured grassroots too.

1770
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:35.330
I have toured to 300 cities around the world just to meet people and talk to

1771
01:45:35.331 --> 01:45:37.640
them and give them answers.
And that's an incredible,

1772
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:40.520
not answers but answer questions,
have a discussion.

1773
01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:45.440
That's an incredible experience.
Um,
being in life.

1774
01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:47.140
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1775
01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:52.140
I think it's cool that people are waking up and realizing that we're involved in

1776
01:45:52.481 --> 01:45:56.550
this society that really hasn't been thought out that well in terms of a

1777
01:45:56.551 --> 01:45:59.590
sustainability or the impact of the future.
Like,

1778
01:45:59.770 --> 01:46:01.630
I remember Fukushima when that happened.

1779
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:05.680
It was a huge wake up call for a lot of folks and they realize you can't shut

1780
01:46:05.681 --> 01:46:09.150
off these plants when they go offline like that.
When,

1781
01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:13.150
when when the power gets disrupted and there's no ability to cool the rods,

1782
01:46:13.151 --> 01:46:17.320
like everyone's fucked.
Like that area is fucked eternally.

1783
01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.750
I mean it will be fucked a hundred thousand years from now.

1784
01:46:19.930 --> 01:46:23.620
It will be fucked for longer than there've been people.

1785
01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:26.910
And then this is something that we just did.

1786
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.750
<v 3>I'm not a,
I'm not an expert on that for sure.</v>

1787
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:33.050
<v 4>Well the half life worry me,
it's like a hundred thousand years.
How many,</v>

1788
01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:37.000
how long has it been people in this form?
Has it been in pointing out 200 years.

1789
01:46:37.050 --> 01:46:39.470
A lot of the fracking chemicals don't biodegrade.

1790
01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:42.920
So you're talking about putting things into the earth.

1791
01:46:42.921 --> 01:46:44.960
We need to shoot it into the space.
That's what we need to do.

1792
01:46:45.650 --> 01:46:50.100
The aliens come back and kick our ass assholes litter in.
Did

1793
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.410
<v 2>you guys do this?
Launch this fucking shit in space</v>

1794
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:58.020
and then we'll find out that the environmental cost of using the jets to

1795
01:46:58.021 --> 01:47:02.940
launching the space accelerating global warming.
It's,
well,
I mean I,

1796
01:47:02.970 --> 01:47:04.280
yeah,
I mean the the,

1797
01:47:04.281 --> 01:47:09.281
the truth of the matter is though that these problems have answers and the and

1798
01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:14.910
the,
the problems boil down to being political problems,

1799
01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:16.020
social problems.

1800
01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:21.620
As much as they end up paying chemics chemistry problems and contamination

1801
01:47:21.991 --> 01:47:22.560
problems,

1802
01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:27.560
they are really about how skewed our system is right now and who's got the

1803
01:47:27.811 --> 01:47:32.430
leavers of control of the end and what I,
what I'm seeing start to happen,

1804
01:47:32.431 --> 01:47:36.030
which is really remarkable is people starting to win.
Well that's cool.

1805
01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:40.320
Information information becomes undeniable in this day and age.

1806
01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:41.820
This is this too much of it.

1807
01:47:41.850 --> 01:47:46.850
It's just like it's too easy to just do research and see the studies.

1808
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:51.300
It's too easy to look at the environmental impact that you could literally see

1809
01:47:51.301 --> 01:47:56.301
where your own eyes and also to see where the influence is to see the system

1810
01:47:56.551 --> 01:47:56.951
that's in place.

1811
01:47:56.951 --> 01:48:00.510
Is this system in place because it's the best way to do it or is a system in

1812
01:48:00.511 --> 01:48:05.511
place because people are already hugely influential and extracting massive

1813
01:48:05.851 --> 01:48:09.060
amounts of money and then spreading that massive amounts of money to our quote

1814
01:48:09.061 --> 01:48:12.210
unquote representatives through lobbyists and what have you.

1815
01:48:12.450 --> 01:48:14.670
And then that's the hold up.
Is that the hold up?

1816
01:48:14.730 --> 01:48:16.030
I mean it seems like that's the whole whole,

1817
01:48:16.050 --> 01:48:17.900
well that was the question of gas and parking now,

1818
01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:21.960
which is that we saw this huge movement on fracking.
Um,

1819
01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:26.760
and then we saw and we had the most,
uh,
you know,

1820
01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:29.910
in a way liberal progressive president we've had in a long,
long time.

1821
01:48:30.210 --> 01:48:31.920
Why wasn't there more action on this?

1822
01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:35.670
Why didn't we see change when all of a sudden,
and that was the question.

1823
01:48:35.671 --> 01:48:39.790
So gasoline to became this investigation into the government,
um,

1824
01:48:40.050 --> 01:48:43.410
and it wasn't about fracking contaminants in the water and fracking pollutants

1825
01:48:43.411 --> 01:48:43.831
in the air.

1826
01:48:43.831 --> 01:48:48.330
It was about these fracking dollars that were contaminating the political
system.

1827
01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:51.870
Um,
and that was really the investigation.
How does that happen?

1828
01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:55.680
And what we found was really startling.
And it's,
we're DEF,
definitely.

1829
01:48:55.681 --> 01:48:57.690
I would say no,
it's on my,
my own film,

1830
01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:02.580
but definitely worth watching that because this is all about a trilogy for me.

1831
01:49:02.581 --> 01:49:05.490
You know,
looking at first my kind of consciousness,

1832
01:49:05.491 --> 01:49:08.790
opening up and understanding what was happening with fracking in the first movie

1833
01:49:08.791 --> 01:49:11.740
about environmental issues.
The second movie really about being gay,

1834
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:16.620
about government and about how government was treating the crisis and this last

1835
01:49:16.621 --> 01:49:18.630
film,
which is not a gas land film.

1836
01:49:18.630 --> 01:49:22.200
The last film of this sort of trilogy and my mind is about climate and it's

1837
01:49:22.201 --> 01:49:23.430
about the whole ball of wax.

1838
01:49:23.431 --> 01:49:27.540
It's about how are we going to deal with this climate crisis from the standpoint

1839
01:49:27.541 --> 01:49:30.450
of,
um,
all of these systems in place.

1840
01:49:30.690 --> 01:49:35.010
It seems like people are more aware of how fucked up our process is now than

1841
01:49:35.011 --> 01:49:36.090
have ever been before.

1842
01:49:36.270 --> 01:49:39.150
I think people kind of looked at democratic process when I was a kid.

1843
01:49:39.151 --> 01:49:42.310
My parents were,
you know,
uh,
my age.
They,
they,

1844
01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:46.200
they didn't really have this awareness of the whole system that was in place.

1845
01:49:46.230 --> 01:49:48.010
But what can that do sometimes that

1846
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:52.090
<v 3>can make you cynical and detached and apathetic.</v>

1847
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:53.650
Um,

1848
01:49:53.650 --> 01:49:58.120
the antidote to that is to get involved and then it makes you,

1849
01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:02.970
um,
it leads you down a pathway,
which is more connected and,

1850
01:50:03.010 --> 01:50:04.840
and I think ultimately more fulfilling.

1851
01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.340
<v 4>Well,
there's always going to be,
you know,
whenever there's a problem,</v>

1852
01:50:07.370 --> 01:50:10.580
any kind of a problem,
there's going to be people that respond in different ways.

1853
01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.210
Like some people respond to being overweight by saying,
fuck,
and I'm fat.

1854
01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:15.770
I'm just going to keep eating cheeseburgers.

1855
01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.530
And some people look at themselves and go,
you know what?

1856
01:50:18.590 --> 01:50:23.300
I just need to start doing something about this vehicle and this meat wagon.

1857
01:50:23.301 --> 01:50:26.690
Then I'm traveling around this world and,
and cleaning it up.
And now it's a,

1858
01:50:26.691 --> 01:50:28.220
it's that choice.

1859
01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:33.240
It's like there's a lot of factors involved in national is the one that is less

1860
01:50:33.501 --> 01:50:35.480
depressing when you're actually active.

1861
01:50:36.010 --> 01:50:39.170
<v 3>And that's the point,
right?
Yeah.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.</v>

1862
01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:43.210
I'll quote mark Ruffalo again and saying,
if you're depressed,

1863
01:50:43.211 --> 01:50:47.470
you're not doing enough.
Um,
like if you,
or something like that.

1864
01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:49.060
I think that's true though,

1865
01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:53.440
that if you're feeling afraid and isolated and um,

1866
01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:58.450
and depressed and sad about these things,
the antidote isn't Prozac.

1867
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.740
Um,
or more therapy.
Although,
you know,
those things might help you.

1868
01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:08.160
The antidote is to get involved and to work with your fellow man and woman and

1869
01:51:09.341 --> 01:51:13.360
your neighbors and your community to do something about this because we,

1870
01:51:13.361 --> 01:51:18.160
you know,
we can't,
um,
I mean this,

1871
01:51:18.161 --> 01:51:20.350
this is from self experience.

1872
01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:24.430
I mean like I get exhausted and I get downtrodden,
I get upset,

1873
01:51:24.431 --> 01:51:26.170
I get worried and I get freaked out.

1874
01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:29.620
And then the antidote is always to go back out and talk to people,

1875
01:51:29.621 --> 01:51:34.570
work with them,
and then you feel like this charge,
now I'm here.
Um,
and yeah,

1876
01:51:34.571 --> 01:51:38.920
information helps.
Um,
and you know,
we have these,

1877
01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:44.170
I mean it was at this community in the Amazon of of of a thousand people,

1878
01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:45.453
you know,

1879
01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:50.200
four and a half hours down river from the nearest population center,

1880
01:51:50.201 --> 01:51:52.930
which wasn't a big population center.
Um,

1881
01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:57.460
and they have solar powered Internet and uh,
that's true.
Hut.

1882
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.550
<v 4>Well yeah,
watch porn.
They weren't doing that.
They weren't,</v>

1883
01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:06.580
there aren't there are,
trust me when you're not there.
Really interesting.

1884
01:52:06.581 --> 01:52:09.550
I didn't think about that.
Of course they are.
There's no way around it.

1885
01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:13.030
Human beings like watching naked human beings.
There's just no way around that.

1886
01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:17.010
The areas that you went to where the,
uh,
the crisis of um,

1887
01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:21.520
the oil spills and the pipelines braking,
is there any effort to clean that up?

1888
01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:26.640
<v 3>I went with Amazon Watch.
Um,
they were our kind of guides.
There's a,
uh,</v>

1889
01:52:26.670 --> 01:52:31.340
amazing local affiliated organization called Alejan Sakana.
Um,

1890
01:52:31.950 --> 01:52:34.280
we were guided by,
uh,

1891
01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:39.000
these folks who are environmental monitors that are sort of self,
um,

1892
01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:40.700
uh,
there,
there,
there,
there,

1893
01:52:40.701 --> 01:52:44.400
there's a system of indigenous environmental monitors that go out into the

1894
01:52:44.401 --> 01:52:46.280
jungle and find these things and report

1895
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:50.330
<v 2>on them.
Um,
but I would say right now</v>

1896
01:52:51.890 --> 01:52:54.350
what we're going to try,
and I haven't said any of this up yet,

1897
01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:57.080
but when I'm going to try to do with the release of the new film,

1898
01:52:57.081 --> 01:53:00.590
since there are actually a lot of organizations that kind of guide us through

1899
01:53:00.591 --> 01:53:03.590
the process.
There's occupy sandy,
when we're looking at Hurricane Sandy,

1900
01:53:03.591 --> 01:53:04.640
there's Amazon Washington,

1901
01:53:04.710 --> 01:53:08.180
Allianz Arcada and these incredible environmental monitors and these indigenous

1902
01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:11.060
parts of uh,
of,
of Peru and Ecuador.

1903
01:53:11.061 --> 01:53:14.360
There's a foundation called empowered by light,

1904
01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:17.180
which helps distribute solar panels in Zambia.

1905
01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:19.040
So when the film actually comes out,

1906
01:53:19.041 --> 01:53:22.970
we're going to connect our audience to a lot of those organizations that are

1907
01:53:22.971 --> 01:53:27.380
doing that work to be a kind of funnel in the same way that we tried to be a

1908
01:53:27.381 --> 01:53:29.570
funnel for the fracking movement.

1909
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:32.660
So if you went to Gaston and the movie.com and you put in your zip code,

1910
01:53:32.661 --> 01:53:34.940
you could find the fracking organizations in your,

1911
01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.390
in your local area or the national organizations working on fracking.

1912
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:40.190
I think for the same,
in the same way,

1913
01:53:40.191 --> 01:53:44.060
we're going to try to connect people through the film to these organizations.

1914
01:53:44.061 --> 01:53:47.390
But right now I haven't done enough of that work to kind of set up the
mechanism.

1915
01:53:47.391 --> 01:53:51.490
But when we do release this new film,
which is currently entitled,
um,

1916
01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:53.420
there at the website,

1917
01:53:53.421 --> 01:53:56.270
you'll definitely have links to Amazon wash and only answer Connor and empowered

1918
01:53:56.271 --> 01:53:59.630
by light.
And occupy sandy and some of the,
uh,

1919
01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:03.620
northern Colorado rebuilders who rebuilt each other's homes in the midst of the

1920
01:54:03.621 --> 01:54:07.710
high park fire,
the biggest fire.
Um,
in recent times,
um,

1921
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:11.010
you know,
where there is a solution,
we're going to try to connect our audience.

1922
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.400
Right?

1923
01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.290
<v 4>Have you been a,
uh,
able to,</v>

1924
01:54:13.291 --> 01:54:17.370
or invited to debate any of your detractors on any of these subjects?

1925
01:54:17.371 --> 01:54:20.070
Because you're very informed.
You,
you have all the statistics you pull,

1926
01:54:20.071 --> 01:54:23.250
obviously this has been a huge part of your life for many years now.

1927
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:27.210
I've done it on TV as much times.
I mean,
I don't want to suck,
man.

1928
01:54:27.211 --> 01:54:30.300
You get these three minute fucking abused,

1929
01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:34.540
two heads on two different frames and one,
you know,

1930
01:54:34.590 --> 01:54:37.360
Fox News person who's buried.
I have

1931
01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:40.630
<v 2>no credibility.
I won't debate people who have no credibility.</v>

1932
01:54:40.631 --> 01:54:45.260
So if you have some kind of charlatan who's like,
you know,
um,

1933
01:54:45.670 --> 01:54:49.360
like trying to just make a name for himself,
uh,
to do this,

1934
01:54:49.361 --> 01:54:52.510
I won't even do the one that tried to get,

1935
01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:55.810
I want it to try to get in the room with t Boone Pickens,
who is that?

1936
01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:01.060
He's connatural star from the 60s,
t Boone Pickens,

1937
01:55:01.061 --> 01:55:02.140
t bone Burnett,
I think.

1938
01:55:02.141 --> 01:55:06.430
But t Boone Pickens is a guy who was promoting natural gas,
who was in oil baron.

1939
01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:11.680
Um,
and he refused to talk to me in written debate.
How weird.
Um,
yeah,

1940
01:55:11.681 --> 01:55:14.230
totally flat teeth.
And in fact t Boone

1941
01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.680
Pickens mouth.
Yeah.
They flat out refused.
Um,
and,
uh,

1942
01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:21.310
I've tried,

1943
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:25.690
I want it to get people who are actually representative of the oil industry to

1944
01:55:25.691 --> 01:55:30.580
talk to me about that,
or,
you know,
uh,
those,
uh,
government officials,

1945
01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:32.030
I would do that.
Um,

1946
01:55:32.230 --> 01:55:36.490
but what the oil and gas industry has done is create these,

1947
01:55:37.090 --> 01:55:41.320
um,
you know,
PR firms.
There's one called energy in depth,

1948
01:55:41.950 --> 01:55:45.510
which is just a fracking,
I mean,
it was created by the super majors.

1949
01:55:45.511 --> 01:55:49.080
It was created by Shell and BP with,
uh,

1950
01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:53.700
and Chesapeake with money,
um,
for their,
uh,
and I,
I,
you know,
I,
I've,

1951
01:55:53.730 --> 01:55:57.810
I've done a few,
um,
against them.
Early on,

1952
01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:02.610
they invited me to Tulsa,
Oklahoma,
where they ganged up on me and I debated them.

1953
01:56:02.611 --> 01:56:05.760
And,
um,
that would,
that's online.

1954
01:56:06.030 --> 01:56:10.710
There's a great one.
When I was in Frostburg,
Maryland,

1955
01:56:11.090 --> 01:56:15.750
we're an oil and gas engineer.
Uh,
we did a debate and another one in Arkansas.

1956
01:56:15.810 --> 01:56:19.800
They're,
they're not,
they don't get a lot of attention.
Um,
but they're fun though.

1957
01:56:20.250 --> 01:56:23.490
They're fun to kind of destroy them.
What are their,
what are their arguments?

1958
01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:26.310
What do they sell?
Their arguments are that the,

1959
01:56:26.311 --> 01:56:30.300
there are no environmental impacts that you can't prove them.
I mean,
they're,

1960
01:56:30.330 --> 01:56:34.140
they say these things that are just utterly 100% false.
And then you can say,

1961
01:56:34.141 --> 01:56:34.630
well,
the,

1962
01:56:34.630 --> 01:56:37.560
here's this study and here's that study and here's one by scientists and here's

1963
01:56:37.561 --> 01:56:42.300
one by your own industry.
Um,
so they lose every time.
That's a debate.

1964
01:56:42.450 --> 01:56:43.890
<v 4>But why do they have them then if they do,</v>

1965
01:56:43.891 --> 01:56:46.500
they know they're going to where they just so confident that they think they're

1966
01:56:46.501 --> 01:56:49.260
just going to be able to smooth talk their way through the whole thing.

1967
01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:52.250
<v 2>You'd have to ask them Fox News at all.
Well,</v>

1968
01:56:52.251 --> 01:56:55.280
the ones on TV work very much like the way you just said.
I mean,

1969
01:56:55.370 --> 01:56:58.790
unfortunately in these types of scenarios,
you know,

1970
01:56:58.820 --> 01:57:02.600
it kind of gets a little egg heady and boring to explain

1971
01:57:03.590 --> 01:57:07.430
<v 4>science,
but that's the only way to really truly debate.
But it's harder.</v>

1972
01:57:07.490 --> 01:57:10.700
It's hard to do that in soundbite,
those fucking shows,
man,

1973
01:57:10.701 --> 01:57:13.010
when they have to be like,
you know,
someone said,
all right,

1974
01:57:13.011 --> 01:57:18.011
we're going to talk to Josh Fox from the movie Gasland and next to him is Satan

1975
01:57:19.630 --> 01:57:20.463
and

1976
01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:25.850
Satan is a money fucking coming out of his collar and money is,

1977
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:30.380
he just stuffed his jacket stuffed with money.
And I mean it's,

1978
01:57:30.381 --> 01:57:35.381
it's so hard to fucking you dealing with these three minute chunks and it's

1979
01:57:35.841 --> 01:57:39.110
like,
who talks over people?
You do it over and over again.

1980
01:57:39.290 --> 01:57:44.270
And that's been my experience.
You know,
Peter Schiff is economics guy,

1981
01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:48.150
really,
really interesting guy.
And He's,
um,
uh,

1982
01:57:48.230 --> 01:57:53.230
one of the few guys that he's a very controversial and he's always on these,

1983
01:57:54.891 --> 01:57:55.460
uh,

1984
01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:59.990
occupy Wall Street things and he doesn't believe in the market the way it's set

1985
01:57:59.991 --> 01:58:02.420
up right now.
And he's,
he's firmly,

1986
01:58:02.421 --> 01:58:06.020
firmly believes that they should have allowed the banks to collapse because they

1987
01:58:06.021 --> 01:58:08.900
were,
they sucked and they weren't functioning properly.

1988
01:58:08.901 --> 01:58:11.820
And in a free market you allow things to fail and then you rebuild and would

1989
01:58:11.821 --> 01:58:15.200
have been better for everybody and that this bailout was very detrimental to our

1990
01:58:15.201 --> 01:58:16.280
process.
Anyway,

1991
01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:20.210
I had him on the podcast and it's so interesting watching him talk because

1992
01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:21.110
brilliant guy,

1993
01:58:21.111 --> 01:58:25.100
but he's used to talking like really fast cause you have like seven minutes to

1994
01:58:25.101 --> 01:58:26.090
bang this out.
I'm like,
dude,

1995
01:58:26.091 --> 01:58:30.590
we got ours and we were cool so he could see like an hour in.

1996
01:58:30.890 --> 01:58:34.640
Oh he like he settles back,
we start drinking and we brought in some whiskey,

1997
01:58:34.641 --> 01:58:36.290
settled.
He be,
it's that,

1998
01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:41.000
that style that you become accustomed to when you do those debates of just
rapid,

1999
01:58:41.530 --> 01:58:42.160
oh sure.
One

2000
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:44.980
<v 2>window on the left and one window of the right and you got seven minutes,</v>

2001
01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:47.210
seven minutes and everyone's trying to make their point.

2002
01:58:47.211 --> 01:58:50.620
And it's a skill that you have to develop but you'd look and there's no way to

2003
01:58:50.621 --> 01:58:54.820
learn it unless you keep doing it.
Got to go to,
so luck,
luckily,
you know,

2004
01:58:55.420 --> 01:58:59.380
um,
I've been able to learn that,
you know,
it's been Dick,
look,
if,

2005
01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:04.360
if you ask me in 2010 would I still be doing this in 2014?

2006
01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:07.570
There was no way I would say,
yeah.
I mean like,
I mean,
I don't know.

2007
01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:10.900
Let's try it in 2008,
that's when he started to start crossing something in 2008.

2008
01:59:10.901 --> 01:59:11.920
But,
you know,
I mean,

2009
01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:15.110
I'm a theater director and if at a playwright and a film maker,

2010
01:59:15.130 --> 01:59:18.280
I'm looking at your fingernails.
You obviously play guitar,
Banjo,
Banjo.

2011
01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:22.810
But like the,
the thing is that,
that,
um,
you know,

2012
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:25.270
I'm used to moving from one project to the next,
to the next to the next.

2013
01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:28.840
It's been an incredible sustained effort to work on this.

2014
01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:32.680
But what's amazing about it is that it's constantly rewarding and fulfilling to

2015
01:59:32.681 --> 01:59:35.470
do it.
And that when you enter into this,
um,

2016
01:59:36.490 --> 01:59:40.450
moment of thinking about all these issues that we've been talking about,

2017
01:59:40.451 --> 01:59:43.840
I think it really changes your brain and you can see,
you know,

2018
01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:46.630
there might be one main river of the work that you're doing,

2019
01:59:46.631 --> 01:59:49.240
but there's thousands of tributaries that are going into that and they're

2020
01:59:49.241 --> 01:59:53.740
fascinating and there's thousands of other subjects that you could use to branch

2021
01:59:53.741 --> 01:59:57.700
off of this that are entered,
you know,

2022
01:59:58.090 --> 02:00:01.210
enough to really keep you occupied.

2023
02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:05.650
And I love the act of interviewing people for a documentary.

2024
02:00:06.070 --> 02:00:10.130
I love the act of,
of meeting people that way.
Um,

2025
02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:14.230
there's something about it which I think is really amazing that you can meet on

2026
02:00:14.231 --> 02:00:15.640
another level that way.

2027
02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:20.410
Cause you have your agenda shines through to people and if you really care about

2028
02:00:20.411 --> 02:00:22.910
what you're doing,
they recognize that you care.

2029
02:00:22.911 --> 02:00:24.910
And all of a sudden it's not an interview anymore.
It's a friendship.

2030
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:29.680
And Al Maysles,
the great document documentary filmmaker who,
um,

2031
02:00:30.010 --> 02:00:33.540
who was in his eighties who made salesman and grey gardens and,

2032
02:00:33.541 --> 02:00:38.260
and gimme shelter,
he said to me,
the whole process is a friendship.

2033
02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:41.110
You get to know,
and then everybody gets to know.

2034
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:45.310
So some of my best friends in the world at this point of the people who started

2035
02:00:45.311 --> 02:00:46.720
off as subjects of my films,

2036
02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:51.040
who we went to spend some time with them at their place in Wyoming or at their

2037
02:00:51.041 --> 02:00:54.780
place in Zambia or at their place in,
um,

2038
02:00:56.190 --> 02:01:00.700
Pennsylvania or somewhere.
And,
and you become friends with them.
Um,

2039
02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:03.280
you know,
and you,
and you know,
I get Christmas cards from them,

2040
02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:06.040
like you have to catch up with them.
And you know,

2041
02:01:06.041 --> 02:01:11.041
like John Fenton who's in the gas in both gas and one and two who was in

2042
02:01:11.711 --> 02:01:15.420
pavilion,
Wyoming,
his case was the shot heard around the world where they,

2043
02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:17.500
where EPA finally came in and said,
Yup,

2044
02:01:17.501 --> 02:01:20.170
fracking fluids have contaminated the water here.
And it's because of fracking.

2045
02:01:20.650 --> 02:01:24.040
Um,
you know,
he's one of my best friends on the planet right now.
And I just,

2046
02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:25.171
you know,
like I,

2047
02:01:25.171 --> 02:01:27.820
I don't know what my life would be like if I didn't have these people's

2048
02:01:27.821 --> 02:01:32.620
friendship and their comradery and,
you know,
it's just like,
what life is now.

2049
02:01:32.890 --> 02:01:36.220
So it's um,
yeah.
And,
and you know,

2050
02:01:36.221 --> 02:01:39.260
we started to just talk this question was about soundbites.

2051
02:01:39.710 --> 02:01:44.240
I think that's just a skill that you have to try to figure out.
Um,
you know,

2052
02:01:44.241 --> 02:01:47.900
luckily,
uh,
you know,
I feel comfortable doing that.
Um,

2053
02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:50.720
I think a lot of the time it's very taxing them.

2054
02:01:51.170 --> 02:01:55.430
Do you stay in touch with some of those folks that were having some pretty

2055
02:01:55.700 --> 02:01:57.890
profound health consequences to fracking?

2056
02:01:57.891 --> 02:02:01.970
Like that woman who was a really sick because of the filters that they were

2057
02:02:01.971 --> 02:02:06.320
using to filter out their water,
wasn't filtering out those specific toxins.

2058
02:02:06.321 --> 02:02:10.700
John [inaudible] has lost all of his hair.
He's lost his eyebrows.
Whoa.

2059
02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:15.770
He has constant ringing in his ears.
Um,
well he,
we,

2060
02:02:15.771 --> 02:02:18.680
he went up,
he had two different forms of alopecia that,

2061
02:02:18.681 --> 02:02:21.410
one of which can be caused by chemical exposure.

2062
02:02:21.411 --> 02:02:25.880
Although the research on that is very,
um,
it gets better when he leaves town.

2063
02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:29.540
So raises eyebrows back when he leaves town starting,
I'm going to fucking move.

2064
02:02:29.541 --> 02:02:31.980
Really Weird.
Well,
that's a big question,
right?

2065
02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:37.420
A lot of these people have moved or were forced to move and they're thinking

2066
02:02:37.641 --> 02:02:39.550
about it the way,
you know,
way he deals with it.

2067
02:02:39.570 --> 02:02:42.170
He tries to leave from time to time.
But you know,

2068
02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:47.800
when you have built your own home by hand and you're on your wife's parents to

2069
02:02:50.691 --> 02:02:55.190
several generations farm in Wyoming,
it's not always that easy to leave.

2070
02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:58.880
Now do these guys,
even how you're living into these spots that are fucked up,

2071
02:02:58.910 --> 02:03:02.090
some cases,
sometimes they have a percentage of the mineral rights,

2072
02:03:02.091 --> 02:03:05.180
sometimes they don't.
Um,
you know,
uh,

2073
02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:09.710
Calvin Tillman for example,
the mayor of dish,
Texas who's also a friend,

2074
02:03:09.740 --> 02:03:13.450
good friend.
Um,
he did leave,
he left the,

2075
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:17.840
the mayor moves out of his own town and got,
and you know,

2076
02:03:18.010 --> 02:03:21.770
that's what I say in the film.
You know,
it's like when,
when things are bad,

2077
02:03:21.771 --> 02:03:21.951
you know,

2078
02:03:21.951 --> 02:03:25.910
things are bad when the mayor moves out of town and he left and he started to

2079
02:03:25.911 --> 02:03:28.340
raise his kids in the next town over where they didn't have shale.

2080
02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:32.140
And what was his issue environment and what was,
is a health issue.
Um,
well his,

2081
02:03:32.141 --> 02:03:33.950
he was worried about his kids getting nose bleeds.

2082
02:03:33.951 --> 02:03:35.330
He was worried about getting those places.

2083
02:03:35.331 --> 02:03:36.920
They were getting nose bleeds in the night.
There were,

2084
02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:39.800
the asthma was getting worse.
They had,
um,
uh,

2085
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:43.820
breathing issues and he was having a new,
uh,
daughter on the way.

2086
02:03:44.690 --> 02:03:48.910
They were planning another child.
I have two sons that,
and you know,
um,

2087
02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:52.790
his wife says,
you know,
it look,
I mean we,

2088
02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:56.600
they did monitoring of the health of the whole town and they found elevated

2089
02:03:56.630 --> 02:04:00.620
levels of a whole host of illnesses.
Um,
and do they do,

2090
02:04:00.621 --> 02:04:04.850
it starts with nosebleeds and it starts to become a respiratory problems,

2091
02:04:04.851 --> 02:04:07.010
but then you don't know like what,
what are they going to be?

2092
02:04:07.011 --> 02:04:10.630
The longterm effects of this.
But they've had exposure that they mapped out from,

2093
02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:14.900
from um,
ambient benzene in the air.
Um,

2094
02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:20.450
uh,
dimethyl sulfides,
uh,
other,
I'm trying to remember the play,

2095
02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:21.630
but if you're looking gasoline too,

2096
02:04:21.650 --> 02:04:25.830
you can see the maps that they did have longterm and short term,
uh,

2097
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:27.690
exposures.
Uh,
and the,

2098
02:04:27.691 --> 02:04:32.360
those exposures can cause health effects in the whole town of dish,
Texas.
Um,

2099
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:35.960
and these are directly attributed to these?
Oh yeah.
I was like,
well,

2100
02:04:35.961 --> 02:04:39.450
they have pipelines and they have oil and gas sites and they have compressor

2101
02:04:39.451 --> 02:04:40.284
stations.

2102
02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:43.980
So how far away do you have to get away before you don't experience the effects

2103
02:04:43.981 --> 02:04:46.110
of those chemicals?
That's what they did.
Some of that mapping,

2104
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:50.670
this whole town of dish,
um,
had those effects of their fathers.
Yeah.

2105
02:04:50.671 --> 02:04:54.050
Well in a lot of people have moved.
Um,
and a lot of people have been,
uh,

2106
02:04:54.150 --> 02:04:56.820
that he goes down the street and one point in gas and two and says,
you know,

2107
02:04:56.821 --> 02:04:57.001
look,

2108
02:04:57.001 --> 02:05:00.660
I think it's 40% of these people are in a lawsuit trying to move because what

2109
02:05:00.661 --> 02:05:02.100
happens when you buy a house,
right?

2110
02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:05.100
You put all of your present and future assets into that house.

2111
02:05:05.490 --> 02:05:08.280
So if oil and gas comes in and destroys the area,

2112
02:05:08.281 --> 02:05:12.990
you've lost so much of that asset and the houses are worth a fraction of what

2113
02:05:12.991 --> 02:05:15.300
they used to be.
I mean,
um,

2114
02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:19.560
so your only choice at that point is to have a lawsuit to get out.

2115
02:05:19.890 --> 02:05:22.980
Now when you have a lawsuit,
um,

2116
02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.940
nine times out of 10 included in that settlement with the oil and gas.
Let's see,

2117
02:05:27.950 --> 02:05:29.460
when you get to the best case scenario,

2118
02:05:29.461 --> 02:05:31.350
you get a settlement for a couple of hundred thousand dollars.

2119
02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:34.470
Included in that settlement is a nondisclosure agreement,

2120
02:05:35.010 --> 02:05:38.590
which means you can never talk about what happened to you.
Um,

2121
02:05:39.090 --> 02:05:41.760
and nobody else can find it out,
uh,
in,
in,

2122
02:05:41.761 --> 02:05:44.850
in a famous case in Pittsburgh or outside of Pittsburgh.
Um,
the how,

2123
02:05:44.851 --> 02:05:46.660
which family who are featured in gas name part two,

2124
02:05:46.661 --> 02:05:49.300
who ended up signing a nondisclosure agreement.
Um,

2125
02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:53.820
they got something like $700,000 to move to leave their homes.
Um,

2126
02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:54.900
and they did move.

2127
02:05:55.170 --> 02:06:00.170
But what was discovered when Pittsburgh Post Gazette pressed to get information

2128
02:06:00.961 --> 02:06:04.590
from that nondisclosure agreement because they argued that it was a matter of

2129
02:06:04.591 --> 02:06:09.450
public health.
They found out that the oil and gas industry had actually gagged.

2130
02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:14.400
They're eight and 10 year old children and PR,
Pr,
the gag.
The kids,

2131
02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:18.270
they said the kids couldn't talk about oil and gas or fracking or what had

2132
02:06:18.271 --> 02:06:22.350
happened to them.
And when the world you could do that.

2133
02:06:22.410 --> 02:06:25.530
How's an eight year old kid consent?
This is what my question was.

2134
02:06:25.531 --> 02:06:29.550
So this was featured on the Colbert report.
Um,
uh,

2135
02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:32.190
Stephen Colbert brought this up,
um,
and you know,

2136
02:06:32.191 --> 02:06:36.690
like lampooned and everything and I had an interview,

2137
02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:38.520
well and we'll go down that road but,

2138
02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:43.350
but another family that I know very well and it won't,
I can't say which one.

2139
02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:44.533
Um,

2140
02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:49.320
who had signed a nondisclosure agreement who had left their multigenerational

2141
02:06:49.321 --> 02:06:51.060
property in a state,

2142
02:06:51.061 --> 02:06:55.710
which people are very attached to their land and they had to end up leaving that

2143
02:06:55.711 --> 02:07:00.000
person.
A representative that family said to me,
hypothetically,

2144
02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:03.840
you get my meaning.
If I was in oil and gas company,

2145
02:07:04.380 --> 02:07:09.380
I might argue that unborn generations of future children would not be able to

2146
02:07:11.221 --> 02:07:15.210
speak about that and force you to negotiate from there.

2147
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:17.303
You see what I'm saying?

2148
02:07:17.310 --> 02:07:21.480
So that he was indicating that the oil and gas company in question in this

2149
02:07:21.481 --> 02:07:24.630
particular case had tried to gag their unborn children

2150
02:07:27.150 --> 02:07:31.260
and that forced them to negotiate back from there.
How is that possible?

2151
02:07:31.261 --> 02:07:34.620
I just don't understand how it can be legally binding because the first

2152
02:07:34.621 --> 02:07:38.330
amendment,
um,
you know,
right free.

2153
02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:40.840
If the government tried to do it would be illegal,
right?

2154
02:07:41.050 --> 02:07:42.280
That pertains to the government.

2155
02:07:43.060 --> 02:07:46.360
Private corporations and private individuals can make the deals to gag each

2156
02:07:46.361 --> 02:07:48.730
other all they want.
It's not the government doing that.

2157
02:07:48.731 --> 02:07:50.680
The government can't tell you.
You can never speak about this.

2158
02:07:50.681 --> 02:07:55.270
That's against the first amendment,
but
it's not,

2159
02:07:55.320 --> 02:07:57.390
it doesn't count to.
But you know,

2160
02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:00.100
there's one thing that you can get around these nondisclosure agreements,

2161
02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:05.140
which is a congressional subpoena.
Um,
so,
um,

2162
02:08:05.230 --> 02:08:09.610
when Henry Waxman was doing an inquiry into fracking,
um,

2163
02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:14.320
when the Democrats in the house had a subpoena power when they were in the

2164
02:08:14.321 --> 02:08:19.030
majority in 2010,
um,
they,
the Waksman Commission on fracking asked me,

2165
02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:21.850
can you connect us with people who aren't,
have nondisclosure agreements?

2166
02:08:21.851 --> 02:08:25.690
And we did.
We gave them,
we gave them names and they were able to testify.

2167
02:08:26.230 --> 02:08:29.770
And it's something that I've asked of several senators currently cause I mean,

2168
02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:31.390
well,
when the Democrats were in the majority,

2169
02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:35.310
I asked Senator Gillibrand is office,
can you please create a subpoena?
Um,

2170
02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:37.090
so that some of these people can come in and testify.

2171
02:08:37.091 --> 02:08:41.920
I've asked this over and over and over again of officials on the hill,
please,

2172
02:08:41.921 --> 02:08:45.370
please,
please,
let's have public hearings with the public,

2173
02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:48.910
not with oil and gas,
talking heads with people.

2174
02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:53.770
Let's have people testify in Congress or what's happening to them was oil and

2175
02:08:53.771 --> 02:08:57.010
gas contamination.
Why not do that?

2176
02:08:57.250 --> 02:09:01.300
I just can't imagine a world where it makes sense that you could put a gag order

2177
02:09:01.301 --> 02:09:04.340
on an eight year old.
That's this world.
Well,

2178
02:09:04.450 --> 02:09:06.470
especially when it comes to the surrogate.
You don't have to advance.

2179
02:09:06.610 --> 02:09:10.060
Imagine that at all.
Something like gas and oil.
I mean,

2180
02:09:10.061 --> 02:09:14.890
that just seems so criminal.
That just seems,
how could you sign that away?

2181
02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:17.170
I've little Timmy,
10 years from now,

2182
02:09:17.710 --> 02:09:21.190
it's kind of mafioso weird kind of godfather came the thing,
right?
It's creepy.

2183
02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:22.150
It's creepy that that's,

2184
02:09:22.350 --> 02:09:25.630
or North Korea where you've got multiple generations in jail.

2185
02:09:26.050 --> 02:09:30.310
These are multiple generations that can't speak about what you wrote on their

2186
02:09:30.311 --> 02:09:31.144
property

2187
02:09:33.010 --> 02:09:36.460
or actually what you didn't agree to admit to doing,

2188
02:09:36.461 --> 02:09:38.620
but you paid them to leave and shut up.

2189
02:09:38.890 --> 02:09:43.210
That's amazing because most of those courts that was don't have any admission of

2190
02:09:43.211 --> 02:09:46.520
wrongdoing and how many people are actually winning in court for me,

2191
02:09:46.521 --> 02:09:49.990
did they settle with these folks just to get them to shut out cord is,
um,

2192
02:09:50.170 --> 02:09:54.400
you know,
it was a,
it was Ron Paul who was running for president right in 2010,

2193
02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:56.740
2008,
I think,

2194
02:09:56.741 --> 02:10:00.670
who was arguing that we should do it with the EPA because all of these

2195
02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:05.260
individual contamination cases can be handled in the courts.
Let me tell you,

2196
02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:10.450
you don't want to take the oil and gas industry on in court,
you know,
um,

2197
02:10:10.990 --> 02:10:12.380
I mean,
they have you,

2198
02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:16.720
they will put motions and thousands of dollars and thousands of lawyers and you

2199
02:10:16.721 --> 02:10:21.130
don't want to try to take these guys on in,
in,
in court by yourself.
I mean,

2200
02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:25.030
I asked,
um,
there's a case in gas and then part two,

2201
02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:30.650
um,
in Texas where the EPA was enforcing an,
uh,
an,

2202
02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:34.600
an imminent and substantial endangerment order,
uh,

2203
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:38.420
the Lipski family who were the ones who can light their water hose on fire,
um,

2204
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:42.890
out of the backyard out of there,
a water wall.
Um,

2205
02:10:43.340 --> 02:10:44.580
because the top of the,

2206
02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:48.020
of headspace of the water wall venting off so much gas that they can just,

2207
02:10:48.450 --> 02:10:51.650
the hose that they attach to the top of the border wall just lights every single

2208
02:10:51.651 --> 02:10:55.330
time and now they have this pipe that they can light off the top.
Um,

2209
02:10:55.850 --> 02:10:57.740
that EPA got involved there.

2210
02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:03.340
And then at a certain point after Obama's 2012 speech on touting the virtues of

2211
02:11:03.941 --> 02:11:06.560
the natural gas,
all these EPA investigations shut down.

2212
02:11:06.561 --> 02:11:11.510
They shut down in Pennsylvania and Texas and Wyoming.
Um,
and uh,

2213
02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:14.270
this was extremely suspicious to me.
Right.

2214
02:11:14.271 --> 02:11:18.080
And this is what we report on it and guessing that part too.
Um,
you know,

2215
02:11:18.081 --> 02:11:22.490
I asked the EPA and the one of the EPA officials off the record said to me,
well,

2216
02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:27.940
we were worried that the gas company in question was going to outspend the

2217
02:11:28.551 --> 02:11:30.050
government on legal fees.

2218
02:11:30.740 --> 02:11:35.360
So we simply couldn't afford as the government to keep her prosecuting this

2219
02:11:35.361 --> 02:11:39.530
case.
That's so crazy.
So I,
I went to NRDC,

2220
02:11:39.531 --> 02:11:43.580
I went to a number of,
uh,
Sierra club and went to try to get advocacy to say,

2221
02:11:43.581 --> 02:11:45.200
can you please take this case on?

2222
02:11:45.201 --> 02:11:48.950
These people are left in the lurch with nothing.
And they said,
well,
you know,

2223
02:11:48.951 --> 02:11:51.260
what makes you think we can take it on if they were going to outspend the

2224
02:11:51.261 --> 02:11:54.980
government,
they're going to outspend us.
I mean,
like this one,

2225
02:11:54.981 --> 02:11:56.060
these are the questions,
right?

2226
02:11:56.061 --> 02:11:59.360
Because you can just take motion after motion and tie things up in court and do

2227
02:11:59.361 --> 02:12:04.300
this for decades.
The amount of money that they have,
it's just so scary.

2228
02:12:04.301 --> 02:12:07.230
It's like government money.
It's like they be more than that.
I mean,
I mean,

2229
02:12:07.231 --> 02:12:11.830
I mean like they are a government,
like a,
an entire country.
I mean,

2230
02:12:11.831 --> 02:12:14.230
it's like that kind of money.
So it's so,

2231
02:12:14.890 --> 02:12:19.330
it's just so hard to believe that things have gone solo ride,

2232
02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:21.640
that you have this huge,

2233
02:12:21.790 --> 02:12:26.680
huge industry that is poisoning people and then paying them to shut the fuck

2234
02:12:26.681 --> 02:12:30.490
that I can sit here and I could sit here and tell you that all of New York state

2235
02:12:30.491 --> 02:12:33.850
just did the impossible but you must be so happy about that because I feel like

2236
02:12:33.851 --> 02:12:35.500
a huge victory.
Yeah,
of course.

2237
02:12:36.010 --> 02:12:40.420
I was actually coming out of five days in the Amazon jungle having investigated

2238
02:12:40.450 --> 02:12:45.450
oil spills on foot and in boats and incredibly arduous out of contact and we

2239
02:12:46.841 --> 02:12:50.980
were coming out on the boat and we were passing by a cell tower and my phone

2240
02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:52.480
blows up as they're,

2241
02:12:52.481 --> 02:12:56.950
as they're making the announcement and made it back to civilization in time to

2242
02:12:56.951 --> 02:13:01.430
go on Chris Hayes that night and do it live Skype from the,
from the Amazon.

2243
02:13:01.450 --> 02:13:06.100
It was,
did you film the texts coming in the next day?

2244
02:13:06.730 --> 02:13:11.080
Cause I was like too,
like I filmed the texts the next day.

2245
02:13:11.081 --> 02:13:14.020
I think there are some reactions shots.
And because I was actually on the front,

2246
02:13:14.050 --> 02:13:18.070
I was on the bow of the boat,
like hanging out,
like getting a Tan,

2247
02:13:18.071 --> 02:13:20.740
like listening to my tunes.
Wow.

2248
02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:23.980
And I was like just hanging out and not doing much and all of a sudden like my

2249
02:13:23.981 --> 02:13:27.340
phone,
which I was playing music on,
um,

2250
02:13:27.780 --> 02:13:30.730
in my headphones just starts to go beep.
And I was like,
well that's weird.

2251
02:13:30.731 --> 02:13:33.570
And like I guess my is working again.
You know,

2252
02:13:33.571 --> 02:13:37.440
cause we were like halfway out on the Marin you own river cause it could hear

2253
02:13:37.441 --> 02:13:42.300
the behind it,
pick it up and then I was like,
no way.
You do.

2254
02:13:42.301 --> 02:13:46.320
You anticipate that this is going to be like this is just the start.

2255
02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:50.520
It's gonna start trickling down other states or moving things trickle down.

2256
02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:54.330
It'll be a domino if we make it try me on.
It's a bad word.

2257
02:13:55.600 --> 02:14:00.420
It certainly helps.
But I want to ask,
um,

2258
02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:01.021
you know,

2259
02:14:01.021 --> 02:14:04.080
all those people who made New York possible to get involved in the fight in PA

2260
02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:06.840
and get involved in the fight in California.
I mean,

2261
02:14:06.841 --> 02:14:08.280
I think we have to be strategic about it.

2262
02:14:08.850 --> 02:14:13.290
I think from a national organizing stand point in New York was always strategic.

2263
02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:17.160
The idea that,
um,
New York mattered enormously.

2264
02:14:17.161 --> 02:14:21.540
Not just because New York is beautiful and matters and we don't get fracked up,

2265
02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:26.040
but also because if we can get that win,

2266
02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:29.070
then there's a huge win for science.
There's a win for reason.

2267
02:14:29.071 --> 02:14:32.490
There's a win for grassroots,
but now without question,

2268
02:14:32.850 --> 02:14:34.740
that movement has to double down,

2269
02:14:34.741 --> 02:14:39.741
be more vigorous in Pennsylvania and Ohio and Maryland and Colorado and

2270
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:41.520
California now too.

2271
02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:44.670
I think that there are certain places that we should focus on because we have a

2272
02:14:44.671 --> 02:14:47.640
chance,
um,
you know,

2273
02:14:47.670 --> 02:14:51.930
where we actually have viable energy.
Absolutely.
Um,

2274
02:14:51.931 --> 02:14:55.330
there's a new governor in Pennsylvania,
his name is governor Wolf.
Um,

2275
02:14:55.790 --> 02:15:00.750
he is the ferry first governor of Pennsylvania ever to be elected.
Um,

2276
02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:04.500
when there was an incumbent that was running and other VA has never thrown out

2277
02:15:04.501 --> 02:15:07.320
of governor before.
Real.
Yeah.
Um,
so,

2278
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:12.350
and this man is a Democrat and he has now the huge weight and moral

2279
02:15:12.421 --> 02:15:15.380
responsibility of all the havoc that the fracking industry is,

2280
02:15:15.530 --> 02:15:20.530
is wreaking in Pennsylvania and does any part of the platform that he ran on.

2281
02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:26.820
He was very wishy washy about it.
He's already got a contradiction in his policy.

2282
02:15:26.850 --> 02:15:29.760
He's pro fracking,
but he's against fracking in the Delaware River basin.

2283
02:15:30.450 --> 02:15:33.360
Now that's unequal protection under the law in my book.
Right.

2284
02:15:33.361 --> 02:15:36.870
So why should people in the river base and have extra protection whereas other

2285
02:15:36.871 --> 02:15:40.110
people in the rest of Pennsylvania don't.
That's a big problem.

2286
02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:43.290
That's why New York is all hundred percent frack free because if they were going

2287
02:15:43.291 --> 02:15:47.550
to ban it in the New York City watershed and not ban it like in,

2288
02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:52.790
you know,
Arthur or something New York,
um,

2289
02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:57.780
or Alfred New York,
uh,
you know,
then there was a problem.
You have a mistake.

2290
02:15:57.781 --> 02:15:59.190
Cause if you don't ban it and out,

2291
02:15:59.220 --> 02:16:01.400
if an Alfred and you've been in New York City watershed,

2292
02:16:01.410 --> 02:16:03.660
well the oil and gas industry can sue you and say,
look,
oh,

2293
02:16:03.661 --> 02:16:05.700
we should be able to open up and drove to New York City watershed.

2294
02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:10.020
So they kind of had to do,
you know,
one law for everybody.

2295
02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:15.210
Governor Wolf has already kind of,
in principle,
I'm broken that,

2296
02:16:15.540 --> 02:16:19.080
uh,
that ideal,
right to say,
all right,
well,

2297
02:16:19.081 --> 02:16:20.790
we're not going to have any change in the river basin,

2298
02:16:20.791 --> 02:16:23.220
which means fracking would be no good for the Delaware River Basin,

2299
02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:24.750
but we're going to allow it in the sauce,

2300
02:16:24.751 --> 02:16:29.500
my hand or river basin or in the Allegheny river basin.
That's a huge problem.

2301
02:16:29.501 --> 02:16:33.160
So he's got compromised and he's not even in office yet.
He's governor elect.

2302
02:16:33.610 --> 02:16:36.040
But on January 20th in Harrisburg,

2303
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:38.890
I will be there with an incredible fracking activists,

2304
02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:42.220
Pennsylvania against fracking and clean water action and a whole host of folks

2305
02:16:42.221 --> 02:16:46.330
to protest that and start to talk about how this governor has to pay attention

2306
02:16:46.331 --> 02:16:48.400
in the same way that governor Cuomo had to pay attention.

2307
02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:53.320
Harrisburg is all that's rush limbo country.
Um,
Harrisburg is the is,

2308
02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:57.210
you know,
I mean I friends and family used to live there.
Really?
Yeah.

2309
02:16:57.211 --> 02:17:00.460
They're like,
it's so right wing.
That's one of the reasons why they moved.

2310
02:17:00.461 --> 02:17:04.120
They were like,
this is crazy.
You Ed Rendell,
governor of PA,

2311
02:17:04.121 --> 02:17:07.120
former governor of PA who opened the doors for the fracking industry famously

2312
02:17:07.121 --> 02:17:12.121
calls it Pennsyltucky PA is Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in Kentucky.

2313
02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:16.210
In between.
I don't know if I believe that.
I mean,
I,

2314
02:17:16.350 --> 02:17:18.160
it doesn't matter to me.
Like I said,

2315
02:17:18.161 --> 02:17:19.750
like there's the first world in the third world,

2316
02:17:19.751 --> 02:17:22.390
but then there's the blue areas and the red states and the red areas and the

2317
02:17:22.391 --> 02:17:26.470
blue states and where I played doesn't really matter.
Um,
you know,

2318
02:17:26.471 --> 02:17:28.450
we play in red areas in blue states and,

2319
02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:32.530
and blueberries and rest days just as much as anywhere in the blue is the blue

2320
02:17:32.531 --> 02:17:36.400
and the reddest of the red.
We've got a phenomenon happening in the America,

2321
02:17:36.401 --> 02:17:38.590
which is green tea.
You know,

2322
02:17:38.910 --> 02:17:41.920
you gotta talk about fracking from a progressive stand point.

2323
02:17:41.921 --> 02:17:43.750
You're going to talk about all the things that we just talked about,

2324
02:17:43.751 --> 02:17:46.000
environmental issues,
social inequality,
inequality,

2325
02:17:46.390 --> 02:17:49.000
etc. If you're talking about it from a,
um,

2326
02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:51.760
a land rights perspective,

2327
02:17:51.761 --> 02:17:56.761
private property rights is one of the bulwarks of conservative philosophy.

2328
02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:00.640
You don't have any private property rights at the fracking area.

2329
02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:03.940
So you've got people who,
um,
if I had the card in my pocket,

2330
02:18:03.941 --> 02:18:07.800
I pulled it out and showed you,
but my,
my wallet,
I went into the Amazon.
Um,

2331
02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:11.650
and it disintegrated.
It was,
uh,
it's called,
um,

2332
02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:14.470
Marcellus patriots for land rights.

2333
02:18:14.770 --> 02:18:18.310
It's got the don't tread on me snake with an oil rig going right through it.

2334
02:18:18.311 --> 02:18:22.900
These are conservative guys who go to sea pack every year who are adamantly

2335
02:18:22.901 --> 02:18:24.500
anti-fracking.
Um,

2336
02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:27.490
so you have this strange bedfellows thing happening where you've got

2337
02:18:27.610 --> 02:18:30.820
anti-fracking activists in the middle of rural Pennsylvania who vote

2338
02:18:30.821 --> 02:18:34.960
conservative or who have conservative values all of a sudden realizing that,

2339
02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:39.010
um,
they're on the same side as environmentalist from New York.

2340
02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:43.180
So that's an interesting conversation to be a part of.
Well,
it's just survival.

2341
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:48.220
It's just a matter of recognizing that you can't just keep fucking polluting

2342
02:18:48.221 --> 02:18:52.090
everywhere.
That's not conservative or liberal,
but conservative,

2343
02:18:52.660 --> 02:18:55.900
conservative ideologies and mindsets.
They get trapped.

2344
02:18:55.901 --> 02:19:00.400
People get trapped in this one sort of team mentality and that team is like

2345
02:19:00.401 --> 02:19:03.370
always support big business or we support industry.

2346
02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:05.230
All we support the creation of jobs.

2347
02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:09.730
Those things are wrapped around occasional unfortunate things that happened to

2348
02:19:09.731 --> 02:19:12.700
the environment and Poo Poo,
not a big deal.

2349
02:19:12.701 --> 02:19:15.640
The real big deal was that we created all these different jobs and all these

2350
02:19:15.641 --> 02:19:18.520
liberals want to save the spotted owl and those fucks on an understand about

2351
02:19:18.521 --> 02:19:21.880
logging and you know those,
those kinds of mindsets.

2352
02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:26.800
And a lot of times what's really crazy?
Well,
it's about this spotted person,

2353
02:19:27.090 --> 02:19:31.310
this point,
right?
Well,
it's also the weird thing about those mindsets.

2354
02:19:31.311 --> 02:19:32.960
It's a lot of those people are poor.

2355
02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:37.550
A lot of those conservative folks are poor and it doesn't benefit them at all.

2356
02:19:37.940 --> 02:19:42.050
But they've locked themselves into this sort of a very rigid,

2357
02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:46.880
not a revelation to say that very smartly conservative element that's aligned

2358
02:19:46.881 --> 02:19:51.020
with the 1% and big business found social issues,

2359
02:19:51.021 --> 02:19:54.360
that we're going to be resonant among people who are in rural areas who are
poor,

2360
02:19:54.430 --> 02:19:58.820
right.
Um,
and,
and use those as wedge as to,
to do,

2361
02:19:59.210 --> 02:20:03.710
to make people vote against their own economic and enact wells to gay marriage

2362
02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:06.890
somehow,
or another fracking to gay marriage.

2363
02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:10.900
But what's really exciting and interesting is like I've had,
um,

2364
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:13.490
at our production space in Brooklyn when,

2365
02:20:13.491 --> 02:20:17.770
when there were things to do in New York,
you know,
we had,
um,
uh,

2366
02:20:18.050 --> 02:20:20.730
one of the guys who was running,
um,

2367
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:25.820
New Yorkers against fracking who is HIV positive gay man who was living in the

2368
02:20:25.821 --> 02:20:30.380
house hosting conservative c pack.
You know,

2369
02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:34.970
dudes from central PA living under the same roof,
hanging out,

2370
02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:39.530
starting to talk about these things.
And that was amazing.

2371
02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:42.770
And I wish I had taped that conversation,
you know,

2372
02:20:43.010 --> 02:20:48.010
between the guy with the rainbow flag and the guy with like conservative values

2373
02:20:48.231 --> 02:20:50.520
from Ronald Reagan.
Yeah.
Like,

2374
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:55.520
and it was remarkable to see the change happen,
um,
uh,

2375
02:20:55.521 --> 02:20:59.570
change where these people acknowledged each other and,
and,
uh,

2376
02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:04.370
the openness,
um,
that it created.
And I,
so I think there's hope there.

2377
02:21:04.550 --> 02:21:07.430
I mean that's one of the things I just couldn't believe watching this

2378
02:21:07.431 --> 02:21:08.840
conversation between these two guys,

2379
02:21:08.990 --> 02:21:11.930
have you experienced much personal backlash from this?
I mean,

2380
02:21:11.931 --> 02:21:13.220
if people gone after you,

2381
02:21:13.221 --> 02:21:16.580
is there been like some weird moments where all personal,
it's so weird,

2382
02:21:16.820 --> 02:21:19.820
like you could look at a smear campaign from outside and go,
oh,

2383
02:21:19.821 --> 02:21:24.620
that shouldn't affect you at all.
That's a total,
you know,
but it does get you,

2384
02:21:24.621 --> 02:21:27.770
and especially when,
you know,
when you get really get into it,
you know,
and they,

2385
02:21:27.790 --> 02:21:30.380
they ran ads,
you know,

2386
02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:34.250
in Ohio of me smoking cigarettes,
like at a La,

2387
02:21:34.370 --> 02:21:38.480
I made the movie premiere in 2008,
you know,
I used to smoke,
I quit smoking,

2388
02:21:39.010 --> 02:21:41.690
you know,
and they would do this to run personally and say,
oh look,

2389
02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:45.620
look at this guy.
He's a total hypocrite and everything.
Cause you were smoking.

2390
02:21:46.660 --> 02:21:48.490
What,
how does that make you hypocrite?
Well,

2391
02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:51.560
cause I'm talking to him about carcinogens in the water supply and all of a

2392
02:21:51.561 --> 02:21:52.910
sudden,
you know,
I was smoking and this was,

2393
02:21:53.390 --> 02:21:57.270
this is a picture from 2008 a long time ago.
Um,

2394
02:21:57.440 --> 02:22:02.180
well I think I smoked an hour ago.
No,
not an hour ago.
Um,
you know,
you,
you,

2395
02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:03.350
you quit for 10 years,

2396
02:22:03.351 --> 02:22:05.970
but it would have definitely been off cigarettes for rail antenna.

2397
02:22:06.350 --> 02:22:10.220
So a along the way,
did you realize like,
Hey,

2398
02:22:10.221 --> 02:22:13.430
I can't keep talking about environmental impacts and health impacts when I'm

2399
02:22:13.431 --> 02:22:17.630
poisoning myself?
Sure.
So part of the reason why I quit,
um,

2400
02:22:17.780 --> 02:22:18.770
I think so.
I mean,

2401
02:22:18.771 --> 02:22:22.190
I think you just quit when you feel like you have to grit and that's also had a

2402
02:22:22.191 --> 02:22:25.470
couple of relatives get cancer,
not lung cancer,
but you know,
it did wakes you up.

2403
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:30.450
Um,
I dunno.
I mean,
I don't,
I've never,

2404
02:22:30.451 --> 02:22:34.110
I've not really ever talked about this in,
in,
in,
in,
in any kind of public forum.

2405
02:22:34.510 --> 02:22:37.500
Um,
I mean,
when you're in the theater and you're a filmmaker and you know,
like,

2406
02:22:37.770 --> 02:22:40.440
do you smoke?
I mean,
people smoke.
Um,

2407
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:44.670
I actually started smoking when I was in a play out of the glass menagerie when

2408
02:22:44.671 --> 02:22:45.760
I was 17.
Um,

2409
02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:49.530
I was playing Tom and the glass menagerie and that role calls for you to smoke

2410
02:22:49.531 --> 02:22:53.910
five cigarettes during the performance.
Um,
so that started me,

2411
02:22:54.210 --> 02:22:57.520
but like,
um,
you know,
uh,

2412
02:22:57.690 --> 02:23:01.090
I think that there was a,
I think that there is,
um,

2413
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:06.590
a problem when we stop being human beings and start being like pods of

2414
02:23:08.581 --> 02:23:12.630
information that can't have contradictions.
Right.
The idea that,

2415
02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:14.370
but at the same time,
like it's not something I wanted.

2416
02:23:14.430 --> 02:23:18.480
Like they will use every piece of information they have against you if the Ken

2417
02:23:18.690 --> 02:23:22.830
of course.
Right.
So you don't want to give any fodder for that.
Um,
you know,

2418
02:23:22.831 --> 02:23:27.270
did I quit smoking because I thought it would be pressure?
No,

2419
02:23:27.271 --> 02:23:30.270
I quit because I felt like I wanted to quit.
You know what I mean?

2420
02:23:30.271 --> 02:23:33.690
I felt like I was done with that and it was a problem.
Um,

2421
02:23:35.070 --> 02:23:38.790
but do I think that,
you know,
we're not all,
uh,
I mean you can't be a saint.

2422
02:23:39.730 --> 02:23:43.300
Um,
you know,
but at the same time,
like I think that what the,

2423
02:23:43.470 --> 02:23:47.220
that's maybe a good example of kind of downward pressure.

2424
02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:52.170
Like you've probably,
you may have noticed that during this two hour,

2425
02:23:52.171 --> 02:23:56.340
whatever interview you've cursed,
like 25 times.
And I haven't at all.

2426
02:23:56.700 --> 02:24:01.380
I don't notice that.
Well,
I haven't at all and no,
no,

2427
02:24:02.430 --> 02:24:06.720
no,
I won't because,
because I just think that to a certain degree,
it's,

2428
02:24:06.890 --> 02:24:11.700
it's not respectful to some of the people who are in my audience.
We have one,

2429
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:16.200
we have one curse in gas land and it's worth it and one in gasoline to,

2430
02:24:16.650 --> 02:24:20.240
well,
what,
these are the kinds of things that,
whether or not you want to record,

2431
02:24:20.430 --> 02:24:21.630
you want to recognize it,

2432
02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:25.050
they will either use it against you or you have to realize like what's

2433
02:24:25.051 --> 02:24:28.840
underneath it.
All right.
Um,
do I want to,

2434
02:24:29.130 --> 02:24:32.820
I don't want to do that right now in this role as a person who is working on

2435
02:24:32.821 --> 02:24:37.410
these issues because they will get in the way and it's easy enough to not do

2436
02:24:37.411 --> 02:24:41.210
that.
And then to examine the reasons why you would or wouldn't,
you know,
um,

2437
02:24:41.700 --> 02:24:44.310
it's one of those things that I think,
uh,

2438
02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:49.380
a lot of people really get into that it's hard.

2439
02:24:49.381 --> 02:24:53.580
It's a burden to to put yourself out in public and be exposed in the way that

2440
02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:56.370
you are,
but especially in individual,

2441
02:24:56.650 --> 02:25:00.540
individual with limited financial resources going up against an empire.
I mean,

2442
02:25:00.541 --> 02:25:03.300
that's what you're doing.
You're going up against the oil empire.
Yeah.

2443
02:25:03.370 --> 02:25:08.280
You were a significant bump in the road.
I,
I,
I think it's,

2444
02:25:08.850 --> 02:25:09.930
um,
I,

2445
02:25:09.931 --> 02:25:14.931
the more I like to think of it more as that these films were a vehicle for

2446
02:25:15.091 --> 02:25:17.820
people to start to understand what was happening to each other,
right?

2447
02:25:17.821 --> 02:25:21.590
That's why gas land is in 12 states because it's a comparative study in it.

2448
02:25:21.630 --> 02:25:23.800
I wanted to show people in Pennsylvania,
look,

2449
02:25:23.801 --> 02:25:27.280
this is what's happening in Wyoming.
This is what's happening in Arkansas.

2450
02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:28.990
This is what's happening in Texas.

2451
02:25:29.410 --> 02:25:32.770
And these are people from a broad spectrum of political opinions.

2452
02:25:32.771 --> 02:25:35.050
So they're not all progressive lefty type folks.

2453
02:25:35.290 --> 02:25:38.110
They're not all conservatives either.

2454
02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:40.930
I actually didn't ask most of the people where their politics were,

2455
02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:45.780
but the idea that there's,
um,
this was connective tissue and I,

2456
02:25:45.790 --> 02:25:50.040
I want,
I have to go out and represent that,
you know,
as well as the fact that I,

2457
02:25:50.130 --> 02:25:53.320
I have a dog in this fight.
You know what I mean?
Like I want to win.

2458
02:25:53.321 --> 02:25:57.820
I don't want to see these places that I love destroyed.
Right.

2459
02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.160
Whether those are the places that I live,

2460
02:26:00.190 --> 02:26:04.660
like in Pennsylvania or the places that I've visited that are remarkable and

2461
02:26:04.661 --> 02:26:06.040
that are on the chopping block,
you know,

2462
02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:09.850
and especially because there are places that have been destroyed.

2463
02:26:09.890 --> 02:26:13.290
It's not like these are theoretical ideas that may or may not come to fruition.

2464
02:26:13.310 --> 02:26:14.051
No,
absolutely.

2465
02:26:14.051 --> 02:26:18.340
You can go to North Dakota and you can look at that fucking spot and see those

2466
02:26:18.341 --> 02:26:22.300
poor people.
That sand thing is freaking me the fuck out.
I need to see that.

2467
02:26:22.330 --> 02:26:24.630
And He'd be cds.
There's,
there's a Facebook,

2468
02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:28.990
a sand called oil feel fails.

2469
02:26:29.650 --> 02:26:31.120
I think it's Facebook page.
It's really,

2470
02:26:31.180 --> 02:26:35.350
it's actually more popular than gas and page.
They have like 140,000 followers.

2471
02:26:35.351 --> 02:26:36.700
We have 115,000 followers.

2472
02:26:36.770 --> 02:26:41.770
It's like oil field fails on Facebook has like crazy stuff on it.

2473
02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:47.650
It's like burning explosions,

2474
02:26:48.010 --> 02:26:51.730
directional drilling gone awry where they're shooting fracking fluids out into a

2475
02:26:51.731 --> 02:26:54.400
field,
Halliburton trucks and they make memes out of them.

2476
02:26:54.401 --> 02:26:56.290
It's like a Halliburton truck looked like overturned.

2477
02:26:56.291 --> 02:26:57.910
It says go home Halliburton,

2478
02:26:57.911 --> 02:27:02.710
you're drunk like stuff and it's for comic value among dudes in the oil and gas

2479
02:27:02.711 --> 02:27:07.711
industry and you can just go on there and it's all these blatant really

2480
02:27:08.951 --> 02:27:11.310
dangerous situations.
Human rights abuses,

2481
02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:16.180
people like bathing and chemicals out in the open on Facebook.

2482
02:27:16.190 --> 02:27:19.840
If you found it.
Oilfield fails on Facebook are good.
One is there.

2483
02:27:20.140 --> 02:27:22.210
They did some whole bunch of holiday stuff that's not that fine.

2484
02:27:22.270 --> 02:27:27.070
Oh well there's a lot of like,
you know like,
or look up directional drilling,

2485
02:27:27.071 --> 02:27:31.690
fail and Youtube or whatever.
Um,
yeah,
like you've got it there.

2486
02:27:31.691 --> 02:27:36.680
You've got the,
the,
the,
the podcast.
I mean the,
the Facebook page.
Yeah.

2487
02:27:36.681 --> 02:27:37.540
See there's a broken,

2488
02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:40.030
there's a truck with fallen off the road and another truck was fallen off the

2489
02:27:40.031 --> 02:27:44.200
road and these are just guys that are fucked up.
Yeah.

2490
02:27:44.201 --> 02:27:49.170
And that's where I saw the backend beach or whatever like um,
uh,

2491
02:27:49.210 --> 02:27:51.130
with the dude's like hanging out at the,
at the,

2492
02:27:51.530 --> 02:27:54.190
she's a huge crane that's phone or I mean some of it is funny,

2493
02:27:54.191 --> 02:27:55.150
it's like bloopers.

2494
02:27:55.810 --> 02:28:00.490
But then when you realize that these are people who could be dead because of

2495
02:28:00.491 --> 02:28:04.290
that truck accident or um,
you know,

2496
02:28:04.390 --> 02:28:05.770
imperiled by,

2497
02:28:05.950 --> 02:28:10.360
there's a flare you to see one of the flares and the window of the store where I

2498
02:28:10.361 --> 02:28:14.590
don't understand what's going on in that picture.
Yeah.
Um,
okay,
so you saw the,

2499
02:28:14.770 --> 02:28:18.160
you see that's a reflection in the window of a flare across the street.

2500
02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:22.400
Oh really?
How do you know what's in a store?
It's not in the store.

2501
02:28:22.430 --> 02:28:24.830
It looks like it.
It looks like it's confusing.
Okay.

2502
02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:29.030
So you see that those types of flares are what is our,
what makes that,

2503
02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:33.020
and those things are just burning off this natural gas that they're trying to

2504
02:28:33.021 --> 02:28:36.710
get rid of because it's not what they're looking for.
Right.
And by doing that,

2505
02:28:36.711 --> 02:28:40.100
you're polluting,
I'm sure you fucking burning,
you're burning CO2,

2506
02:28:40.101 --> 02:28:41.600
you're burning unrefined gas,

2507
02:28:42.290 --> 02:28:45.770
which also has a lot of other stuff in it besides just method.
What is that?

2508
02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:49.130
Documentaries,
the overnighters.
Is that what it is?
Yeah,
that's about it.

2509
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:52.460
I haven't seen it yet.
It's about North Dakota.
About the,
the crazy,

2510
02:28:52.820 --> 02:28:55.280
it's really good.
Yeah,
I've heard it's really good as well.
The,
the,

2511
02:28:55.281 --> 02:28:59.480
the just the nutty gas industry and all these crazy colorful characters.

2512
02:28:59.930 --> 02:29:02.570
I used the word colorful very lightly.
I haven't seen it.

2513
02:29:03.230 --> 02:29:06.020
I have not seen supposed to be great,
but listen,
um,

2514
02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:10.550
I think what you're doing is awesome.
Thank you know,
it's uh,
uh,
you know,

2515
02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:13.400
I'll fucking,
people that agree and disagree.

2516
02:29:13.401 --> 02:29:17.690
It's like a very hotly debated subject on my message board and on Twitter page.

2517
02:29:17.691 --> 02:29:21.230
And some people are so fucking angry.
You,
it's,
it's interesting.

2518
02:29:21.231 --> 02:29:24.980
I don't think they're real people.
I think some of those people might be real.

2519
02:29:24.981 --> 02:29:28.190
People have a lot,
a lot of them are real.
A lot of them are trolls,

2520
02:29:28.490 --> 02:29:30.770
but not a lot of them aren't man.
These people that I know,

2521
02:29:30.771 --> 02:29:32.930
these are people that have been on my message board for years.

2522
02:29:32.931 --> 02:29:34.280
Something to talk about,
all sorts of things,

2523
02:29:34.281 --> 02:29:38.840
but they lock on to those conservative ideals was conservative talking pot.

2524
02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:42.200
All I would say is like this is not a progressive or conservative issue.

2525
02:29:42.260 --> 02:29:43.860
This is about science.
Yeah,

2526
02:29:44.060 --> 02:29:49.060
and I would invite those folks who are getting angry at me to go to physicians,

2527
02:29:49.351 --> 02:29:52.660
scientists and engineers website.
Just type it in.
Physicians,

2528
02:29:52.720 --> 02:29:57.720
scientists and engineers for healthy energy at their website are 400 peer

2529
02:29:59.601 --> 02:30:01.220
reviewed scientific papers,

2530
02:30:01.221 --> 02:30:06.221
cross listed by topic on everything that we report on and they back up what we

2531
02:30:07.821 --> 02:30:11.660
report on sub substantively in every case.
Well.

2532
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:16.830
So if you're one of those people who decides that cell phones work by magic or

2533
02:30:17.121 --> 02:30:21.830
your car works because you sprinkle Pixie dust under the hood,
then fine.

2534
02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:24.260
But if you're going to participate in the modern world,

2535
02:30:24.440 --> 02:30:29.440
which you need to do is he'd what science is saying to you and science is saying

2536
02:30:30.021 --> 02:30:31.760
very decisively at this point,

2537
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:35.480
fracking does all the things described in the gas nine films.

2538
02:30:35.540 --> 02:30:39.320
It creates flammable water and creates water contamination.

2539
02:30:39.321 --> 02:30:42.710
It creates chemicals in water,
creates air pollution.
It creates health effects.

2540
02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:46.580
It creates civil unrest.
It creates fractured communities.

2541
02:30:46.790 --> 02:30:51.080
All of these things can be studied from objective scientific standpoint and had

2542
02:30:51.081 --> 02:30:56.081
come out to be proven and true from the standpoint of science and reporting so

2543
02:30:56.751 --> 02:31:00.590
that people are getting mad at me about it.
Look inward.

2544
02:31:01.450 --> 02:31:02.870
No way you're getting mad about,

2545
02:31:03.260 --> 02:31:07.130
you've got to come to the F to grips with the fact that if you're participating

2546
02:31:07.131 --> 02:31:10.610
in this way and you don't believe that this is an object of witchcraft,

2547
02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:14.360
then you must deal with the fact that you're wrong.

2548
02:31:14.690 --> 02:31:17.400
The Twitter page is gas land movie.
Um,

2549
02:31:17.420 --> 02:31:22.420
your website or the Twitter is gasoline movie and the website has gasoline land,

2550
02:31:22.810 --> 02:31:25.740
the movie.com.
I also mentioned our new project,

2551
02:31:25.741 --> 02:31:29.490
which is solutions grassroots.com,
which is the renewable energy,
uh,

2552
02:31:29.790 --> 02:31:33.690
and democracy organizing pub that we're trying for.
Thank you very much,
man.

2553
02:31:33.691 --> 02:31:36.900
Thank you.
It's on really fun.
Josh Fox.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2554
02:31:36.960 --> 02:31:41.340
we'll be back tomorrow with the Great Russell Peters and a until then,

2555
02:31:41.341 --> 02:31:42.840
we'll see you soon.
Thank you.
Much love.
