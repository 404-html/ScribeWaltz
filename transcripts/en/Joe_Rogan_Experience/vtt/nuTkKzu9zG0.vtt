00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.200
<v Speaker 1>He's now basically the ultimate golden snitch.</v>

3
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Now why you say Golden Snitch was golden?</v>

4
00:00:07.331 --> 00:00:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Because he's at another level,</v>

5
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>but he's not a snitch.</v>

6
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.050
<v Speaker 1>He's an investigator.</v>

7
00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>He's not like a garnish evolve.</v>

9
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>A snitch will be Victor Conte.</v>

10
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Victor Conte is a snitch.</v>

11
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>He got content on top,</v>

12
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.950
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't even rat on people when he got caught you.</v>

13
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 1>He can't even call him a snitch.</v>

14
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.200
<v Speaker 1>You call them a postoperative because he used rats where I come from,</v>

15
00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:26.800
<v Speaker 1>but he's.</v>

16
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.071
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

17
00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:27.790
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

18
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker 1>He used to be involved in it.</v>

19
00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:30.620
<v Speaker 1>He's not involved in anymore.</v>

20
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Now he's going after people who are involved with.</v>

21
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.783
<v Speaker 1>So what is that?</v>

22
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>That's like an informer.</v>

23
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.150
<v Speaker 1>But can I ask you a question?</v>

24
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Did they ever actually.</v>

25
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Jamie says yes joe,</v>

26
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.570
<v Speaker 1>to kind of be a snitch because he's really revealing all this backstory like,</v>

27
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I just love this time.</v>

29
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>It's fun because it's really the same thing.</v>

30
00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on with podcasts.</v>

31
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>You guys don't need any sort of account.</v>

32
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>You guys kind of have a company though.</v>

33
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.470
<v Speaker 1>You kind of have fox.</v>

34
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.930
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

35
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>not really because again,</v>

37
00:00:56.951 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 1>they don't tell you what to do.</v>

38
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>They can't try and not where they started,</v>

39
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:02.581
<v Speaker 1>but they can't do it.</v>

40
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:03.910
<v Speaker 1>I've actually been so good.</v>

41
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what this whole,</v>

42
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>they know.</v>

43
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.041
<v Speaker 1>If they're like,</v>

44
00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

45
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.741
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>

46
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:09.941
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

47
00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:11.720
<v Speaker 1>what can I do?</v>

48
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.570
<v Speaker 1>What the thing is like,</v>

49
00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:16.780
<v Speaker 1>you guys have an advantageous position in the relationship.</v>

50
00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a regular show where they could fire you from it.</v>

51
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.470
<v Speaker 1>If they fire you,</v>

53
00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:23.020
<v Speaker 1>you will have zero impact,</v>

54
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>but also it actually helped us because just tell everyone what went down and I</v>

55
00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>will tell all the dirt and I will blast picture.</v>

56
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.173
<v Speaker 1>I'm a snitch.</v>

57
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big skew.</v>

58
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.733
<v Speaker 1>Fucking.</v>

59
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>I've always been a snitch.</v>

60
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm that golden snitch.</v>

61
00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Truth comes out golden</v>

62
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.350
<v Speaker 1>before someone makes a photoshop of you in the salt liberalize outfit.</v>

63
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Says Golden Snitch,</v>

64
00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:49.654
<v Speaker 1>golden snitch.</v>

65
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Somebody made it already.</v>

66
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Jamie made it while working on the show.</v>

67
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.083
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

68
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>We did a lot of direction,</v>

69
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:01.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

70
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.350
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>

71
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I ran into you in New York when you were doing the Chappelle show with</v>

73
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.733
<v Speaker 1>Chappelle.</v>

74
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>The very first episode I would work at the beginning at Dave Chappelle's.</v>

75
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:12.151
<v Speaker 1>Not Crazy.</v>

76
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing that drives me nuts,</v>

77
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 1>because he walked away,</v>

79
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 1>but I saw those people micromanage them and drive him nuts.</v>

80
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>They were so rude.</v>

81
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Now Dave's not crazy.</v>

82
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:21.570
<v Speaker 1>He's a friend of mine.</v>

83
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>

84
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.041
<v Speaker 1>He's a very,</v>

85
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>very brilliant guy.</v>

86
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Very smart and aware.</v>

87
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>And how's the Kahunas to do what you said,</v>

88
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>to quit,</v>

89
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>to walk away from 50 million bucks.</v>

90
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm uncomfortable saying this story,</v>

91
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>but just trying to use.</v>

92
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Cause I know the semantics of the language.</v>

93
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I'll just say what happened.</v>

94
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>People can make whatever,</v>

95
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>but I was.</v>

96
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>I was directing the show and white comedy central executives came down and asked</v>

97
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

98
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.261
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

99
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>can you tell Dave not the same nigger so much?</v>

100
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.053
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

101
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>

102
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.580
<v Speaker 1>the white comedy Central Executive in front of them,</v>

103
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.363
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

104
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.873
<v Speaker 1>So much.</v>

105
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>Dave goes,</v>

106
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.810
<v Speaker 1>bobcat push off.</v>

107
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>What did you say?</v>

108
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>It was really weird and awkward and then they left.</v>

109
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:11.261
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

110
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I intentionally thought,</v>

111
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 1>well this will be embarrassing for them.</v>

112
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly what you told me.</v>

113
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>

114
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Cause because,</v>

115
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

116
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever heard that story,</v>

117
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:19.370
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

118
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm a witness to that insanity.</v>

119
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Just sell it,</v>

120
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>sell it to the American people.</v>

121
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>What is wrong,</v>

122
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.940
<v Speaker 1>what can be fixed and what can Gary Johnson do to fix this?</v>

123
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>I'll make</v>

124
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.320
<v Speaker 2>a pitch for myself and that is,</v>

125
00:03:31.321 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 2>is that I think I really am a unique package.</v>

126
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.441
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

127
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I am fiscally conservative.</v>

128
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.353
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

129
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

130
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm as frugal a human being as you've ever met.</v>

131
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean that I'm cheap.</v>

132
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 2>It just means that I spend my money wisely.</v>

133
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 2>I got to serve as governor of New Mexico for two terms.</v>

134
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

135
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I served as governor of New Mexico for two terms as a Republican in the state</v>

136
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 2>that's two to one democrat.</v>

137
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.730
<v Speaker 2>I got reelected by a bigger margin the second time than the first time made a</v>

138
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 2>name for myself as a real government skeptic vetoing legislation.</v>

139
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 2>I may have vetoed more legislation than the other 49 governors in the country</v>

140
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:11.314
<v Speaker 2>combined.</v>

141
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Coupled with that,</v>

142
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.863
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

143
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm socially tolerant.</v>

144
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm socially liberal.</v>

145
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

146
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 2>you and I should be able to make decisions in our own lives that only affect our</v>

147
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 2>own lives as long as those decisions don't adversely affect others.</v>

148
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 2>And then there is a very real terrorist threat out there.</v>

149
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.460
<v Speaker 2>It exists.</v>

150
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.333
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

151
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.290
<v Speaker 2>but I do believe that our military interventions have resulted in making</v>

152
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 2>situations worse,</v>

153
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:40.211
<v Speaker 2>not better.</v>

154
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a real skeptic when it comes to government and the fact that government</v>

155
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 2>is too big.</v>

156
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.141
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

157
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 2>I've been an entrepreneur my entire life.</v>

158
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 2>I know what it is to hire and fire.</v>

159
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 2>I know what it is to share in the profits.</v>

160
00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 2>And what a magic formula that is,</v>

161
00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:58.960
<v Speaker 2>that when you share in the profits,</v>

162
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 2>amazingly the profit pie grows significantly.</v>

163
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

164
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 2>I've been an athlete my entire life.</v>

165
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Bit of an oxymoron is a 63 year old,</v>

166
00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 2>but what athletics has taught me is,</v>

167
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 2>life is putting one foot in front of the other.</v>

169
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Athletics has taught me that anything that can go wrong will go wrong.</v>

170
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 2>It's how you deal with failure that ultimately determines your success.</v>

171
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.691
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

172
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 2>things go wrong all the time.</v>

173
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 2>You can crawl up on the couch,</v>

174
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 2>you can declare yourself a victim,</v>

175
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 2>you can give up,</v>

176
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 2>or you can recognize that that's just part of life and wake up the next day with</v>

177
00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 2>a smile on your face and continue to move forward and just do your best.</v>

178
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.873
<v Speaker 2>I've told,</v>

179
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 2>I've told the truth.</v>

180
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

181
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really hard to do any damage to somebody who's willing to tell the</v>

182
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:50.530
<v Speaker 2>truth regardless of the consequences.</v>

183
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Speaker 2>And then I admit mistakes.</v>

184
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.700
<v Speaker 2>I think mistakes have a way of.</v>

185
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 2>So compounding themselves just because people don't acknowledge those mistakes.</v>

186
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 2>So given this pitch,</v>

187
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.880
<v Speaker 2>all I want to do is just get in the polls that determines who is in the</v>

188
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 2>presidential debates.</v>

189
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 2>I think that if I'm in the presidential debates,</v>

190
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 2>I have an opportunity of actually winning because of</v>

191
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 2>this package that you've allowed me to present here today ago.</v>

192
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

193
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.520
<v Speaker 1>That's how I act is important.</v>

194
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:25.331
<v Speaker 1>Not what I think.</v>

195
00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:27.130
<v Speaker 1>So tell me to keep my thoughts purist.</v>

196
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.311
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

197
00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:28.810
<v Speaker 1>my thoughts are mine.</v>

198
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.830
<v Speaker 1>They're mine.</v>

199
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.640
<v Speaker 1>I do what I want with them.</v>

200
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.181
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

201
00:06:31.181 --> 00:06:32.130
<v Speaker 1>So if you girlfriend,</v>

202
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking about that big country fucker Lego,</v>

203
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.090
<v Speaker 1>a piece a week coming out of the corner of his mouth,</v>

204
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Nazi Tattoo on the back of his neck.</v>

205
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Just lay in Dick.</v>

206
00:06:42.761 --> 00:06:44.200
<v Speaker 1>God bless her fat Dick.</v>

207
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:45.010
<v Speaker 1>God bless her.</v>

208
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.311
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

209
00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:47.980
<v Speaker 1>She's into like a sailor's forearm.</v>

210
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.210
<v Speaker 1>I am not asking.</v>

211
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.740

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

214
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you have moments like in your relationship where you know you're with each</v>

215
00:06:52.721 --> 00:06:53.770
<v Speaker 1>other for your life?</v>

216

<v Speaker 1>This is a.</v>

217

<v Speaker 1>This is a long time thing.</v>

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we ended yet on music.</v>

219
00:06:57.371 --> 00:06:59.050
<v Speaker 1>There's times when you're all of a sudden,</v>

225
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.040

230

239
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.190
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is you don't ask her why you don't ask what?</v>

240
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.000
<v Speaker 1>What is it like?</v>

241
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.680
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to know these things.</v>

242
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know why she's unhappy.</v>

243
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.223
<v Speaker 1>I want to know.</v>

244
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I just want her to keep her thoughts to herself.</v>

245
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.520
<v Speaker 1>If she's bang some big redneck in a truck stop.</v>

246
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:53.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do.</v>

249
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.660
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to know if she's actually being or thinking about being.</v>

250
00:07:57.661 --> 00:07:58.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know anything.</v>

251
00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.633
<v Speaker 1>You don't want anything.</v>

255
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.550
<v Speaker 1>A good wife and eat my bread.</v>

256
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.600
<v Speaker 1>And how about she cooks something once in a while.</v>

257
00:08:12.601 --> 00:08:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Why my baking bread?</v>

258
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm an old lady.</v>

259
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Why am I running around with flower on my shirt?</v>

260
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.620
<v Speaker 1>She's sitting on the couch.</v>
