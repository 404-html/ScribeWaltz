<v Speaker 1>Trey,</v>

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.081
<v Speaker 1>my day,</v>

3
00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

4
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like one one 35 first opened up.</v>

5
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.190
<v Speaker 1>It was in the UFC.</v>

6
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:08.510
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

7
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.510
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't as many guys that were that elite like even to watch the guys who</v>

8
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>are really good improve.</v>

9
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Like you saw the Cody fight where he was fucking fantastic against Dominick help</v>

10
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>God damn good to teach a look against Linacre completely.</v>

11
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:25.620
<v Speaker 1>No five Linacre nullified them.</v>

12
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.490
<v Speaker 1>We were going to Kurt,</v>

13
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.490
<v Speaker 1>he's like one of the best examples of a guy with absolutely freakish physical</v>

14
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>attributes of fucking iron jaw,</v>

15
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>iron Joe.</v>

16
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>I'd never even seen the guy get hurt.</v>

17
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>He gets hit by everybody,</v>

18
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:38.694
<v Speaker 1>gets head kicked,</v>

19
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.593
<v Speaker 1>he gets punched.</v>

20
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Rob Font said he hit him with the hardest punch.</v>

21
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>He ever hit anybody with his life and he goes,</v>

22
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:44.550
<v Speaker 1>he didn't even acknowledge that he hit him.</v>

23
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>He just walked right forties and he hit him with a body shot.</v>

24
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Felt like he got hit by a car.</v>

25
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 1>He didn't look like this,</v>

26
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>that Linacre.</v>

27
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that same Linacre showed up on Saturday or Friday and teaching all</v>

28
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.391
<v Speaker 1>fight them.</v>

29
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:55.161
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have any days,</v>

30
00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>but [inaudible] was very hesitant and I think it was because of tjs,</v>

31
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>the way he was fighting and with a faints,</v>

32
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>the takedowns,</v>

33
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>the kicks and throwing that that head kick to the body kick.</v>

34
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.690
<v Speaker 1>But he was very tentative.</v>

35
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>

36
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>he got out beat,</v>

37
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>you throw him in the truck,</v>

38
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>almost had them in a cab.</v>

39
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was going to go for the twister and I was like,</v>

40
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.351
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

41
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>if he goes to the twister,</v>

42
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>but he got went to the capsulize it,</v>

43
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

44
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.651
<v Speaker 1>I looked it up.</v>

45
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Like he's not going to tap to that.</v>

46
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just paying a stump.</v>

47
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>He needed a stump down looked amazing.</v>

48
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

49
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>And the timing and those takedowns like lightening bolts.</v>

51
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Like it looks like he's throwing a punch and he's underneath you.</v>

52
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

53
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>it was so nice.</v>

54
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>He's so fast,</v>

55
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

56
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>But God damn Cody Garbrandt what the fuck?</v>

57
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

58
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I'll admit I,</v>

59
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>I said I think code is going to be champ.</v>

60
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Just not just,</v>

61
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>not yet.</v>

62
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna be your champ,</v>

63
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>but he's not ready for dom yet.</v>

64
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.721
<v Speaker 1>No opening round.</v>

65
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

66
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

67
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>He's so busy mimic him.</v>

68
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>He's doing break dancing.</v>

69
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>He's doing push ups and shit.</v>

70
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>He fucked with Dominic's head.</v>

71
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>And that was what one of the things I was thinking,</v>

72
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:53.731
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

73
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>this kid's been in a lot of street fights.</v>

74
00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know if there's trash talk is going to work on him.</v>

75
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.820
<v Speaker 1>The way it works on other guys.</v>

76
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Like he said he was fine in there.</v>

77
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.491
<v Speaker 1>Like I asked him,</v>

78
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:02.911
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

79
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:03.601
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

80
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:03.871
<v Speaker 1>It goes,</v>

81
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:04.704
<v Speaker 1>I feel calm.</v>

82
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.161
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

83
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I know I can stay calm when that's going on.</v>

84
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.360
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

85
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>and I think he's just like this young hungry dude who,</v>

86
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>he took it personal and a lot of guys get real emotional.</v>

87
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>And I was worried that Cody come out super emotional and just get merch like</v>

88
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.171
<v Speaker 1>taken down.</v>

89
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

90
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>the real emotional like,</v>

92
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>all the dude against me,</v>

94
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Gregor,</v>

95
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>we just forget that I was technique and rushes and gets marked.</v>

96
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.251
<v Speaker 1>But dude,</v>

97
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>he just took all that and the best performance.</v>

98
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

99
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>can you name another performance like that where the guy,</v>

100
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.301
<v Speaker 1>he remembered,</v>

101
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>he was even number one contenders,</v>

102
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>five or six in the world.</v>

103
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>He was eight.</v>

104
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Was he a,</v>

105
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I thought I moved to six maybe,</v>

106
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>but that might have been some shenanigans.</v>

107
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Just a who knows the cheeto finger rankings.</v>

108
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

109
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>but still motherfucker went from five,</v>

110
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:47.250
<v Speaker 1>six rank number one.</v>

111
00:02:47.251 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one that's a big stretch.</v>

112
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Handily.</v>

113
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.480
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a dumb one.</v>

114
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>One round.</v>

115
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

116
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>And I love on me one one or I'm Cody dropped him,</v>

117
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.591
<v Speaker 1>hurt him.</v>

118
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:54.741
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

119
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:55.081
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

120
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:57.570
<v Speaker 1>we still don't exactly know where the cut came from.</v>

121
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Some people were saying he came from a punch.</v>

122
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Hear people online say came from a kick.</v>

123
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.491
<v Speaker 1>The Guy,</v>

124
00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:02.150
<v Speaker 1>definitely not.</v>

125
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>But the guys in the trucks that it was ahead by your truck boys were off.</v>

126
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Cause I heard when they said that,</v>

127
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:06.551
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

128
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are they watching?</v>

129
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:07.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

130
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:08.271
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

131
00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>they uh,</v>

132
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.731
<v Speaker 1>pulled it up for me,</v>

133
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.564
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard.</v>

134
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.081
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

135
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>while the fights going on,</v>

136
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.511
<v Speaker 1>they'll do that.</v>

137
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell me it's a head bud and see,</v>

138
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>I have two monitors in front of me.</v>

139
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I have one right here and then have one over the side and they'll say like look</v>

140
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>on monitor be and then they'll show it to me but I can't really,</v>

141
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me to do that while I'm watching the actual fight,</v>

142
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.321
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

143
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>So they'll show it to me and I usually,</v>

144
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I just take their word for it but occasionally it gets too,</v>

145
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.680
<v Speaker 1>but I'm talking in the replay that they showed maybe they saw different and</v>

146
00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:36.480
<v Speaker 1>didn't show the correct one to replay that they showed it was definitely wasn't</v>

147
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>the head but well they definitely did collide heads for sure.</v>

148
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

149
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>And so who knows?</v>

150
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.591
<v Speaker 1>It was hard to tell,</v>

151
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:43.110
<v Speaker 1>but who gives a fuck either.</v>

152
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 1>It was a big ass cut,</v>

153
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>big ass cut on Dom's eyebrow and he got drunk.</v>

154
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>How good is Dominick?</v>

155
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Cruz took a punch too,</v>

156
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 1>but he gets in,</v>

157
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>he gets cracked,</v>

158
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>his legs go stiff.</v>

159
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>He goes down and a couple of times Cody like acted almost like he wasn't going</v>

160
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>to follow him to the ground and beat on him on the ground and almost acted like</v>

161
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:02.284
<v Speaker 1>he was done.</v>

162
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 1>He was like calling him up or like a Mark Hunt kind of walk off Caleb better get</v>

163
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:07.400
<v Speaker 1>on and say did he do,</v>

164
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 1>didn't even make an attempt.</v>

165
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

166
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe he doesn't want to have anything to do with the ground.</v>

167
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Maybe feels like that's where Dominic might have a chance to shush it down</v>

168
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.243
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

169
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what Dominick Cruz wanting to punish him to.</v>

170
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just Dominick Cruz have any submissions.</v>

171
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

172
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Dominick Cruz is really good on the ground.</v>

173
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

174
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.053
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>

175
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean on his record.</v>

176
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:26.651
<v Speaker 1>Does he have any submissions?</v>

177
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

178
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>he has some missions usually from guillotines though back in the day.</v>

179
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Does he see his Jujitsu is really good.</v>

180
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>

181
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.021
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

182
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

183
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.621
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

184
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:33.221
<v Speaker 1>You can't do with them.</v>

185
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 1>He's a black belt for sure.</v>

186
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160
<v Speaker 1>I've seen him compete and introduce the tournaments.</v>

187
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

188
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.243
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

189
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 1>and he wrestled as well.</v>

190
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>He's a wrestler,</v>

191
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 1>but for a guy not to go down in his guard,</v>

192
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>that's some shit.</v>

193
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>That's like some Conor Mcgregor,</v>

194
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:48.311
<v Speaker 1>Dia Shit.</v>

195
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

196
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.691
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

197
00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:49.241
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want,</v>

198
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:49.311
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

199
00:04:49.311 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 1>I can lose two easily down there.</v>

200
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

201
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might not have been that at all.</v>

202
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 1>It might have been even more simple.</v>

203
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a lost Jamie</v>

204
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.983
<v Speaker 1>naked.</v>

205
00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

206
00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>So he's got a rear naked there.</v>

207
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:00.581
<v Speaker 1>He's got,</v>

208
00:05:00.581 --> 00:05:01.740
<v Speaker 1>so he lost to a,</v>

209
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.180
<v Speaker 1>he's got one room naked Joe.</v>

210
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

211
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.331
<v Speaker 1>Well who knows.</v>

212
00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:05.990
<v Speaker 1>So we do.</v>

213
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.341
<v Speaker 1>You still,</v>

214
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what he could do.</v>

215
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 1>But the bottom line was Cody wanted to keep the fight standing.</v>

216
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.490
<v Speaker 1>He just wanted to punish him.</v>

217
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Getting hit him so hard.</v>

218
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 1>It might've thought the fight was over.</v>

219
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

220
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 1>he seemed to be the answer for Dominic.</v>

221
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean at least it worked for Cody.</v>

222
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>

223
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.271
<v Speaker 1>Or was it not?</v>

224
00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm no Stryker that he made Dominic come to him.</v>

225
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>And it's different when,</v>

226
00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

227
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>

228
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.821
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

229
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

230
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.991
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>

231
00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>you got to give credit to his teams.</v>

232
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:30.551
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

233
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Justin Buchholz and those guys had been imitating.</v>

234
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>They fought dom so many times,</v>

235
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:34.670
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

236
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.831
<v Speaker 1>nine.</v>

237
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 1>You can imitate his movements so they can mimic his shit.</v>

238
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 1>So when they're sparring,</v>

239
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 1>they do that,</v>

240
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 1>that fake stuff that like false start.</v>

241
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

242
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 1>cause dom does this thing where he false starts and then he'd start and you</v>

243
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:47.500
<v Speaker 1>never know which one's going to be a kick,</v>

244
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot of like,</v>

245
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.160
<v Speaker 1>like patterns at dom throws up.</v>

246
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.820
<v Speaker 1>So they figured out how to do that and they mimicked and they watched him so</v>

247
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>many times that they can get it down to a,</v>

248
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>and Cody didn't buy into the fates.</v>

249
00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.961
<v Speaker 1>You're just like,</v>

250
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 1>come on if you're going to come on,</v>

251
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>come in within this range.</v>

252
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>And he kept baiting him and [inaudible] and they'd make account.</v>

253
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

254
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line is if his brain's not confused and he just knows that in these</v>

255
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:09.141
<v Speaker 1>exchanges,</v>

256
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Dom's going to be there and he's going to do some,</v>

257
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

258
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>he's got some really unpredictable movement.</v>

259
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Dom does,</v>

260
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 1>but he does like a bunch of things a lot.</v>

261
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 1>And then commit.</v>

262
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:20.800
<v Speaker 1>And so he timed those things and Cottonwood,</v>

264
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 1>some fucking vicious punches,</v>

265
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

266
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

267
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:23.610
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>

268
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.841
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

269
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't,</v>

270
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>you'll like dom fight Talala guys.</v>

271
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:26.331
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

272
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 1>what duff fuck?</v>

273
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like that Chris Ducker,</v>

274
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:29.480
<v Speaker 1>maybe we get to in the face of guy,</v>

275
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.910
<v Speaker 1>which one y'all kicked me and you don't know where it's coming from,</v>

276
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.830
<v Speaker 1>but can you just,</v>

277
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

278
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.000
<v Speaker 1>he just Garbrandt just never bought it.</v>

279
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm just gonna wait for you to commit.</v>

280
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>You can do all that jazz and I'm just going to wait right here.</v>

281
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>It's also a guy's been boxing when he was real young when you were talking about</v>

282
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 1>last night.</v>

283
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

284
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 1>It was eight 32 and two amateur record.</v>

285
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:48.104
<v Speaker 1>You look at that,</v>

286
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>but in the UFC compared to other fighters,</v>

287
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.660
<v Speaker 1>that boxing comes in handy.</v>

288
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

289
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>He was coaching,</v>

290
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

291
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.960
