32
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Please do you know the pc police is </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to take the word bitch out of our</v>

33
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 1>vernacular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the latest one.</v>

34
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Align the new retard W.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't let go.</v>

35
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Retard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you say.</v>

36
00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not a medical term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

37
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.780
<v Speaker 1>it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to retard is to slow down,</v>

38
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 1>is to be behind the curve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be retarded is to be slow.</v>

39
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.090
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with down syndrome </v>
<v Speaker 1>or any diseases I may have to abandon </v>

40
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.540
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for right now,</v>

41
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.810
<v Speaker 1>fucking staying strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staying strong with retard and I'm </v>

42
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.810
<v Speaker 1>staying strong with pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's bad with bitch?</v>

43
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:07.781
<v Speaker 1>it's a derogatory term for females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the Patriarchy to engender </v>

45
00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:09.200
<v Speaker 1>stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

46
00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:11.270
<v Speaker 1>you'd done understand because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>white male.</v>

47
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:13.490
<v Speaker 1>You need to check your privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Kelly,</v>

48
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.460
<v Speaker 1>have you not checked your privilege?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

49
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.320
<v Speaker 1>I saw your tweet about checking your </v>
<v Speaker 1>pedigree,</v>

50
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.990
<v Speaker 1>realized I was thinking about checking </v>
<v Speaker 1>my privilege yesterday.</v>

51
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I didn't though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about it.</v>

52
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:27.640
<v Speaker 1>I thought about the fact that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be.</v>

53
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's a way that people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>silence you.</v>

54
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's essentially what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea behind it has some </v>

55
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>merit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.631
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there are people that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege in life and they need to </v>

57
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.940
<v Speaker 1>understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a valid term when you're </v>

58
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.601
<v Speaker 1>talking about minorities and poor people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people on welfare and people in </v>

59
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:53.960
<v Speaker 1>foreign countries that have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare and they're poor,</v>

60
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>I believe support 100 percent that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it gets used a crutch to silence </v>

61
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:05.131
<v Speaker 1>people and it gets used as a crutch for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who lack the intellectual vigor </v>

62
00:03:05.131 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>to engage in an honest debate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

63
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to check your privilege.</v>

64
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>I love watching videos of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are just really not that bright,</v>

65
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>but they're like getting involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those debates and they have that weapon.</v>

66
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Check your privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's like a fighter that </v>

67
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really know how to box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as an awesome overhand,</v>

68
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:27.061
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That overhand rights in the other boxes </v>

69
00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:31.020
<v Speaker 1>like pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of here with that overhand </v>

70
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.581
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that shit coming a mile </v>

71
00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:32.581
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check your privilege.</v>

72
00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>So not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking argument sucks.</v>

73
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I get it because there are the </v>

74
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.140
<v Speaker 1>people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

75
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live in a colorblind society.</v>

76
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no more risk season.</v>

77
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:47.161
<v Speaker 1>We can all be equal and if you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to argue anything but you are a </v>

78
00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:51.241
<v Speaker 1>reverse racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can see how some of these guys </v>

79
00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:53.491
<v Speaker 1>that are addicts themselves because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are ignoring the fact that there's a </v>

80
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>whole history behind it and when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say we started the race evenly,</v>

81
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well somebody has their shoots.</v>

82
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Things tie together for 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit not.</v>

83
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>And so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

84
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>the reason the way you've been raised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit.</v>

85
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:11.611
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time when you turn 18 to</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is about what happened 200 </v>

86
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>years ago is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

87
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a fine balance there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a website that a twitter handle </v>

88
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't follow them on twitter because I</v>

89
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>don't want them to know that I follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

90
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 1>but what I did is I bookmark them and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to her page all the time.</v>

91
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And her thing is about being child free,</v>

92
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag child free and I mean this </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman's entire fucking twitter feed is </v>

93
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:40.771
<v Speaker 1>all about how happy she is that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a child and it's one of </v>

94
00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:40.970
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>me thinks the does protest too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

96
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you go to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

97
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like is this,</v>

98
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:51.280
<v Speaker 1>your whole existence is like being happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't have a child.</v>

99
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Like this is so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bizarre hang up,</v>

100
00:04:55.031 --> 00:05:00.031
<v Speaker 1>but that bizarreness is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a characteristic of human beings.</v>

101
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Like they can get caught up in a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of different weird ways of thinking and </v>

102
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.841
<v Speaker 1>one of them can be just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>meandering on and on constantly about </v>

103
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:12.310
<v Speaker 1>racial issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

104
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.770
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it works.</v>

105
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.610
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen Al Sharpton's girlfriend?</v>

00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Tawana Brawley case where it was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>false rape accusations.</v>

118
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 1>He was blaming all these white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's again,</v>

<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

123
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>this is a weird thing that happens with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's heads when they lose weight.</v>

124
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.990

<v Speaker 1>their heads get big.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's how sharp sharp to now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost a lot of weight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>one photo over.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She's watching her show mode or less.</v>

146
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.430
<v Speaker 1>That was when my daughter was three was </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the coolest moments ever.</v>

147
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.560
<v Speaker 1>My daughter was three wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skin.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I took their scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skim Skim when?</v>

149
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.180
<v Speaker 1>When one daughter was two and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>one was for.</v>

150
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 1>That's when I started skiing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

151
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:32.270
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's good to just get kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing shit as much as possible.</v>

152
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I'd take them to dance class and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gymnastics and I teach them martial </v>

153
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:42.341
<v Speaker 1>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's good to just get them </v>

154
00:07:42.341 --> 00:07:45.071
<v Speaker 1>used to traveling and doing things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when she was three we are putting </v>

155
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:50.381
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff into her little bag and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a little badge carriers how we </v>

156
00:07:50.381 --> 00:07:53.741
<v Speaker 1>travel and she likes to pull her own bag</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she didn't have her helmet in the </v>

157
00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:58.121
<v Speaker 1>bag and she had everything zipped up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>right when she finished up and I'll buy </v>

158
00:07:58.121 --> 00:07:58.121
<v Speaker 1>my honey didn't put your helmet and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

159
00:07:58.121 --> 00:08:03.060
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something so adorable.</v>

160
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I bought a three year old gone and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife and I would just like,</v>

161
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:13.150
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't do it right.</v>

162
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 1>So what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bid Sees what I.</v>

163
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>The deal that I struck with her was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you do it around me.</v>

164
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That light to wait too.</v>

165
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>But you do not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are places.</v>

166
00:08:23.511 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Where do you do at school?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Around other kids.</v>

167
00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:26.800
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frodo,</v>

168
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.900
<v Speaker 1>fewer teachers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

169
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 1>I told him so one day we were driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>home from school and she let slip up,</v>

170
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:32.790
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

171
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>she does shit and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is she looked at me?</v>

172
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:36.920
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry,</v>

173
00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

174
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I just say here and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

175
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.810
<v Speaker 1>that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she sees that she had to go ahead</v>

176
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:45.600
<v Speaker 1>and so she liked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just kind of got.</v>

177
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

178
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
<v Speaker 1>it's tricky because it's a totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable for adults in normal </v>

179
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.970
<v Speaker 1>rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

180
00:08:56.971 --> 00:09:01.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not in certain circles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that whole thing.</v>

181
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:06.321
<v Speaker 1>The whole censorship in language thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is such a bizarre aspect of being a </v>

182
00:09:06.321 --> 00:09:10.491
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These forbidden words that we use that </v>

183
00:09:10.491 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 1>essentially are interchangeable with </v>
<v Speaker 1>words that are okay.</v>

184
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Like what drives me crazy is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone goes fricken fricken guy with </v>

185
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.240
<v Speaker 1>his fricking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I hated nuts.</v>

186
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of bizarre corporate world we </v>

187
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.761
<v Speaker 1>live with Applebee's existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we floating through here fricken </v>

188
00:09:25.761 --> 00:09:25.761
<v Speaker 1>night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I should be nuts.</v>

189
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird and it's why.</v>

190
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:30.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't Overdo,</v>

191
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight can check it out,</v>

192
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.240
<v Speaker 1>but I don't try to censor myself around </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in anything you do in anything </v>

193
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 1>that I do is kind of like dc is how I </v>
<v Speaker 1>am,</v>

194
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

195
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:44.470
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm now going to out of my way to make </v>

196
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.470
<v Speaker 1>it extra weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm like,</v>

197
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.430
<v Speaker 1>oh I am is I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like talking to kids.</v>

198
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Not exactly like they are adults because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do today aren't right.</v>

199
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:55.610
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not treating them like they are fucking </v>

200
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.011
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you just studied them like a </v>

201
00:09:58.011 --> 00:09:58.011
<v Speaker 1>Google God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff all day long.</v>

202
00:09:58.011 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You'll give them Canadian too.</v>

204
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you work with them like that from the</v>

205
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:09.201
<v Speaker 1>get go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will surprise you with time and </v>

206
00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:09.201
<v Speaker 1>time again with the stuff that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say back to you.</v>

207
00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt.</v>

208
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:14.961
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people I still to this day remember </v>

209
00:10:14.961 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 1>people treated me like I was more on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to me stupid.</v>

210
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember thinking why?</v>

211
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.010
<v Speaker 1>When I have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never talking to them like that,</v>

212
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.960
<v Speaker 1>so I talked to my kids like they're my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

213
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:27.020
<v Speaker 1>like I'm very sweet to them and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice and very understanding if they're </v>

214
00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:28.920
<v Speaker 1>crying about something that doesn't make</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sense,</v>

215
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:31.410
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I explain something to them,</v>

216
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:34.860
<v Speaker 1>I explained it to them like an adult and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know their heads only that big,</v>

217
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:40.250
<v Speaker 1>so it can't possibly be smartest man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smart man.</v>

218
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.830
<v Speaker 1>They are my six year old can read now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

219
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Which is interesting because I had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shirt on the other day that said nine </v>

220
00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:48.980
<v Speaker 1>fucking oranges because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

221
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I had this a bit in my act is based on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>true story where,</v>

222
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:53.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my,</v>

223
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:57.510
<v Speaker 1>a power cut off in my house because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't pay my bill.</v>

224
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.460
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was young I was very responsible.</v>

225
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.130
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't pay my bill.</v>

226
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.050
<v Speaker 1>And so the guy came by and turn the </v>
<v Speaker 1>power on.</v>

227
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.240
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after we turned the power on and go,</v>

228
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:11.241
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had an orange tree in this yard of </v>

229
00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:11.241
<v Speaker 1>this House I was renting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

230
00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:12.090
<v Speaker 1>if you want to grab one of those </v>

<v Speaker 1>talked about it on stage.</v>

240
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.010
<v Speaker 1>And it's really true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a true story.</v>

241
00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:46.011
<v Speaker 1>And so this dude gave me this tee shirt </v>
<v Speaker 1>at one of my shows that just said nine </v>

242

244
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.580
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

245
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.850
<v Speaker 1>I worked for one of the shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one podcast I worked for.</v>

246
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.030
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Bad word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad word.</v>

256
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:24.220

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:48.150

<v Speaker 1>but it's nice when I said that wasn't </v>

265
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Brian Count when I got back from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

266
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.740
<v Speaker 1>So that one was before hunting or 58 </v>
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>

267
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

268
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did two,</v>

269
00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.990
<v Speaker 1>two podcasts in row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One before and one after hunting.</v>

270
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:04.290
<v Speaker 1>We went up to this island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prince of Wales in the middle of Alaska.</v>

271
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Terrible trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The well,</v>

272
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.680
<v Speaker 1>it was beautiful though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was beautiful.</v>

273
00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 1>It was a great trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just unsuccessful hunting trip,</v>

274
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:16.380
<v Speaker 1>but there was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was great about it was when I came </v>

275
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.720
<v Speaker 1>back home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciated civilization.</v>

276
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really.</v>

277
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.370
<v Speaker 1>We slept in a tent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was wet.</v>

278
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Everything was wet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sleeping bag was wet.</v>

279
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:23.980
<v Speaker 1>It was just.</v>

280
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.260
<v Speaker 1>It was miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 40 degrees.</v>

281
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Just poured every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so much humidity that like inside</v>

282
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:32.350
<v Speaker 1>the tent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I would turn.</v>

283
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I had this little miner's light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything like a forehead light.</v>

284
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:41.490
<v Speaker 1>I turned it on and you'd see the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>tent was filled with little floating </v>

285
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.030
<v Speaker 1>beads of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just that much humidity in there.</v>

286
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 1>When did you guys go with the first week</v>
<v Speaker 1>of October?</v>

287
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.400
<v Speaker 1>It was too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

288
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:49.480
<v Speaker 1>it's late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

289
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:54.510
<v Speaker 1>It was too late for the area that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were hunting in because the deer had </v>

290
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 1>already moved down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were at the top where the water is,</v>

291
00:13:54.881 --> 00:13:56.920
<v Speaker 1>where the lakes are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the deer had already moved down.</v>

292
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.620
<v Speaker 1>There's water up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lakes that have no fish,</v>

293
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.860
<v Speaker 1>giant lakes that are lakes that are only</v>
<v Speaker 1>there because of rainwater.</v>

294
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giant lakes of rainwater and he drank it</v>

295
00:14:05.651 --> 00:14:06.580
<v Speaker 1>because there is no beavers.</v>

296
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.430
<v Speaker 1>He just dip your thing right in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

297
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:13.000
<v Speaker 1>We drink right out of the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful in itself is beautiful.</v>

298
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing in that sense.</v>

299
00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I was prepared for diarrhea </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>

300
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I bet that it never came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were saying if you get Giardia,</v>

301
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:25.290
<v Speaker 1>like you wouldn't get Giardia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giardia comes from animal poop and the </v>

302
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.280
<v Speaker 1>only way you would get that as if there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a beaver up there,</v>

303
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:31.930
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could like run into a bear and bear </v>

304
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:32.200
<v Speaker 1>could have pooped in there because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bear poop in your mouth.</v>

305
00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be.</v>

306
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see how it sinks would be more </v>

307
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:38.700
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

308
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.701
<v Speaker 1>But it's such an enormous lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The odds of you getting any substantial </v>

309
00:14:41.701 --> 00:14:41.701
<v Speaker 1>amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

310
00:14:41.701 --> 00:14:46.500
<v Speaker 1>the reality is unfortunately we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly getting fecal matter and </v>

311
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.540
<v Speaker 1>stuff in your body and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a person who only eats </v>

312
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.201
<v Speaker 1>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that one of the best ways that </v>

313
00:14:55.201 --> 00:14:57.641
<v Speaker 1>vegans get vitamin B 12 is from bugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they inadvertently eat that are on </v>

314
00:14:58.581 --> 00:14:59.210
<v Speaker 1>their food.</v>

315
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of hilarious that the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day I handed out this glass of wine to </v>

316
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:09.671
<v Speaker 1>this lovely lady and she grabbed it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes about this secret and she </v>

317
00:15:09.671 --> 00:15:09.950
<v Speaker 1>looked and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

318
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:15.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a bag inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she handed it back to him and I </v>

319
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.291
<v Speaker 1>think I was already buzzed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then after that I look at it and was </v>

320
00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:17.291
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just shrug my shoulder.</v>

321
00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm down the bug into wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was tasty.</v>

322
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bugs don't taste nearly as bad as people</v>

323
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:23.960
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do take it from me.</v>

324
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.070
<v Speaker 1>From my days at fear factor I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've eaten quite a few bugs.</v>

325
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 1>It's more in your head?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

326

<v Speaker 1>I mean I wouldn't go for like nasty.</v>

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.860
<v Speaker 1>there's so much of a need for </v>
<v Speaker 1>cockroaches that there is someone who </v>

347
00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:20.860
<v Speaker 1>raises them for television that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>never heard before.</v>

348
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that seed that is take the ride </v>

349
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:25.940
<v Speaker 1>and they would have millions of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

350
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.070
<v Speaker 1>These guys that have cockroaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was around them so often it just </v>

351
00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:31.400
<v Speaker 1>became nothing.</v>

352
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've watched people eat them and you</v>

353
00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:35.510
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was.</v>

354
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was um,</v>

355
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:42.400
<v Speaker 1>one of the girls from a soap opera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a celebrity fear factor and </v>

356
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.031
<v Speaker 1>I made her a deal that if she ate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she ate one of the cockroaches to move </v>

357
00:16:46.031 --> 00:16:50.171
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would eat a cockroach and she </v>

358
00:16:50.171 --> 00:16:50.270
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't even eat a cockroach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She ate a worm instead.</v>

359
00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I would rather eat a roach than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>worm.</v>

360
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:58.020
<v Speaker 1>But even from my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see a boardroom I think is filled with </v>

361
00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:58.020
<v Speaker 1>dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

362
00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the dirt.</v>

363
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:04.180
<v Speaker 1>But then again it could approach is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly a rap being himself day and </v>

364
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.070
<v Speaker 1>night and taking showers is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

365
00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:07.900
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

366
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.490
<v Speaker 1>it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no taste at all.</v>

367
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Very mild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just exploded in my mouth and I crunched</v>

368
00:17:14.091 --> 00:17:15.650
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a very mild.</v>

369
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Like if I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was starving,</v>

370
00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:22.370
<v Speaker 1>I would eat a bowl of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

371
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 1>If they're starving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that are too many things.</v>

372
00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:29.960
<v Speaker 1>That one doesn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you a gag a little just because</v>

373
00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:33.530
<v Speaker 1>it just feels gross in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reality of like the actual flavor of it.</v>

374
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not too bad.</v>

375
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

376
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.160
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

377
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:45.070
<v Speaker 1>People are saying that in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that bugs are becoming like a </v>

378
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.890
<v Speaker 1>viable form of protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

379
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.980
<v Speaker 1>They say it's really clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protein is less fattening than most </v>

380
00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:50.980
<v Speaker 1>other types of proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

381
00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.070
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can get over the disease grows </v>

382
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.070
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be actually good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

383
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.580
<v Speaker 3>probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just less fat.</v>

384
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much fat is in a bug?</v>

385
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine next to nothing super </v>

386
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:03.680
<v Speaker 3>lean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

387
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:03.680
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

388
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.090
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they even have like cricket,</v>

389
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.660
<v Speaker 3>like snacks that you can buy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like hiking places.</v>

390
00:18:09.661 --> 00:18:11.880
<v Speaker 3>The SELAC please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cricket bars.</v>

391
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:17.150
<v Speaker 3>I've done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't a sound coming out of her </v>

392
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.150
<v Speaker 3>ears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ear Buds.</v>

393
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:24.400
<v Speaker 3>I was wondering what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought maybe someone was outside </v>

394
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:24.720
<v Speaker 3>cranking music of these things fell off </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I need to just.</v>

395
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You come to listen to the other one.</v>

396
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.290
<v Speaker 3>I'll just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of days went up.</v>

397
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.120
<v Speaker 3>She's so adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all right,</v>

398
00:18:30.121 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

399
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:34.620
<v Speaker 3>I had that before with a friend of mine </v>
<v Speaker 3>was from Wahaca,</v>

400
00:18:34.621 --> 00:18:36.990
<v Speaker 3>Mexico and so one of their traditional </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

401
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:40.620
<v Speaker 3>they will have this entire plates field </v>
<v Speaker 3>with crickets and you know,</v>

402
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 3>he didn't grow up where you grew up out </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

403
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His parents are all into that stuff.</v>

404
00:18:44.881 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 3>So one day he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to try after try he order a seat.</v>

405
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:51.420
<v Speaker 3>That is what huck and restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he just looked at it and I could see</v>

406
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:53.540
<v Speaker 3>he's about to throw up like any cycled </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

407
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.660
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just like,</v>

408
00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.440
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that bad and I have to say </v>

409
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.170
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can eat them,</v>

410
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:06.171
<v Speaker 3>but I can think of about 10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>572 things that are better than that are</v>

411
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.020
<v Speaker 3>not the tastiest in the world and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at you,</v>

412
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:15.620
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are not that tidy so they have </v>

413
00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:15.620
<v Speaker 3>their eyes so that you can clearly see </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

414
00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm crunching on some creek.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A tie right now is it?</v>

415
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.230
<v Speaker 3>But why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that gross?</v>

416
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.060
<v Speaker 3>But like a lobster is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

417
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are some stuff that I agree</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you some seeing sir.</v>

418
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:30.830
<v Speaker 3>It's thought that social conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>season you just broke up with the idea </v>

419
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.730
<v Speaker 3>that that's normal and that it's normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but otherwise it's not.</v>

420
00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:35.400
<v Speaker 3>It's just as we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does a bunch of other stuff.</v>

421
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I mean essentially like crabs </v>

422
00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.531
<v Speaker 3>and lobsters and crustaceans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really like bugs are bugs that </v>

423
00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:46.191
<v Speaker 3>just live in the ocean or water bugs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>lobster or one of the few things that I </v>

424
00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:51.291
<v Speaker 3>can't quite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the whole thing of boiling them </v>

425
00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:51.580
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That freaks me out really.</v>

426
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other stuff,</v>

427
00:19:52.801 --> 00:19:54.120
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no problem.</v>

428
00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you second the hunting thing,</v>

429
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:56.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go out,</v>

430
00:19:56.701 --> 00:19:59.700
<v Speaker 3>you hand and anamolies footy as a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and you killed them.</v>

431
00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:01.920
<v Speaker 3>You eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally make perfect sense to me.</v>

432
00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Boiling alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something actually involving torture to </v>

433
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.210
<v Speaker 3>make sure that you get to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I can't eat something else.</v>

434
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.320
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can eat and again,</v>

435
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:15.410
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have to be a vet I can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no problem with the whole eating </v>

436
00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.880
<v Speaker 3>meat thing or writing or any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the pain of pirates.</v>

437
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.170
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

438
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:20.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it makes you feel better,</v>

439
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:24.060
<v Speaker 3>they say that lobsters lack the nerve </v>
<v Speaker 3>endings to feel pain.</v>

440
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:24.870
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

441
00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:29.871
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will they also regenerate limbs and </v>

442
00:20:29.871 --> 00:20:29.871
<v Speaker 3>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lobster loses a leg.</v>

443
00:20:29.871 --> 00:20:32.610
<v Speaker 3>It just grows rack in that case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're on the lobster.</v>

444
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.650
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you really wanted it humanely,</v>

445
00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:39.651
<v Speaker 3>eat lobster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just hack their arms off and they </v>

446
00:20:39.651 --> 00:20:42.171
<v Speaker 3>just keep letting them grow their arms </v>
<v Speaker 3>back clause.</v>

447
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.580
<v Speaker 3>You could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would work.</v>

448
00:20:44.581 --> 00:20:46.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how long it would take to </v>
<v Speaker 3>regenerate a claw,</v>

449
00:20:46.891 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they regenerate</v>

450
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.250
<v Speaker 1>the same way like crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they regenerate as well?</v>

451
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Some lizards do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

452
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:58.681
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my maternal grandfather was in by the </v>

453
00:20:58.681 --> 00:21:00.340
<v Speaker 1>seaside and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hardly ever see him.</v>

454
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 1>So it was kind of a new thing and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>already weird enough.</v>

455
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.380
<v Speaker 1>And when they um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thirsty,</v>

456
00:21:05.381 --> 00:21:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I wake up in the middle of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the fridge,</v>

457
00:21:07.331 --> 00:21:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I opened the fridge and he's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant lobster,</v>

458
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:14.911
<v Speaker 1>jump out of the features,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start running away because I was like,</v>

459
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.880
<v Speaker 1>what the hell out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weird thing about lobsters is they,</v>

460
00:21:21.241 --> 00:21:26.241
<v Speaker 1>they live in the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can ship them in a box and they </v>

461
00:21:26.241 --> 00:21:28.510
<v Speaker 1>don't even have to be in water and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to you,</v>

462
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:32.350
<v Speaker 1>like from Maine and they're all live </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday in Vegas.</v>

463
00:21:32.351 --> 00:21:35.230
<v Speaker 1>They have lobster shipped in from Maine </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the restaurants.</v>

464
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Just like how the hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how the,</v>

465
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.860
<v Speaker 1>what are these things like they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even have to breathe.</v>

466
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I know like how many days can they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>without breathing?</v>

467
00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.570
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's freaky is definitely fakey.</v>

468
00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freak as it comes.</v>

469
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:56.240
<v Speaker 1>She needs some sort of a television show</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this to work television show right </v>

470
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:56.240
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not watching.</v>

471
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more interesting to interrupt.</v>

472
00:21:58.781 --> 00:21:59.950
<v Speaker 1>We should have worked this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

473
00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:04.951
<v Speaker 1>I would've brought my kids over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you could have a little party and </v>

474
00:22:04.951 --> 00:22:07.500
<v Speaker 1>we just heard yelling and fucking play </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been wild and crazy over </v>

475
00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:08.920
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

476
00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:11.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it feels,</v>

477
00:22:11.051 --> 00:22:16.051
<v Speaker 1>but the one thing I do know is when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw a lobster in the water and the </v>

478
00:22:16.051 --> 00:22:16.051
<v Speaker 1>water boils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried to get out.</v>

479
00:22:16.051 --> 00:22:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not buying it.</v>

480
00:22:17.411 --> 00:22:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy it either.</v>

481
00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.570
<v Speaker 1>It sounded a little weird to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The convenient thing that people say,</v>

482
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.620
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

483
00:22:23.621 --> 00:22:25.360
<v Speaker 1>they don't feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like it.</v>

484
00:22:25.361 --> 00:22:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a sonar to them.</v>

485
00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:31.981
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have these pleasant sawn </v>

486
00:22:31.981 --> 00:22:34.390
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden the day die </v>
<v Speaker 1>peacefully and go to lobster heaven and </v>

487
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.280
<v Speaker 1>all is good to hear music and they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>expire.</v>

488
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:41.370
<v Speaker 1>They want to go to their dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relative lobster was been in your Paul </v>

489
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.920
<v Speaker 1>to before and they are uniting lobster </v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven and all is well and a well.</v>

490
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:49.010
<v Speaker 1>One thing that is interesting about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>prey animals like deer and antelope and </v>

491
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:53.551
<v Speaker 1>stuff is that they believe now that like</v>
<v Speaker 1>when an antelope gets captured but like </v>

492
00:22:53.551 --> 00:22:57.310
<v Speaker 1>a lion or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when the lion bites down on it that</v>

493
00:22:57.311 --> 00:23:00.460
<v Speaker 1>it's brain floods with chemicals and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost sort of gives up,</v>

494
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:05.770
<v Speaker 1>like it kicks a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just sort of gives up and it </v>

495
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:08.821
<v Speaker 1>doesn't fight like ses if lack of a lion</v>
<v Speaker 1>captured like a Predator,</v>

496
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:14.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other Predator like a leopard or </v>

497
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.350
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would fight for their rights.</v>

498
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.830
<v Speaker 1>They would go crazy and make screaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>noises and everything.</v>

499
00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.890
<v Speaker 1>But antelopes just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

500
00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.970
<v Speaker 1>this is just my place in the world to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pray.</v>

501
00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I got cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>

502
00:23:23.231 --> 00:23:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll check it out next to life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see soon.</v>

503
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Come back as a draft or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your take on that kind of stuff?</v>

504
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you actually send my believing </v>

505
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:35.880
<v Speaker 1>reincarnation w what's your take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

506
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't not believe in it because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the idea of life itself is so </v>

507
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.590
<v Speaker 1>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we have a soul,</v>

508
00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:44.740
<v Speaker 1>that we have consciousness that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see through our,</v>

509
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.530
<v Speaker 1>that we navigate with sound and feel and</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>

510
00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:49.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

511
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:50.300
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

512
00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:54.320
<v Speaker 1>so bizarre that reincarnation is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the question.</v>

513
00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

514
00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there is such a thing as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a soul.</v>

515
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what this life is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

516
00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Like there's this life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this a finite experience where you,</v>

517
00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:13.281
<v Speaker 1>you're born and then you die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or are you drifting in and out of </v>

518
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:16.820
<v Speaker 1>parallel experiences every time you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sleep and wake up.</v>

519
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you on the same timeline constantly </v>

520
00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:25.360
<v Speaker 1>when you wake up and you have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory of your existence in this life </v>

521
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:25.360
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

522
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.400
<v Speaker 1>are you sure that that's exactly how </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything goes?</v>

523
00:24:27.401 --> 00:24:29.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because all the people in your life</v>

524
00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:31.760
<v Speaker 1>seemed to think that that's everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how everything goes.</v>

525
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:36.970
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that you didn't go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed last night with a totally different </v>

526
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.691
<v Speaker 1>existence and wake up with a memory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this life that you're living right now </v>

527
00:24:40.691 --> 00:24:42.050
<v Speaker 1>just completely embedded in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know.</v>

528
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.080
<v Speaker 4>That's negative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fame.</v>

529
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.090
<v Speaker 4>Moza,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Schwan's when the butterfly,</v>

530
00:24:45.091 --> 00:24:46.210
<v Speaker 4>right to the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

531
00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways to sage,</v>

532
00:24:48.121 --> 00:24:48.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twan.</v>

533
00:24:48.401 --> 00:24:49.930
<v Speaker 4>So it was all like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

534
00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.640
<v Speaker 4>they asked him about these many say I </v>
<v Speaker 4>had this dream that I was a butterfly,</v>

535
00:24:53.641 --> 00:24:55.580
<v Speaker 4>but now I'm puzzled because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember anymore.</v>

536
00:24:55.590 --> 00:25:00.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I'm really transformed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was dreaming that I was about their </v>

537
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.770
<v Speaker 4>flight or if I'm actually a butterfly </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is the butterflies dream,</v>

538
00:25:01.771 --> 00:25:03.560
<v Speaker 4>thinking that she's trans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

539
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:07.440
<v Speaker 4>And that's the paradox off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll never fucking know.</v>

540
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:13.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a really intense dream once that </v>

541
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.251
<v Speaker 1>was so realistic that to this day it </v>
<v Speaker 1>haunts me because I was some sort of an </v>

542
00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:22.891
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a wolf or something along those </v>

543
00:25:22.891 --> 00:25:24.430
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were sneaking up on this deer and</v>

544
00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.020
<v Speaker 1>the deer herd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a branch snap or a leaf move.</v>

545
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.940
<v Speaker 1>And I could smell fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember smelling fear,</v>

546
00:25:33.941 --> 00:25:38.941
<v Speaker 1>like smelling the tingling in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal's body as it was thinking about </v>

547
00:25:38.941 --> 00:25:40.420
<v Speaker 1>bolting as it was wondering whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not it heard anything.</v>

548
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:45.600
<v Speaker 1>And I also remember smelling water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could smell the water that was </v>

549
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:45.600
<v Speaker 1>dripping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I woke up.</v>

550
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

551
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Because I remember there was other </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar animals near me,</v>

552
00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:57.090
<v Speaker 1>some wolf like animals near me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were like communicating without </v>

553
00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:00.040
<v Speaker 1>words in some sort of strange primitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

554
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.650
<v Speaker 1>It was a very short dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I woke up.</v>

555
00:26:02.651 --> 00:26:03.580
<v Speaker 1>But I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

556
00:26:03.581 --> 00:26:08.581
<v Speaker 1>that was an intensely realistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience because I didn't feel like </v>

557
00:26:08.581 --> 00:26:10.210
<v Speaker 1>while it was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't like,</v>

558
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.700
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a person that thinks it's a wolf.</v>

559
00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.610
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like I was in this.</v>

560
00:26:14.611 --> 00:26:18.700
<v Speaker 1>This animal's mind of course could </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily be imagination.</v>

561
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

562
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.230
<v Speaker 4>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's some of those dreams.</v>

563
00:26:21.231 --> 00:26:23.450
<v Speaker 4>I know exactly what you mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some of the things that are weird,</v>

564
00:26:23.451 --> 00:26:26.780
<v Speaker 4>there's a staff that I know what I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced.</v>

565
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.480
<v Speaker 4>And then sometimes there's something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that clicks seen that he's like,</v>

566
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:34.690
<v Speaker 4>this is not part of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what I'm feeling right now is </v>

567
00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.490
<v Speaker 4>way beyond the range of my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not part of the game.</v>

568
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.570
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I find.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find it creepy,</v>

569
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:45.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find it really interesting like you </v>

570
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.250
<v Speaker 4>ever seen the legends of the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I really liked the movie.</v>

571
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:50.850
<v Speaker 4>I could only watch it with at one time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I could never watch it again because</v>

572
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:53.430
<v Speaker 4>he freaked the hell out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was one scene where,</v>

573
00:26:53.431 --> 00:26:58.431
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you guys are gonna Watch legends of </v>

574
00:26:58.431 --> 00:26:59.250
<v Speaker 4>the fall and you plan to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>skip the next main articles.</v>

575
00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:03.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to give spot from spoiler from</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years ago.</v>

576
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.670
<v Speaker 4>Not exactly big spoiler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's that scene where,</v>

577
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:13.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brett's but brother get killed in one </v>

578
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.710
<v Speaker 4>word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

579
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.330
<v Speaker 4>he goes berserk and he kind of goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>behind enemy lines and he,</v>

580
00:27:15.331 --> 00:27:16.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>end the next CEO,</v>

581
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.760
<v Speaker 4>sees you seek coming back into camp and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's covered in blood.</v>

582
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.880
<v Speaker 4>He has a German scalps all over him and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's walking through the camp and </v>

583
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.220
<v Speaker 4>everybody's opening up to let him go </v>
<v Speaker 4>through nobody's saying award.</v>

584
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:35.320
<v Speaker 4>There's the sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's the sense about him that </v>

585
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.201
<v Speaker 4>he's kind of larger than life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has done this crazy thing of going </v>

586
00:27:38.201 --> 00:27:39.030
<v Speaker 4>single handedly again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing probably 10,</v>

587
00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.650
<v Speaker 4>15 guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something insane,</v>

588
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.550
<v Speaker 4>and yet there's this sense of extreme </v>
<v Speaker 4>sadness.</v>

589
00:27:44.551 --> 00:27:49.551
<v Speaker 4>Like all that power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that warrior ability doesn't give </v>

590
00:27:49.551 --> 00:27:51.360
<v Speaker 4>him what he truly needs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which he still got back his loved ones.</v>

591
00:27:51.361 --> 00:27:56.361
<v Speaker 4>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that combination of extreme larger </v>

592
00:27:56.361 --> 00:27:59.150
<v Speaker 4>than life power and torque tragedy that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do,</v>

593
00:27:59.151 --> 00:28:01.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that hold that power doesn't really help</v>

594
00:28:01.021 --> 00:28:01.200
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

595
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:07.100
<v Speaker 4>When I saw that scene,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was so familiar in a way that it's </v>

596
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:07.100
<v Speaker 4>not mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

597
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.910
<v Speaker 4>it's no out my life up until that point </v>
<v Speaker 4>that been.</v>

598
00:28:09.911 --> 00:28:12.990
<v Speaker 4>He had no parallel whatsoever in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

599
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.290
<v Speaker 4>And he wasn't like any other movie where</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see something and he's like,</v>

600
00:28:16.291 --> 00:28:21.291
<v Speaker 4>oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can kind of relate to that on some </v>

601
00:28:21.291 --> 00:28:21.291
<v Speaker 4>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any heat me like,</v>

602
00:28:21.291 --> 00:28:25.790
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that feeling so damn well and </v>

603
00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:27.060
<v Speaker 4>that I think about it like where do I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know that feeling,</v>

604
00:28:27.061 --> 00:28:32.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years ago or whenever I saw legends </v>

605
00:28:32.061 --> 00:28:32.061
<v Speaker 4>of the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

606
00:28:32.061 --> 00:28:32.490
<v Speaker 4>and there's nothing in my life to mirror</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

607
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.600
<v Speaker 4>Not even a tiny bit.</v>

608
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.710
<v Speaker 1>The imagination is such a wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible thing.</v>

609
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:42.770
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so impossible to really understand </v>

610
00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:47.010
<v Speaker 1>the boundaries of the imagination and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can imagine memories.</v>

611
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been moments where people have </v>

612
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.960
<v Speaker 1>been talked into remembering things by </v>
<v Speaker 1>like through experiments,</v>

613
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.950
<v Speaker 1>like through with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone would counsel them and give</v>

614
00:28:58.951 --> 00:29:03.951
<v Speaker 1>them a memory of the past and then coach</v>
<v Speaker 1>them through this memory and then time </v>

615
00:29:04.261 --> 00:29:06.540
<v Speaker 1>will go on and they'll think that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a real memory.</v>

616
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean?</v>

617
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:15.140
<v Speaker 1>The imagination itself is such a bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of being a human being.</v>

618
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.290
<v Speaker 1>The ability to like this wolf thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had in my mind essentially that was my</v>

619
00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:20.490
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

620
00:29:20.491 --> 00:29:25.491
<v Speaker 1>the only other option is what is it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppressed memory from my genetics from </v>

621
00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.600
<v Speaker 1>a long time ago when I was some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an animal,</v>

622
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:35.630
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea of evolution is </v>

623
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.781
<v Speaker 1>essentially that human beings in 2014 </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the result of millions of years of </v>

624
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.730
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of natural selection,</v>

625
00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:47.731
<v Speaker 1>of all these different slow processes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have led us to being this thing </v>

626
00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:49.090
<v Speaker 1>that we are today.</v>

627
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:54.600
<v Speaker 1>But this thing has a direct link to </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck survived from that </v>

628
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Speaker 1>gigantic asteroid that hit the Yucatan </v>
<v Speaker 1>and was what?</v>

629
00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Some in one and a half miles deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like slammed.</v>

630
00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:08.320
<v Speaker 1>The thing was like five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five miles deep into the earth within </v>

631
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:08.380
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second and a half.</v>

632
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Killed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything larger than,</v>

633
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.400
<v Speaker 1>you know me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Mckenna used the term a chicken.</v>

634
00:30:15.401 --> 00:30:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Everything larger than a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just like as a point of reference and</v>

635
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.350
<v Speaker 1>just weird little mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rat things survived.</v>

636
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.170
<v Speaker 1>So somehow or another from 65 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

637
00:30:26.171 --> 00:30:30.470
<v Speaker 1>those weird little rat things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>survived became CEO,</v>

638
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:30.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

639
00:30:30.881 --> 00:30:35.881
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold the my mouse around us as </v>

640
00:30:35.881 --> 00:30:35.881
<v Speaker 1>inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

641
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:36.860
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

642
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.230
<v Speaker 1>but there's no direct chain to any </v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves.</v>

643
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:46.650
<v Speaker 1>There's no direct chain to any mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the lower hominids were even the </v>

644
00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:48.420
<v Speaker 1>ones that ate meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

645
00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.870
<v Speaker 1>There weren't on all four.</v>

646
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:50.890
<v Speaker 1>They weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no.</v>

647
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I have no past with wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

648
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.380
<v Speaker 1>So if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is that thing?</v>

649
00:30:56.381 --> 00:31:01.381
<v Speaker 1>Is that just total imagination?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it just the psychedelic chemicals </v>

650
00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:02.350
<v Speaker 1>that flood your brain during heavy rem </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep?</v>

651
00:31:02.351 --> 00:31:07.351
<v Speaker 1>Just creating a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful image for you to try to </v>

652
00:31:07.351 --> 00:31:12.030
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize and wrap your head around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or are you drifting in and out of </v>

653
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.070
<v Speaker 1>realities?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you mean,</v>

654
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:16.110
<v Speaker 1>are you a monkey one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

655
00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:19.160
<v Speaker 1>and then you go to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up and you've done all,</v>

656
00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.790
<v Speaker 1>you have your life and everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>

657
00:31:21.791 --> 00:31:23.980
<v Speaker 1>But were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you a monkey yesterday?</v>

658
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Probably some would argue that a monkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

659
00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:33.760
<v Speaker 1>while everybody argues that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's obviously one of those </v>

660
00:31:34.001 --> 00:31:39.001
<v Speaker 1>stoner conversations that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you know anything about </v>

661
00:31:39.001 --> 00:31:41.110
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're saying.</v>

662
00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those,</v>

663
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.380
<v Speaker 1>those conversations are so common.</v>

664
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that,</v>

665
00:31:46.431 --> 00:31:49.020
<v Speaker 1>you know when you go to bed and you wake</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and more than the youth,</v>

666
00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Speaker 1>same person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know.</v>

667
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:55.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's the weird thing about going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bed is that everyone wants to do it.</v>

668
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wants to sleep and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>scared to die.</v>

669
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wants to shut off temporarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one wants to shut off </v>

670
00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:04.050
<v Speaker 1>permanently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Yep.</v>

671
00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very odd existence because you know,</v>

672
00:32:07.391 --> 00:32:09.880
<v Speaker 1>if there were any guarantees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if throughly people,</v>

673
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:14.970
<v Speaker 1>that's why I don't really buy a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the religious people think they say I </v>

674
00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.290
<v Speaker 1>believe in an afterlife isn't that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're really dgl,</v>

675
00:32:17.291 --> 00:32:21.610
<v Speaker 1>it'd be way more relaxed about a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in life because you wouldn't have</v>

676
00:32:21.611 --> 00:32:22.580
<v Speaker 1>that fear of that is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

677
00:32:22.581 --> 00:32:24.720
<v Speaker 1>do I have to be afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to be afraid of it.</v>

678
00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:25.750
<v Speaker 1>It would be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

679
00:32:25.751 --> 00:32:26.410
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

680
00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:28.240
<v Speaker 1>I do my thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I check out,</v>

681
00:32:28.241 --> 00:32:30.220
<v Speaker 1>I check out and I go to this other cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

682
00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Evidencing is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to fear the Fed,</v>

683
00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:38.251
<v Speaker 1>that people are obviously not thrilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the notion of dine makes me think </v>

684
00:32:38.251 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 1>that they don't believe it half as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they actually do it.</v>

685
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief systems are very strange.</v>

686
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.400
<v Speaker 1>It can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can really seem in your mind to be </v>

687
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.681
<v Speaker 1>absolutely real and you will explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>these beliefs to someone else and they </v>

688
00:32:51.681 --> 00:32:56.181
<v Speaker 1>will tell you that you're an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was on a set once I was doing </v>

689
00:32:56.181 --> 00:32:59.991
<v Speaker 1>this thing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to this girl and her </v>

690
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:00.360
<v Speaker 1>sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem totally normal.</v>

691
00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:05.810
<v Speaker 1>And then the girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what we were talking </v>

692
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.470
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had something to do with gay people.</v>

693
00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:12.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something like about gay marriage</v>

694
00:33:12.421 --> 00:33:17.421
<v Speaker 1>or gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about how the woman </v>

695
00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:17.740
<v Speaker 1>was saying that it's a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

696
00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:22.820
<v Speaker 1>And I thought she was joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really thought she was joking because </v>

697
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:22.820
<v Speaker 1>it was a set like intelligence such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

698
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a sin,</v>

699
00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

700
00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:30.410
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I realized she was serious and </v>

701
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

702
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:34.220
<v Speaker 1>so you think that God created people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are gay and then he did it like as </v>

703
00:33:34.351 --> 00:33:35.310
<v Speaker 1>a goof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a trick.</v>

704
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

705
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.880
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

706
00:33:38.881 --> 00:33:40.050
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand.</v>

707
00:33:40.051 --> 00:33:43.530
<v Speaker 1>She said that this the devil scales of </v>
<v Speaker 1>covering your eyes.</v>

708
00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

709
00:33:44.911 --> 00:33:49.590
<v Speaker 1>the devil scales are covering my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget that term.</v>

710
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the devil scales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know the devil Ed scale.</v>

711
00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:55.810
<v Speaker 1>That's when it's starting to run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

712
00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

713
00:33:56.181 --> 00:33:56.520
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

714
00:33:56.521 --> 00:33:58.590
<v Speaker 1>she was friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was just,</v>

715
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:00.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

716
00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:01.110
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

717
00:34:01.111 --> 00:34:04.890
<v Speaker 1>There was this girl and her sister and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl,</v>

718
00:34:04.891 --> 00:34:08.310
<v Speaker 1>the one that I was originally talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem totally normal,</v>

719
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:11.380
<v Speaker 1>but her sister was just out to Liz </v>
<v Speaker 1>launch.</v>

720
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the devil scales are covering</v>

721
00:34:16.981 --> 00:34:20.460
<v Speaker 1>your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just about gay people.</v>

722
00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:23.050
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

723
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's quite pretty key right there.</v>

724
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:30.430
<v Speaker 1>You admitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like people pick and choose </v>

725
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.430
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

726
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I know this dude who is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious,</v>

727
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:32.610
<v Speaker 1>but he has religious tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like motherfucker,</v>

728
00:34:32.611 --> 00:34:35.270
<v Speaker 1>you gotta read the whole Bible are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to text.</v>

729
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I could have read all of it and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to tattoo yourself.</v>

730
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:43.790
<v Speaker 4>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact to me is like when people say </v>

731
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.620
<v Speaker 4>either they are pro or against anyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>really John seely because it's like when</v>

732
00:34:45.621 --> 00:34:48.830
<v Speaker 4>somebody tells me they are Christiano or</v>
<v Speaker 4>Muslim or Buddhist or whatever,</v>

733
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:51.890
<v Speaker 4>that maybe he's not telling me anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>really because as you say,</v>

734
00:34:51.891 --> 00:34:54.500
<v Speaker 4>people pick and choose what they want </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of that.</v>

735
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.040
<v Speaker 4>So one guy's way of being Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Subtly awesome.</v>

736
00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:03.110
<v Speaker 4>There are going to be super nice people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and their belief system elps them being </v>

737
00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:03.110
<v Speaker 4>nicer people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

738
00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:07.990
<v Speaker 4>The next guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the our way of being Christian because </v>

739
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.691
<v Speaker 4>they pick and choose the crappiest part </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the Bible is scary as hell and </v>

740
00:35:10.691 --> 00:35:14.861
<v Speaker 4>their way of being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christian is around 40 or life and also </v>

741
00:35:14.861 --> 00:35:14.861
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the label itself.</v>

742
00:35:14.861 --> 00:35:19.631
<v Speaker 4>I'm not interested in an argument about </v>
<v Speaker 4>whether one religion is good or bad </v>

743
00:35:19.631 --> 00:35:23.560
<v Speaker 4>because the reality is that every one of</v>
<v Speaker 4>them you're going to find at least some </v>

744
00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.890
<v Speaker 4>good part in some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot more than in others,</v>

745
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:26.570
<v Speaker 4>but you're gonna find at least a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>

746
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:31.600
<v Speaker 4>That's good in just about scene and </v>
<v Speaker 4>usually I find also tons of crap I'm </v>

747
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.071
<v Speaker 4>interested in which pirates will peak </v>
<v Speaker 4>and allow those parts inform your </v>

748
00:35:36.071 --> 00:35:36.630
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do,</v>

749
00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.280
<v Speaker 4>how do you behave based</v>

750
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.830
<v Speaker 3>on your beliefs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the interest me.</v>

751
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like like the idea of drugs,</v>

752
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.250
<v Speaker 3>like all drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just drugs.</v>

753
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:48.420
<v Speaker 3>The idea is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

754
00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:53.421
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a religious person or I'm a </v>

755
00:35:53.421 --> 00:35:53.421
<v Speaker 3>Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

756
00:35:53.421 --> 00:35:53.421
<v Speaker 3>Fred Phelps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phelps was the Christian.</v>

757
00:35:53.421 --> 00:35:58.101
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's like rupert sheldrake </v>

758
00:35:58.101 --> 00:35:58.101
<v Speaker 3>is also a Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This very,</v>

759
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:03.230
<v Speaker 3>very different ideologies at work here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're both calling themselves </v>

760
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:06.150
<v Speaker 3>Christian and Fred Phelps is just as </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil mean creepy old fuck.</v>

761
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:11.151
<v Speaker 3>That eventually died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is rotted in his own filth and fucking </v>

762
00:36:11.151 --> 00:36:11.640
<v Speaker 3>anger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

763
00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:13.490
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why to me,</v>

764
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:18.530
<v Speaker 3>even the whole antireligious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the watson thing gets through romantic </v>

765
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.130
<v Speaker 3>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

766
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.140
<v Speaker 3>can stay on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

767
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.500
<v Speaker 3>Terrible Muslims are all evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

768
00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:28.960
<v Speaker 3>do you really think every single one out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of millions of people who belong to the </v>

769
00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.520
<v Speaker 3>sinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are all bad people,</v>

770
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.210
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's,</v>

771
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:36.250
<v Speaker 3>there's the nice lady will pick the </v>
<v Speaker 3>parts that are all about being nice to </v>

772
00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:39.411
<v Speaker 3>your neighbor and charity or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's or way of being Christian or </v>

773
00:36:39.411 --> 00:36:43.431
<v Speaker 3>Muslim or Buddhist or whatever the hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is and he's awesome and there's </v>

774
00:36:43.431 --> 00:36:46.731
<v Speaker 3>nothing wrong with deep and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually pleasant and I'm sure we'd </v>

775
00:36:46.731 --> 00:36:46.731
<v Speaker 3>actually helps our life.</v>

776
00:36:46.731 --> 00:36:47.310
<v Speaker 3>Either beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

777
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.100
<v Speaker 3>those are scary and anybody going by </v>
<v Speaker 3>those beliefs.</v>

778
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:55.340
<v Speaker 3>Then you see it in action and is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>helping an old lady cross the street is </v>

779
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.930
<v Speaker 3>chopping people set off because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't believe the same thing you do.</v>

780
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.020
<v Speaker 3>That's where you get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the freaky part,</v>

781
00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:03.780
<v Speaker 3>but I don't even care what it's people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

782
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.900
<v Speaker 3>always Saturday about which one is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>one who does all this shit.</v>

783
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:10.320
<v Speaker 3>It's not even just 30 days alone because</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look a communist,</v>

784
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:11.960
<v Speaker 3>dictatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nazis,</v>

785
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.790
<v Speaker 3>they've all done anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The name of it,</v>

786
00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.240
<v Speaker 3>it's totalitarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

787
00:37:15.241 --> 00:37:20.241
<v Speaker 3>It's that idea of everybody needs to </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave according to my way of life and </v>

788
00:37:20.241 --> 00:37:24.100
<v Speaker 3>anybody who doesn't need to be squashed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the scary thing that I got really</v>

789
00:37:24.101 --> 00:37:29.101
<v Speaker 3>self,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which a label is attached to it </v>

790
00:37:29.101 --> 00:37:29.510
<v Speaker 3>regardless of which set of clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the site aware.</v>

791
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:30.480
<v Speaker 3>He's the same shit.</v>

792
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ideologies or they're problematic </v>

793
00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.160
<v Speaker 3>because when you feel like you force </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself into like a framework,</v>

794
00:37:38.161 --> 00:37:43.161
<v Speaker 3>you force yourself into a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything that's outside of that </v>

795
00:37:43.161 --> 00:37:45.861
<v Speaker 3>framework is like automatically not to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be considered and when you have like </v>

796
00:37:45.861 --> 00:37:50.280
<v Speaker 3>rigid thinking anytime you ever really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except like rigid thinking like,</v>

797
00:37:50.281 --> 00:37:52.500
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't rob people.</v>

798
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:54.240
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't go around stealing.</v>

799
00:37:54.241 --> 00:37:56.400
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't around go around stabbing </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

800
00:37:56.401 --> 00:38:01.401
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's rigid things that in a sense </v>

801
00:38:01.401 --> 00:38:04.551
<v Speaker 3>that like a pretty clear cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense because they're causing </v>

802
00:38:04.551 --> 00:38:04.830
<v Speaker 3>harm and there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also,</v>

803
00:38:04.831 --> 00:38:09.831
<v Speaker 3>there's ideologies that are just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get locked into them and you're </v>

804
00:38:09.831 --> 00:38:12.951
<v Speaker 3>forced to think that way because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people that will tell you that this</v>

805
00:38:13.021 --> 00:38:17.490
<v Speaker 3>religion is correct because this </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion is the truth and now they'll,</v>

806
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.490
<v Speaker 3>they'll force themselves to like be </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuck in that little box.</v>

807
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:25.510
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you don't want to admit that you </v>

808
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.980
<v Speaker 3>ever fucked up and lived 20 years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life believing in some nonsense so </v>

809
00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:29.820
<v Speaker 3>then you're stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're stuck in this little box and that</v>

810
00:38:29.821 --> 00:38:33.510
<v Speaker 3>could be atheism just as much as it can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be Christianity,</v>

811
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.530
<v Speaker 3>because I've met a lot of atheists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

812
00:38:35.531 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're</v>

813
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:41.190
<v Speaker 1>in a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to read the religion </v>

814
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.230
<v Speaker 1>called atheism and they like want you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>proclaim.</v>

815
00:38:41.231 --> 00:38:46.231
<v Speaker 1>You're an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know this dude that's an atheist </v>

816
00:38:46.231 --> 00:38:46.790
<v Speaker 1>and he gets upset if I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

817
00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:52.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that to me is the most honest </v>

818
00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.960
<v Speaker 1>thing you can say is on a about a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>about stuff of the universities.</v>

819
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because that's the reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

820
00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.700
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't had any really extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences either.</v>

821
00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:02.200
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

822
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:07.150
<v Speaker 1>he's very smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his ideas are like only based on his</v>

823
00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:12.151
<v Speaker 1>own personal experiences and what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned and what he's red and he's a </v>

824
00:39:12.151 --> 00:39:12.850
<v Speaker 1>very smart person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very aware of religion,</v>

825
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.880
<v Speaker 1>but he's like so adamant about </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclaiming there is no god and I'm </v>

826
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:18.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look dude,</v>

827
00:39:18.761 --> 00:39:23.761
<v Speaker 1>I have seen things on mushrooms that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>way crazier than an old man with a book </v>

828
00:39:23.761 --> 00:39:28.440
<v Speaker 1>check in your name and the cloud and </v>
<v Speaker 1>leading you to pearly gates and there's </v>

829
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.741
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people with wings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some shit that's way crazier </v>

830
00:39:31.741 --> 00:39:32.110
<v Speaker 1>than that so that I don't think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

831
00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:34.200
<v Speaker 1>but there's no evidence whatsoever in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

832
00:39:34.201 --> 00:39:35.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my estimation that that's,</v>

833
00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:41.010
<v Speaker 1>that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that there might be some </v>

834
00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:44.580
<v Speaker 1>universal consciousness that we want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe as a god and it's just not this</v>

835
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:49.801
<v Speaker 1>old man in the clouds wearing robes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just something maybe even beyond </v>

836
00:39:49.801 --> 00:39:53.620
<v Speaker 1>the realm of humanity beyond the realm </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the possibility of us understanding.</v>

837
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any evidence for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not.</v>

838
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:59.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm not throwing it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

839
00:39:59.541 --> 00:40:00.050
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

840
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:05.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if somebody and get some crappy </v>

841
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:05.050
<v Speaker 4>fairytale that subs really poorly at </v>
<v Speaker 4>Eaton and his bad screenwriting,</v>

842
00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.610
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't take a genius to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

843
00:40:06.611 --> 00:40:08.500
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just bullshit and I can see it.</v>

844
00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:13.740
<v Speaker 4>But if you define God in some other way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the hell do you know that,</v>

845
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you're a drag,</v>

846
00:40:15.571 --> 00:40:18.370
<v Speaker 4>just the most scholarly type of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fairytale,</v>

847
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.280
<v Speaker 4>everything else is up for grabs because </v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody really knows.</v>

848
00:40:21.281 --> 00:40:26.281
<v Speaker 4>I mean universities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why to me it's kind of hard to </v>

849
00:40:26.281 --> 00:40:28.981
<v Speaker 4>have the discussions about religions </v>
<v Speaker 4>even like the books ever written about </v>

850
00:40:28.981 --> 00:40:31.981
<v Speaker 4>religion because usually people don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>like organized religion is because they </v>

851
00:40:32.561 --> 00:40:34.770
<v Speaker 4>are big fans of um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

852
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:39.840
<v Speaker 4>kind of a hardcore materialist worldview</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's all about what you can see </v>

853
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:44.731
<v Speaker 4>and touch and nothing else exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then you write a book that pleases </v>

854
00:40:44.731 --> 00:40:45.820
<v Speaker 4>those guys and doesn't play the </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious folks.</v>

855
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.500
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You still have an audience.</v>

856
00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:49.990
<v Speaker 4>But if you argue for something more sub </v>
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>

857
00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:52.840
<v Speaker 4>if you argue for sensing that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically not dogmatic,</v>

858
00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:57.280
<v Speaker 4>either religiously dogmatic or in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hardcore materialistic form,</v>

859
00:40:57.281 --> 00:40:59.920
<v Speaker 4>dogmatic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're shit out of luck in terms of</v>

860
00:40:59.921 --> 00:41:00.670
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And audience,</v>

861
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:05.671
<v Speaker 4>because you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no niche that you jumping to </v>

862
00:41:05.671 --> 00:41:05.671
<v Speaker 4>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

863
00:41:05.671 --> 00:41:07.450
<v Speaker 4>It's not just one simple,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

864
00:41:07.451 --> 00:41:10.870
<v Speaker 4>there's those guys that are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>right behind you.</v>

865
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:16.300
<v Speaker 4>You're asking people to be aware on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment by moment basis so they'd urgent </v>

866
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.650
<v Speaker 4>just seemingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

867
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.950
<v Speaker 4>binding to a dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spouting the ideology,</v>

868
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:22.960
<v Speaker 4>spouting the disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we believe one,</v>

869
00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:27.961
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and three year asking people to leave </v>

870
00:41:27.961 --> 00:41:29.800
<v Speaker 4>life without relying on a damn recipe </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you apply at every little thing you</v>

871
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:33.790
<v Speaker 4>run into when instead you to use their </v>
<v Speaker 4>notes to use their eyes.</v>

872
00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.740
<v Speaker 4>The situation right now I'm able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

873
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 4>in this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do what he's saying.</v>

874
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.290
<v Speaker 4>In his other case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same thing that work two minutes ago</v>

875
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:44.510
<v Speaker 4>is not appropriate and it's not the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right thing to do.</v>

876
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.830
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like in fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

877
00:41:45.831 --> 00:41:48.590
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's a rhythm to things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a timing to things.</v>

878
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:53.510
<v Speaker 4>And going with that plan as a rigid </v>
<v Speaker 4>plan,</v>

879
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:55.730
<v Speaker 4>going in with a plan is great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but going with that are easy to plan.</v>

880
00:41:55.731 --> 00:42:00.731
<v Speaker 4>They are not going to change it </v>
<v Speaker 4>regardless of what's in front of you is </v>

881
00:42:00.731 --> 00:42:00.731
<v Speaker 4>the recipe for death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

882
00:42:00.731 --> 00:42:00.731
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ask her up.</v>

883
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:05.740
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would the life in general bna </v>

884
00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.540
<v Speaker 4>different region to the applying the </v>
<v Speaker 4>scheme to everything that comes your </v>

885
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:08.540
<v Speaker 4>way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

886
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:10.370
<v Speaker 4>to me real talent is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

887
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 4>is mainly mobile to judge things.</v>

888
00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.720
<v Speaker 1>I can hear them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately the,</v>

889
00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:17.240
<v Speaker 1>her little ear buds are picking up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

890
00:42:17.241 --> 00:42:18.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

891
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.740
<v Speaker 1>the microphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

892
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:23.270
<v Speaker 1>let's try it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure you don't want to watch TV?</v>

893
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:29.470
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kids watch tv every chance they get </v>

894
00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:30.830
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want to watch tv so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can always go.</v>

895
00:42:30.831 --> 00:42:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to watch them to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a book that up?</v>

896
00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the greatest thing ever for </v>

897
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:40.560
<v Speaker 1>travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

898
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.440
<v Speaker 1>for travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put on one of those things behind </v>

899
00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:44.440
<v Speaker 1>the headset and people will go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

900
00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.330
<v Speaker 1>why do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not have your kids like,</v>

901
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.950
<v Speaker 1>have a conversation with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking for that session.</v>

902
00:42:50.951 --> 00:42:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Only last so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

903
00:42:52.461 --> 00:42:57.461
<v Speaker 1>It's just like educational cartoons now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cartoons like teach them how to spell </v>

904
00:42:57.461 --> 00:43:01.250
<v Speaker 1>and teach them and they can sing along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it and learn phrases and words.</v>

905
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you have you ever heard of.</v>

906
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Well there's atheism obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a thing called atheism plus.</v>

907
00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of new towels?</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Religion.</v>

908
00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:15.690
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's atheism plus a set of moral </v>

909
00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:16.800
<v Speaker 1>guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call it de.</v>

910
00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.920
<v Speaker 1>This is what I call it because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all be a good person,</v>

911
00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:24.490
<v Speaker 1>but I just think that's De,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

912
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:29.500
<v Speaker 1>and maybe like when it comes to things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like racism and these sort of </v>

913
00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:34.061
<v Speaker 1>discussions or homophobia or any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of discussion about inequality </v>

914
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:40.460
<v Speaker 1>or treating people in a very negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>way because of something that they can't</v>

915
00:43:40.461 --> 00:43:44.810
<v Speaker 1>control their sexual orientation or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way the skin they have,</v>

916
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.030
<v Speaker 1>what color they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what part of the world they're from.</v>

917
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I think anybody who's a good person sees</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in 2014 recognizes.</v>

918
00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:55.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucked up way to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these people,</v>

919
00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.520
<v Speaker 1>this atheism plus thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have like atheism.</v>

920
00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:01.250
<v Speaker 1>So they're all saying there's no god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's No God,</v>

921
00:44:01.251 --> 00:44:05.330
<v Speaker 1>there's No God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we want a set of moral guidelines to</v>

922
00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:10.331
<v Speaker 1>live our lives by no sexual harassment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sexual harassment and feminist </v>

923
00:44:10.331 --> 00:44:14.830
<v Speaker 1>issues are big aspect of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly a lot of like really weak </v>

924
00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:19.091
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>placating to a lot of like angry women </v>

925
00:44:19.091 --> 00:44:22.060
<v Speaker 1>and they formed this group were they all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of get together and they have </v>

926
00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.590
<v Speaker 1>conferences and they just die each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>to death.</v>

927
00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:27.340
<v Speaker 1>They say Dah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all the same shit.</v>

928
00:44:27.341 --> 00:44:29.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's all shit that you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>already know,</v>

929
00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 1>like don't be racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't sexually</v>

930
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.800
<v Speaker 3>harass women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely don't rape.</v>

931
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.540
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

932
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.800
<v Speaker 3>don't murder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Duh.</v>

933
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:38.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

934
00:44:38.401 --> 00:44:40.020
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

935
00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.480
<v Speaker 3>well how many times can we talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

936
00:44:41.481 --> 00:44:42.690
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get a certain point.</v>

937
00:44:42.691 --> 00:44:47.691
<v Speaker 3>I've watched a bunch of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>conferences online and it's hilarious </v>

938
00:44:47.691 --> 00:44:51.150
<v Speaker 3>because it's so fucking pedantic at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of [inaudible] you get beaten to </v>

939
00:44:51.631 --> 00:44:55.530
<v Speaker 3>death by what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you should already know this.</v>

940
00:44:55.531 --> 00:44:56.910
<v Speaker 3>Everyone should know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

941
00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:02.120
<v Speaker 3>this is silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that depends on what </v>

942
00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:02.120
<v Speaker 3>audience you're speaking to because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

943
00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.450
<v Speaker 3>for anybody was as same id,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sane human being shrewd.</v>

944
00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:09.530
<v Speaker 3>I've learned these by the time and our </v>
<v Speaker 3>five and it's like don and overweight </v>

945
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:12.550
<v Speaker 3>that are we still talking about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then of course there are a bunch of </v>

946
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:12.780
<v Speaker 3>people that are not exactly same id </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying you won beings.</v>

947
00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.330
<v Speaker 3>So maybe for those guys he's a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>message.</v>

948
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.830
<v Speaker 3>But I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like to me,</v>

949
00:45:16.831 --> 00:45:20.910
<v Speaker 3>my thing is like I use these diamond </v>
<v Speaker 3>time again in podcasts and writing.</v>

950
00:45:20.911 --> 00:45:25.911
<v Speaker 3>I always write the whole idea that rules</v>
<v Speaker 3>are for people who are too stupid to </v>

951
00:45:25.911 --> 00:45:28.710
<v Speaker 3>leave without the rules because you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are smart you don't need them.</v>

952
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:33.740
<v Speaker 3>But it was because you know how to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right call in every situation and </v>

953
00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:34.560
<v Speaker 3>you don't need anybody telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

954
00:45:34.561 --> 00:45:35.640
<v Speaker 3>don't rape anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

955
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't need you to tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>

956
00:45:37.561 --> 00:45:39.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in the situation,</v>

957
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:40.470
<v Speaker 3>I need the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The next.</v>

958
00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:41.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not gonna apply.</v>

959
00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:46.551
<v Speaker 3>That's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's gonna be the exception to that </v>

960
00:45:46.551 --> 00:45:46.830
<v Speaker 3>role either seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be exceptions,</v>

961
00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 3>but steel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have the intelligence to</v>

962
00:45:49.351 --> 00:45:54.351
<v Speaker 3>be able to make the right call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's Ui or somebody was coming to Mug </v>

963
00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:54.351
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

00:45:56.101 --> 00:45:58.920
<v Speaker 3>You are somebody who is disagreeing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>me punching in the face.</v>

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:00.750
<v Speaker 3>You're crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's appropriate or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

969
00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:07.340
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are able to make the right call that</v>

970
00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:08.010
<v Speaker 3>Ben's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

971
00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:13.250
<v Speaker 3>and that's where he's freaking amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can carry on a conversation </v>

972
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.830
<v Speaker 3>with her squirming crawling on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not working nearly as well as we</v>

973
00:46:16.831 --> 00:46:19.070
<v Speaker 3>were hoping it was going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a whole thing.</v>

974
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:24.080
<v Speaker 3>She was going to watch the television or</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch their little video or being,</v>

975
00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:27.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheaply.</v>

976
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:29.670
<v Speaker 3>Apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No worries man.</v>

977
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.380
<v Speaker 3>I honestly thought that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

978
00:46:31.381 --> 00:46:33.230
<v Speaker 3>I also had higher hopes than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

979
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:34.950
<v Speaker 3>than these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then again,</v>

980
00:46:34.951 --> 00:46:37.270
<v Speaker 3>she's five painful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

981
00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.430
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

982
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:42.540
<v Speaker 3>they are what they are five sometime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

983
00:46:42.541 --> 00:46:44.820
<v Speaker 3>she surprised me because she'll do </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that I'm like,</v>

984
00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:45.220
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

985
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:50.330
<v Speaker 3>How the hell it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I had this conversation with 30 </v>

986
00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:50.330
<v Speaker 3>other day where she's telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

987
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:55.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm so sensitive because every </v>

988
00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:55.820
<v Speaker 3>little thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

989
00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.670
<v Speaker 3>I feel every scene too much when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy,</v>

990
00:46:56.671 --> 00:46:59.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm really happy when I'm sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really sad and I'm like,</v>

991
00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.610
<v Speaker 3>you have five already were having this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation and then she goes,</v>

992
00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:04.500
<v Speaker 3>even one step forward or she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what?</v>

993
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.160
<v Speaker 3>It's okay because at least when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy I'm really super happy.</v>

994
00:47:08.161 --> 00:47:12.090
<v Speaker 3>So I'll take the pain of when I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 3>sad thinking,</v>

995
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:13.770
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are you again?</v>

996
00:47:13.771 --> 00:47:15.030
<v Speaker 3>Let's try this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

997
00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:20.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get in those conversational when I'm </v>

998
00:47:20.031 --> 00:47:20.031
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

999
00:47:20.031 --> 00:47:21.540
<v Speaker 3>you are way bigger than five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can take you to do this and that.</v>

1000
00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:22.410
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1001
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:25.410
<v Speaker 3>she's a five-year-old curve that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>limits to the game.</v>

1002
00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:30.590
<v Speaker 3>But well there's this understanding that</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes with being a human being and </v>

1003
00:47:30.761 --> 00:47:31.750
<v Speaker 3>that's what she's got.</v>

1004
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.450
<v Speaker 3>She's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a human being with,</v>

1005
00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:35.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am I,</v>

1006
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.640
<v Speaker 3>what is it 100 months on the planet or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

1007
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:43.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's lead me to not even imagine </v>

1008
00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:49.170
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure the world out with 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>months of experience and I mean a year </v>

1009
00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:50.890
<v Speaker 3>of school or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's I possible,</v>

1010
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:56.310
<v Speaker 3>but you do have that little human brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you're also juggling around </v>

1011
00:47:56.310 --> 00:48:00.511
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this collection of words that you've </v>

1012
00:48:00.511 --> 00:48:02.800
<v Speaker 3>acquired and so you're trying to express</v>
<v Speaker 3>these ideas and thoughts and feelings.</v>

1013
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:08.790
<v Speaker 3>One of the themes that are coming out </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the boat there from the get go is </v>

1014
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:11.520
<v Speaker 3>that she not exactly now because she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not picking up on the frustration of it </v>

1015
00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:15.901
<v Speaker 3>all of the discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but normally she has a seen a level of </v>

1016
00:48:15.901 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 3>empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not just for a kid,</v>

1017
00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.040
<v Speaker 3>but like even for adults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see her.</v>

1018
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:24.180
<v Speaker 3>She's always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever she sees somebody was having a </v>

1019
00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:24.180
<v Speaker 3>bad day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really sad.</v>

1020
00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.510
<v Speaker 3>She instantly goes to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's trying to,</v>

1021
00:48:25.511 --> 00:48:30.511
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen her at school where she'll go </v>

1022
00:48:30.511 --> 00:48:30.511
<v Speaker 3>to a kid was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1023
00:48:30.511 --> 00:48:30.610
<v Speaker 3>he's in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kid that you don't like.</v>

1024
00:48:30.611 --> 00:48:32.290
<v Speaker 3>It was always giving you a hard time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

1025
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:37.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I still feel bad to look at what a </v>

1026
00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:39.900
<v Speaker 3>bad day these guys and she's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like trying to call him for diamond to </v>

1027
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:39.900
<v Speaker 3>this scene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1028
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:40.390
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1029
00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:45.420
<v Speaker 3>you got a really nice nicer to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought maybe that's what it is.</v>

1030
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.990
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think kids recognize things</v>

1031
00:48:49.991 --> 00:48:53.860
<v Speaker 3>that their parents do that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>think of the right way to handle things.</v>

1032
00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Come up with their own sort of work </v>
<v Speaker 3>arounds.</v>

1033
00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:01.010
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty laborious either in school </v>
<v Speaker 3>where she was clearly quoting Bob Marley</v>

1034
00:49:01.011 --> 00:49:06.011
<v Speaker 3>liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was going through a phase where Bob </v>

1035
00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:06.011
<v Speaker 3>Marley was called Marley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1036
00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:08.020
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know she loved Bob Marley to death and</v>

1037
00:49:08.021 --> 00:49:08.690
<v Speaker 3>she would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1038
00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:14.340
<v Speaker 3>she went to this key to us crying </v>
<v Speaker 3>because his mom had laughed and was like</v>

1039
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.590
<v Speaker 3>in preschool or something.</v>

1040
00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:19.160
<v Speaker 3>She was four and she started robbing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids back as the cutesy.</v>

1041
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:21.460
<v Speaker 3>And she say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about thing.</v>

1042
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:23.260
<v Speaker 3>I every little thing is going to be all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1043
00:49:23.261 --> 00:49:28.261
<v Speaker 3>I really felt burt's that's a lariat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'll ever own the.</v>

1044
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:33.010
<v Speaker 3>We are seeing some that one day she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1045
00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:38.011
<v Speaker 3>she asked me shooting the car and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>asked me for it immediately on time for </v>

1046
00:49:38.011 --> 00:49:38.011
<v Speaker 3>Bob Marley and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1057
00:49:58.051 --> 00:50:03.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if she's serious or if </v>

1058
00:50:03.051 --> 00:50:07.171
<v Speaker 3>she misses me when I go away and she </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to do like she's never heard a </v>

1059
00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:07.171
<v Speaker 3>gunshot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1060
00:50:07.171 --> 00:50:11.921
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's obviously no way she's </v>

1061
00:50:11.921 --> 00:50:12.190
<v Speaker 3>going to be a pullback in Arrow that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong enough to kill an animal.</v>

1062
00:50:12.191 --> 00:50:14.440
<v Speaker 3>So it's like that's not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1063
00:50:14.441 --> 00:50:19.441
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But step one would probably get used to </v>

1064
00:50:19.441 --> 00:50:19.720
<v Speaker 3>hearing gunshots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1065
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.900
<v Speaker 3>She's just so bored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That held me.</v>

1066
00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:24.350
<v Speaker 3>What's mad?</v>

1067
00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:28.460
<v Speaker 3>Tiny</v>

1068
00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:33.930
<v Speaker 1>pinch because you are driving me crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>square.</v>

1069
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
<v Speaker 1>He's settle down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't put on a show for you or </v>

1070
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:41.390
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A television show for you to watch.</v>

1071
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>

1072
00:50:42.141 --> 00:50:43.790
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do this serious.</v>

1073
00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Sit down and watch your show because </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately this is being seen by </v>

1074
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:54.200
<v Speaker 1>thousands and heard by hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands.</v>

1075
00:50:55.340 --> 00:51:00.340
<v Speaker 1>The failing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's today's podcast about it at all.</v>

1076
00:51:01.791 --> 00:51:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1077
00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:08.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing of becoming a father </v>

1078
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:08.570
<v Speaker 1>and being around kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was really young,</v>

1079
00:51:08.571 --> 00:51:11.660
<v Speaker 1>like when I was in my early twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never be able to deal with it.</v>

1080
00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Like little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

1081
00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.080
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy brought his little kid,</v>

1082
00:51:15.081 --> 00:51:17.660
<v Speaker 1>but like when I'm on a plane and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>little kids crying,</v>

1083
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:21.230
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't bother me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to drive me crazy,</v>

1084
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:26.410
<v Speaker 1>but when you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where you kind </v>

1085
00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:26.410
<v Speaker 1>of recognize.</v>

1086
00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:28.670
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big shift that happened is I started</v>

1087
00:51:28.671 --> 00:51:32.840
<v Speaker 1>thinking of everyone as being a baby at </v>
<v Speaker 1>one point in time.</v>

1088
00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Like one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Il was a baby.</v>

1089
00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1090
00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:39.480
<v Speaker 1>That's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1091
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.900
<v Speaker 1>like Edm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a baby.</v>

1092
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:45.110
<v Speaker 1>All these weird people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that fucking Pistorius guy that</v>

1093
00:51:45.111 --> 00:51:46.790
<v Speaker 1>shot his girlfriend throughout bathroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>

1094
00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 1>That guy was a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1095
00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know all these creeps and fuck ups </v>

1096
00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:53.320
<v Speaker 1>and assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Babies.</v>

1097
00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Gloria allred was a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a cute little girl.</v>

1098
00:51:56.630 --> 00:52:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Now she's fucking Robin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People using the law.</v>

1099
00:52:03.021 --> 00:52:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Just straight up rob dudes out much do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think is how much do you believe in,</v>

1100
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be dna or a soul or something</v>

1101
00:52:10.491 --> 00:52:13.790
<v Speaker 1>like something that's purely uniquely </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that person when they are born and</v>

1102
00:52:13.791 --> 00:52:16.190
<v Speaker 1>that's part of our car or our culture.</v>

1103
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:18.740
<v Speaker 1>You're not a female's nurture versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture debate.</v>

1104
00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:23.810
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your take on what's more </v>

1105
00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:23.810
<v Speaker 1>important in this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1106
00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have done studies where they've </v>

1107
00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:30.491
<v Speaker 1>taken twins that were separated at birth</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were adopted and they get them </v>

1108
00:52:30.491 --> 00:52:33.460
<v Speaker 1>together after not seeing each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire life and they find out they liked</v>

1109
00:52:33.461 --> 00:52:35.270
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1110
00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1111
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.840
<v Speaker 1>they have very similar likes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dislikes.</v>

1112
00:52:38.841 --> 00:52:43.841
<v Speaker 1>Their personalities are very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a strong argument for nature </v>

1113
00:52:43.841 --> 00:52:48.221
<v Speaker 1>over nurture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no denying that nurture </v>

1114
00:52:48.221 --> 00:52:49.310
<v Speaker 1>plays a huge role as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's either or.</v>

1115
00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I think we live in a soup of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities and I think that you can </v>

1116
00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:59.681
<v Speaker 1>get super lucky with the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure that you have to positive and </v>

1117
00:52:59.781 --> 00:53:04.781
<v Speaker 1>even to negative things like there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression hard times make good people,</v>

1118
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:08.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do believe that in a certain sense</v>

1119
00:53:08.511 --> 00:53:13.511
<v Speaker 1>that there's some experiences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>children and adults even have that they </v>

1120
00:53:13.511 --> 00:53:16.010
<v Speaker 1>get through and it makes them more </v>
<v Speaker 1>empathetic.</v>

1121
00:53:16.011 --> 00:53:21.011
<v Speaker 1>It makes them kinder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make some more understanding and it </v>

1122
00:53:21.011 --> 00:53:21.011
<v Speaker 1>makes them stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like more,</v>

1123
00:53:21.011 --> 00:53:25.430
<v Speaker 1>more character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's funny because you're </v>

1124
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:28.271
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's part of that that's </v>

1125
00:53:28.271 --> 00:53:28.271
<v Speaker 1>totally true</v>

1126
00:53:28.271 --> 00:53:31.190
<v Speaker 4>and you do see that happen a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then you see somebody who through the </v>

1127
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.990
<v Speaker 4>exact same thing and it makes them 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>times more of an asshole.</v>

1128
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:37.790
<v Speaker 4>I got hurt so I'm going to hurt anybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>else in the process and with them and </v>

1129
00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:41.181
<v Speaker 4>he's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where you think like what is the </v>

1130
00:53:41.181 --> 00:53:44.091
<v Speaker 4>make these one person make a right turn </v>
<v Speaker 4>and going in their actual where they </v>

1131
00:53:44.091 --> 00:53:47.511
<v Speaker 4>become a kinder and nicer because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>felt what it is to get hurt and what is </v>

1132
00:53:47.511 --> 00:53:50.340
<v Speaker 4>the other one may make the complete </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposite turn and going in the direction</v>

1133
00:53:50.341 --> 00:53:52.780
<v Speaker 4>of I got hurt so I don't care for </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody else.</v>

1134
00:53:52.781 --> 00:53:54.730
<v Speaker 4>This feeding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody has to pay for defendant.</v>

1135
00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:56.430
<v Speaker 4>I go hurt once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1136
00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.300
<v Speaker 4>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1137
00:53:57.310 --> 00:54:02.160
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's that moment where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can really make a 90 degree turn one way</v>

1138
00:54:02.161 --> 00:54:06.510
<v Speaker 4>or another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the make people make the choices</v>

1139
00:54:06.511 --> 00:54:06.990
<v Speaker 4>they make?</v>

1140
00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:11.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good question and it could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a lot of it could be genetics.</v>

1141
00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean their epigenetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the concept that people are passing</v>

1142
00:54:16.541 --> 00:54:19.240
<v Speaker 1>down ideas through their DNA to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>children is,</v>

1143
00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:24.360
<v Speaker 1>is not without merit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that your ideas that the </v>

1144
00:54:24.701 --> 00:54:29.701
<v Speaker 1>lessons you've learned in your life are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just stored in your brain but are </v>

1145
00:54:29.701 --> 00:54:33.391
<v Speaker 1>stored in every cell in your body and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also stored in your genetic material </v>

1146
00:54:33.391 --> 00:54:37.831
<v Speaker 1>that passes on to your woman who gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>birth to the baby and the baby has the </v>

1147
00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:39.820
<v Speaker 1>genetic material from both the mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the father.</v>

1148
00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:42.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of that is is real stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1149
00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:48.640
<v Speaker 1>All absolute real possibilities and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really incredibly fascinating.</v>

1150
00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:53.050
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we are this soup of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>

1151
00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:58.520
<v Speaker 1>We do exist in this very strange world </v>
<v Speaker 1>of so many different things going on at </v>

1152
00:54:58.991 --> 00:54:59.710
<v Speaker 1>the same time</v>

1153
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:01.490
<v Speaker 4>and there is something to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1154
00:55:01.491 --> 00:55:03.530
<v Speaker 4>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that's the experience part of it</v>

1155
00:55:03.531 --> 00:55:08.531
<v Speaker 4>all where you got some kind of traumatic</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience that really changes your,</v>

1156
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:12.740
<v Speaker 4>your makeup the way you are as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a person,</v>

1157
00:55:12.741 --> 00:55:16.770
<v Speaker 4>as a human being and like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at that point to kind.</v>

1158
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:20.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've seen even on myself not I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with right now.</v>

1159
00:55:20.571 --> 00:55:23.210
<v Speaker 4>I see how my brain has changed over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>last 30,</v>

1160
00:55:23.211 --> 00:55:24.400
<v Speaker 4>40 years in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1161
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.420
<v Speaker 4>go the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In some ways really not in a good way.</v>

1162
00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:29.650
<v Speaker 4>What way is in a bad way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I do have.</v>

1163
00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:34.660
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now I'm coming to the realization </v>

1164
00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:34.670
<v Speaker 4>that I do have some serious ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1165
00:55:34.671 --> 00:55:35.600
<v Speaker 4>we're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1166
00:55:35.601 --> 00:55:38.940
<v Speaker 4>my wife died in my arms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't quite as a,</v>

1167
00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:40.470
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can deal with dates.</v>

1168
00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:42.620
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rationally understand us.</v>

1169
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:47.650
<v Speaker 4>She tap ins and nobody's seen goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it did affect me to a different </v>

1170
00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:51.161
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I know I'd have to give you an </v>

1171
00:55:51.161 --> 00:55:52.541
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll see that because of the way it </v>

1172
00:55:52.541 --> 00:55:52.541
<v Speaker 4>started with there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1173
00:55:52.541 --> 00:55:53.170
<v Speaker 4>when she got sick in the first scene,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

1174
00:55:53.171 --> 00:55:54.530
<v Speaker 4>it was like a tiny little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1175
00:55:54.531 --> 00:55:55.580
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my shoulder hurts.</v>

1176
00:55:55.581 --> 00:55:56.600
<v Speaker 4>He's like a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1177
00:55:56.601 --> 00:55:57.320
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1178
00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.360
<v Speaker 4>you went to the gym and you lift it too </v>
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>

1179
00:55:59.361 --> 00:56:03.110
<v Speaker 4>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something seeing that transformed me and</v>

1180
00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:05.150
<v Speaker 4>I met throw for weeks to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

1181
00:56:05.151 --> 00:56:06.740
<v Speaker 4>I can't move my arm anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1182
00:56:06.741 --> 00:56:11.741
<v Speaker 4>I can barely walk that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of that in such a short period of </v>

1183
00:56:11.741 --> 00:56:12.170
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1184
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:14.360
<v Speaker 4>every time there's something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 4>my body,</v>

1185
00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't just think like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1186
00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:21.310
<v Speaker 4>look at that weird little scene to them </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm having my mind immediately </v>

1187
00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:22.730
<v Speaker 4>erased the whole sequence and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to die tomorrow.</v>

1188
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:24.490
<v Speaker 4>Some horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible disease.</v>

1189
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.360
<v Speaker 4>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know better.</v>

1190
00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:29.770
<v Speaker 4>Reich noted that stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I know that that's a fantasy.</v>

1191
00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:35.320
<v Speaker 4>That's like puddle Jack Things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are definitely not lpn and </v>

1192
00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.110
<v Speaker 4>if anything they are damaging and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>still can't help it.</v>

1193
00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:40.810
<v Speaker 4>They're still part of my brain that even</v>
<v Speaker 4>the conscious of the.</v>

1194
00:56:40.811 --> 00:56:44.170
<v Speaker 4>I know it's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still go there every single time.</v>

1195
00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:47.140
<v Speaker 4>There's something wrong with my body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he's like,</v>

1196
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:49.480
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do I need to do to change that?</v>

1197
00:56:49.481 --> 00:56:51.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's almost like Pavlov's dogs,</v>

1198
00:56:51.311 --> 00:56:56.311
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is Conditional response is immediately </v>

1199
00:56:56.311 --> 00:56:56.311
<v Speaker 4>the second something goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're piled high,</v>

1200
00:56:56.311 --> 00:56:57.550
<v Speaker 4>go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1201
00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:03.050
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are moments where I have control </v>

1202
00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:03.050
<v Speaker 4>over it and I can kind of come to this </v>
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

1203
00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:07.180
<v Speaker 4>That's because I've seen horrible things</v>
<v Speaker 4>can happen at any moment.</v>

1204
00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.130
<v Speaker 4>I actually try and sign and date and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1205
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.410
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have no control over anything,</v>

1206
00:57:11.411 --> 00:57:16.411
<v Speaker 4>so let's have fun right here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now because what the hell knows </v>

1207
00:57:16.411 --> 00:57:19.171
<v Speaker 4>what happened tomorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the empowering part of it and I </v>

1208
00:57:19.171 --> 00:57:19.730
<v Speaker 4>love it when I get that and I don't love</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much.</v>

1209
00:57:19.731 --> 00:57:21.940
<v Speaker 4>And the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that terror of,</v>

1210
00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:23.620
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something's gonna happen.</v>

1211
00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:29.220
<v Speaker 4>Which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inevitably something's going to happen </v>

1212
00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:29.220
<v Speaker 4>at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1213
00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:29.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody dies,</v>

1214
00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.090
<v Speaker 4>everybody gets sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just the nature of the business.</v>

1215
00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:36.100
<v Speaker 4>But having that in the back of your mind</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a some time paralyzing thought,</v>

1216
00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.330
<v Speaker 4>that's a whole different game.</v>

1217
00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.510
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem with being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being,</v>

1218
00:57:39.511 --> 00:57:41.430
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the awareness,</v>

1219
00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:46.760
<v Speaker 1>the awareness of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the finite nature of your existence and </v>

1220
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.690
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's tomorrow or 100 years from </v>

1221
00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:49.690
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's coming.</v>

1222
00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:54.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you told someone that they're going </v>

1223
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:54.410
<v Speaker 1>to die in a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still freak out.</v>

1224
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year passes 999</v>

1225
00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:02.020
<v Speaker 4>pithily and I mean that's just the </v>
<v Speaker 4>noise,</v>

1226
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.000
<v Speaker 4>but there's a somewhat removed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1227
00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:09.080
<v Speaker 4>There's that intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>existential anxiety and then there's </v>

1228
00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.620
<v Speaker 4>existential anxiety or for sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who have seen the weather because</v>

1229
00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:16.621
<v Speaker 4>of war or sickness or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People close to them die in horrible </v>

1230
00:58:16.621 --> 00:58:18.470
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just an intellectual.</v>

1231
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.790
<v Speaker 4>Some point in the future or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad is going happen is it's in the past,</v>

1232
00:58:21.791 --> 00:58:26.791
<v Speaker 4>something bad is gonna happen in any </v>
<v Speaker 4>second now can app and that's not a fun </v>

1233
00:58:26.791 --> 00:58:26.791
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1234
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the best way.</v>

1235
00:58:28.991 --> 00:58:31.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good in any sense of the word.</v>

1236
00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Living in the moment and being happy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment is very.</v>

1237
00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very difficult thing to do.</v>

1238
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:42.430
<v Speaker 1>It requires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It requires discipline and it also </v>

1239
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:44.230
<v Speaker 1>requires that you develop like a pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thinking.</v>

1240
00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you didn't get.</v>

1241
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.010
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about with the young people,</v>

1242
00:58:48.011 --> 00:58:53.011
<v Speaker 1>like they automatically start blaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and hating on people for </v>

1243
00:58:53.011 --> 00:58:54.760
<v Speaker 1>whatever has happened wrong to them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make people feel the way.</v>

1244
00:58:54.761 --> 00:58:59.761
<v Speaker 1>I feel that there's patterns of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can fall into like almost </v>

1245
00:59:00.011 --> 00:59:02.620
<v Speaker 1>automatically and once you have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern,</v>

1246
00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:07.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a cut groove and that groove is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very easy to slip into.</v>

1247
00:59:07.211 --> 00:59:09.340
<v Speaker 1>It's very comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very simple.</v>

1248
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:12.810
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that psychedelics do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is pull you out of that groove.</v>

1249
00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1250
00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:17.620
<v Speaker 1>they lift you above the motherboard and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to see what the groove is.</v>

1251
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just a pattern that I've created</v>

1252
00:59:19.811 --> 00:59:22.280
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only is not empowering,</v>

1253
00:59:22.281 --> 00:59:27.281
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to live my life a fucking </v>

1254
00:59:27.281 --> 00:59:29.120
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to 60 more years of this.</v>

1255
00:59:29.121 --> 00:59:34.121
<v Speaker 1>Then my heart's going to stop beating </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to die an asshole that's </v>

1256
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:38.780
<v Speaker 1>very easy to fall into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy.</v>

1257
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.120
<v Speaker 1>It can happen to all of us if I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1258
00:59:41.121 --> 00:59:41.540
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

1259
00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:46.610
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to say it's very hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to reset and even when you do reset,</v>

1260
00:59:47.271 --> 00:59:52.271
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to continue that new pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it requires great discipline </v>

1261
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.460
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you've got to write things</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1262
00:59:55.461 --> 00:59:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Writing things down is big right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Writing things down,</v>

1263
00:59:58.041 --> 00:59:59.900
<v Speaker 1>reading things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive affirmations.</v>

1264
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Nobody likes the idea that you go over </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's house and they have fucking </v>

1265
01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.470
<v Speaker 1>all these things written on the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like today's a new day today.</v>

1266
01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:08.480
<v Speaker 1>We're going to go forth with strength </v>
<v Speaker 1>and dignity,</v>

1267
01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:12.800
<v Speaker 1>but doing stuff like that actually can </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit you.</v>

1268
01:00:12.801 --> 01:00:13.640
<v Speaker 1>It can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>

1269
01:00:13.641 --> 01:00:18.641
<v Speaker 1>Writing things on walls and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having positive affirmations can help </v>

1270
01:00:18.641 --> 01:00:18.641
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1271
01:00:18.641 --> 01:00:19.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I mean some stuff,</v>

1272
01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:24.410
<v Speaker 4>just because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean that you don't need to </v>

1273
01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:24.870
<v Speaker 4>hear it again and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>realize it because you know,</v>

1274
01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.890
<v Speaker 4>most people know if you have read the </v>
<v Speaker 4>books,</v>

1275
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:32.900
<v Speaker 4>if you have been alive long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably know what's there is to </v>

1276
01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:34.650
<v Speaker 4>know you've already before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The difference is transforming deaf from</v>

1277
01:00:34.651 --> 01:00:39.651
<v Speaker 4>intellectual knowledge into actual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of your being part of </v>

1278
01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:43.640
<v Speaker 4>something that affects how you behave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Both the old buddy and I'm amber Lyon on</v>

1279
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:48.230
<v Speaker 4>giving me the lecture about psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 4>moved three times now regarding the,</v>

1280
01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.590
<v Speaker 4>this is what you need to now.</v>

1281
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:52.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>

1282
01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:57.691
<v Speaker 1>She has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never met anybody that I gave the </v>

1283
01:00:57.691 --> 01:00:59.920
<v Speaker 1>suggestions to like I gave to her where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just fucking ran with it.</v>

1284
01:00:59.921 --> 01:01:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Like she did that she had changed her </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1285
01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Henneberry's it three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a trip.</v>

1286
01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.560
<v Speaker 4>I didn't meet her before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know what the before looked </v>

1287
01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:09.560
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1288
01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>before she was a very rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious journalist who was very </v>

1289
01:01:13.411 --> 01:01:18.411
<v Speaker 1>concerned about the future of humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our culture and in journalism </v>

1290
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>because she had seen the ugly side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beast where she had reported on some</v>

1291
01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:28.221
<v Speaker 1>horrific events in Bahrain and when she </v>
<v Speaker 1>got back and try to put together the CNN</v>

1292
01:01:28.741 --> 01:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they instead put out this fluff piece,</v>

1293
01:01:31.201 --> 01:01:35.010
<v Speaker 1>like almost like a tourism propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 1>video for Bahrain,</v>

1294
01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you set.</v>

1295
01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when I talked to her about </v>

1296
01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

1297
01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I've never even done.</v>

1298
01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:47.130
<v Speaker 4>I totally go do Iowaska.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the funniest thing of that </v>

1299
01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:47.130
<v Speaker 4>started at time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Berkeley House.</v>

1300
01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:49.870
<v Speaker 4>He's like John Globe about the down it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they say,</v>

1301
01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:51.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Joe never did right?</v>

1302
01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:51.760
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1303
01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:57.100
<v Speaker 1>but I've done dmt a dozen times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least.</v>

1304
01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Probably nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 or 12,</v>

1305
01:01:58.810 --> 01:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this the same thing.</v>

1306
01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1307
01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.400
<v Speaker 1>it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is.</v>

1308
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same psychoactive substance.</v>

1309
01:02:05.681 --> 01:02:07.450
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>DMT,</v>

1310
01:02:07.451 --> 01:02:11.860
<v Speaker 1>the small global forum is a stronger </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of a Iowasca,</v>

1311
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>but I asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tends to be a long spiritual trip,</v>

1312
01:02:15.581 --> 01:02:17.500
<v Speaker 1>which I thought would really benefit </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

1313
01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she was struggling it.</v>

1314
01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it sure did.</v>

1315
01:02:20.701 --> 01:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1316
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen them before.</v>

1317
01:02:22.711 --> 01:02:27.711
<v Speaker 1>By the after is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean seriously one of those people </v>

1318
01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>that she glows every time I out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

1319
01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:29.900
<v Speaker 1>I feel happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

1320
01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:31.600
<v Speaker 1>she's a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1321
01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Is like in the same room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve the level of fat is I'm amazed </v>

1322
01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>by her every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

1323
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.130
<v Speaker 1>are you for real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1324
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:40.050
<v Speaker 1>I have never.</v>

1325
01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I can think of too many people that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>met that are that happy while she's </v>

1326
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:49.130
<v Speaker 1>doing psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every couple of months I was fucking hit</v>

1327
01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:54.140
<v Speaker 1>it so hard from the moment I met her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I guess it was like two plus years </v>

1328
01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:57.501
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than two years ago because we </v>

1329
01:02:57.501 --> 01:02:57.501
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from that moment on,</v>

1330
01:02:57.501 --> 01:03:01.940
<v Speaker 1>when she went to the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she went to the jungle like a fucking </v>

1331
01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:02.900
<v Speaker 1>month after I brought her up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even less went.</v>

1332
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>And even though they told her I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had never done I was,</v>

1333
01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>she's still fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1334
01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I think I knew that I told her to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I knew that it was the thing that </v>

1335
01:03:15.571 --> 01:03:20.571
<v Speaker 1>she needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people really need that they need </v>

1336
01:03:20.571 --> 01:03:23.691
<v Speaker 1>to go to a place and they need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience this thing in this very alien</v>

1337
01:03:24.061 --> 01:03:29.061
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so transformative because of </v>

1338
01:03:29.061 --> 01:03:30.000
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you're in that place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1339
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I could probably benefit from </v>

1340
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:35.000
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my,</v>

1341
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:35.250
<v Speaker 1>what I like to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1342
01:03:35.251 --> 01:03:40.251
<v Speaker 1>my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a sensory deprivation tank in my </v>

1343
01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:40.251
<v Speaker 1>basement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>

1344
01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of experiencing is as removed </v>

1345
01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.821
<v Speaker 1>as the jungle might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm removing myself from reality itself </v>

1346
01:03:46.821 --> 01:03:49.260
<v Speaker 1>on this daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to say that I wouldn't still benefit</v>

1347
01:03:49.261 --> 01:03:52.200
<v Speaker 1>from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't subscribe what I do.</v>

1348
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1349
01:03:52.861 --> 01:03:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't prescribe rather.</v>

1350
01:03:54.301 --> 01:03:57.150
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say what you need to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a tank filled up with water and he'd</v>

1351
01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:59.070
<v Speaker 1>trip your fucking balls out and climbing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>

1352
01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that right now.</v>

1353
01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that come over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to do the tank.</v>

1354
01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm going to get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1355
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>What's so scary about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1356
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:11.190
<v Speaker 1>reality is that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1357
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:16.250
<v Speaker 1>because the big fucking meat locker of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and I need to do to that have </v>

1358
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:16.250
<v Speaker 1>done it.</v>

1359
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:17.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always liked.</v>

1360
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I always felt great or no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1361
01:04:20.281 --> 01:04:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's my mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you been sober?</v>

1362
01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time.</v>

1363
01:04:23.851 --> 01:04:26.970
<v Speaker 1>It was good to do it sober,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1364
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.040
<v Speaker 1>amateur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1365
01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1366
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Float tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1367
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:35.750
<v Speaker 1>with an asterisk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The asterisk is very important because </v>

1368
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:38.160
<v Speaker 1>whatever the asked Rick can do the astro</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do in regular life.</v>

1369
01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:43.340
<v Speaker 1>It's multiplied 10 fold inside of there </v>
<v Speaker 1>because especially edibles,</v>

1370
01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:49.050
<v Speaker 1>edible marijuana becomes a full blown </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiments and the that he </v>

1371
01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:51.780
<v Speaker 1>bolts for somebody who is like 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hydroxy metabolite.</v>

1372
01:04:51.781 --> 01:04:54.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the [inaudible] I've tried.</v>

1373
01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Every time I've tried edibles is either </v>
<v Speaker 1>too little where I don't feel it or I </v>

1374
01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:00.080
<v Speaker 1>feel like somebody grabbing the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball back in,</v>

1375
01:05:00.081 --> 01:05:01.860
<v Speaker 1>but your way first and just slagged me </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1376
01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Not Pleasurable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

1377
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:08.100
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where am I?</v>

1378
01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.430
<v Speaker 1>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are my favorite trips really does.</v>

1379
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:16.470
<v Speaker 1>We'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think them whether it happened </v>

1380
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.470
<v Speaker 1>when they were over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned the most from them.</v>

1381
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Like I like being scared that because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know</v>

1382
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

1383
01:05:19.271 --> 01:05:20.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why it's happening.</v>

1384
01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:26.610
<v Speaker 3>I think I got when I was maybe 15 or 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1385
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:31.630
<v Speaker 3>I did this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember making these tea with ashish </v>

1386
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:35.790
<v Speaker 3>and the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got a little carried away because </v>

1387
01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:37.531
<v Speaker 3>they were supposed to be a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people doing that and it turned out to </v>

1388
01:05:37.531 --> 01:05:40.321
<v Speaker 3>be only two or five years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the doors that were supposed to be </v>

1389
01:05:40.321 --> 01:05:42.901
<v Speaker 3>for like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was like half a gram per </v>

1390
01:05:42.901 --> 01:05:42.910
<v Speaker 3>person and the study was two and a half </v>
<v Speaker 3>a gram per person.</v>

1391
01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:44.920
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by the time we'd down it's,</v>

1392
01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:46.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an hour goes by with teddy bowls is also</v>

1393
01:05:46.931 --> 01:05:48.370
<v Speaker 3>messy because you don't feel it right </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

1394
01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.380
<v Speaker 3>So an hour goes by and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

1395
01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:52.230
<v Speaker 3>nothing happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two hours goes by.</v>

1396
01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:52.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

1397
01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Nothing steal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a waste.</v>

1398
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:56.860
<v Speaker 3>We throw that stuff away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to sleep,</v>

1399
01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:59.650
<v Speaker 3>I wake up two hours later and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1400
01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.750
<v Speaker 3>am I?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where am I?</v>

1401
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.870
<v Speaker 3>And I pass out and I opened up my eyes </v>
<v Speaker 3>again and like,</v>

1402
01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:06.710
<v Speaker 3>where am I?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1403
01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:11.340
<v Speaker 3>and the next six hours go like these </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I basically lose consciousness 70,</v>

1404
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:13.900
<v Speaker 3>30 seconds and I wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where am I?</v>

1405
01:06:13.901 --> 01:06:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Or Am I think after that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1406
01:06:16.961 --> 01:06:21.961
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm doing too badly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It even other times that I've done it </v>

1407
01:06:21.961 --> 01:06:22.690
<v Speaker 3>was always not quite that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but clothes.</v>

1408
01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:23.740
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1409
01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:26.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it bolts are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are men for me.</v>

1410
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1411
01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:32.320
<v Speaker 3>there's so many religions that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabis and cannabis eating as the base</v>

1412
01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:33.910
<v Speaker 3>of their religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hindu is,</v>

1413
01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:35.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many,</v>

1414
01:06:35.501 --> 01:06:37.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many passages in,</v>

1415
01:06:37.481 --> 01:06:39.010
<v Speaker 3>in ancient Hindu scripts.</v>

1416
01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:41.260
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look up,</v>

1417
01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.780
<v Speaker 3>if you look up on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1418
01:06:42.830 --> 01:06:45.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Wikipedia,</v>

1419
01:06:45.491 --> 01:06:50.491
<v Speaker 3>you can look up the f entheogenic use of</v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabis and shows all these different </v>

1420
01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.150
<v Speaker 3>times where people have used cannabis as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a psychedelic,</v>

1421
01:06:55.151 --> 01:06:56.290
<v Speaker 3>like not just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1422
01:06:56.291 --> 01:06:58.480
<v Speaker 3>we're smoking a joint relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you eat it,</v>

1423
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:02.020
<v Speaker 3>you have these profound visions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you eat enough.</v>

1424
01:07:02.021 --> 01:07:07.021
<v Speaker 3>Like Mckenna used to say that eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>like large doses of marijuana was </v>

1425
01:07:07.021 --> 01:07:08.650
<v Speaker 3>equivalent to eating large doses of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms.</v>

1426
01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.680
<v Speaker 3>It's just a matter of having the courage</v>
<v Speaker 3>to eat too much code.</v>

1427
01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:17.810
<v Speaker 3>You'll never get the crazy heart fast </v>
<v Speaker 3>heart rate on a,</v>

1428
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:19.960
<v Speaker 3>on edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>

1429
01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:25.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because then you don't get a fast heart </v>

1430
01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:27.301
<v Speaker 3>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you get this panic sense like I'm </v>

1431
01:07:27.301 --> 01:07:27.301
<v Speaker 3>never going to sober up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1432
01:07:27.301 --> 01:07:31.680
<v Speaker 3>but not as a physical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A physical thing like I've done like a </v>

1433
01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:31.780
<v Speaker 3>heart.</v>

1434
01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where I feel my heart start pounding </v>

1435
01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:36.810
<v Speaker 3>where I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

1436
01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:40.621
<v Speaker 3>I'm going like 120 beats per minute with</v>
<v Speaker 3>our son seeing which are not doing </v>

1437
01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:41.800
<v Speaker 3>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a bit much.</v>

1438
01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:46.860
<v Speaker 3>I bet it's anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That probably as probably is because it </v>

1439
01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:47.650
<v Speaker 3>brings on a lot of anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1440
01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:50.910
<v Speaker 3>Heavy duty edibles make you really </v>
<v Speaker 3>reconsider it.</v>

1441
01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:56.090
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to live in the </v>

1442
01:07:56.090 --> 01:07:58.891
<v Speaker 3>moment on heavy duty edibles because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>forces you to examine problematic </v>

1443
01:07:58.891 --> 01:08:03.031
<v Speaker 3>aspects of your past behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assuming you'll still have an affluent </v>

1444
01:08:03.031 --> 01:08:04.210
<v Speaker 3>cdt because there are really tight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just like,</v>

1445
01:08:04.211 --> 01:08:06.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm not accepting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not accepting a belief.</v>

1446
01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:07.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1447
01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:09.340
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1448
01:08:09.341 --> 01:08:14.341
<v Speaker 3>You can go too deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not too long ago with the Rick Simpson </v>

1449
01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:14.910
<v Speaker 3>oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1450
01:08:14.911 --> 01:08:19.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which supposed to be great for health </v>

1451
01:08:19.911 --> 01:08:22.511
<v Speaker 3>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing with the oil is that unless </v>

1452
01:08:22.511 --> 01:08:23.690
<v Speaker 3>somebody preparing it for you in </v>
<v Speaker 3>capsules or something,</v>

1453
01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:28.750
<v Speaker 3>it's such a guesswork of trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out which one is how many drops </v>

1454
01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:28.880
<v Speaker 3>you not put up.</v>

1455
01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:34.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've done it where I take a tiny bit </v>

1456
01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:34.290
<v Speaker 3>and I feel nothing and I'm assuming it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ilt,</v>

1457
01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:38.530
<v Speaker 3>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not feeling anything and I take a </v>

1458
01:08:38.530 --> 01:08:38.530
<v Speaker 3>tiny bit and one day I take a tiny beat </v>
<v Speaker 3>plus a,</v>

1459
01:08:38.530 --> 01:08:42.851
<v Speaker 3>my new school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny micro drop more and I'm like </v>

1460
01:08:42.851 --> 01:08:42.980
<v Speaker 3>hitting the trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1461
01:08:42.981 --> 01:08:45.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm just way out there and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

1462
01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:50.740
<v Speaker 3>What's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's making those things know being </v>

1463
01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.710
<v Speaker 3>made in the same place where they make </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tesla's?</v>

1464
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:58.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's part of the problem when that's </v>

1465
01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:58.360
<v Speaker 3>why we did sell feudal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1466
01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:03.380
<v Speaker 3>it's the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can kind of figure things out and </v>

1467
01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.600
<v Speaker 3>when you're smoking it you can sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel how it's going and you can stop.</v>

1468
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:10.950
<v Speaker 3>It's edible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sees you take it and an hour later </v>

1469
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:11.450
<v Speaker 3>you're in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Surprise to see what it's like.</v>

1470
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to this radio show the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day where people are complaining </v>

1471
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:17.180
<v Speaker 1>about marijuana being stronger than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was when they were kids.</v>

1472
01:09:17.181 --> 01:09:22.181
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy in his fifties who just </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently tried marijuana again and he </v>

1473
01:09:22.181 --> 01:09:25.931
<v Speaker 1>was talking about how he overdosed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I overdosed on marijuana and I swear to </v>

1474
01:09:25.931 --> 01:09:26.760
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you exactly.</v>

1475
01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:29.690
<v Speaker 1>You almost went to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I barely got through it.</v>

1476
01:09:29.691 --> 01:09:34.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can overdose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like going on like about </v>

1477
01:09:34.691 --> 01:09:34.691
<v Speaker 1>the pot today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1478
01:09:34.691 --> 01:09:36.650
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like shut the fuck up.</v>

1479
01:09:36.651 --> 01:09:41.651
<v Speaker 1>What do you like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that someone can go on the air </v>

1480
01:09:41.651 --> 01:09:41.651
<v Speaker 1>and say something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit.</v>

1481
01:09:41.651 --> 01:09:46.511
<v Speaker 1>It's what's it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just like you could put a bad </v>

1482
01:09:46.511 --> 01:09:51.351
<v Speaker 1>thought in someone's head and I really </v>

<v Speaker 1>or something in 2014 is all the progress</v>

1571
01:13:57.681 --> 01:14:02.681
<v Speaker 1>that we've gone through to get to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in age and there's still some </v>

1572
01:14:02.681 --> 01:14:02.681
<v Speaker 1>people that just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could take them,</v>

1573
01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.780
<v Speaker 1>you could shove them back to the year </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero and they would fit called.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that spectrum.</v>

1578
01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:18.340
<v Speaker 1>The broad spectrum of behavior where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost seems like you have to have like </v>

1579
01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.790
<v Speaker 1>shitty people to appreciate the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I wonder if there's ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come a time where there's a legitimate </v>

1581
01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:31.021
<v Speaker 1>biological utopia where like human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings like where they achieve some form</v>

1582
01:14:31.181 --> 01:14:35.920
<v Speaker 1>of enlightenment where everyone has </v>
<v Speaker 1>reached the dust age.</v>

1583
01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:39.940
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about like his atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus they rattle this onto themselves,</v>

1584
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:45.210
<v Speaker 1>but they should know better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all fucking educated and going </v>

1585
01:14:45.210 --> 01:14:45.830
<v Speaker 1>to conferences and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see.</v>

1586
01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:48.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're preaching to the choir</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially or,</v>

1587
01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:53.340
<v Speaker 1>or propping themselves up on a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral high ground in front of their </v>

1588
01:14:53.381 --> 01:14:58.381
<v Speaker 1>peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's gonna come a time where the </v>

1589
01:14:58.381 --> 01:14:58.381
<v Speaker 1>whole world is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

1590

<v Speaker 4>humanity going into more pleasant </v>

1593
01:15:09.710 --> 01:15:12.980
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't need the bad people just give </v>

01:15:16.850 --> 01:15:20.420
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make people very nice.</v>

1598
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:23.370
<v Speaker 1>So you watch movies and you get almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an experience</v>

1599
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:26.040
<v Speaker 4>without diving actually to deal with it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the whole restaurant,</v>

1600
01:15:26.041 --> 01:15:27.900
<v Speaker 4>now that you've been here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a religious devout are.</v>

1601
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:30.970
<v Speaker 4>You need to evolve in order to </v>
<v Speaker 4>appreciate the good.</v>

1602
01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Like to what degree man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we talk about human history,</v>

1603
01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:38.290
<v Speaker 4>there has been so much evil that is like</v>
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

1604
01:15:38.291 --> 01:15:41.650
<v Speaker 4>I could actually do with one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 of that.</v>

1605
01:15:41.651 --> 01:15:46.651
<v Speaker 4>I will learn the lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to learn that same lesson </v>

1606
01:15:46.651 --> 01:15:46.960
<v Speaker 4>over and over again in such brutal nasty</v>
<v Speaker 4>fashion.</v>

1607
01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:52.650
<v Speaker 4>There's something about the design of </v>
<v Speaker 4>human history or nature or for that </v>

1608
01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:53.320
<v Speaker 4>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because as you say multiple times.</v>

1609
01:15:53.321 --> 01:15:54.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look at nature,</v>

1610
01:15:54.471 --> 01:15:57.310
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's not a soft,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuzzy,</v>

1611
01:15:57.311 --> 01:15:59.810
<v Speaker 4>happy animals running around the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's brutal.</v>

1612
01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:02.410
<v Speaker 4>His fangs and close on the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

1613
01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:08.580
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe if it's about appreciating the </v>

1614
01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:08.580
<v Speaker 4>good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there would be a gentler way to go about</v>

1615
01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.460
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do we really have to go these hardcore?</v>

1616
01:16:10.461 --> 01:16:11.260
<v Speaker 4>It will make it happen.</v>

1617
01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature is the most vicious motherfucker.</v>

1618
01:16:15.251 --> 01:16:20.251
<v Speaker 1>A wall my friend was telling me about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching this bear killed this </v>

1619
01:16:21.961 --> 01:16:24.780
<v Speaker 1>female bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was watching his grizzly bears.</v>

1620
01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:30.200
<v Speaker 1>They were observing them and this male </v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to mate with this female </v>

1621
01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.610
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bear and the grizzly bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to mate with them.</v>

1622
01:16:32.670 --> 01:16:34.290
<v Speaker 1>She kept pushing them off and yelling at</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1623
01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I kept trying so hard to get her to meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>

1624
01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:41.550
<v Speaker 1>but she didn't want to do it and then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new grizzly bear,</v>

1625
01:16:41.551 --> 01:16:45.420
<v Speaker 1>a new female came into the picture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new female came into the picture and</v>

1626
01:16:45.421 --> 01:16:50.421
<v Speaker 1>started trying to get him to meet with </v>
<v Speaker 1>her and he got angry that she was </v>

1627
01:16:50.421 --> 01:16:53.350
<v Speaker 1>distracting him so he murdered her in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of the other business.</v>

1628
01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Just tore her apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just ripped her to shreds and he </v>

1629
01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.841
<v Speaker 1>said it was the craziest thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden this bear had its feet </v>

1630
01:17:02.841 --> 01:17:03.870
<v Speaker 1>up in the air and it was just dead like </v>
<v Speaker 1>within seconds,</v>

1631
01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:06.720
<v Speaker 1>like a few seconds ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had wandered into the camp,</v>

1632
01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:11.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or into this little valley with these </v>

1633
01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:12.490
<v Speaker 1>were and tried to get this bear to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

1634
01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:17.890
<v Speaker 1>he's a biologist and so he was observing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff or if he's not a biologist </v>

1635
01:17:17.890 --> 01:17:22.361
<v Speaker 1>who works with biologists and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>observing this stuff and he said it was </v>

1636
01:17:22.361 --> 01:17:22.910
<v Speaker 1>one of the most disturbing things he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen in his life.</v>

1637
01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:27.940
<v Speaker 1>He's a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's lived his whole life hunting and </v>

1638
01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:27.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death is a normal,</v>

1639
01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:31.961
<v Speaker 1>natural part of life to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this to him freaked him out more </v>

1640
01:17:31.961 --> 01:17:36.311
<v Speaker 1>than anything I'd ever seen because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said it was so brutal and it was so </v>

1641
01:17:36.311 --> 01:17:36.311
<v Speaker 1>instantaneous,</v>

1642
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just really crazy,</v>

1643
01:17:38.751 --> 01:17:43.751
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever do divert daily about the </v>

1644
01:17:43.751 --> 01:17:43.751
<v Speaker 4>rapists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>necrophilia docs,</v>

1645
01:17:43.751 --> 01:17:47.830
<v Speaker 4>docs?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't tell you about the rapists </v>

1646
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.830
<v Speaker 4>necrophilia docs thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I have to.</v>

1647
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:48.240
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1648
01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:50.780
<v Speaker 4>cute little dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are adorable.</v>

1649
01:17:50.781 --> 01:17:54.200
<v Speaker 4>I remember seeing docs beam bar naturing</v>
<v Speaker 4>out with an ag and I'm like,</v>

1650
01:17:54.201 --> 01:17:57.910
<v Speaker 4>I never eat in Nag again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Diane 18 doc again and poorly told that,</v>

1651
01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:03.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got into these romanticized cute </v>

1652
01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:03.060
<v Speaker 4>fuzzy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1653
01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:07.720
<v Speaker 4>And then I start reading about docs that</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently mailed docs are particularly </v>

1654
01:18:08.181 --> 01:18:12.950
<v Speaker 4>fond of raping female dogs and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is where it gets interesting.</v>

1655
01:18:12.951 --> 01:18:14.840
<v Speaker 4>So they go out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure maybe you've seen them in these</v>

1656
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:19.870
<v Speaker 4>super high speed chase where the female </v>
<v Speaker 4>is that I need and there's like two or </v>

1657
01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:21.440
<v Speaker 4>three male run flying right behind her </v>
<v Speaker 4>and in,</v>

1658
01:18:21.441 --> 01:18:26.441
<v Speaker 4>during this high speed chases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>occasionally the female take the wrong </v>

1659
01:18:26.441 --> 01:18:28.730
<v Speaker 4>turn and she ask us into something a </v>
<v Speaker 4>three or a weekend or something.</v>

1660
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:30.180
<v Speaker 4>And then she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1661
01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:33.350
<v Speaker 4>she broke her neck and die immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1662
01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:37.490
<v Speaker 4>bodies still warm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the one that'd be rapists,</v>

1663
01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:38.870
<v Speaker 4>docs on poor suites,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the side,</v>

1664
01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:39.800
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell,</v>

1665
01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.750
<v Speaker 4>we don't want to waste this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

1666
01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:46.160
<v Speaker 4>And they just got on and have sex with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>dead corpse after that.</v>

1667
01:18:46.161 --> 01:18:48.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>docs are back on the manual</v>

1668
01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:53.360
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers because you guys are mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>and horrible and I'm going to each </v>

1669
01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:57.060
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is show to all those people </v>

1670
01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:57.060
<v Speaker 1>that are trying to keep you from eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>fog war,</v>

1671
01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:57.360
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1672
01:18:57.361 --> 01:18:59.370
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird thing that California </v>
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>

1673
01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:02.850
<v Speaker 1>California has a law where you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to eat duck liver,</v>

1674
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:07.910
<v Speaker 1>but you can eat ducks because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced feeding these ducks if their </v>

1675
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:10.090
<v Speaker 1>liver to grow and people found out to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably cruel,</v>

1676
01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I guess crueler than killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1677
01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:19.130
<v Speaker 1>And eating them like force feeding them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get their livers to grow larger was </v>

1678
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:20.930
<v Speaker 1>crueler than killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emi.</v>

1679
01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1680
01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:23.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1681
01:19:24.130 --> 01:19:27.680
<v Speaker 4>the stuff that's done in raising </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore,</v>

1682
01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.490
<v Speaker 4>letting industrial level tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty fucked up,</v>

1683
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:35.550
<v Speaker 4>which is why even people who whine about</v>
<v Speaker 4>that but they do anything related to </v>

1684
01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:39.601
<v Speaker 4>whether you have land that already with </v>
<v Speaker 4>any kind of meat is ridiculous because </v>

1685
01:19:39.601 --> 01:19:39.700
<v Speaker 4>it's like hunting is a lot cleaner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That way.</v>

1686
01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:44.880
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll let the animal live its life be </v>

1687
01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:44.880
<v Speaker 4>for the end of every single commercial </v>
<v Speaker 4>farming.</v>

1688
01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:49.591
<v Speaker 4>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some nasty stuff happening at </v>

1689
01:19:49.591 --> 01:19:49.591
<v Speaker 4>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1690
01:19:49.591 --> 01:19:50.670
<v Speaker 4>there are limits to how far you want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take it because there's.</v>

1691
01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:53.410
<v Speaker 4>They're not too many simple,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clean,</v>

1692
01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:58.440
<v Speaker 4>painless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>easy ways to do seeing that still </v>

1693
01:19:58.440 --> 01:19:58.440
<v Speaker 4>deliver the goods that people that rely </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

1694
01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:02.791
<v Speaker 4>So it's a very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why he's the same thing as the </v>

1695
01:20:02.791 --> 01:20:05.101
<v Speaker 4>stuff we were saying earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any kind of dogmatic position about </v>

1696
01:20:05.101 --> 01:20:07.861
<v Speaker 4>these either the scuttle animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just here for us to use an Okr </v>

1697
01:20:07.861 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 4>sweater and</v>

1698
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.100
<v Speaker 1>a software horribly or the poor little </v>
<v Speaker 1>band.</v>

1699
01:20:11.101 --> 01:20:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can touch anything.</v>

1700
01:20:12.511 --> 01:20:14.850
<v Speaker 1>I've missed the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three colors,</v>

1701
01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:19.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both have a point that they are </v>

1702
01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:19.880
<v Speaker 1>both ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If taken too far.</v>

1703
01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen the video of a woman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She walks into a restaurant and tells </v>

1704
01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:26.610
<v Speaker 1>everyone in the restaurant that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're eating is not food.</v>

1705
01:20:26.611 --> 01:20:27.870
<v Speaker 1>It's violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1706
01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:29.250
<v Speaker 1>and she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes in,</v>

1707
01:20:29.251 --> 01:20:31.200
<v Speaker 1>she tells everybody about her little </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>

1708
01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you about my little girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's chicken.</v>

1709
01:20:33.721 --> 01:20:36.000
<v Speaker 1>She's talking about.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They complain and rant goes viral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't food.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull this up and we'll have you seen </v>

1720
01:21:14.251 --> 01:21:19.251

<v Speaker 1>There was just that right before we </v>

1721
01:21:19.251 --> 01:21:19.300
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>

1722
01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.870
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know what's going on about </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill cosby,</v>

1723
01:21:21.871 --> 01:21:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Bill cosby going to be very careful how </v>
<v Speaker 1>I phrase this.</v>

1724
01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly has raped a large number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>women and allegedly has drug these women</v>

1725
01:21:34.530 --> 01:21:39.530
<v Speaker 1>and I mean I find it hard to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that 13 women would make something </v>

1726
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:44.240
<v Speaker 1>that's a large number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would have to be some massive </v>

1727
01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:45.270
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy dating back to the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies just now being uncovered.</v>

1728
01:21:45.630 --> 01:21:48.180
<v Speaker 1>So he put this thing on his website </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>

1729
01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:49.650
<v Speaker 1>like me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and the meme being the print that you </v>

1731

<v Speaker 1>can add a meme generator and his said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy Monday and these people just went </v>

1732
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:04.040
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it,</v>

1733
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:06.900
<v Speaker 1>it went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got so ugly,</v>

1734
01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:10.530
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of them was like,</v>

1735
01:22:10.531 --> 01:22:13.830
<v Speaker 1>one of the first one was like more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>a dozen women have accused me of rape.</v>

1736
01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:17.940
<v Speaker 1>How can I hear you say no because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got like headphones on.</v>

1737
01:22:18.210 --> 01:22:20.100
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean you're pressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>charges?</v>

1738
01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1739
01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:24.390
<v Speaker 1>these are the mild ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1740
01:22:24.391 --> 01:22:27.090
<v Speaker 1>what was he thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking idiot.</v>

1741
01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:32.120
<v Speaker 1>What the hell was he thinking for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people believe that someone who</v>

1742
01:22:32.161 --> 01:22:34.240
<v Speaker 1>works for him did it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1743
01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Someone who works for him knew that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to like someone who is like a </v>

1744
01:22:39.710 --> 01:22:43.850
<v Speaker 1>website designer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to think like website </v>

1745
01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:43.850
<v Speaker 1>designers.</v>

1746
01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:45.570
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times younger people and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>even a woman.</v>

1747
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1748
01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:48.930
<v Speaker 1>it was like this fucking piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm working for him.</v>

1749
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Or a guy who is sympathetic to what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on and says,</v>

1750
01:22:51.601 --> 01:22:56.601
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I get this fucker that would </v>

1751
01:22:56.601 --> 01:22:56.601
<v Speaker 1>actually be ged?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

1752
01:22:56.601 --> 01:23:01.100
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they put a bunch of them that </v>

1753
01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:02.820
<v Speaker 1>were like really cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His on his website,</v>

1754
01:23:02.850 --> 01:23:07.850
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took some of the ones that people </v>

1755
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:10.231
<v Speaker 1>had created that were pg rated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the amount that were raped related </v>

1756
01:23:10.231 --> 01:23:11.800
<v Speaker 1>was so staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1757
01:23:11.801 --> 01:23:12.560
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1758
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:16.180
<v Speaker 1>what's he like in the news?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's has been like,</v>

1759
01:23:16.210 --> 01:23:21.210
<v Speaker 1>what have you heard about him in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>news over the last year has been the </v>

1760
01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:21.210
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1761
01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:21.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that's what's going to pop up.</v>

1762
01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Of course that's what's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and no one is a press charges is okay.</v>

1763
01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:28.330
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's.</v>

1764
01:23:28.331 --> 01:23:30.250
<v Speaker 1>It seems strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1765
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:35.800
<v Speaker 1>it seems like if you don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical evidence like,</v>

1766
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:38.470
<v Speaker 1>but you have 13 people telling a similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1767
01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:43.890
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pencils are from how long ago it is </v>

1768
01:23:43.890 --> 01:23:44.410
<v Speaker 1>because that's all statue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations.</v>

1769
01:23:44.411 --> 01:23:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Is there a statute of limitations on </v>
<v Speaker 1>rape?</v>

1770
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:50.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm as it and I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>

1771
01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I think there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that would save that 77 guy.</v>

1772
01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:55.540
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1773
01:23:55.570 --> 01:23:58.160
<v Speaker 1>This is a statute of limitations is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiser.</v>

1774
01:23:58.250 --> 01:24:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Central limitations on something so </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>

1775
01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes tricky though because of </v>

1776
01:24:05.670 --> 01:24:08.011
<v Speaker 1>course once you wait to report it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all physical evidence is gone and </v>

1777
01:24:08.011 --> 01:24:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Danny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to rely on a lot the newer kind</v>

1778
01:24:10.751 --> 01:24:13.120
<v Speaker 1>of evidence that's a lot harder to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>

1779
01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:18.490
<v Speaker 1>There is also that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about memory right discussed </v>

1780
01:24:18.490 --> 01:24:22.141
<v Speaker 1>earlier that human memory is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst pieces of evidence you could ever </v>

1781
01:24:22.141 --> 01:24:22.141
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

1782
01:24:22.141 --> 01:24:25.330
<v Speaker 1>There are people that I have had </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences with where they'll go,</v>

1783
01:24:25.331 --> 01:24:30.331
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember when we did this and did that </v>

1784
01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:30.331
<v Speaker 1>and blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

1785
01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never even been in there with,</v>

1786
01:24:31.301 --> 01:24:33.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went with us like,</v>

1787
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:35.350
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been to South Dakota.</v>

1788
01:24:35.610 --> 01:24:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't happen.</v>

1789
01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Or they remember the wrong state or </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1790
01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's memories are fucking terrible.</v>

1791
01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:46.620
<v Speaker 1>They're awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have this video will play this </v>

1792
01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:46.620
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll give her a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slicker.</v>

1793
01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:47.100
<v Speaker 1>She looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's done.</v>

1794
01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.730
<v Speaker 1>We did like an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all good.</v>

1795
01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to see this.</v>

1796
01:24:50.561 --> 01:24:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Please put your headphones on so you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear this stuff,</v>

1797
01:24:52.810 --> 01:24:55.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's not plugged in anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you of course,</v>

1798
01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.250
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it a chance.</v>

1799
01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Did she yank it out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1800
01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:02.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1801
01:25:02.321 --> 01:25:04.020
<v Speaker 1>we'll just play this and then we'll end </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1802
01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:09.360
<v Speaker 1>This is so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This woman walks in this restaurant and </v>

1803
01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.540
<v Speaker 1>there there's a whole group of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind her.</v>

1804
01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:17.620
<v Speaker 6>She walked into a restaurant and people </v>
<v Speaker 6>are eating little girl.</v>

1805
01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:22.690
<v Speaker 6>She was very abused for her entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was terrified.</v>

1806
01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.990
<v Speaker 6>She has a very determined look in her </v>
<v Speaker 6>eyes wherever she goes,</v>

1807
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:31.790
<v Speaker 6>and she was hurt and abused her entire </v>
<v Speaker 6>life because of this establishment and </v>

1808
01:25:31.871 --> 01:25:36.460
<v Speaker 6>because of establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was locked away.</v>

1809
01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:40.180
<v Speaker 6>She was hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She got nobody there for her.</v>

1810
01:25:40.930 --> 01:25:45.930
<v Speaker 6>She was crying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was scared every single moment and </v>

1811
01:25:46.301 --> 01:25:49.720
<v Speaker 6>because they're useful as had run out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she was going to be killed.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I can see you laughing.</v>

1813
01:25:55.580 --> 01:26:00.310
<v Speaker 6>It's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went in there with other humans.</v>

1814
01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:04.610
<v Speaker 6>I took her out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She wouldn't be with me right now.</v>

1815
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:10.090
<v Speaker 6>She wouldn't be gone just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all right everybody today.</v>

1816
01:26:15.250 --> 01:26:20.250
<v Speaker 6>There was other girls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they just wanted to live their life </v>

1817
01:26:26.730 --> 01:26:31.730
<v Speaker 6>and their bodies and every time you see </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone eating somebody else's ags or </v>

1818
01:26:41.241 --> 01:26:44.690
<v Speaker 6>somebody else's body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you are going to remember her name.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Her name is a beautiful little girl and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it didn't just violent is the best part.</v>

1820
01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:57.880
<v Speaker 6>They all come in and they all have a</v>

1821
01:26:57.890 --> 01:27:01.380
<v Speaker 1>sign like it's not just to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to have assigned it.</v>

1822
01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

1823
01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.810
<v Speaker 6>I think of her name every time,</v>

1824
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:15.460
<v Speaker 1>like these fucking pathetic people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are just so lucky.</v>

1825
01:27:15.461 --> 01:27:20.461
<v Speaker 1>Their ancestors ate meat to get them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>2014 idealistic little kids in this </v>

1826
01:27:22.630 --> 01:27:25.680
<v Speaker 1>video that you have the in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

1827
01:27:25.690 --> 01:27:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my girl is all perfect,</v>

1828
01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:35.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has this determined look in her </v>

1829
01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:35.210
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1830
01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:35.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't.</v>

1831
01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her expression never changed.</v>

1832
01:27:35.710 --> 01:27:39.490
<v Speaker 1>She's a fucking chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit and crazy lady.</v>

1833
01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.270
<v Speaker 1>That is one of my favorite videos ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she's just so bonkers.</v>

1834
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Like I see you smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>

1835
01:27:46.541 --> 01:27:49.120
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why we're smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because you're kind of crazy.</v>

1836
01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:53.320
<v Speaker 1>You're walking into a chicken restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 1>with more people and Jamie's right.</v>

1837
01:27:53.321 --> 01:27:55.880
<v Speaker 1>There's more people came with her that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in the restaurant.</v>

1838
01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.820
<v Speaker 1>What's the at like two in the afternoon </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some flower.</v>

1839
01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:02.140
<v Speaker 1>It was just so strange.</v>

1840
01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:07.860
<v Speaker 6>She's a little girl,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just turban looking her wherever she </v>

1841
01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:09.250
<v Speaker 6>goes and she just went to live and </v>
<v Speaker 6>people are eating her eggs.</v>

1842
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat my chicken's eggs and they don't </v>

1843
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.470
<v Speaker 1>care at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

1844
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Because the eggs don't become a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking dunce.</v>

1845
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just eggs.</v>

1846
01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.550
<v Speaker 1>When you have chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have chickens as pets.</v>

1847
01:28:19.551 --> 01:28:21.010
<v Speaker 1>They provide you with free protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1848
01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:23.600
<v Speaker 1>You give them food and they give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>protein.</v>

1849
01:28:23.601 --> 01:28:25.550
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't hurt anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't harm them.</v>

1850
01:28:25.551 --> 01:28:27.380
<v Speaker 1>They have chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lay eggs every day.</v>

1851
01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea that you're their milk.</v>

1852
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:30.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1853
01:28:30.591 --> 01:28:31.530
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no chicken meal.</v>

1854
01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Never seem to stay away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't breastfeed,</v>

1855
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:40.820
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1856
01:28:40.890 --> 01:28:43.160
<v Speaker 1>that is the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the spectrum.</v>

1857
01:28:43.161 --> 01:28:48.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity is important and </v>

1858
01:28:48.161 --> 01:28:48.350
<v Speaker 1>understanding of nature's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've been accused,</v>

1859
01:28:48.351 --> 01:28:53.351
<v Speaker 1>especially lately since I've last couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of years since I started hunting of </v>

1860
01:28:53.351 --> 01:28:55.820
<v Speaker 1>being cruel of doing it because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy killing animals.</v>

1861
01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

1862
01:28:57.681 --> 01:29:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy bringing home the meat.</v>

1863
01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:05.370
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the killing of the animals,</v>

1864
01:29:05.371 --> 01:29:06.770
<v Speaker 1>the worst part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1865
01:29:06.771 --> 01:29:11.771
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you're able to take an </v>

1866
01:29:11.771 --> 01:29:13.590
<v Speaker 1>animal out of nature though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the most natural environment,</v>

1867
01:29:13.591 --> 01:29:18.591
<v Speaker 1>possibly if I didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that animal would be doing the exact </v>

1868
01:29:18.591 --> 01:29:19.860
<v Speaker 1>same thing until I came along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no influence whatsoever on its</v>

1869
01:29:19.861 --> 01:29:21.990
<v Speaker 1>life and then all sudden boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ends,</v>

1870
01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:25.250
<v Speaker 1>which is going to end by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to end by,</v>

1871
01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:28.080
<v Speaker 1>especially where I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was up in Canada where they have,</v>

1872
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:33.470
<v Speaker 1>they have so many wolves up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no limit on how many wolves </v>

1873
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:34.700
<v Speaker 1>you can shoot serious that had begun to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth football,</v>

1874
01:29:34.701 --> 01:29:36.960
<v Speaker 1>a huge population problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

1875
01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Like they have elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have deer,</v>

1876
01:29:40.051 --> 01:29:43.620
<v Speaker 1>they have moose and the wolves are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing them left and right.</v>

1877
01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:46.110
<v Speaker 1>While we were up there and we actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>came upon,</v>

1878
01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:51.000
<v Speaker 1>we saw all these ravens that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>floating around this one area,</v>

1879
01:29:51.090 --> 01:29:54.000
<v Speaker 1>so we're trying to figure out what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that they were attracted to.</v>

1880
01:29:54.150 --> 01:29:59.150
<v Speaker 1>So we went over to it and we found this </v>
<v Speaker 1>moose calf that had been torn apart by </v>

1881
01:29:59.150 --> 01:30:03.030
<v Speaker 1>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the Moose calf.</v>

1882
01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it up on my instagram later so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys could see because you're not </v>

1883
01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:08.750
<v Speaker 1>going much left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>

1884
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:10.140
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just mangled.</v>

1885
01:30:10.141 --> 01:30:13.050
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy and it was wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves,</v>

1886
01:30:13.051 --> 01:30:14.670
<v Speaker 1>it taking it from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from its mother.</v>

1887
01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:18.510
<v Speaker 1>And they just figured out a way to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahold of it and just ripped apart.</v>

1888
01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>devoured it,</v>

1889
01:30:19.921 --> 01:30:22.010
<v Speaker 1>and it was hair all over the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

1890
01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:25.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the reality of that life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the get it.</v>

1891
01:30:25.351 --> 01:30:30.351
<v Speaker 1>And then what's left?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coyotes get that and then what's </v>

1892
01:30:30.351 --> 01:30:30.351
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1893
01:30:30.351 --> 01:30:33.870
<v Speaker 1>any other scavengers get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a much more likely death.</v>

1894
01:30:33.871 --> 01:30:37.060
<v Speaker 1>And by hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hunter death is the least likely.</v>

1895
01:30:37.061 --> 01:30:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1896
01:30:38.290 --> 01:30:39.300
<v Speaker 1>And in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1897
01:30:39.301 --> 01:30:44.301
<v Speaker 1>to me it's like everything is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>die as long as they are not doing where </v>

1898
01:30:44.301 --> 01:30:46.470
<v Speaker 1>you are wiping out with a species and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>long as they are not doing where you are</v>

1899
01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.620
<v Speaker 1>at Dean and necessity pain to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

1900
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:51.660
<v Speaker 1>then that's the nature of the business.</v>

1901
01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what this woman is doing by running into</v>

1902
01:30:54.001 --> 01:30:58.110
<v Speaker 1>that restaurant and say it's not food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's violence,</v>

1903
01:30:58.730 --> 01:31:01.410
<v Speaker 1>like you're kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're missing the whole point.</v>

1904
01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.530
<v Speaker 1>You're missing the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not violence.</v>

1905
01:31:04.531 --> 01:31:07.890
<v Speaker 1>It's ending life so that you could eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and yeah,</v>

1906
01:31:07.891 --> 01:31:11.850
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a crazy way to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're detached from it.</v>

1907
01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.170
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right about that.</v>

1908
01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:18.440
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a shitty communication </v>

1909
01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:20.391
<v Speaker 1>strategy because I'm sure she can have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>point where she's at it because there </v>

1910
01:31:20.391 --> 01:31:21.360
<v Speaker 1>are issues that we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Commercial farming that are nasty,</v>

1911
01:31:21.361 --> 01:31:22.590
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1912
01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:24.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a way to communicate it to where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

1913
01:31:24.661 --> 01:31:25.470
<v Speaker 1>I would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1914
01:31:25.530 --> 01:31:26.880
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll make a good point.</v>

1915
01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:31.881
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we can tweak the lows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A tiny beat to do it in a more humane </v>

1916
01:31:31.881 --> 01:31:31.881
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thought that they agree.</v>

1917
01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.570
<v Speaker 1>You go like these are preaching to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>choir.</v>

1918
01:31:33.570 --> 01:31:36.630
<v Speaker 1>You only have like pan out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who feel the exact same way.</v>

1919
01:31:36.631 --> 01:31:39.560
<v Speaker 1>You do agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if somebody is 80 percent,</v>

1920
01:31:39.570 --> 01:31:41.340
<v Speaker 1>the other way you'll get are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at you and go like,</v>

1921
01:31:41.341 --> 01:31:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really went off the deep end.</v>

1922
01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:46.380
<v Speaker 1>She's emotionally unbalanced and on top </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

1923
01:31:46.650 --> 01:31:48.960
<v Speaker 1>that leads people to want to kill more </v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens.</v>

1924
01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:54.440
<v Speaker 1>It really does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have this guy that I'm friends </v>

1925
01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:58.341
<v Speaker 1>with up in Alaska or in BC rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that runs this hunting camp and he would</v>

1926
01:31:58.711 --> 01:32:02.680
<v Speaker 1>get these death threats from people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they would be hunting wolves and</v>

1927
01:32:02.681 --> 01:32:05.740
<v Speaker 1>the reason why they hunt wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had one of their cows torn apart by</v>

1928
01:32:05.741 --> 01:32:10.741
<v Speaker 1>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These 30 wolves got ahold of a cow and </v>

1929
01:32:10.741 --> 01:32:11.830
<v Speaker 1>ripped it apart while the people were in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house and their hand.</v>

1930
01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:18.400
<v Speaker 1>They look out the window and they see </v>
<v Speaker 1>this wolves bringing down a cow and </v>

1931
01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:18.400
<v Speaker 1>kill.</v>

1932
01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.990
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1933
01:32:19.991 --> 01:32:24.991
<v Speaker 1>Do to look out your window and see this </v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 pound animal get taken out by this </v>

1934
01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:28.360
<v Speaker 1>pack of wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderous animals.</v>

1935
01:32:28.370 --> 01:32:30.220
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be pretty cool,</v>

1936
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:35.310
<v Speaker 1>but also pretty goddamn terrifying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fans and people do get killed by wolves </v>

1937
01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:37.150
<v Speaker 1>and they certainly did in large numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the day,</v>

1938
01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:40.030
<v Speaker 1>which is why the Little Red Riding Hood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big bad wolf.</v>

1939
01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:42.580
<v Speaker 1>We don't think about that today because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an issue,</v>

1940
01:32:42.581 --> 01:32:47.581
<v Speaker 1>but there was many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times throughout history where </v>

1941
01:32:47.581 --> 01:32:50.841
<v Speaker 1>wolves and killed people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you google like wolf desk by people </v>

1942
01:32:50.841 --> 01:32:53.980
<v Speaker 1>before we had eradicated like large </v>
<v Speaker 1>populations of the wolves,</v>

1943
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:56.470
<v Speaker 1>there was actually a ceasefire in world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war one.</v>

1944
01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Remember that story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1945
01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:03.180
<v Speaker 1>The Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans and the Russians actually </v>

1946
01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:05.170
<v Speaker 1>called a ceasefire because so many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them were getting killed by wolves.</v>

1947
01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:06.040
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1948
01:33:06.041 --> 01:33:07.210
<v Speaker 1>let's just stop killing each other.</v>

1949
01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Fuck these wolves up real bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't go back to kill each other.</v>

1950
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:14.650
<v Speaker 1>That's how nutty wolves are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these,</v>

1951
01:33:14.670 --> 01:33:17.050
<v Speaker 1>these people were sending this guy death</v>
<v Speaker 1>threats,</v>

1952
01:33:17.051 --> 01:33:19.000
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you send me a death threat,</v>

1953
01:33:19.001 --> 01:33:24.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to shoot a wolf in the guts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they stopped sending death </v>

1954
01:33:24.851 --> 01:33:26.740
<v Speaker 1>threats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just stopped posting.</v>

1955
01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:31.960
<v Speaker 1>This woman was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to post a new page every day </v>

1956
01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:31.960
<v Speaker 1>if you banned me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make a new name.</v>

1957
01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:31.960
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1958
01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Every time you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

1959
01:33:32.501 --> 01:33:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Shoot a wolf in the guts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silence.</v>

1960
01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured that the care of business </v>

1961
01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:40.930
<v Speaker 1>really is a way of communicating where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just like,</v>

1962
01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:44.560
<v Speaker 1>you think it's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't she thinks it's fun shooting the</v>

1963
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:49.570
<v Speaker 1>gun so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's really a way to </v>

1964
01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:52.470
<v Speaker 1>communicate to the guests of the job is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like most people like to communicate and</v>

1965
01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:53.910
<v Speaker 1>preach to the choir kind of way.</v>

1966
01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Most people communicate in a way that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to see that anywhere you are </v>

1967
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:59.260
<v Speaker 1>coming from the person they are talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1968
01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:02.950
<v Speaker 1>They're only considering where they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming through them and they want you to</v>

1969
01:34:03.010 --> 01:34:05.380
<v Speaker 1>feel what they're feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're thinking.</v>

1970
01:34:05.381 --> 01:34:10.381
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only they want to force their ideology </v>

1971
01:34:10.381 --> 01:34:12.370
<v Speaker 1>on you and in that sense like veganism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and vegetarianism is sort of a religion.</v>

1972
01:34:12.371 --> 01:34:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Just like we're talking about atheism </v>
<v Speaker 1>plus as a religion.</v>

1973
01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:19.190
<v Speaker 1>So is being a Christian and so is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mormon and you know,</v>

1974
01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:21.130
<v Speaker 1>it's like its ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all.</v>

1975
01:34:21.131 --> 01:34:22.280
<v Speaker 1>It's all thought processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1976
01:34:22.281 --> 01:34:24.250
<v Speaker 1>you could label it and call it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

1977
01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:25.530
<v Speaker 1>You could label it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1978
01:34:25.570 --> 01:34:27.280
<v Speaker 1>call it a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could call it whatever you want,</v>

1979
01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:32.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's just thought processes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought patterns that you want other </v>

1980
01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:36.691
<v Speaker 1>people to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want them to express </v>

1981
01:34:36.691 --> 01:34:36.691
<v Speaker 1>themselves and you can look at it from </v>
<v Speaker 1>their point of view.</v>

1982
01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:37.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just want.</v>

1983
01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:40.360
<v Speaker 1>You want them to know and you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not.</v>

1984
01:34:40.361 --> 01:34:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Food is violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1985
01:34:42.071 --> 01:34:43.690
<v Speaker 1>it's food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually is food.</v>

1986
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:46.400
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking chicken and I'm about to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat and you.</v>

1987
01:34:46.401 --> 01:34:51.401
<v Speaker 1>You crazy bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You came in with all these meek fucking </v>

1988
01:34:51.401 --> 01:34:53.380
<v Speaker 1>low blood sugar freaks holding up signs </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking you got to change the world.</v>

1989
01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Changing Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go get a job.</v>

1990
01:34:54.851 --> 01:34:56.530
<v Speaker 1>What are you guys doing here at 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the afternoon?</v>

1991
01:34:56.710 --> 01:34:57.950
<v Speaker 1>How are you feeding yourself?</v>

1992
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:59.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you have jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>

1993
01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:04.640
<v Speaker 3>Your fucking parents are putting you </v>
<v Speaker 3>through schools that was going on here </v>

1994
01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:06.850
<v Speaker 3>and the thing there is like our many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's minds have you just changed by </v>

1995
01:35:06.850 --> 01:35:07.670
<v Speaker 3>doing zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>zero point zero.</v>

1996
01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:12.880
<v Speaker 3>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you believe that you're 100 </v>

1997
01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.300
<v Speaker 3>percent right in your message,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to the drawing board and look at</v>

1998
01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:16.160
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you just did is bullshit because it</v>

1999
01:35:16.161 --> 01:35:18.740
<v Speaker 3>doesn't lead to any single person being </v>
<v Speaker 3>convinced,</v>

2000
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:21.260
<v Speaker 3>so figure out a better communication </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy because you suck.</v>

2001
01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She needs to get on some IOWASCA.</v>

2002
01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:29.680
<v Speaker 3>Fucking elves would let her know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chickens are going to die no matter </v>

2003
01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:29.680
<v Speaker 3>what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bitch.</v>

2004
01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:29.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

2005
01:35:29.871 --> 01:35:31.820
<v Speaker 3>Last time I did DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked them about hunting.</v>

2006
01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:33.320
<v Speaker 3>I asked it and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2007
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:38.350
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's literally what they said went </v>

2008
01:35:38.391 --> 01:35:40.610
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had this thought in my head.</v>

2009
01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:41.430
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2010
01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.730
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his hunting and is it,</v>

2011
01:35:44.150 --> 01:35:46.600
<v Speaker 3>is it morally acceptable?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there anything wrong with hunting?</v>

2012
01:35:46.601 --> 01:35:47.180
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>

2013
01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:52.420
<v Speaker 3>Of course they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like showing me all these </v>

2014
01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:52.420
<v Speaker 3>different things about life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2015
01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:52.420
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to die,</v>

2016
01:35:52.930 --> 01:35:54.020
<v Speaker 3>dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything dies.</v>

2017
01:35:54.021 --> 01:35:59.021
<v Speaker 3>It all goes into this thing and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>showing me all these fractal reality and</v>

2018
01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:03.370
<v Speaker 3>I felt silly for asking that question </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I have to tell you about that.</v>

2019
01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:08.380
<v Speaker 3>My one and only dmt experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty fun because I did it </v>

2020
01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:10.860
<v Speaker 3>with Duncan Duncan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's hating it.</v>

2021
01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Then he's like seeing God and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe said he has these big smile on </v>

2022
01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.670
<v Speaker 3>his face and he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an I'm just like,</v>

2023
01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:23.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at him and I think you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>the goofiest buster I've ever seen.</v>

2024
01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:27.830
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't just laughing my ass off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've not seen have him to seem and I</v>

2025
01:36:27.831 --> 01:36:28.580
<v Speaker 3>keep hitting it.</v>

2026
01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:31.850
<v Speaker 3>So like there should be an at one point </v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2027
01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:34.760
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my perception is changing.</v>

2028
01:36:34.761 --> 01:36:39.761
<v Speaker 3>I am beginning to a vision because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>see that Duncan ceiling is all warped </v>

2029
01:36:39.761 --> 01:36:43.181
<v Speaker 3>and weird and then eventually come down </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the experience and I realize that </v>

2030
01:36:43.181 --> 01:36:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin is really just weird that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't working.</v>

2031
01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:48.840
<v Speaker 3>I was working in the sense that he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the biggest,</v>

2032
01:36:48.841 --> 01:36:50.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like the biggest weed,</v>

2033
01:36:50.251 --> 01:36:54.230
<v Speaker 3>the high in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had the big body high,</v>

2034
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:59.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt it really sinking into the couch </v>

2035
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.610
<v Speaker 3>and melting into the couch and I failed </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2036
01:36:59.630 --> 01:37:03.930
<v Speaker 3>That like every thing was hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did not have a fish.</v>

2037
01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:05.300
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one.</v>

2038
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:07.430
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took as much as Duncan beaten again.</v>

2039
01:37:07.431 --> 01:37:08.750
<v Speaker 3>He was out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2040
01:37:08.751 --> 01:37:13.610
<v Speaker 3>spacing out with Cosmo Molson </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion.</v>

2041
01:37:13.611 --> 01:37:18.611
<v Speaker 3>You were like passing it back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like you were getting at the </v>

2042
01:37:18.611 --> 01:37:21.521
<v Speaker 3>same depth as what they do say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain percentage of people </v>

2043
01:37:21.521 --> 01:37:24.360
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't work on and I'm sure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the next time you take one more.</v>

2044
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:29.410
<v Speaker 3>What is it like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long was after a while I was getting</v>

2045
01:37:30.531 --> 01:37:31.190
<v Speaker 3>mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2046
01:37:31.191 --> 01:37:36.191
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we'd wherever,</v>

2047
01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:41.570
<v Speaker 3>like I'll take a hit of weed and in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>afternoon or in the evening and I'm </v>

2048
01:37:41.691 --> 01:37:43.330
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I barely affects me.</v>

2049
01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:44.090
<v Speaker 3>It's pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2050
01:37:44.091 --> 01:37:46.190
<v Speaker 3>he's reading glasses on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a very male kind of way.</v>

2051
01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:49.190
<v Speaker 3>If I do it before lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean another,</v>

2052
01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:49.950
<v Speaker 3>you won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

2053
01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:52.810
<v Speaker 3>Once I met is a horrible mistake with </v>
<v Speaker 3>David Seaman.</v>

2054
01:37:52.811 --> 01:37:57.811
<v Speaker 3>Like before it podcast he offered me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I took a hit and I didn't eat </v>

2055
01:37:57.811 --> 01:38:00.750
<v Speaker 3>before and all of a sudden in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this podcast that he's like,</v>

2056
01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:04.170
<v Speaker 3>I hear him talk and he heard that his </v>
<v Speaker 3>voice is coming.</v>

2057
01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:06.510
<v Speaker 3>The sentence is coming to an end and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

2058
01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:12.160
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm going to say.</v>

2059
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same substance,</v>

2060
01:38:17.670 --> 01:38:21.680
<v Speaker 1>one heat versus painting another case </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the 10 where it's like,</v>

2061
01:38:22.170 --> 01:38:25.610
<v Speaker 1>it's also different kinds of weed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some really strong stuff,</v>

2062
01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:28.610
<v Speaker 1>but that's a dmt things weird that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked on Duncan and not you.</v>

2063
01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if maybe it's one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2064
01:38:31.401 --> 01:38:36.401
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those things where you have that </v>

2065
01:38:36.401 --> 01:38:36.401
<v Speaker 1>thing where you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work on,</v>

2066
