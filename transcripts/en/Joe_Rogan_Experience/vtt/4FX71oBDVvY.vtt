1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.280
<v Speaker 1>To get squirrely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.130
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta ask Donnie Vincent who made that</v>

5
00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:10.570
<v Speaker 2>knife because people always ask me about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

6
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.030
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have used it on Saturday.</v>

7
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.670
<v Speaker 2>When is dfc the side that you guys were </v>
<v Speaker 2>on where you guys were in the crowd?</v>

8
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Did anybody jump toward you that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

9
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.350
<v Speaker 2>The crowd mainly started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was because we were.</v>

10
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.213
<v Speaker 2>We had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure we had Irish right in </v>

11
00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:31.114
<v Speaker 2>front of us and right in front of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>was some of Khabib's guys and Khabib's </v>

12
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.863
<v Speaker 2>guys were turning around just literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing the fingers right to the Irish </v>

13
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:46.171
<v Speaker 2>guys the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then once that happened it was like I</v>

14
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:48.820
<v Speaker 2>was lucky though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had A.</v>

15
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had already and Whitney right there.</v>

16
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.590
<v Speaker 2>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were there to protect you?</v>

17
00:00:53.591 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

18
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.370
<v Speaker 2>they were in full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown down.</v>

19
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.963
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the dumb people just kind </v>

20
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:02.590
<v Speaker 2>of looking around like the mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody has there.</v>

21
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Any immediate danger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

22
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.590
<v Speaker 2>it A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

23
00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 2>obviously it seemed way worse over on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your side,</v>

24
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.173
<v Speaker 2>but I was more worried when they made us</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave because the further up you got in </v>

25
00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:15.844
<v Speaker 2>the bleachers and once you got out into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the concession area and in the </v>

26
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:20.410
<v Speaker 2>bathrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where stuff was going down.</v>

27
00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Like just people from the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

28
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.853
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys with Irish flags all obviously </v>

29
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:26.734
<v Speaker 2>we're getting trashed talk to them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a big brawl right next to me </v>

30
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 2>on the other side from where they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting.</v>

31
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one just to our right.</v>

32
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.613
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was the guy that jumped in </v>

33
00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:37.924
<v Speaker 2>and the registered on convenience team </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were trying to leave and </v>

34
00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:41.740
<v Speaker 2>they're getting them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the crowd or like,</v>

35
00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start throwing shit at them first.</v>

36
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.373
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the first shit was getting </v>

37
00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 2>thrown down and some other people know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was them.</v>

38
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.040
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all saw it.</v>

39
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.570
<v Speaker 2>She saw them as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the guy,</v>

40
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 2>that's the guy right there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

41
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:54.880
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

42
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 2>And he went and tried to do something </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was doing but,</v>

43
00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

44
00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a price to be paid for all this </v>

45
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all the,</v>

46
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.170
<v Speaker 1>all the drama and the trash talk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes it so fun.</v>

47
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.750
<v Speaker 1>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:10.400
<v Speaker 1>it has the potential for blown up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your face ultimately.</v>

49
00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:11.234
<v Speaker 1>Like couple people got punched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was in an event where a bunch of </v>

50
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.910
<v Speaker 1>people got punched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

51
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:18.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like way more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

52
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what I'm saying,</v>

53
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:21.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we made it seem.</v>

54
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.813
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like it was way worse than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>really was because in any other </v>

55
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 1>situation it would be way worse than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>really was.</v>

56
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Like if it was a rock concert and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes just from,</v>

57
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one band was the opening band and </v>

58
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>then there was another band that was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bra with them and they were,</v>

59
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.403
<v Speaker 1>they were the main event and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fans of one band through down with the </v>

60
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:47.180
<v Speaker 1>fans of the other band of beat the shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of each other.</v>

61
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>That would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

62
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.780
<v Speaker 1>be way worse than when it's at a fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if it's at a fight,</v>

63
00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:54.920
<v Speaker 1>it's just fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

64
00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:56.800
<v Speaker 1>I saw this in St.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cloud.</v>

65
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.573
<v Speaker 1>This was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This insane clown posse guy tried to </v>

66
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:02.434
<v Speaker 1>drop kick Fred durst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't even looking at them running </v>

67
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>headstart and Mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look her.</v>

68
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

69
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>And he just kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen drag that dude off.</v>

70
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is maybe the worst public </v>
<v Speaker 1>drop kick in the history of the world.</v>

71
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I think they meant he dropped when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to kick while he tried.</v>

72
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>That was a classic dropkick classic pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling dropkick.</v>

73
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:29.194
<v Speaker 1>But his problem is he threw it like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pro wrestler would where you don't </v>

74
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 1>really hit the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

75
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Just kinda touched him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if Fred was playing along,</v>

76
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>it would have been awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need a slow mo re.</v>

77
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Fred would have went flying and it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been,</v>

78
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

79
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.650
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's going through people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds too is when you're in a fight like</v>

81
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:49.894
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people in the crowd </v>

82
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>that can throw down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

83
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to a well if you go to a hard,</v>

84
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.893
<v Speaker 1>a hard rock concert of any kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clay Guido is going to be there </v>

85
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>somewhere obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as long as you can avoid clay,</v>

86
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.493
<v Speaker 1>like your opportunity of finding a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can really throw cuffs is going to </v>

87
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>be way smaller than when you're at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC and you look around.</v>

88
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 1>It's hard not to see cauliflower ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean someone who's in the crowd,</v>

89
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>that's just a shit talker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows.</v>

90
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:24.211
<v Speaker 1>If I just turn around and talk shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get wrapped up and be dead quick.</v>

91
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very high number of people that</v>

92
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>could fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of those events,</v>

93
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>it's probably like 30 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 percent of the people in the audience</v>

94
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>actually know how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's high.</v>

95
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that I think it'd be higher at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC,</v>

96
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.890
<v Speaker 1>at least a basic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's about 30,</v>

97
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.443
<v Speaker 1>I'd say about 30 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you just like parcy </v>

98
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:47.610
<v Speaker 1>audience out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how many,</v>

99
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>how many you guys ever been punched?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many guys ever fuck somebody up.</v>

100
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 1>How many guys actually trained?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many guys know how to train and like</v>

101
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Speaker 1>do it on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many guys are in shape?</v>

102
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.903
<v Speaker 1>Like if shit went down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many guys could actually throw down </v>

103
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:02.370
<v Speaker 1>for a solid 37 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

104
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.660
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

105
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 1>that's where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I would shine.</v>

106
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to ride this out for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and then these,</v>

107
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:10.723
<v Speaker 1>these draft elk legs are getting ready </v>
<v Speaker 1>to frigging started dancing on some </v>

108
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:14.463
<v Speaker 1>April.</v>

109
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Let's beat the spazz out for a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>while and then,</v>

110
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>then I'm good people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.170
<v Speaker 1>when people were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

112
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.073
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connor in his conditioning for this </v>

113
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:25.331
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

114
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I'm Cam Cam Hanes</v>
<v Speaker 1>said was like,</v>

115
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs to start running,</v>

116
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>like go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go run in the hills.</v>

117
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:34.680
<v Speaker 1>And my dad ain't going to help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

118
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 1>it would help some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

119
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 1>when someone's wrestling you and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of you,</v>

120
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:44.370
<v Speaker 1>fucking you up like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just get,</v>

121
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.413
<v Speaker 1>you're just getting drained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a vampire just sucking blood </v>

122
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:49.910
<v Speaker 1>out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

123
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>you're exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You carrying all their weight and you're</v>

124
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 1>getting beat up and you're stressed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're trying to.</v>

125
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>And you can't breathe well because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's weight is on top of you,</v>

126
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.243
<v Speaker 1>so you're not getting like real breaths </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're constantly resisting their </v>

127
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:05.474
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's way easier for them that it is </v>

128
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:07.994
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way easy to stay on top than it is </v>

129
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 1>to be on the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a disaster.</v>

130
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

131
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.560
<v Speaker 2>people that grew up wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

132
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 2>you look at Miller Mendez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quita,</v>

133
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.113
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys have experienced that </v>

134
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.810
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

135
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.760
<v Speaker 2>it's ingrained in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most wrestlers don't lose like a classic</v>

136
00:06:27.761 --> 00:06:29.830
<v Speaker 2>wrestling physique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even as adults,</v>

137
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.770
<v Speaker 2>they still look like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

138
00:06:32.771 --> 00:06:35.080
<v Speaker 2>they were guys that were real athletic </v>
<v Speaker 2>at one time.</v>

139
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.980
<v Speaker 2>I remember one of the first things my </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad taught me,</v>

140
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was younger in school,</v>

141
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:42.240
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

142
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was after the first guy </v>

143
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.020
<v Speaker 2>wanted to fight me on the playground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

144
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.003
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know if the guy's good at </v>

145
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.273
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it unless he's a </v>

146
00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:51.790
<v Speaker 2>wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

147
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:54.550
<v Speaker 2>just if it's a wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to back down.</v>

148
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what to do.</v>

149
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

150
00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.713
<v Speaker 1>it was classic this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this weekend when I was watching that </v>

151
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:02.234
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

152
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

153
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 1>This is just a classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna,</v>

154
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connor had like 30 seconds,</v>

155
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.510
<v Speaker 1>they've started those rounds and then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just a mauling yeah.</v>

156
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Well John Cavanaugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's connors trainer,</v>

157
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:14.564
<v Speaker 1>it will be here next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be here at 11 and we'll </v>

<v Speaker 1>get a chance to talk to him and see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck he thinks and what happened.</v>

159
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 1>And the bottom line is that guy is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much better than him as a grappler.</v>

160
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.820
<v Speaker 1>So much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he is on such a high level.</v>

161
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 1>When I talked to Daniel Cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel called me.</v>

162
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.643
<v Speaker 1>He says that guy schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldclass wrestlers in the gym just </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

165
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:44.180
<v Speaker 1>He's just mentioned this training.</v>

166
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.013
<v Speaker 1>Special talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been wrestling since he was a </v>

167
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 1>little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

168
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.493
<v Speaker 1>I mean he really has this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen the video of him </v>

169
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:52.810
<v Speaker 1>wrestling a bear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

170
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 1>but I want you to ever sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

171
00:07:54.321 --> 00:07:58.970
<v Speaker 1>but I want to fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's him wrestling a brown bear.</v>

172
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like a small brown bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Russian brown bear.</v>

173
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.363
<v Speaker 1>Like our version of a grizzly in Russia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's saying like coastal peninsula </v>

174
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:10.220
<v Speaker 1>bear like a peninsula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

175
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

176
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's him.</v>

177
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>When he's a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

178
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

179
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.260
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck lets their kid there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bears bite them.</v>

180
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>The Bear's bite and I'm looking as bare </v>
<v Speaker 1>as biting his clothes.</v>

181
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Bears a total cheater which prepared </v>
<v Speaker 1>them for connor this weekend.</v>

182
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.013
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of do a lot of cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I were to setup position would be </v>

183
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:37.390
<v Speaker 1>making a bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave a position because of the bite.</v>

184
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.480
<v Speaker 1>You see that he was on top and the bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>pit him and he let the get on top.</v>

185
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Now he's until it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this,</v>

186
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bears are squirrely.</v>

187
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Man and bears have a really good guard.</v>

188
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.350
<v Speaker 1>He's laughing that at Sam as a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

189
00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 97.</v>

190
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't do that stuff in America.</v>

191
00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.413
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

192
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if Mendez got to go out and just</v>

193
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 1>wrestle bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how little he is too.</v>

194
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a little kid there,</v>

195
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he's about eight years old</v>

196
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.173
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the neighborhood I grew up </v>

197
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.243
<v Speaker 1>with the cheetahs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably had one of these in the </v>

198
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 1>garage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bearer.</v>

199
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clay and Jason.</v>

200
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.650
<v Speaker 1>They were both kind of nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they did wrestle some barriers.</v>

201
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:26.180
<v Speaker 1>What state was it was in Illinois.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that were the Johnsburg yeah.</v>

202
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is awesome.</v>

203
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's interesting?</v>

204
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

205
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.593
<v Speaker 1>why does he bite back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't get that training that don't do </v>

206
00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:37.840
<v Speaker 1>that because in the bear is really going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get into looking at it.</v>

207
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 1>We're just trying to bite his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shifts just a little bear,</v>

208
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.380
<v Speaker 1>but his dad just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them ride it out.</v>

209
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.161
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

210
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:47.710
<v Speaker 1>the barrier is obviously being nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're having fun and even though it's,</v>

211
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when a dog's bite and you know</v>

212
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.710
<v Speaker 1>when you're playing with them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're done,</v>

213
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.710
<v Speaker 1>they're not trying to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that,</v>

214
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:57.770
<v Speaker 1>but also on a chain which is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up because the bear can't think.</v>

215
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean that beard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guard.</v>

216
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bears have a very good guard.</v>

217
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says low.</v>

218
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians are fucking different.</v>

219
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Different breed and as things are hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there,</v>

220

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just guys.</v>

233
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.660
<v Speaker 1>And in as much as we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>

234
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.610
<v Speaker 1>he impressed me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stand up.</v>

235
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He cracked his right hand.</v>

236
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:54.570
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

237
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.910
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stood up enough to just say,</v>

238
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sit here and take a few and</v>

239
00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:00.954
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he went to probably what his </v>

240
00:11:02.521 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 1>game plan was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would assume.</v>

241
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.423
<v Speaker 1>Well you have to stand for a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>while because if he just shoots in who </v>

242
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:10.740
<v Speaker 1>get caught with a knee or caught with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch rushing in.</v>

243
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.870
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

244
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean he landed the bigger shot.</v>

245
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.170
<v Speaker 1>There was one big giant shot that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>landed in that fight and it was by hand.</v>

246
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.550
<v Speaker 1>He hit them with some pretty good front </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick to the body and some other things,</v>

247
00:11:23.551 --> 00:11:25.470
<v Speaker 1>but didn't really get much off on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

248
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.333
<v Speaker 1>Not like classic left Jabs that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>break people down and on the ground he </v>

249
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:31.254
<v Speaker 1>just got mall and it's one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things where you see that guy in the </v>

250
00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:35.424
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys fight them off a little bit and </v>

251
00:11:37.171 --> 00:11:38.004
<v Speaker 1>then as the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas on he just gets more and more </v>

252
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:42.960
<v Speaker 1>dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get more and more exhausted.</v>

253
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.063
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fight just makes ally acquaint to </v>

254
00:11:45.101 --> 00:11:46.830
<v Speaker 1>look like a god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

255
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 1>that's the most impressive thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

256
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Ally Quintin went five rounds with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stood toe to toe with him and you know,</v>

257
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.360
<v Speaker 1>gave him at least a struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least he gave him a bit of adversity,</v>

258
00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.453
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to survive on the ground much </v>

259
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 1>better than conor did.</v>

260
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Manage to get back up to his feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage the stuff,</v>

261
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of take downs and on the feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a real threat,</v>

262
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:09.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously Khabib didn't prepare </v>

263
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 1>for ally Quinta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He prepared for Connor,</v>

264
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.910
<v Speaker 1>but ally acquainted didn't even prepare </v>
<v Speaker 1>for five rounds.</v>

265
00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Speaker 1>The only prepared for three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was so much to that fight.</v>

266
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 1>What do you think will happen with </v>
<v Speaker 1>conner now?</v>

267
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens with Khabib,</v>

268
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I hope they sit everybody down and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

269
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.860
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>

270
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

271
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.153
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the guy who rushed into the cage and </v>

272
00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.630
<v Speaker 1>punch connor in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

273
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 1>that guy should be in the most trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know the guy just fought for</v>

274
00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:43.270
<v Speaker 1>rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got the fuck beaten out of them,</v>

275
00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:45.640
<v Speaker 1>got choked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard a lot of people.</v>

276
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:51.160
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of silly non experts out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there saying that that wasn't a choke or</v>

277
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.780
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a neck crank.</v>

278
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.943
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what the fuck they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about that that is absolutely a </v>

279
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:57.304
<v Speaker 1>neck crank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone gets their arm around your </v>

280
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:00.754
<v Speaker 1>head like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what they do is they grab it </v>

281
00:13:03.341 --> 00:13:04.174
<v Speaker 1>like this and they pinched the elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put the forearm on his back like </v>

282
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:10.564
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as the arm is across the neck and </v>

283
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:13.114
<v Speaker 1>then they grip it like this and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forearm goes into the back and pulling </v>

284
00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:17.644
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're pushing with your forum and </v>

285
00:13:18.941 --> 00:13:19.774
<v Speaker 1>Yanking with your hand is a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck crank 'em they call dean lister </v>

286
00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:25.700
<v Speaker 1>actually has a video on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

287
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.920
<v Speaker 1>He calls it the fulcrum choke and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty choke.</v>

288
00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:30.754
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was going under the neck </v>

289
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:34.570
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see it here,</v>

290
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.210
<v Speaker 1>dean lister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a world champion,</v>

291
00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my friend Hans.</v>

292
00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Hans Mellencamp behind them and watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>how he does it,</v>

293
00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:46.330
<v Speaker 1>see how he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's grabbing a hold of it.</v>

294
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.630
<v Speaker 1>And what he's gonna do is it's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>clamp his hands,</v>

295
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.100
<v Speaker 1>cle grips his hands and so it crushes is</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this.</v>

296
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:53.611
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

297
00:13:53.611 --> 00:13:54.190
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

298
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.023
<v Speaker 1>You can go right over your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can go over your neck and go over </v>

299
00:13:57.761 --> 00:13:59.920
<v Speaker 1>your face and go over your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheekbones.</v>

300
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.083
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even have to go under the </v>

301
00:14:02.351 --> 00:14:04.000
<v Speaker 1>chin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it goes into the chin,</v>

302
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:04.834
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see what's going on with his </v>

303
00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:08.230
<v Speaker 1>forearm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See how he's pull,</v>

304
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.720
<v Speaker 1>push,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull arms.</v>

305
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do it some.</v>

306
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.293
<v Speaker 1>Some guys do it like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think this is probably the best </v>

307
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:15.970
<v Speaker 1>way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you're right here,</v>

308
00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:19.360
<v Speaker 1>this part just digs that elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

309
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>

310
00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:23.040
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's pulling on it with his,</v>

311
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:23.973
<v Speaker 1>his right arm and then his left arm is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing down with his forum on Connor </v>

312
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a nasty,</v>

313
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:35.050
<v Speaker 1>nasty neck crank and your head is </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting popped off and first of all,</v>

314
00:14:35.051 --> 00:14:36.940
<v Speaker 1>that guy could squeeze the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

315
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.073
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of guys who could put </v>

316
00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:42.460
<v Speaker 1>you to sleep like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marcello Garcia is one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>without even getting under the chin.</v>

318
00:14:45.641 --> 00:14:46.474
<v Speaker 1>He just gets your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get your head in there and </v>

319
00:14:48.131 --> 00:14:49.900
<v Speaker 1>squeezes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo can do that too.</v>

320
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 1>If it gets your head in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even</v>

321
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.993

<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even have to be under the </v>

322
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:54.434
<v Speaker 2>chin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just really puts you to sleep with </v>

323
00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:57.284
<v Speaker 2>your own fucking head.</v>

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>

348
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.660
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

349
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

350
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.270
<v Speaker 2>there's parallels in archery for sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>because archery,</v>

351
00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.600
<v Speaker 2>it's what's really important is your </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>

352
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Your technique is almost everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like doing everything correctly.</v>

353
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:20.060
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same thing with Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with Moitai,</v>

354
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.290
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

355
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:22.124
<v Speaker 2>It's just technique and doing it over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and over again correctly until it's </v>

356
00:16:26.091 --> 00:16:27.440
<v Speaker 2>ingrained in your system.</v>

357
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's information overload for sure.</v>

358
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.040
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the hardest parts for me </v>
<v Speaker 2>is I'm so new at it.</v>

359
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.933
<v Speaker 2>Then I feel like my cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning is not at a level to take </v>

360
00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:40.364
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much going on and several </v>

361
00:16:43.761 --> 00:16:44.990
<v Speaker 2>people have told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

362
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.883
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There comes a point where all of a </v>

363
00:16:46.731 --> 00:16:48.290
<v Speaker 2>sudden it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

364
00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.560
<v Speaker 2>it's something clicks and you start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>comprehend everything,</v>

365
00:16:51.561 --> 00:16:53.750
<v Speaker 2>but until that moment happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

366
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to struggle to remember </v>

367
00:16:55.431 --> 00:16:58.220
<v Speaker 2>what you talked about last time or how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it exactly right.</v>

368
00:16:58.221 --> 00:17:02.750
<v Speaker 2>But eventually there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there comes a time when it clicks and it</v>

369
00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:03.770
<v Speaker 2>starts to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

370
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.240
<v Speaker 2>you do start to soak in stuff and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely not to that point yet.</v>

371
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just even some of the basic drills,</v>

372
00:17:11.241 --> 00:17:12.074
<v Speaker 2>the one thing I do understand that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were impressed by is just leverage on </v>

373
00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:18.920
<v Speaker 2>joints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

374
00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:21.890
<v Speaker 2>because they were talking about some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the different arm bars and stuff,</v>

375
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

376
00:17:22.911 --> 00:17:24.620
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the elbows like this,</v>

377
00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:25.101
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

378
00:17:25.101 --> 00:17:26.990
<v Speaker 2>that won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The elbow has to be like this.</v>

379
00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:29.450
<v Speaker 2>And I remember Damien looked at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you know that?</v>

380
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:30.021
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

381
00:17:30.021 --> 00:17:32.030
<v Speaker 2>how many arms I've dissected off </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

382
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:38.120
<v Speaker 2>If you have to knock four hooves off of </v>
<v Speaker 2>elk quarter to pack it out,</v>

383
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know where the joint is and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>

384
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 2>how to bend it and hit it just right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>crack that off.</v>

385
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.960
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

386
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.490
<v Speaker 2>hips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders,</v>

387
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.980
<v Speaker 2>even taking the head off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

388
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

389
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:50.963
<v Speaker 1>that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also your understanding of like the </v>

390
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:56.880
<v Speaker 1>proper positioning of your shoulders in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your elbow and everything in archery.</v>

391
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.300
<v Speaker 1>I think just an understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human body alone.</v>

392
00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that that helps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendously.</v>

393
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are really good at gymnastics.</v>

394
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Excel at Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were really good at break dance.</v>

395
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

396
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Breakdancers excel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

397
00:18:13.981 --> 00:18:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of yoga people,</v>

398
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.050
<v Speaker 1>they get really good at yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can excel at Jujitsu to.</v>

399
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a,</v>

400
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:24.120
<v Speaker 1>just an understanding of what the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body moves in my mind,</v>

401
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:24.973
<v Speaker 1>both mind body connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like being able to really have a mind </v>

402
00:18:29.971 --> 00:18:32.780
<v Speaker 1>muscle connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people don't understand that.</v>

403
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.290
<v Speaker 1>You tell them to do a pull up and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

404
00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:35.880
<v Speaker 1>you really want to use lattes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

405
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

406
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

407
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.480
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

408
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:41.700
<v Speaker 1>They just pull in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people when they,</v>

409
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.650
<v Speaker 1>when they pull a boat for the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

410
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:44.663
<v Speaker 1>even big guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they struggle pulling a boat because </v>

411
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.900
<v Speaker 1>they're not their techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor.</v>

412
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.060
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

413
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.640
<v Speaker 1>they're lifting apart or pulling all </v>
<v Speaker 1>with bicep down and it's like,</v>

414
00:18:53.641 --> 00:18:54.474
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you just lift up and goes straight </v>

415
00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:57.210
<v Speaker 1>back with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

416
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.660
<v Speaker 1>just certain muscles of the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they see it they're like,</v>

417
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.613
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just understanding of leverage </v>

418
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:04.973
<v Speaker 1>in muscle and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they understand that flow it gets </v>

419
00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:08.514
<v Speaker 1>really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But until that it looks like they're </v>

420
00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:15.540
<v Speaker 1>trying to literally do a Max rep gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>

421
00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:16.374
<v Speaker 1>But it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably have done it a million </v>

422
00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:23.700
<v Speaker 1>times so your arms are so conditioned to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

423
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:26.140
<v Speaker 1>It's such a natural movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.</v>

424
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably several million.</v>

425
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say probably several.</v>

426
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Well here's a perfect example of use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>

427
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.200
<v Speaker 1>even if they have like a strong left </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm,</v>

428
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:35.610
<v Speaker 1>like if I go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flex your arm,</v>

429
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.030
<v Speaker 1>you see a good left Bicep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you look got good shoulders and</v>

430
00:19:39.031 --> 00:19:39.864
<v Speaker 1>you left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I bring you to a heavy bag and </v>

431
00:19:41.491 --> 00:19:45.600
<v Speaker 1>I say throw a left hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people's left hooks are fucking dog</v>

432
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.210
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just straight up talk shit.</v>

433
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Hit somebody to throw out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it just,</v>

434
00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.680
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't like someone throw a baseball</v>

435
00:19:55.681 --> 00:19:57.390
<v Speaker 1>lefthanded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just looks terrible.</v>

436
00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:58.283
<v Speaker 1>It's even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you might be able to throw </v>

437
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.910
<v Speaker 1>because the concept of throwing seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>

438
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:08.060
<v Speaker 1>But the concept of digging in with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>toes and turning your body into the hook</v>

439
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.250
<v Speaker 1>and then if you do it and you just do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly,</v>

440
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:13.110
<v Speaker 1>just bang and hit a bag.</v>

441
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.310
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing that?</v>

442
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.380
<v Speaker 1>And he just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just get used to it.</v>

443
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 1>For the [inaudible] when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was striking all the time,</v>

444
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.590
<v Speaker 1>my left bicep was quite a bit larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than my right one.</v>

445
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.090
<v Speaker 1>My left arm was actually stronger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>my right because you're always jabbing,</v>

446
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.143
<v Speaker 1>you always jabbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jabbing and hooking and you throwing </v>

447
00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:34.260
<v Speaker 1>less right hands and you are left hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my left side was bigger,</v>

448
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.990
<v Speaker 1>like my left arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a bit like I could see it.</v>

449
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.063
<v Speaker 1>Like if I flex the two of them together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my left bicep look larger and that's a </v>

450
00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:43.300
<v Speaker 1>normal thing with boxers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

451
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.183
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not a person switch the </v>

452
00:20:46.151 --> 00:20:49.660
<v Speaker 1>stances and you yourself in an orthodox </v>
<v Speaker 1>stance with your left leg forward,</v>

453
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.550
<v Speaker 1>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have a stronger lefthand.</v>

454
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.553
<v Speaker 1>Like I would be able to open things </v>
<v Speaker 1>better with my left hand and my right </v>

455
00:20:54.911 --> 00:20:55.630
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>

456
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Not Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

457
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:57.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

458
00:20:57.011 --> 00:20:59.410
<v Speaker 1>you're in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're turning so much too,</v>

459
00:20:59.411 --> 00:21:02.950
<v Speaker 1>so I mean I guess when you're snapping </v>
<v Speaker 1>back you're kind of soup and aiding the.</v>

460
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.680
<v Speaker 1>When you come back think it's just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>

461
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.080
<v Speaker 1>just the sheer number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the.</v>

462
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:12.370
<v Speaker 1>If you looked at like a really good box </v>
<v Speaker 1>or left hand versus right hand,</v>

463
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:15.100
<v Speaker 1>you might throw two to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe three to one,</v>

464
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.110
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 slash three to three to one.</v>

465
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing it right,</v>

466
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:20.733
<v Speaker 1>you know you're supposed to be jabbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than you are just throwing </v>

467
00:21:22.091 --> 00:21:24.520
<v Speaker 1>haymakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well one of my,</v>

468
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.383
<v Speaker 1>one of the highlights of the fight there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were several Ferguson's match was </v>

469
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:31.270
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson's incredible.</v>

470
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean incredible too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy had catastrophic knee surgery,</v>

471
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.920
<v Speaker 1>like his knee was so blown out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

472
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.780
<v Speaker 1>they were not sure if he was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to fight again.</v>

473
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.053
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's gonna happen here </v>

474
00:21:43.241 --> 00:21:47.020
<v Speaker 1>because he had ripped his tendon </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely off the bone.</v>

475
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.850
<v Speaker 1>The scar on his leg is enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His scars like 12 inches long,</v>

476
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.203
<v Speaker 1>that fucking massive scar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had to open him up like a fish </v>

477
00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.393
<v Speaker 1>and then they have to get in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to bolt down that ligament to </v>

478
00:22:00.461 --> 00:22:01.600
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the bone.</v>

479
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Were they able to use the same one back </v>
<v Speaker 1>down?</v>

480
00:22:03.821 --> 00:22:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had surgery almost immediately</v>

481
00:22:07.001 --> 00:22:07.834
<v Speaker 1>after the injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have to have a cadaver or </v>

482
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:12.310
<v Speaker 1>anything like that and the way they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

483
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.353
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I honestly don't know exactly what was </v>

484
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:17.010
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look at that knee.</v>

485
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Cut The fucking name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

486
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.600
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

487
00:22:22.601 --> 00:22:23.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is incredible.</v>

488
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.940
<v Speaker 1>And then six months later he's not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>healed up.</v>

489
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.310
<v Speaker 1>He's got Anthony Pettis kicking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>leg.</v>

490
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're very concerned in the beginning of</v>

491
00:22:32.411 --> 00:22:33.244
<v Speaker 1>the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked like he got hurt on that leg </v>

492
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.593
<v Speaker 1>because pedes hit that leg twice really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard and it looked like he was wobbly a </v>

493
00:22:41.981 --> 00:22:46.390
<v Speaker 1>little bit on that leg was going to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>he survived a catastrophic flurry.</v>

494
00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is caught him.</v>

495
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came back big time because it didn't </v>

496
00:22:52.151 --> 00:22:52.984
<v Speaker 1>look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were several fighters that dug </v>

497
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 1>really deep that we're in trouble and </v>
<v Speaker 1>came back for some awesome.</v>

498
00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Come back about Derrick Lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the best.</v>

499
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.270
<v Speaker 1>He's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's my official favorite now.</v>

500
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking post fight interviews.</v>

504
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:15.773

<v Speaker 1>Donald trump called me and said I got </v>

<v Speaker 1>make get everybody look bad.</v>

506
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:27.120
<v Speaker 1>When I was putting shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the crowd and I'm like.</v>

507
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.270
<v Speaker 1>I looked at Sharon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say his balls were.</v>

508
00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:32.650
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

509
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.970
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he did.</v>

510
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he put the crowd.</v>

511
00:23:35.351 --> 00:23:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think appreciated it as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people back home.</v>

512
00:23:37.401 --> 00:23:38.234
<v Speaker 1>It was hard to hear people back home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got it straight from his mic into </v>

513
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:43.840
<v Speaker 1>their TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got the full version of it.</v>

514
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was muffled.</v>

515
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Pretty hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so classic.</v>

516
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.880
<v Speaker 1>He so funny man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

517
00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.880
<v Speaker 1>and what a fucking punch her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

518
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.130
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can that guy crack?</v>

519
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Because he was down as down as you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

520
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's basically three rounds in the cam,</v>

521
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 1>three rounds in the hole and 30 seconds </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go.</v>

522
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.093
<v Speaker 1>We were saying that we were saying it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the commentary that he still has the </v>

523
00:24:09.891 --> 00:24:14.150
<v Speaker 1>kind of power where one shot could win </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight and people like,</v>

524
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:14.751
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

525
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:16.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as you're going to live,</v>

526
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.670
<v Speaker 2>that's what's hard about being live at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight.</v>

527
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.140
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

528
00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.453
<v Speaker 2>you don't really get the commentary and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your guys's commentary so good when </v>

529
00:24:27.991 --> 00:24:28.824
<v Speaker 2>you're watching on paper view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dissecting so many things that you </v>

530
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:32.581
<v Speaker 2>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

531
00:24:32.581 --> 00:24:35.730
<v Speaker 2>unless you're a very seasoned at </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching mma,</v>

532
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.680
<v Speaker 2>you don't appreciate a lot of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

533
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.230
<v Speaker 2>And when you're watching with no one's </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion,</v>

534
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.393
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of just watching and waiting</v>
<v Speaker 2>for something like that to happen where </v>

535
00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:44.843
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of times you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling that you're seeing some of that </v>

536
00:24:47.821 --> 00:24:50.220
<v Speaker 2>stuff that needs to happen or should </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

537
00:24:50.221 --> 00:24:52.230
<v Speaker 2>And they used to have this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get.</v>

538
00:24:52.231 --> 00:24:55.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they have it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a little FM radio.</v>

539
00:24:55.141 --> 00:24:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Did you see it at the scene?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It in a while?</v>

540
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they have it anymore,</v>

541
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.350
<v Speaker 2>but it used to be a little thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>

542
00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.213
<v Speaker 2>you would buy at the gift shop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like a little in a doubled as an FM </v>

543
00:25:05.671 --> 00:25:06.504
<v Speaker 2>radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you used it like it would still </v>

544
00:25:08.161 --> 00:25:08.994
<v Speaker 2>would work somewhere else as a radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you keep it on a certain </v>

545
00:25:11.281 --> 00:25:12.114
<v Speaker 2>frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would broadcast the commentary so </v>

546
00:25:14.461 --> 00:25:15.294
<v Speaker 2>you would get the commentary and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it in your ear while the fight was </v>

547
00:25:18.031 --> 00:25:18.600
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

548
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is one of the things that that's </v>

549
00:25:21.121 --> 00:25:23.270
<v Speaker 2>missing just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

550
00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's just there's something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>being in the building.</v>

551
00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.000
<v Speaker 2>Especially that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

552
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:34.400
<v Speaker 2>there was just electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Sha radiating from person to person</v>

553
00:25:34.511 --> 00:25:35.910
<v Speaker 2>in the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was electric.</v>

554
00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was probably the biggest UFC of all</v>

555
00:25:39.601 --> 00:25:42.750
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it has to be one of them,</v>

556
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know.</v>

557
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:45.643
<v Speaker 1>I won't know for another day or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's the most important </v>

558
00:25:48.981 --> 00:25:53.981
<v Speaker 1>fight of all time because connor being </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a huge superstar and then being out</v>

559
00:25:55.011 --> 00:26:00.011
<v Speaker 1>of mma for two solid years and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>Khabib just being so dominant 26 and.</v>

560
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:02.443
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there was also like the </v>

561
00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:05.990
<v Speaker 1>controversy of like how he won the </v>
<v Speaker 1>title.</v>

562
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he won the title last minute.</v>

563
00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:09.740
<v Speaker 1>He was supposed to be fighting Tony </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson.</v>

564
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:10.603
<v Speaker 1>Tony gets injured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ally Quinta steps up and it's further </v>

565
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.260
<v Speaker 1>title and everyone is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

566
00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:16.430
<v Speaker 1>How is that for the title?</v>

567
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

568
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.770
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing was just very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very weird.</v>

569
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.873
<v Speaker 2>If there's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rematch which you would think numbers </v>

570
00:26:24.701 --> 00:26:25.930
<v Speaker 2>wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has to be.</v>

571
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't think there'd be a rematch.</v>

572
00:26:28.241 --> 00:26:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Not for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

573
00:26:29.861 --> 00:26:30.694
<v Speaker 2>what's awesome is if there isn't and </v>
<v Speaker 2>counter the counter politics or out of </v>

574
00:26:34.771 --> 00:26:39.771
<v Speaker 2>that weight class now some of the fights</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd get to see like I'd love to see him</v>

575
00:26:41.291 --> 00:26:44.110
<v Speaker 2>in Ferguson would be bringing fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

576
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.850
<v Speaker 1>a fight 100 percent now after ferguson </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated pedis like that.</v>

577
00:26:47.851 --> 00:26:50.550
<v Speaker 1>And then also overcame that big shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he got hurt.</v>

578
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

579
00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see mcgregor versus can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be begin.</v>

580
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was going to be any </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

581
00:26:56.641 --> 00:26:58.950
<v Speaker 1>There's so many more that would just be </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

582
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.170
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see it in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

583
00:27:01.171 --> 00:27:04.800
<v Speaker 1>but connor would have to do something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show that he,</v>

584
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:05.813
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is absolutely a factor in that he </v>

585
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.640
<v Speaker 1>had not been fighting for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

586
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:18.000
<v Speaker 1>One boxing match in two years is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>not good enough for MMA.</v>

587
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Especially with wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just not good enough.</v>

588
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:24.870
<v Speaker 1>And then I think he would have to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

589
00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:28.620
<v Speaker 1>really concentrate on is wrestling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even that.</v>

590
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:30.031
<v Speaker 1>Even that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

591
00:27:30.031 --> 00:27:31.990
<v Speaker 1>how much better can you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude?</v>

592
00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.440
<v Speaker 1>That guy was wrestling a bear as a kid.</v>

593
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so much better.</v>

594
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:37.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to have to go back in time </v>

595
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:41.850
<v Speaker 1>and rethink this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

596
00:27:41.851 --> 00:27:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Khabib might just have his number for </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

597
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what [inaudible] said.</v>

598
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking for me after the fight,</v>

599
00:27:48.721 --> 00:27:49.710
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

600
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:51.510
<v Speaker 1>listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never going to beat him.</v>

601
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never going to beat him.</v>

602
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:54.953
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think you can ever get to the </v>

603
00:27:55.921 --> 00:27:58.320
<v Speaker 1>point where he'd get his take down </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense up enough.</v>

604
00:27:58.321 --> 00:27:59.610
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll never happen.</v>

605
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.500
<v Speaker 1>He's never going to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too far away.</v>

606
00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.510
<v Speaker 2>He's got to get a just a clean one shot </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just ends up.</v>

607
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:09.260
<v Speaker 2>That would be it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that in my field too.</v>

608
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean I stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I stay honed,</v>

609
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.790
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not like razor sharp in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>

610
00:28:16.791 --> 00:28:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Just so like you mean like target </v>
<v Speaker 2>archery?</v>

611
00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're going to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

612
00:28:20.091 --> 00:28:22.340
<v Speaker 2>People all the time say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you,</v>

613
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.233
<v Speaker 2>why don't you compete in it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I shoot better than most people at </v>

614
00:28:28.161 --> 00:28:30.080
<v Speaker 2>this point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

615
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I can answer that without question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I shoot at a,</v>

616
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.700
<v Speaker 2>at a word?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like could I have beat myself when I was</v>

617
00:28:37.701 --> 00:28:39.050
<v Speaker 2>shooting on the teams?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>

618
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Like that was a different person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I stepped away for,</v>

619
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.910
<v Speaker 2>for two or three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I contemplated coming back,</v>

620
00:28:46.911 --> 00:28:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this commitment is going to take a year,</v>

621
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:55.570
<v Speaker 2>two years of really fine tuning because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean at those levels,</v>

622
00:28:56.151 --> 00:28:58.340
<v Speaker 2>people don't miss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

623
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.280
<v Speaker 2>so missing one or two still means it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>weekend,</v>

624
00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.173
<v Speaker 2>it's still a tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have to be flawless and if </v>

625
00:29:05.631 --> 00:29:08.390
<v Speaker 2>you're not flawless then all you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is donating money.</v>

626
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.580
<v Speaker 2>And when you compete in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>tournaments with the distance,</v>

627
00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.370
<v Speaker 2>it depended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were several different formats,</v>

628
00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.293
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere from 18 meters which you were </v>

629
00:29:16.371 --> 00:29:20.090
<v Speaker 2>shooting at something the size of a dime</v>
<v Speaker 2>in most of those,</v>

630
00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a 600 round you would need to be,</v>

631
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.640
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I was shooting like,</v>

632
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:28.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upper five nineties,</v>

633
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm at something the size of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining what that means.</v>

634
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:36.770
<v Speaker 2>So like to hit that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit that exercise of a dime as a 10.</v>

635
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.570
<v Speaker 2>So you would have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

636
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.520
<v Speaker 2>literally says she times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

637
00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:44.110
<v Speaker 2>out of arrows in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in like in tournament play,</v>

638
00:29:44.111 --> 00:29:46.480
<v Speaker 2>you would have to hit that dime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

639
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:48.780
<v Speaker 2>57 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

640
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:54.090
<v Speaker 2>and then when we went out to the longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>distances up to 90 meters,</v>

641
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.353
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be shooting something a </v>

642
00:29:56.891 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 2>little bit larger than the end of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Coffee Cup.</v>

643
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to,</v>

644
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.250
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be deadly accurate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing.</v>

645
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:04.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to be in,</v>

646
00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.020
<v Speaker 2>in the high 90 percentile of being able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hit that</v>

647
00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:10.790
<v Speaker 1>and you also get used to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

648
00:30:10.791 --> 00:30:14.510
<v Speaker 1>You get sharper because your minds in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that place that all the time,</v>

649
00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.270
<v Speaker 1>that's the hardest part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're on the game,</v>

650
00:30:17.271 --> 00:30:20.640
<v Speaker 1>which there's been times like this past </v>
<v Speaker 1>summer,</v>

651
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a event that I did for um,</v>

652
00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:24.923
<v Speaker 2>a Cabela's experience where some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kybella is black signature card members </v>

653
00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:30.870
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess bought an experience.</v>

654
00:30:30.871 --> 00:30:33.870
<v Speaker 2>And I did some training at the Easton </v>
<v Speaker 2>Center with them.</v>

655
00:30:33.871 --> 00:30:36.480
<v Speaker 2>And then we went and shot the total </v>
<v Speaker 2>archery challenge in,</v>

656
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.670
<v Speaker 2>in Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we talked,</v>

657
00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:42.430
<v Speaker 2>I talked through the technicalities of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you would do on each shot,</v>

658
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:43.583
<v Speaker 2>what the total archery challenges for </v>
<v Speaker 2>total archery challenge is a tournament </v>

659
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.530
<v Speaker 2>that order's not even a tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more of a fun event where they set,</v>

660
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:54.590
<v Speaker 2>it's in snowbird and they set archery </v>
<v Speaker 2>targets like in real hunting situations,</v>

661
00:30:55.291 --> 00:30:57.570
<v Speaker 2>but with very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very technical shots,</v>

662
00:30:57.571 --> 00:31:00.360
<v Speaker 2>extreme angles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer distances.</v>

663
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:04.680
<v Speaker 2>He got cross winds and canyons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>snowbird from people don't know is a ski</v>

664
00:31:04.681 --> 00:31:05.514
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that actually have the video </v>

665
00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.740
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

666
00:31:10.741 --> 00:31:12.500
<v Speaker 2>it's just very technical because</v>

667
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.560
<v Speaker 1>you're the footings poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

668
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.760
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the total archery challenge.</v>

669
00:31:16.761 --> 00:31:20.000
<v Speaker 1>So it's really interesting because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the summertime,</v>

670
00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's at a ski place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ski range,</v>

671
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:23.930
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Ski,</v>

672
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:25.610
<v Speaker 1>what'd you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

673
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:26.750
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

674
00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:28.820
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a ski lodge.</v>

675
00:31:28.821 --> 00:31:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is,</v>

676
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:32.330
<v Speaker 1>what is where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the flips.</v>

677
00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.800
<v Speaker 1>It's literally a resort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

678
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:34.683
<v Speaker 1>Snowbird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take the ski lifts up to where </v>

679
00:31:37.551 --> 00:31:40.400
<v Speaker 1>these things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

680
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:45.350
<v Speaker 1>these targets are all set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were all these foam deer and foam,</v>

681
00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:50.090
<v Speaker 1>sheep and all these different game </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and they're at extreme distances</v>

682
00:31:50.091 --> 00:31:52.270
<v Speaker 1>and weird angles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take</v>

683
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.233
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

684
00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:54.123
<v Speaker 2>take the tram all the way to the top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mountain and then you literally </v>

685
00:31:57.831 --> 00:32:00.650
<v Speaker 2>shoot down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was about six miles for us to</v>

686
00:32:00.651 --> 00:32:03.230
<v Speaker 2>get down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think our total walk one day was about</v>

687
00:32:03.231 --> 00:32:05.250
<v Speaker 2>six miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

688
00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.260
<v Speaker 2>but I shot it with this group and taught</v>
<v Speaker 2>them the technicalities of it.</v>

689
00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:13.010
<v Speaker 2>And because of that I really wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be prepared.</v>

690
00:32:13.011 --> 00:32:15.320
<v Speaker 2>I knew that there was going to be people</v>
<v Speaker 2>there watching.</v>

691
00:32:15.321 --> 00:32:16.154
<v Speaker 2>I knew that because I stepped into an </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual event where there were a few </v>

692
00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:20.953
<v Speaker 2>thousand archers there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew that there was going to be a lot </v>

693
00:32:22.461 --> 00:32:26.810
<v Speaker 2>of people watching me because I haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone out into that realm in a while.</v>

694
00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:29.390
<v Speaker 2>It would be no different than a false </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

695
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.310
<v Speaker 2>you were out of mma for awhile and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>went in there,</v>

696
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be eyes on you.</v>

697
00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.000
<v Speaker 2>So I just wanted to be on my game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

698
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 2>or as best as I could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've set a goal,</v>

699
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I set a goal of like,</v>

700
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:49.340
<v Speaker 2>I think it was around 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrows I wanted to shoot prior to that.</v>

701
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:54.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm so over a course of just a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

702
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:55.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

703
00:32:55.551 --> 00:32:58.880
<v Speaker 2>I think the one day I shot round $500 a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

704
00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:00.950
<v Speaker 2>A tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a timelapse one of those,</v>

705
00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:02.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

706
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:07.430
<v Speaker 2>but once you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're totally on your game,</v>

707
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:12.770
<v Speaker 2>if you have to shoot with other guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are elite level athletes,</v>

708
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 2>there's still a lot that goes into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>

709
00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:17.360
<v Speaker 2>And especially if you're shooting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>score,</v>

710
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.960
<v Speaker 2>you're shooting for money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those pressure factors,</v>

711
00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:21.794
<v Speaker 2>if you're not acclimated to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those aren't things that you can just </v>

712
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:25.370
<v Speaker 2>step back into.</v>

713
00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:29.900
<v Speaker 2>When I was my best as a competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always like,</v>

714
00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:34.901
<v Speaker 2>my practice was almost at tournaments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every weekend it was 40 something events</v>

715
00:33:37.611 --> 00:33:38.660
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

716
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:39.583
<v Speaker 2>every three days you're at a tournament </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the heat of the moment with the best </v>

717
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:47.950
<v Speaker 2>five or six people in the world and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go home for a few days to repack you</v>

718
00:33:48.591 --> 00:33:51.590
<v Speaker 2>retune and then you're right back in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>grind again,</v>

719
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:56.620
<v Speaker 2>somebody's got stripped of a title </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they tested positive for thc and</v>

720
00:33:56.631 --> 00:33:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Beta blockers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is real recent,</v>

721
00:33:59.001 --> 00:33:59.834
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

722
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I competed.</v>

723
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>

724
00:34:02.721 --> 00:34:03.554
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you a year depending on what level </v>

725
00:34:05.811 --> 00:34:09.310
<v Speaker 2>you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was because I shot with the U,</v>

726
00:34:09.311 --> 00:34:10.144
<v Speaker 2>s team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain tournament's didn't have doping </v>

727
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.280
<v Speaker 2>and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you shot anything that was on a</v>

728
00:34:16.281 --> 00:34:19.340
<v Speaker 2>world level you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was always in a doping pool,</v>

729
00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:22.490
<v Speaker 2>so it was no different than like when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

730
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.390
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

731
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:26.540
<v Speaker 2>with Chad Mendez at a Turkey hunt and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>made a testing pool.</v>

732
00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

733
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:29.390
<v Speaker 2>So they would test your blood or your </v>
<v Speaker 2>urine.</v>

734
00:34:29.391 --> 00:34:30.650
<v Speaker 2>What would the test?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either one.</v>

735
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'd be on call,</v>

736
00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.940
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to live with Beta blockers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that,</v>

737
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:39.210
<v Speaker 2>what do they do you ever told that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know that it's supposed to kill alarms,</v>

738
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think it blocks adrenaline,</v>

739
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:42.973
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ability for your brain to dump </v>

740
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:46.310
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

741
00:34:46.311 --> 00:34:47.144
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number one thing in archery or any </v>

742
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:51.690
<v Speaker 2>type of finesse sport is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

743
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:56.310
<v Speaker 2>low heart rate keeping your heart rate </v>
<v Speaker 2>down because that's obviously keeping,</v>

744
00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping your mind in the game.</v>

745
00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stability.</v>

746
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Very minimal movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

747
00:35:02.811 --> 00:35:03.650
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

748
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.770
<v Speaker 2>I remember I had a coach a long time </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

749
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:07.693
<v Speaker 2>he talked about um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol and how alcohol could help </v>

750
00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.153
<v Speaker 2>shooter because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about a guy that had </v>

751
00:35:13.641 --> 00:35:15.740
<v Speaker 2>done well at tournament several times </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>

752
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:16.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he always does.</v>

753
00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:17.751
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

754
00:35:17.751 --> 00:35:19.760
<v Speaker 2>he's always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's always drunk.</v>

755
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.040
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>

756
00:35:22.041 --> 00:35:22.940
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

757
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:23.803
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you play alcohol the right way and </v>

758
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:29.330
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not sloppy drunk,</v>

759
00:35:29.331 --> 00:35:30.550
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

760
00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:31.371
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

761
00:35:31.371 --> 00:35:35.240
<v Speaker 2>he just stays in his zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just kinda sitting there drinking</v>

762
00:35:35.241 --> 00:35:36.074
<v Speaker 2>the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was like prior to where they </v>

763
00:35:38.491 --> 00:35:41.460
<v Speaker 2>were testing for alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he actually made us,</v>

764
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

765
00:35:42.721 --> 00:35:44.390
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's see how you,</v>

766
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.590
<v Speaker 2>how you do if you shoot when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>buzz going.</v>

767
00:35:46.591 --> 00:35:47.840
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

768
00:35:47.841 --> 00:35:51.060
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we drank and shot and uh,</v>

769
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't try this at home kids,</v>

770
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.820
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't an archery range where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to buy insurance or whatever.</v>

771
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:58.140
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

772
00:35:58.141 --> 00:35:59.010
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

773
00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:02.970
<v Speaker 2>that was part of it because at the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>this was in the mid nineties,</v>

774
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.153
<v Speaker 2>another archer that had won a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>titles also tested positive for Beta </v>

775
00:36:09.301 --> 00:36:12.000
<v Speaker 2>blockers and had some title stripped.</v>

776
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:13.583
<v Speaker 2>But then for the longest time that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my complaints was once I was </v>

777
00:36:16.771 --> 00:36:19.350
<v Speaker 2>shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at a level with,</v>

778
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:24.560
<v Speaker 2>with the teams and we had to go through </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing or be like if,</v>

779
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.110
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at an event when I met old,</v>

780
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.960
<v Speaker 2>if you're in the top three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately you get tested.</v>

781
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:32.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's how it is.</v>

782
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:35.580
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone there is level,</v>

783
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.430
<v Speaker 2>they're all level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you go to other events.</v>

784
00:36:38.431 --> 00:36:39.264
<v Speaker 2>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the biggest money events were </v>

785
00:36:42.061 --> 00:36:42.894
<v Speaker 2>the three d shoots and that was a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why I left those sheets because </v>

786
00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:49.110
<v Speaker 2>at those tournaments there was no </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing,</v>

787
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.273
<v Speaker 2>there was no testing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was clearly guys there that were </v>

788
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:54.930
<v Speaker 2>shooting that we're kind of just out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

789
00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.600
<v Speaker 2>There could be $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the line and there was just no,</v>

790
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:03.060
<v Speaker 2>not a sweat cracked because there were </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of that stuff.</v>

791
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:03.923
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it is a performance enhancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the fact they're not having </v>

792
00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:08.214
<v Speaker 2>to deal with adrenaline spikes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>accelerated heart rate for people don't </v>

793
00:37:11.851 --> 00:37:12.684
<v Speaker 2>know what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three d shoots are a type of tournament </v>

794
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:18.600
<v Speaker 2>where they have those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a realistic looking targets.</v>

795
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.350
<v Speaker 2>So foam elks or a foam bear and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

796
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>areas that you're supposed to hit.</v>

797
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:25.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

798
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:26.123
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing was I didn't like the </v>

799
00:37:28.771 --> 00:37:31.920
<v Speaker 2>fact that I'm at that time when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>scored,</v>

800
00:37:31.921 --> 00:37:34.950
<v Speaker 2>it was just based off if there's four </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys in the group,</v>

801
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.530
<v Speaker 2>whatever the majority voted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how it's scored.</v>

802
00:37:37.531 --> 00:37:38.364
<v Speaker 2>And when there's a lot of money online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like say you shot and I shot Jamie </v>

803
00:37:42.331 --> 00:37:46.170
<v Speaker 2>shop and Sharon shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd walk up and you know,</v>

804
00:37:46.171 --> 00:37:50.340
<v Speaker 2>it's their phone ring so the era could </v>
<v Speaker 2>look like it's in,</v>

805
00:37:50.341 --> 00:37:51.174
<v Speaker 2>it could look like it's out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a clear line and we would </v>

806
00:37:53.611 --> 00:37:54.540
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if me,</v>

807
00:37:54.541 --> 00:37:56.030
<v Speaker 2>you and Jamie said that's out.</v>

808
00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Then even if Sharon's was close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be out.</v>

809
00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was in some groups where things got</v>

810
00:38:02.521 --> 00:38:03.354
<v Speaker 2>a little shady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are wanting to make money and it </v>

811
00:38:05.401 --> 00:38:08.910
<v Speaker 2>got a parent that it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't a judge.</v>

812
00:38:08.911 --> 00:38:09.744
<v Speaker 2>They're calling every score,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which on a world level there's judges </v>

813
00:38:13.711 --> 00:38:14.544
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you guys were all competing </v>

814
00:38:15.421 --> 00:38:17.220
<v Speaker 2>against each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would call for each other.</v>

815
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.370
<v Speaker 2>I've seen groups where they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

816
00:38:20.371 --> 00:38:21.640
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

817
00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:23.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

818
00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:26.520
<v Speaker 2>I've seen groups where they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever tried their Beta blocker?</v>

819
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.230
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to know what that's like.</v>

820
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.430
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to do something nerve wracking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try a Beta blocker and then do something</v>

821
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:33.293
<v Speaker 2>fucking really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nerve wracking can mean any throw you </v>

822
00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:35.634
<v Speaker 2>out of</v>

823
00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.153
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you would like it whether I'd </v>

824
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:42.760
<v Speaker 1>like it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not happening.</v>

825
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not interested.</v>

826
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:47.650
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get much sketchier than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>roller coaster we're on.</v>

827
00:38:47.651 --> 00:38:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Yesterday we did the rollercoaster at </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>

828
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:51.590
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oof,</v>

829
00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.113
<v Speaker 1>sketch city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing felt like it was tied </v>

830
00:38:54.971 --> 00:38:59.971
<v Speaker 1>together with Bubblegum floss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels so uncomfortable.</v>

831
00:39:01.421 --> 00:39:02.254
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

832
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:06.790
<v Speaker 1>This is just way it's old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's outside.</v>

833
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:07.783
<v Speaker 1>Everything is outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're flying around the casino itself </v>

834
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:15.430
<v Speaker 1>like and the whole thing just feels like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be there.</v>

835
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.293
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's several things there </v>

836
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:20.220
<v Speaker 1>that are a little outdated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

837
00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the,</v>

838
00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one row behind you guys and uh,</v>

839
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:27.523
<v Speaker 1>I was next to this kid who had never </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridden a rollercoaster and he was </v>

840
00:39:30.191 --> 00:39:32.950
<v Speaker 1>terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was terrified and I thought,</v>

841
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.353
<v Speaker 1>have I just not been on one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>long for that long to where this feels </v>

842
00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:38.344
<v Speaker 1>like it could possibly shake off and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could launch on like what was the last </v>

843
00:39:42.371 --> 00:39:44.740
<v Speaker 1>time a rollercoaster did break loose?</v>

844
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Like when was the last side of someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something?</v>

845
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it happened.</v>

846
00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Something happened last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't show him one of those carnivals.</v>

847
00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Roll into town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

848
00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.593
<v Speaker 1>that's on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get on one of those fucking </v>

849
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:01.594
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at one a couple of years back and </v>

850
00:40:04.271 --> 00:40:07.960
<v Speaker 1>I took a picture of it for instagram </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there was a.</v>

851
00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.620
<v Speaker 1>This one of those whirlwind things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

852
00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:12.493
<v Speaker 1>rollercoaster derails to writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fall 30 feet to the ground and Daytona </v>

853
00:40:15.161 --> 00:40:16.120
<v Speaker 1>beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

854
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:19.030
<v Speaker 1>don't show me this either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just afterwards.</v>

855
00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

856
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got the live video.</v>

857
00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daytona beach.</v>

858
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:26.344
<v Speaker 1>But that's Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See anything that's fucked up could </v>

859
00:40:29.921 --> 00:40:30.754
<v Speaker 1>happen in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee that guy was fixing that on </v>

860
00:40:32.711 --> 00:40:33.544
<v Speaker 1>oxycontin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably got a python in his </v>

861
00:40:35.111 --> 00:40:37.810
<v Speaker 1>pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking assholes.</v>

862
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.793
<v Speaker 1>They need one of those in the buckies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they have a rollercoaster in a </v>

863
00:40:41.651 --> 00:40:42.280
<v Speaker 1>buckies yet?</v>

864
00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.590
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't need one.</v>

865
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Just Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas is not known for roller coasters.</v>

866
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:52.270
<v Speaker 1>That a little wiser than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you could wrestle grizzly bears in</v>

867
00:40:52.271 --> 00:40:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Texas though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if someone wanted to train.</v>

868
00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:55.803
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could probably shoot them to do </v>

869
00:40:57.161 --> 00:40:58.260
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

870
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:01.260
<v Speaker 1>We could do a brown bear wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>training camp.</v>

871
00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:05.170
<v Speaker 1>It's an exotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole thing about Texas,</v>

872
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.470
<v Speaker 1>like if thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's an exotic animal,</v>

873
00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.590
<v Speaker 1>meaning it's not indigenous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not native,</v>

874
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.420
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of do whatever the fuck you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to.</v>

875
00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:18.570
<v Speaker 1>It is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Text is a fascinating place.</v>

876
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:23.800
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the weird states that almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the land is private.</v>

877
00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:26.200
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a rare thing.</v>

878
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.063
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a public land system in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country with the bureau of land </v>

879
00:41:30.791 --> 00:41:33.380
<v Speaker 1>management and all the different</v>

880
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 2>national parks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like none of that in Texas.</v>

881
00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:40.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas is mostly just private ranches.</v>

882
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:42.523
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

883
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.693
<v Speaker 2>It's very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very weird that there's been roads </v>

884
00:41:45.891 --> 00:41:46.724
<v Speaker 2>I've been down where you're just driving</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for miles and miles and miles is </v>

885
00:41:49.461 --> 00:41:52.430
<v Speaker 2>nothing but high fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like people's private ranch is just</v>

886
00:41:52.431 --> 00:41:54.350
<v Speaker 2>like gated in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

887
00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:55.373
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's strange because they have these </v>

888
00:41:56.541 --> 00:42:01.541
<v Speaker 2>ranches that they seem like wilderness </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the ranch will be like 10,000</v>

889
00:42:02.871 --> 00:42:03.920
<v Speaker 2>acres.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

890
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:05.630
<v Speaker 2>But if it's 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>acres,</v>

891
00:42:05.631 --> 00:42:08.240
<v Speaker 2>it's fenced in and party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

892
00:42:08.241 --> 00:42:08.751
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

893
00:42:08.751 --> 00:42:11.360
<v Speaker 2>the whole country's fed fenced in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets to the ocean.</v>

894
00:42:11.361 --> 00:42:12.194
<v Speaker 2>He can't go any further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit's Kinda like a third that </v>

895
00:42:14.061 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 2>excuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there you guys how I look at it,</v>

896
00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:18.500
<v Speaker 2>you go far enough north,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hit the ice,</v>

897
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.660
<v Speaker 2>he hit the glaciers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

898
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Where you going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

899
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:27.860
<v Speaker 2>But there's something about that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

900
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:28.693
<v Speaker 2>Like that's one of the weirdest things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Texas is that they have these </v>

901
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:32.833
<v Speaker 2>enormous fenced in properties where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have all these African animals running </v>

902
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:38.084
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Neil guy and Elan's and you name </v>

903
00:42:41.211 --> 00:42:41.711
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

904
00:42:41.711 --> 00:42:43.410
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're zebra.</v>

905
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.293
<v Speaker 2>More of those animals running around in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas than they do in the wild of their </v>

906
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:51.140
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like oryx,</v>

907
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:52.940
<v Speaker 2>oryx.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

908
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.220
<v Speaker 2>they're threatened in other parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

909
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got a ton of them down there,</v>

910
00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got up fuck load and black books.</v>

911
00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of stuff.</v>

912
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have lots of stuff access the same </v>

913
00:43:03.381 --> 00:43:04.041
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

914
00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:06.220
<v Speaker 2>So how do you feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

915
00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.290
<v Speaker 2>if the place is like this is like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical argument,</v>

916
00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:10.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's 10,000</v>

917
00:43:10.851 --> 00:43:11.684
<v Speaker 2>acres and it's fenced in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's far greater than their natural </v>

918
00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:16.520
<v Speaker 2>range,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

919
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.383
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normally wouldn't wander any further </v>

920
00:43:19.761 --> 00:43:21.980
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an ongoing debate.</v>

921
00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is Squirrelly,</v>

922
00:43:23.481 --> 00:43:24.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

923
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:25.610
<v Speaker 2>it's squirly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

924
00:43:25.611 --> 00:43:26.444
<v Speaker 2>There's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because even with like animals that </v>

925
00:43:29.511 --> 00:43:30.171
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

926
00:43:30.171 --> 00:43:33.530
<v Speaker 2>where they want to score and then put </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the record books,</v>

927
00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep track of scores.</v>

928
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:37.200
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

929
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.083
<v Speaker 2>there are certain score scoring clubs </v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't recognize anything with a </v>

930
00:43:43.011 --> 00:43:43.844
<v Speaker 2>high fence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then at the same time there's </v>

931
00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.450
<v Speaker 2>members within those organizations that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are like,</v>

932
00:43:47.451 --> 00:43:48.284
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

933
00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:48.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

934
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ranches 15,000</v>

935
00:43:50.571 --> 00:43:52.100
<v Speaker 2>acres that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

936
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.990
<v Speaker 2>they kind of have this same argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

937
00:43:53.991 --> 00:43:54.681
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that.</v>

938
00:43:54.681 --> 00:43:55.550
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

939
00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:56.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if,</v>

940
00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.940
<v Speaker 2>if there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a hunter,</v>

941
00:43:58.941 --> 00:44:03.500
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's kind of a continual debate.</v>

942
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:04.363
<v Speaker 2>Some hunters absolutely refused to hunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that has any sort of </v>

943
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:12.650
<v Speaker 2>containment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other people have their kind of,</v>

944
00:44:12.651 --> 00:44:13.710
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

945
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.880
<v Speaker 2>they have their own threshold of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if it's 5,000</v>

946
00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:20.320
<v Speaker 2>or more than I'm kind of okay with it.</v>

947
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:22.550
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

948
00:44:22.551 --> 00:44:23.930
<v Speaker 2>it's no different than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

949
00:44:23.931 --> 00:44:24.764
<v Speaker 2>some people in the hunting community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people only want to hunt animals </v>

950
00:44:29.121 --> 00:44:29.954
<v Speaker 2>that are on public land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some people like to hunt areas </v>

951
00:44:34.801 --> 00:44:35.631
<v Speaker 2>where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

952
00:44:35.631 --> 00:44:36.464
<v Speaker 2>it's managed properties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's privately owned properties that </v>

953
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.940
<v Speaker 2>have really good management and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

954
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:42.774
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

955
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.520
<v Speaker 2>you're shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

956
00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:47.190
<v Speaker 2>a certain age limit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of calling out,</v>

957
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:48.503
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the older animals maybe that aren't </v>

958
00:44:49.531 --> 00:44:51.540
<v Speaker 2>breeding anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

959
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:52.830
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

960
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:53.743
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's continual differences of what </v>

961
00:44:55.771 --> 00:45:00.480
<v Speaker 2>people feel like they want to accept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people want to be able to.</v>

962
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Some people just like hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nugent.</v>

963
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.010
<v Speaker 2>He just loves hunting his ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

964
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean he unsat thing.</v>

965
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I think he also has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's has a problem moving around.</v>

966
00:45:11.191 --> 00:45:12.024
<v Speaker 1>Well he doesn't mean he can't really go </v>
<v Speaker 1>elk hunting like where it goes hiking </v>

967
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.780
<v Speaker 1>into the mountains eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 hours a day.</v>

968
00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:21.870
<v Speaker 1>He can't legitimately loves hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas ranches.</v>

969
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Like he legitimately tree stands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think he's limited to that.</v>

970
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Like he has two bad knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really bad,</v>

971
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.780
<v Speaker 1>like [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got artificial knees.</v>

972
00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:34.740
<v Speaker 1>He said some serious surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got friends that loved to hunt.</v>

973
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm like exotic ranches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

974
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Well I can see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see the argument both ways.</v>

975
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.713
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a meat eater and you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get meat from a free range cattle </v>

976
00:45:49.231 --> 00:45:52.320
<v Speaker 1>ranch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you only want grass fed,</v>

977
00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:57.510
<v Speaker 1>grass finished beef free range that </v>
<v Speaker 1>roams around.</v>

978
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of people that feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

979
00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

980
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.130
<v Speaker 1>what is why you're hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you hunting because you,</v>

981
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:05.250
<v Speaker 1>you want meat?</v>

982
00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Are you hunting because you want to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>your on meat?</v>

983
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Are you hunting because you want to eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>wild game or you're hunting because it's</v>

984
00:46:10.381 --> 00:46:14.380
<v Speaker 1>fun or you're hunting for all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons all the above and if it's,</v>

985
00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.273
<v Speaker 1>if it's an all of the above,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people feel like the only kind of </v>

986
00:46:19.141 --> 00:46:22.830
<v Speaker 1>hunting they want to do is backpacking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Public land.</v>

987
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:23.703
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go into the wilderness and they don't </v>

988
00:46:25.471 --> 00:46:30.420
<v Speaker 1>want to have anything to do with raising</v>
<v Speaker 1>those animals,</v>

989
00:46:30.421 --> 00:46:31.254
<v Speaker 1>helping those animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want those animals be straight up </v>

990
00:46:34.261 --> 00:46:35.880
<v Speaker 1>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

991
00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and they feel like that is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical way.</v>

992
00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:42.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weird debates about </v>
<v Speaker 1>public land to.</v>

993
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.133
<v Speaker 1>Here's one that really gets me is a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people that are really into public </v>

994
00:46:45.631 --> 00:46:48.840
<v Speaker 1>land and public land is super important </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

995
00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:50.730
<v Speaker 1>They want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they only want to hunt public land,</v>

996
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:55.110
<v Speaker 1>but they have secret spots on public </v>
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

997
00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.260
<v Speaker 1>They don't want anybody to know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and if you tell someone about their</v>

998
00:46:58.261 --> 00:47:00.300
<v Speaker 1>spot on public land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll get mad at you.</v>

999
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:01.823
<v Speaker 1>Like if you take someone to a spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard Rinella talk about this on </v>

1000
00:47:05.071 --> 00:47:07.210
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's the big public land guy,</v>

1001
00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:12.650
<v Speaker 1>but he'll talk on his show about what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>betrayal it is.</v>

1002
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:14.573
<v Speaker 1>If you tell a person about a spot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell someone else about that spot </v>

1003
00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:19.760
<v Speaker 1>or they go to that spot without you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1004
00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:22.980
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this public land or is it not?</v>

1005
00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:25.740
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it is public land,</v>

1006
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:26.933
<v Speaker 1>if you're telling someone about a spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me that this public land </v>

1007
00:47:31.631 --> 00:47:34.120
<v Speaker 1>spot you don't want them going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>without you.</v>

1008
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Not unless they find it on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dad Is fucking ridiculous.</v>

1009
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

1010
00:47:40.091 --> 00:47:41.910
<v Speaker 1>That's like spot.</v>

1011
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.293
<v Speaker 1>You have a private spot on public land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're a public land guy until it </v>

1012
00:47:47.981 --> 00:47:48.814
<v Speaker 1>infringes on your own privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you figured out a way to have a </v>

1013
00:47:53.801 --> 00:47:54.634
<v Speaker 1>private spot on public land and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>share this private spot with someone </v>

1014
00:47:58.151 --> 00:47:58.984
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not allowed to go there without </v>

1015
00:47:59.861 --> 00:48:01.210
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

1016
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:05.080
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the number one rule in fishing to</v>

1017
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.070
<v Speaker 1>someone takes or it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1018
00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:07.923
<v Speaker 1>but if someone takes you to a sweet </v>
<v Speaker 1>little spot where they just rip lips </v>

1019
00:48:10.571 --> 00:48:11.404
<v Speaker 1>constantly on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a lake and then next thing you know </v>

1020
00:48:13.451 --> 00:48:16.030
<v Speaker 1>they go out there on the weekend and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting there in your boat with a</v>

1021
00:48:16.031 --> 00:48:21.031
<v Speaker 1>bunch of buddies that stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to get mad and be like,</v>

1022
00:48:21.401 --> 00:48:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took you to my spot.</v>

1023
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're assholes.</v>

1024
00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1025
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:29.740
<v Speaker 1>You think they should not go there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's.</v>

1026
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they own that spot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking child.</v>

1027
00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.060
<v Speaker 1>They don't own it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't own it.</v>

1028
00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about like lake superior.</v>

1029
00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:37.673
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got a giant ass lake and someone has </v>

1030
00:48:39.581 --> 00:48:42.100
<v Speaker 1>a spot where all the lake trout live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little reef.</v>

1031
00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:42.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where everything's chill and tell me </v>

1032
00:48:44.441 --> 00:48:45.274
<v Speaker 1>about that spot and then you go back </v>
<v Speaker 1>there six months later and I'm at that </v>

1033
00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:49.330
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be mad at me.</v>

1034
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not.</v>

1035
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.053
<v Speaker 1>Not Me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if it's a guy that you don't </v>

1036
00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:54.700
<v Speaker 1>know as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I went back and you had a whole bunch</v>

1037
00:48:54.701 --> 00:48:55.540
<v Speaker 1>of guys there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like,</v>

1038
00:48:55.541 --> 00:48:59.110
<v Speaker 1>dude should have saved this spot for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this ridiculous.</v>

1039
00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:00.183
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking public lane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not taking you in any of my spa did not </v>

1040
00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:04.990
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing,</v>

1041
00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.013
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that say they want </v>

1042
00:49:07.451 --> 00:49:08.440
<v Speaker 1>everything to be public.</v>

1043
00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.990
<v Speaker 1>That's not public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not public.</v>

1044
00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:12.970
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want other people going </v>
<v Speaker 1>back there.</v>

1045
00:49:12.971 --> 00:49:13.804
<v Speaker 1>I see the argument though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he put in the work to find a </v>

1046
00:49:16.211 --> 00:49:17.044
<v Speaker 1>good place that took work within public </v>
<v Speaker 1>land and you better not tell people </v>

1047
00:49:20.651 --> 00:49:21.850
<v Speaker 1>about it or they're going to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1048
00:49:21.851 --> 00:49:24.100
<v Speaker 1>that's will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you go wrong.</v>

1049
00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you find it,</v>

1050
00:49:25.541 --> 00:49:28.360
<v Speaker 1>you gotta just you gotta just keep it </v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet.</v>

1051
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:31.330
<v Speaker 1>That's so corny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so ridiculous.</v>

1052
00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want that spot to yourself?</v>

1053
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.640
<v Speaker 1>You want that spot to be private in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1054
00:49:36.641 --> 00:49:37.474
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

1055
00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:41.020
<v Speaker 1>You're making a private area and public </v>
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

1056
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:42.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1057
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I think that's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1058
00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:47.540
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine if you say you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to cotton,</v>

1059
00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:48.423
<v Speaker 1>you left camp an hour and a half before </v>
<v Speaker 1>daylight and you pack all the way out </v>

1060
00:49:52.001 --> 00:49:55.300
<v Speaker 1>there and there's someone sitting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your glass and rock in that basin.</v>

1061
00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:58.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would still say,</v>

1062
00:49:58.630 --> 00:50:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I should've never told this guy that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1063
00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:05.500
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone got there first.</v>

1064
00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:08.400
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever tell you about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>spouses spot.</v>

1065
00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:11.620
<v Speaker 1>That's been the same way for hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands a year.</v>

1066
00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:12.483
<v Speaker 1>It has way it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but someone found it put in the work to </v>

1067
00:50:16.281 --> 00:50:18.520
<v Speaker 1>find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is small minded thinking,</v>

1068
00:50:18.521 --> 00:50:20.890
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is small minded thinking.</v>

1069
00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

1070
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:27.070
<v Speaker 1>but this is a common way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

1071
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I'd say there's people that don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

1072
00:50:29.511 --> 00:50:30.344
<v Speaker 1>but there are certainly people that are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to side with with grinnell </v>

1073
00:50:33.441 --> 00:50:34.850
<v Speaker 1>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1074
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think.</v>

1075
00:50:36.561 --> 00:50:38.930
<v Speaker 1>So let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

1076
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:39.764
<v Speaker 1>if someone takes you to a place and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>this really good meal deer spot and you </v>

1077
00:50:43.641 --> 00:50:44.474
<v Speaker 1>gotta you hike in seven miles and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is beautiful base in and you go there </v>

1078
00:50:48.351 --> 00:50:52.220
<v Speaker 1>and just just to always deer there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't go there without that person's</v>

1079
00:50:52.221 --> 00:50:53.240
<v Speaker 1>permission would tell.</v>

1080
00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to be there?</v>

1081
00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:57.140
<v Speaker 1>And if he said no and I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I go,</v>

1082
00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't take that would be carried on</v>
<v Speaker 1>national forest land.</v>

1083
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Can I go to public land?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I go to this spot?</v>

1084
00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:07.283
<v Speaker 1>You don't fucking own even a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of respect for that guy that found </v>

1085
00:51:10.461 --> 00:51:11.540
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found it.</v>

1086
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just walked.</v>

1087
00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.490
<v Speaker 1>He walked on the dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found what?</v>

1088
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.370
<v Speaker 1>A tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are more true.</v>

1089
00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.080
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin rocked.</v>

1090
00:51:21.081 --> 00:51:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I stand on this top to cliff is cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1091
00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can take it to a point,</v>

1092
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:30.530
<v Speaker 1>but craze I still think it's code is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird code.</v>

1093
00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.830
<v Speaker 1>The other argument though too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just from a hunting situation,</v>

1094
00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Jamie is a person who doesn't hunt it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1095
00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:36.901
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1096
00:51:36.901 --> 00:51:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it so I understand like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a new concept to me,</v>

1097
00:51:40.011 --> 00:51:41.600
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to compare it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

1098
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.433
<v Speaker 1>Like if it was a pickup basketball hoop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found somewhere not built until </v>

1099
00:51:45.171 --> 00:51:46.004
<v Speaker 1>somebody to go to that playground </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's my hoop and I show up at </v>

1100
00:51:47.841 --> 00:51:49.830
<v Speaker 1>people or they're playing a public </v>
<v Speaker 1>playground.</v>

1101
00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another hoop to play on.</v>

1102
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't play basketball.</v>

1103
00:51:52.701 --> 00:51:57.090
<v Speaker 1>That seems ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just trying to think that you,</v>

1104
00:51:57.091 --> 00:51:57.924
<v Speaker 1>like you have a specialty in today's Day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and age because today people use like </v>

1105
00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:06.940
<v Speaker 1>onyx maps and they use google earth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could find these beautiful spots and</v>

1106
00:52:09.471 --> 00:52:10.304
<v Speaker 1>you just go out to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you find a beautiful spot on </v>

1107
00:52:12.891 --> 00:52:15.050
<v Speaker 1>google earth and you go out to it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

1108
00:52:15.051 --> 00:52:15.884
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a spot I found don't golder to </v>

1109
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:22.840
<v Speaker 1>merge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But bottom public wind seems ridiculous.</v>

1110
00:52:23.251 --> 00:52:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

1111
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.510
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there,</v>

1112
00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a legitimate code to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems ridiculous,</v>

1113
00:52:29.241 --> 00:52:34.190
<v Speaker 1>but it seems understandable that someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be upset if they're looking forward</v>

1114
00:52:34.191 --> 00:52:35.024
<v Speaker 1>to going to a place and they told you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it a year ago and they go to that </v>

1115
00:52:38.211 --> 00:52:38.570
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1116
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:39.403
<v Speaker 1>They hike him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes him nine miles when you were </v>

1117
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:42.260
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1118
00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Tough Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

1119
00:52:45.281 --> 00:52:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Another nine should have got there </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>

1120
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:48.763
<v Speaker 1>You procrastinate and Motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking you with me when we're going </v>

1121
00:52:53.521 --> 00:52:55.310
<v Speaker 1>into someone's spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you.</v>

1122
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.070
<v Speaker 1>No one owns any spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1123
00:52:58.100 --> 00:52:59.780
<v Speaker 1>that's what's so weird about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me.</v>

1124
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:01.480
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>

1125
00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.100
<v Speaker 1>There definitely is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There definitely is a line.</v>

1126
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:04.993
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see your argument 100 percent and I </v>

1127
00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:08.320
<v Speaker 1>know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1128
00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.400
<v Speaker 1>at some point it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1129
00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.110
<v Speaker 1>it could definitely get childish or out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of hand.</v>

1130
00:53:12.111 --> 00:53:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously there's a ton of a ton </v>
<v Speaker 1>of stuff,</v>

1131
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:16.430
<v Speaker 1>but out of courtesy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean if anytime you showed me </v>
<v Speaker 1>something cool,</v>

1133
00:53:18.711 --> 00:53:19.221
<v Speaker 1>if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1134
00:53:19.221 --> 00:53:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I got this cool thing is what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1135
00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:24.460
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of private.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take my family there,</v>

1136
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:25.410
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like.</v>

1137
00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I respect</v>

1138
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.900
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not private.</v>

1139
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:29.423
<v Speaker 2>That's what's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's weird is the whole water's not </v>

1140
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.710
<v Speaker 2>either public land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fishermen would be the same.</v>

1141
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Captain still close captains.</v>

1142
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.710
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1143
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:41.610
<v Speaker 1>The thing about public land is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be everyone's.</v>

1144
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.403
<v Speaker 1>So if you find a really good area in </v>
<v Speaker 1>public land that's supposed to be </v>

1145
00:53:48.031 --> 00:53:49.540
<v Speaker 1>available for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1146
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:50.453
<v Speaker 1>It does not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What everybody wants what everybody </v>

1147
00:53:52.711 --> 00:53:53.544
<v Speaker 1>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things about people </v>

1148
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:57.330
<v Speaker 1>not wanting new people to get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

1149
00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.033
<v Speaker 1>Like I've heard this argument before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you shouldn't be telling people to </v>

1150
00:54:01.441 --> 00:54:02.910
<v Speaker 1>get into hunting because it's already </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough.</v>

1151
00:54:02.911 --> 00:54:03.744
<v Speaker 1>A tough enough out there on public land </v>
<v Speaker 1>has already so many people hunting on </v>

1152
00:54:06.781 --> 00:54:08.670
<v Speaker 1>public land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If more people get into hunting,</v>

1153
00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.080
<v Speaker 1>who's going to be more pressure?</v>

1154
00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

1155
00:54:11.841 --> 00:54:13.370
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not me.</v>

1156
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:15.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely looking to get more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in for sure.</v>

1157
00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're thinking they didn't know</v>

1158
00:54:18.591 --> 00:54:23.150
<v Speaker 2>about your spots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll find a new spot.</v>

1159
00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:25.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a good attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the,</v>

1160
00:54:25.131 --> 00:54:25.964
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the questions or I guess </v>

1161
00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:29.660
<v Speaker 2>arguments too is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1162
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:30.583
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that when people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any tolerance for like </v>

1163
00:54:35.841 --> 00:54:37.820
<v Speaker 2>hunting private land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

1164
00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:40.120
<v Speaker 2>or they don't have tolerance for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1165
00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind people that hunt exotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>ranches or hunted high fence.</v>

1166
00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:49.100
<v Speaker 2>That's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like not what I personally like,</v>

1167
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.980
<v Speaker 2>but I also understand that people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

1168
00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:55.130
<v Speaker 2>I also don't like it when people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like super negative to that,</v>

1169
00:54:55.131 --> 00:54:55.964
<v Speaker 2>but yet they'll have like a bull in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pen or they'll have chickens in a cage </v>

1170
00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:06.080
<v Speaker 2>or they'll have a goat in there like </v>
<v Speaker 2>raising and raising and go to slaughter.</v>

1171
00:55:06.081 --> 00:55:06.914
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it that is because it shows us a </v>

1172
00:55:08.151 --> 00:55:09.350
<v Speaker 2>different scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1173
00:55:09.351 --> 00:55:11.370
<v Speaker 2>but it's not because it shows that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference.</v>

1174
00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Hang in the pursuit of a wild animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a different thing to that.</v>

1175
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like here's the thing,</v>

1176
00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:21.060
<v Speaker 1>say if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a ranch and the ranch is 5,000</v>

1177
00:55:21.061 --> 00:55:23.610
<v Speaker 1>acres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is big but not the biggest.</v>

1178
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:26.130
<v Speaker 1>And on that 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acre ranch,</v>

1179
00:55:26.131 --> 00:55:31.131
<v Speaker 1>someone shoots a giant buck like a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>two for 240 inch mule deer,</v>

1180
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:38.550
<v Speaker 1>epic deer and people are like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a private ranch and you kind of</v>

1181
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:39.384
<v Speaker 1>know that there wasn't a lot of pressure</v>
<v Speaker 1>there so they probably knew where this </v>

1182
00:55:42.571 --> 00:55:43.404
<v Speaker 1>deer was and people that worked on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ranch told people about this deer and </v>

1183
00:55:46.621 --> 00:55:49.040
<v Speaker 1>they kind of kept their eye on it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew where to go to find them.</v>

1184
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Versus you getting your truck driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>four hours outside of Reno in Nevada,</v>

1185
00:55:57.810 --> 00:56:00.120
<v Speaker 1>getting out into the mountains by </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1186
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:01.303
<v Speaker 1>You're like setting up camp by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending three or four days just </v>

1187
00:56:05.041 --> 00:56:06.840
<v Speaker 1>scouting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just earning your spot,</v>

1188
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:10.290
<v Speaker 1>finding your styles out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding your spot.</v>

1189
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:15.030
<v Speaker 1>But it's more difficult as the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if someone accomplishes that,</v>

1190
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:16.943
<v Speaker 1>you look at it differently than someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's shot something in a high ranch in </v>

1191
00:56:20.071 --> 00:56:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a different thing.</v>

1192
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I know</v>

1193
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.910
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying is like hunters versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>non hunters,</v>

1194
00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:31.280
<v Speaker 2>people that are non hunting that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked down on like what</v>

1195
00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:32.243
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about is hires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yet they'll raise a goat to </v>

1196
00:56:35.401 --> 00:56:39.780
<v Speaker 1>slaughter in attending that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's some sort of pursuit man versus.</v>

1197
00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:40.623
<v Speaker 1>And See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about the hunting thing is </v>

1198
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.983
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at it like it's a </v>

1199
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:45.593
<v Speaker 1>difficult pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're out there trying to outwit </v>

1200
00:56:48.781 --> 00:56:49.740
<v Speaker 1>this animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me.</v>

1201
00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I like about it.</v>

1202
00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:56.480
<v Speaker 1>But if you're in a 400 acre fenced in </v>
<v Speaker 1>property with a bunch of exotics running</v>

1203
00:56:57.181 --> 00:56:59.190
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting in a tree stand is a pile</v>

1204
00:56:59.191 --> 00:57:00.024
<v Speaker 1>of corn down there and you're waiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for an animal to walk over to that </v>

1205
00:57:02.281 --> 00:57:07.020
<v Speaker 1>corner and you whack it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is very different than say what you</v>

1206
00:57:07.021 --> 00:57:11.940
<v Speaker 1>did this year in Alberta when you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me that you were hiking hundreds</v>

1207
00:57:11.941 --> 00:57:12.700
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1208
00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.640
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many days did you guys go?</v>

1209
00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I think we went nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did 100 miles.</v>

1210
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you hiked a hundred miles in the </v>

1211
00:57:21.841 --> 00:57:24.090
<v Speaker 1>wilderness for nine days?</v>

1212
00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:26.070
<v Speaker 1>No elk and never got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never got one.</v>

1213
00:57:26.071 --> 00:57:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Never got one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1214
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:30.390
<v Speaker 1>That is very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1215
00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:31.110
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1216
00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:31.943
<v Speaker 1>That's real hunting in comparison to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's sitting over a pile of </v>

1217
00:57:35.731 --> 00:57:37.460
<v Speaker 1>corn fenced in ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1218
00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:40.260
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I think people have a problem</v>

1219
00:57:40.261 --> 00:57:41.560
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1220
00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:42.673
<v Speaker 1>that anybody would compare what you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that and then there's like the </v>

1221
00:57:46.921 --> 00:57:51.450
<v Speaker 1>intermediary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a really nice ranch that's</v>

1222
00:57:51.451 --> 00:57:52.284
<v Speaker 1>not high fence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a private ranch like the place </v>

1223
00:57:55.081 --> 00:57:58.680
<v Speaker 1>we went to in Utah that is private.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody can go there,</v>

1224
00:57:58.681 --> 00:58:02.420
<v Speaker 1>but those are just wild animals roaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and uh,</v>

1225
00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And opportunities high.</v>

1226
00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More opportunity,</v>

1227
00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:08.580
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing fenced in.</v>

1228
00:58:08.581 --> 00:58:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's keeping the animals there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1229
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.270
<v Speaker 1>those animals had been there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>

1230
00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:13.323
<v Speaker 1>It's just what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have the opportunity to hunt a </v>

1231
00:58:16.441 --> 00:58:17.274
<v Speaker 1>wild animal on a piece of property where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not going to be a lot of people </v>

1232
00:58:20.911 --> 00:58:21.750
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1233
00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:25.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my preference.</v>

1234
00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:26.843
<v Speaker 2>I like doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the balance of having </v>

1235
00:58:29.371 --> 00:58:33.180
<v Speaker 2>really tough aunts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because I knew my,</v>

1236
00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:36.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my Utah Hunt wouldn't quite be the same.</v>

1237
00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:39.420
<v Speaker 2>That was kind of a very different </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience for me.</v>

1238
00:58:39.421 --> 00:58:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I haven't ever had an opportunity like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1239
00:58:42.241 --> 00:58:45.360
<v Speaker 2>so that was quite a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a difference for me.</v>

1240
00:58:45.361 --> 00:58:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I'm between the other states </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I hunted,</v>

1241
00:58:48.421 --> 00:58:49.254
<v Speaker 2>I think I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was right at just over 200 </v>

1242
00:58:52.351 --> 00:58:54.420
<v Speaker 2>miles before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1243
00:58:54.421 --> 00:58:56.920
<v Speaker 2>before we got our first bull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1244
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.460
<v Speaker 2>between there and then hunting some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1245
00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:00.953
<v Speaker 2>some private land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also some public land in Montana </v>

1246
00:59:02.881 --> 00:59:03.714
<v Speaker 2>before finally getting that first elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you talk about what happened with </v>

1247
00:59:07.081 --> 00:59:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Montana?</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the bear?</v>

1248
00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1249
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can talk about it.</v>

1250
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:16.170
<v Speaker 2>They actually text me back and ruled </v>
<v Speaker 2>back that it was not a grizzly.</v>

1251
00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:17.400
<v Speaker 2>What's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1252
00:59:17.401 --> 00:59:21.030
<v Speaker 2>they say it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a colored black bear.</v>

1253
00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:22.940
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1254
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's possible.</v>

1255
00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:27.770
<v Speaker 2>I was going to pull up the pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a black bear.</v>

1256
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1257
00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:31.410
<v Speaker 2>It thought it was a grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1258
00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:32.241
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shot,</v>

1259
00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:33.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1260
00:59:33.501 --> 00:59:34.334
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1261
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:38.300
<v Speaker 2>our mutual friend Andy Stumpf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shahada Bull on nine slash 11,</v>

1262
00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.430
<v Speaker 2>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was pretty,</v>

1263
00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:41.443
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty cool for him to have an </v>

1264
00:59:42.591 --> 00:59:44.650
<v Speaker 2>experience like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it took us,</v>

1265
00:59:44.651 --> 00:59:46.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget how far out we were,</v>

1266
00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:50.140
<v Speaker 2>just several,</v>
<v Speaker 2>several miles from camp and we,</v>

1267
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:54.380
<v Speaker 2>it took us two trips to pack this bull </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1268
00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:55.820
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1269
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:59.810
<v Speaker 2>the first pack out that we did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we finally got back to camp,</v>

1270
00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:01.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around midnight or something.</v>

1271
01:00:01.611 --> 01:00:04.270
<v Speaker 2>So the next morning we went back at </v>
<v Speaker 2>firstlight,</v>

1272
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.790
<v Speaker 2>took us a while to pack back in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when we got there,</v>

1273
01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:09.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half of the carcass,</v>

1274
01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I had already pulled everything apart.</v>

1275
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:15.230
<v Speaker 2>We had everything gained bags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was strung up in trees,</v>

1276
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:16.963
<v Speaker 2>but the actual cavity was half buried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as we were approaching I seen </v>

1277
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:25.730
<v Speaker 2>something kind of running off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the coloration on the side,</v>

1278
01:00:25.731 --> 01:00:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I really thought for sure it was a gris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1279
01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:32.420
<v Speaker 2>because I've seen lots of them and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>got up there and sure enough it was,</v>

1280
01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.373
<v Speaker 2>it was buried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we kind of took a lot of precaution </v>

1281
01:00:35.601 --> 01:00:38.720
<v Speaker 2>as we were trying to tell people just to</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain to people what that means.</v>

1282
01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.790
<v Speaker 2>So it Grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1283
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Speaker 2>they will bury something that they find </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

1284
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:49.010
<v Speaker 2>I think they do it for a couple reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons is they want,</v>

1285
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:49.873
<v Speaker 2>they don't want like prey birds like </v>
<v Speaker 2>crows and stuff to be able to see it </v>

1286
01:00:53.871 --> 01:00:54.704
<v Speaker 2>because they'll start talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then other predators in the area </v>

1287
01:00:56.751 --> 01:00:59.000
<v Speaker 2>listen for those birds and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1288
01:00:59.001 --> 01:01:02.150
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a magnet starts to draw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they like to conceal it.</v>

1289
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:03.043
<v Speaker 2>So the literally kind of pivot on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>circle around that kill and actually </v>

1290
01:01:07.671 --> 01:01:12.410
<v Speaker 2>claw the ground in and bury them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1291
01:01:12.411 --> 01:01:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a were grizzlies barrier full </v>
<v Speaker 2>moose and it's,</v>

1292
01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:21.020
<v Speaker 2>it is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The type of dirt they can move,</v>

1293
01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:21.883
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a skid loader came in </v>

1294
01:01:23.331 --> 01:01:26.150
<v Speaker 2>there and buried these things and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do,</v>

1295
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:28.850
<v Speaker 2>they can do that kind of work fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>

1296
01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they'll pile up everything around it</v>

1297
01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:32.773
<v Speaker 2>and then they kind of normally we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>create one small little hole at the end </v>

1298
01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:37.423
<v Speaker 2>of that mound where they'll kinda crawl </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there and they literally like eat </v>

1299
01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:44.000
<v Speaker 2>from one side to the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1300
01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:49.600
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's normally the back end first.</v>

1301
01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:52.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1302
01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:53.293
<v Speaker 2>I felt like we had just got there when </v>
<v Speaker 2>this bear had just discovered the </v>

1303
01:01:58.161 --> 01:01:58.994
<v Speaker 2>carcass and had just started the burial </v>
<v Speaker 2>process because he hadn't pulled </v>

1304
01:02:03.621 --> 01:02:05.030
<v Speaker 2>anything out of the trees.</v>

1305
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:07.700
<v Speaker 2>He had only started to cover the </v>
<v Speaker 2>carcass,</v>

1306
01:02:07.701 --> 01:02:09.890
<v Speaker 2>which normally they'll cover that seal </v>
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>

1307
01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:11.053
<v Speaker 2>then they'll clean up the scraps around </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they go to their pile and kind </v>

1308
01:02:14.321 --> 01:02:16.550
<v Speaker 2>of consume that last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1309
01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:21.450
<v Speaker 2>but I was certain that we had seen one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We ended up seeing a wildlife biologist,</v>

1310
01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>later on.</v>

1311
01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.210
<v Speaker 2>And I told him I thought I saw a grid </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he told me,</v>

1312
01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:28.044
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1313
01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.173
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty important if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there hasn't been one naturally </v>

1314
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:36.960
<v Speaker 2>on this hill and I think he said a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred years.</v>

1315
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.940
<v Speaker 2>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1316
01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:41.940
<v Speaker 2>would you be willing to go back in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>to put a camera up,</v>

1317
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:44.890
<v Speaker 2>which is not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was a,</v>

1318
01:02:44.891 --> 01:02:46.410
<v Speaker 2>if it was a Grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1319
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:47.483
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously they're gonna be depending on </v>

1320
01:02:49.831 --> 01:02:52.110
<v Speaker 2>their demeanor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can be very protective of that.</v>

1321
01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:53.453
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we did end up going back in there </v>

1322
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.090
<v Speaker 2>just to put the camera up.</v>

1323
01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:59.580
<v Speaker 2>And then after the camera was there a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few weeks,</v>

1324
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.540
<v Speaker 2>he sent a picture and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were close to being right.</v>

1325
01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:08.930
<v Speaker 2>It's just a perfectly colored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a black bear that looks like,</v>

1326
01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:12.150
<v Speaker 2>like it would be a grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how does he know for sure?</v>

1327
01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:15.820
<v Speaker 2>You can tell by they don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1328
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.820
<v Speaker 2>you thought it was a grizzly when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw the photo?</v>

1329
01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1330
01:03:18.791 --> 01:03:21.030
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a younger one,</v>

1331
01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:23.000
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have a very distinct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1332
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:25.620
<v Speaker 2>hump on their back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the claw marks.</v>

1333
01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:29.340
<v Speaker 2>See he went in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell a lot by the clause.</v>

1334
01:03:29.341 --> 01:03:31.200
<v Speaker 2>So when you go in and you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tracks,</v>

1335
01:03:31.201 --> 01:03:33.450
<v Speaker 2>that's also a really easy way because </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1336
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:37.050
<v Speaker 2>like that beer that was a wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 2>Khabib,</v>

1337
01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:39.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see the claws,</v>

1338
01:03:39.301 --> 01:03:43.380
<v Speaker 2>like grizzlies have very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very distinct a clause.</v>

1339
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:44.363
<v Speaker 2>So that was a just looking here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can't really pull up the pick for </v>

1340
01:03:51.701 --> 01:03:52.750
<v Speaker 2>every sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

1341
01:03:53.290 --> 01:03:54.123
<v Speaker 2>let me check it out.</v>

1342
01:03:57.810 --> 01:03:59.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see that.</v>

1343
01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:02.290
<v Speaker 2>That's Luke and that doesn't actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of looked like a brown bear.</v>

1344
01:04:02.291 --> 01:04:04.200
<v Speaker 2>And now that I look at black bear </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather.</v>

1345
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then running the head is going to be</v>

1346
01:04:06.721 --> 01:04:07.554
<v Speaker 2>narrower and it took several pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the pictures that looked more </v>

1347
01:04:11.461 --> 01:04:14.880
<v Speaker 2>like a grid just because the coloration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the pictures that didn't,</v>

1348
01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:16.360
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1349
01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and keep in mind,</v>

1350
01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mountain Grizzlies look a little bit </v>

1351
01:04:19.801 --> 01:04:23.370
<v Speaker 2>different than like a coastal bear or </v>
<v Speaker 2>inland grizzly,</v>

1352
01:04:23.371 --> 01:04:24.204
<v Speaker 2>but either way it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a bear that came in and covered </v>

1353
01:04:28.471 --> 01:04:30.530
<v Speaker 2>the whole carcass and went to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1354
01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:31.373
<v Speaker 2>when you were in Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went back to that place that you </v>

1355
01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:36.690
<v Speaker 2>were talking about on the first podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>we ever did,</v>

1356
01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.673
<v Speaker 2>where you had that encounter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you shot that elk that was just </v>

1357
01:04:39.661 --> 01:04:40.980
<v Speaker 2>outside of that wolf den.</v>

1358
01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wolves tried to claim the elk.</v>

1359
01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:48.080
<v Speaker 2>You guys how to shoot your way out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a fucking crazy story.</v>

1360
01:04:48.601 --> 01:04:52.470
<v Speaker 2>What was it like to be back there again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1361
01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:55.500
<v Speaker 2>what was strange about it is while we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were there,</v>

1362
01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.133
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually found that they were back in </v>

1363
01:05:00.571 --> 01:05:01.820
<v Speaker 2>that area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1364
01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:07.140
<v Speaker 2>there was some fresh tracks and then we </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard one how like during that thing.</v>

1365
01:05:07.141 --> 01:05:07.974
<v Speaker 2>So it was almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a little bit weird because I'm </v>

1366
01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.750
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys bring extra bullets as time.</v>

1367
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.740
<v Speaker 2>We only had my bow this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sending you this Jamie.</v>

1368
01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:17.663
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1369
01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.420
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1370
01:05:19.421 --> 01:05:21.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that I'm,</v>

1371
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:26.110
<v Speaker 2>the thing that was always kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>creeped me out a little bit was just,</v>

1372
01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:27.723
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I had like a kind of a </v>

1373
01:05:30.131 --> 01:05:30.964
<v Speaker 2>personal connection with that Alpha male</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the way he came in at the very </v>

1374
01:05:35.591 --> 01:05:40.591
<v Speaker 2>end because he wanted to know what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>heck had taken out three of his pack.</v>

1375
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:43.001
<v Speaker 2>He wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1376
01:05:43.001 --> 01:05:45.580
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we're getting out of here,</v>

1377
01:05:45.581 --> 01:05:47.740
<v Speaker 2>but I want to see this for myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

1378
01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were close enough but I don't think</v>

1379
01:05:50.651 --> 01:05:55.060
<v Speaker 2>they could totally see us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that was going away.</v>

1380
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzly.</v>

1381
01:05:58.050 --> 01:05:58.883
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look like a brown or a black </v>

1382
01:06:00.101 --> 01:06:01.000
<v Speaker 2>bear though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the nose.</v>

1383
01:06:01.001 --> 01:06:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See how the face is more narrow.</v>

1384
01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:05.950
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the cost to.</v>

1385
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:07.000
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1386
01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which,</v>

1387
01:06:08.321 --> 01:06:12.280
<v Speaker 2>like on the right foot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the claw looks more like a black bear on</v>

1388
01:06:12.281 --> 01:06:13.114
<v Speaker 2>the left foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some grass there that made it </v>

1389
01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:18.580
<v Speaker 2>a little bit strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1390
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:22.900
<v Speaker 2>when that Alpha male came in to kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1391
01:06:22.901 --> 01:06:24.400
<v Speaker 2>I think he just wanted to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1392
01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:27.250
<v Speaker 2>what's caused all this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1393
01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:28.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at,</v>

1394
01:06:28.961 --> 01:06:29.794
<v Speaker 2>I looked him in the face and just pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>much said I'm going to shoot you in the </v>

1395
01:06:31.961 --> 01:06:32.794
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

1396
01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>

1397
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:36.760
<v Speaker 2>every time I go back in that area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1398
01:06:36.761 --> 01:06:38.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this old suckers walking around,</v>

1399
01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:43.770
<v Speaker 2>he knows my smell is going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the members personally.</v>

1400
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.033
<v Speaker 2>They are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could picture him remembering it and </v>

1401
01:06:47.411 --> 01:06:49.430
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1402
01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.710
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1403
01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:52.070
<v Speaker 2>oh this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1404
01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:55.280
<v Speaker 2>this dude can make him into a hero </v>
<v Speaker 2>turret.</v>

1405
01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:58.120
<v Speaker 2>On the side of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent you that,</v>

1406
01:06:58.121 --> 01:06:58.954
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Wolf Big Wolf Shit that had </v>

1407
01:07:01.001 --> 01:07:02.640
<v Speaker 2>porcupine quills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

1408
01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:03.483
<v Speaker 2>I put that on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny how many people were like </v>

1409
01:07:05.650 --> 01:07:08.050
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not porcupine quills.</v>

1410
01:07:08.051 --> 01:07:09.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen people,</v>

1411
01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the outdoors 200 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a year.</v>

1412
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:15.720
<v Speaker 2>And if there's porcupine quills coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1413
01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:18.280
<v Speaker 2>pile of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure I know what it is.</v>

1414
01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.690
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell from a photo on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram.</v>

1415
01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:23.913
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a pile of shit with porcupine </v>

1416
01:07:28.271 --> 01:07:29.104
<v Speaker 2>quills in it.</v>

1417
01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Imagine how God damn hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be to be eating porcupine.</v>

1418
01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Quills wolf's that tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't care.</v>

1419
01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:38.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at how many bears just.</v>

1420
01:07:38.970 --> 01:07:43.970
<v Speaker 2>We'll just go head first into a pile and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a fire ant bed or a wasps' nests.</v>

1421
01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:47.860
<v Speaker 2>Like yellow jacket is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make that a little bigger please.</v>

1422
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:51.850
<v Speaker 2>Down in the bottom you can see some nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>quills yeah,</v>

1423
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:54.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people will go to her.</v>

1424
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:57.340
<v Speaker 2>The other is there is porcupine hair in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their.</v>

1425
01:07:57.341 --> 01:07:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are all so close.</v>

1426
01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:00.293
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of little blood drops </v>

1427
01:08:01.391 --> 01:08:03.740
<v Speaker 2>up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Need some prep age.</v>

1428
01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1429
01:08:06.941 --> 01:08:08.380
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're beasts there.</v>

1430
01:08:08.381 --> 01:08:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

1431
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:12.520
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think their intelligence,</v>

1432
01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:16.850
<v Speaker 2>their intelligence level is super high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of,</v>

1433
01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you're in the outdoors and you </v>

1434
01:08:18.891 --> 01:08:23.210
<v Speaker 2>experience things demeanors and their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1435
01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:24.740
<v Speaker 2>their ability to survive.</v>

1436
01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:25.431
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at,</v>

1437
01:08:25.431 --> 01:08:26.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>

1438
01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.560
<v Speaker 2>you look at an old grizzly that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>in those woods for 20 years,</v>

1439
01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:35.980
<v Speaker 2>think of the experience level that thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>has surviving every single day.</v>

1440
01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:37.553
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day just maybe making a slight </v>

1441
01:08:40.641 --> 01:08:42.590
<v Speaker 2>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slipping up a little bit,</v>

1442
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:44.900
<v Speaker 2>almost getting jacked by another </v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzly.</v>

1443
01:08:44.901 --> 01:08:45.770
<v Speaker 2>And then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1444
01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know not to do this.</v>

1445
01:08:47.781 --> 01:08:48.614
<v Speaker 2>I know not to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're there until their </v>

1446
01:08:50.391 --> 01:08:51.224
<v Speaker 2>intelligence level and their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>function is extremely high and wolves </v>

1447
01:08:55.191 --> 01:08:56.024
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean arguably will probably get shot </v>

1448
01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:01.790
<v Speaker 2>less than probably any of the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

1449
01:09:01.791 --> 01:09:02.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in.</v>

1450
01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.500
<v Speaker 2>They are incredibly smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1451
01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:07.850
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't doubt it,</v>

1452
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:08.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1453
01:09:08.931 --> 01:09:10.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1454
01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.513
<v Speaker 2>they were very after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were very intent in that area for </v>

1455
01:09:17.121 --> 01:09:20.360
<v Speaker 2>people to put up some pretty big </v>
<v Speaker 2>bounties on the wolves.</v>

1456
01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:21.583
<v Speaker 2>And they really went after him and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and knock those herds down quite a bit </v>

1457
01:09:24.591 --> 01:09:29.540
<v Speaker 2>because there was very few mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like very few mule deer.</v>

1458
01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.100
<v Speaker 2>You'd hardly see a doe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1459
01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:36.310
<v Speaker 2>and they had to cut the number of tags </v>
<v Speaker 2>way down a elk as soon as wolves.</v>

1460
01:09:36.561 --> 01:09:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Like how at night if a pack moves into </v>
<v Speaker 2>an area and they,</v>

1461
01:09:39.471 --> 01:09:43.010
<v Speaker 2>how like calling elk is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonexistent.</v>

1462
01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.340
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's just like don't say nothing</v>

1463
01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:48.020
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're here.</v>

1464
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1465
01:09:49.611 --> 01:09:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I think I think them thinning them down </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1466
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.730
<v Speaker 2>was very relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And since then,</v>

1467
01:09:55.731 --> 01:09:58.150
<v Speaker 2>which was quite awhile ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1468
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:59.143
<v Speaker 2>the numbers of like elk and Moose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like this past year I saw way more </v>

1469
01:10:02.871 --> 01:10:04.570
<v Speaker 2>moose than I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1470
01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:06.830
<v Speaker 2>I think they're really hard on moose </v>
<v Speaker 2>fonds.</v>

1471
01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

1472
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:14.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean Moose Mulally's white tails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw way more animals this year,</v>

1473
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:17.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than in the past up there.</v>

1474
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.863
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's just because that Moose</v>
<v Speaker 2>number or the wolf number was just much </v>

1475
01:10:21.531 --> 01:10:23.660
<v Speaker 2>lower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was,</v>

1476
01:10:23.661 --> 01:10:26.510
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was still sign that there was some</v>

1477
01:10:26.511 --> 01:10:27.860
<v Speaker 2>in the area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just nothing.</v>

1478
01:10:27.861 --> 01:10:31.220
<v Speaker 2>Like several years ago when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1479
01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was even,</v>

1480
01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:34.274
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as I appreciate balance in </v>

1481
01:10:36.021 --> 01:10:36.854
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was excessive and it's getting that </v>

1482
01:10:40.161 --> 01:10:42.320
<v Speaker 2>way now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even in Wisconsin,</v>

1483
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:43.243
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was talking to a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mine up in an area I used to live up by </v>

1484
01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:47.983
<v Speaker 2>kind of in the Lacrosse area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually lived a little northeast of </v>

1485
01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Lacrosse by a small town called </v>
<v Speaker 2>cataract.</v>

1486
01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:58.010
<v Speaker 2>And there was a few times where there </v>
<v Speaker 2>were some wolf spottings.</v>

1487
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.903
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big military base called Fort </v>

1488
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Mccoy and I lived up on the northern </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of the base,</v>

1489
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:05.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was called the impact area.</v>

1490
01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:10.730
<v Speaker 2>They kind of shot test rounds over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of went off there or whatever,</v>

1491
01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 2>but there was an incredible number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like deer</v>

1492
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.050
<v Speaker 1>and things that were in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1493
01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of the rumor was that they had </v>

1494
01:11:18.151 --> 01:11:21.780
<v Speaker 1>introduced wolves into their timber </v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves to let,</v>

1495
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:25.350
<v Speaker 1>to Kinda thinned down some of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers will now it's to the point where</v>

1496
01:11:25.351 --> 01:11:26.184
<v Speaker 1>the amount of people I know in Wisconsin</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sea wolves is just rapidly </v>

1497
01:11:29.641 --> 01:11:31.710
<v Speaker 1>increasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously when that happens,</v>

1498
01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:33.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat stuff.</v>

1499
01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves don't mess around.</v>

1500
01:11:36.031 --> 01:11:39.330
<v Speaker 1>They take stuff down and sometimes it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just strange.</v>

1501
01:11:39.331 --> 01:11:41.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand the balance of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1502
01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:45.720
<v Speaker 1>of why there's an introduction to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you know,</v>

1503
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:49.380
<v Speaker 1>has the possibility to just take over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1504
01:11:49.381 --> 01:11:50.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's strange.</v>

1505
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:51.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

1506
01:11:51.481 --> 01:11:53.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there needs to be some sort of balance.</v>

1507
01:11:53.941 --> 01:11:58.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't want the animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>overpopulating and you do want some sort</v>

1508
01:11:58.771 --> 01:12:03.771
<v Speaker 1>of a balance between Predator and prey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the real problem becomes when people</v>

1509
01:12:04.201 --> 01:12:06.680
<v Speaker 1>don't want to manage the predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1510
01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:10.530
<v Speaker 1>They only want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want nature to sort itself out.</v>

1511
01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really work that way though.</v>

1512
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:14.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just people need to </v>

1513
01:12:15.391 --> 01:12:18.720
<v Speaker 1>understand like if you do like deer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Moose and you,</v>

1514
01:12:18.721 --> 01:12:22.770
<v Speaker 1>like all these other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have too many wolves.</v>

1515
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:24.223
<v Speaker 1>Too many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1516
01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.970
<v Speaker 1>You can't have too many grizzlies </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you do,</v>

1517
01:12:26.971 --> 01:12:29.220
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have very few of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>other animals.</v>

1518
01:12:29.221 --> 01:12:31.050
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna see them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get wiped out.</v>

1519
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.770
<v Speaker 1>And in some places like they're almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the point of extinction.</v>

1520
01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:35.604
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that Caribou herd that's in </v>

1521
01:12:37.951 --> 01:12:40.890
<v Speaker 1>North America?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caribou herd.</v>

1522
01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:41.753
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that familiar with it because </v>

1523
01:12:42.661 --> 01:12:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I've never really been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1524
01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:47.160
<v Speaker 1>a Caribou person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1525
01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:48.053
<v Speaker 1>from a hunting aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're an animal that's like </v>

1526
01:12:49.851 --> 01:12:51.990
<v Speaker 1>severely targeted by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

1527
01:12:51.991 --> 01:12:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1528
01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:53.784
<v Speaker 1>I could see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything with a very predictable </v>

1529
01:12:55.231 --> 01:12:58.770
<v Speaker 1>migration is going to be very prone to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1530
01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:01.230
<v Speaker 1>to any type of prey creature you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

1531
01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:02.573
<v Speaker 1>you look at any of the migrations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like willdabeast and stuff like that in </v>

1532
01:13:05.731 --> 01:13:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Africa where they're having to migrate.</v>

1533
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Those crocs are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1534
01:13:10.351 --> 01:13:12.600
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know where that river crossing is.</v>

1535
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:15.720
<v Speaker 1>We know where the neck down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

1536
01:13:15.721 --> 01:13:16.770
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1537
01:13:16.771 --> 01:13:17.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you knew this,</v>

1538
01:13:17.701 --> 01:13:18.534
<v Speaker 1>but many people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The females actually have antlers and </v>

1539
01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:22.920
<v Speaker 1>the reason why they have antlers is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fend off wolves.</v>

1540
01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.320
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1541
01:13:25.321 --> 01:13:26.154
<v Speaker 1>Female Caribou have antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the only deer species where </v>

1542
01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:30.340
<v Speaker 1>the females have antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1543
01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he made sure that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

1544
01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:34.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1545
01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I guess I guess if it's for wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they all have antlers,</v>

1546
01:13:37.531 --> 01:13:38.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fall Caribou,</v>

1547
01:13:38.941 --> 01:13:40.080
<v Speaker 1>have antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1548
01:13:40.081 --> 01:13:42.150
<v Speaker 1>you're male and flushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think so,</v>

1549
01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:46.520
<v Speaker 1>but I think they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How good was a.</v>

1550
01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:51.470
<v Speaker 1>How good was that elk from that camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1551
01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.130
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

1552
01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're usually right.</v>

1553
01:13:57.930 --> 01:13:58.830
<v Speaker 1>People would disagree.</v>

1554
01:13:59.430 --> 01:14:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I'd say eight times this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few times where I say things though,</v>

1555
01:14:03.121 --> 01:14:04.740
<v Speaker 1>when I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck are you saying?</v>

1556
01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:08.430
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least you a question.</v>

1557
01:14:08.431 --> 01:14:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You questioned it always,</v>

1558
01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:12.880
<v Speaker 1>and you laugh about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm no expert.</v>

1559
01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm an expert in very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few things.</v>

1560
01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:18.190
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have very,</v>

1561
01:14:18.191 --> 01:14:20.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your intelligence levels high.</v>

1562
01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.480
<v Speaker 1>It just says that males are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to be a little bit bigger.</v>

1563
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Antlers are a little bit bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1564
01:14:24.491 --> 01:14:25.324
<v Speaker 1>they both have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1565
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:26.211
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1566
01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:27.044
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if it's true that the females have </v>

1567
01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:30.640
<v Speaker 1>it defend off wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's theoretical actually.</v>

1568
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the part that,</v>

1569
01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:34.720
<v Speaker 1>that's the part where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1570
01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:35.853
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I saw that in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary that the females have it to </v>

1571
01:14:40.421 --> 01:14:43.480
<v Speaker 1>fend off wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was speculation.</v>

1572
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.433
<v Speaker 1>Speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three 60 video of what a cool animal </v>

1573
01:14:47.381 --> 01:14:47.650
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1574
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:50.500
<v Speaker 1>They're so cool looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never hunted them.</v>

1575
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:51.783
<v Speaker 1>I would like to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to be delicious and </v>

1576
01:14:53.771 --> 01:14:54.604
<v Speaker 1>there's a shitload of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the crazy thing about </v>

1577
01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The areas of Alaska,</v>

1578
01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:03.100
<v Speaker 1>like they'll have hundreds and hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them and these streams,</v>

1579
01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.550
<v Speaker 1>you know more than that depending on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>migration.</v>

1580
01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1581
01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.760
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not streamed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1582
01:15:09.761 --> 01:15:11.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever path full of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one with no antlers.</v>

1583
01:15:11.831 --> 01:15:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Must have lost them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they lose their antlers to them?</v>

1584
01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says there are exceptions.</v>

1585
01:15:16.661 --> 01:15:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Like there's this one dude got jacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see elk like that.</v>

1586
01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see that I'm years had a broken time.</v>

1587
01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Didn't a little one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1588
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:29.980

<v Speaker 1>not a big broken one,</v>

1589
01:15:29.981 --> 01:15:33.130
<v Speaker 1>but we saw one that I almost shot that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it only had one antler.</v>

1590
01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but to.</v>

1597
01:15:50.621 --> 01:15:53.230
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there are things snapped off,</v>

1598
01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.020
<v Speaker 1>it means they're just going to war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1599
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:57.103
<v Speaker 2>I was really pumped for that camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically because I had several good </v>

<v Speaker 1>You got to give me that recipe and I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how to do that.</v>

1607
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:19.290
<v Speaker 1>That was sensational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1608
01:16:19.291 --> 01:16:20.310
<v Speaker 1>That was so good.</v>

1609
01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Grossed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1610
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:24.200
<v Speaker 2>We had 51.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People will,</v>

1611
01:16:24.201 --> 01:16:27.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of camera people there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was guides,</v>

1612
01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:30.710
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people that maybe worked there.</v>

1613
01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.630
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a,</v>

1614
01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:33.533
<v Speaker 2>a massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took the one half of the elk neck and </v>

1615
01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:39.373
<v Speaker 2>did a forward seer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've talked about reverse sear that </v>

1616
01:16:42.261 --> 01:16:44.510
<v Speaker 2>our buddy Chad ward taught us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1617
01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.250
<v Speaker 2>but this was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call it affords here.</v>

1618
01:16:46.251 --> 01:16:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a car.</v>

1619
01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I see her at the beginning,</v>

1620
01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:51.313
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a big cast iron pot way to massive </v>

1621
01:16:53.031 --> 01:16:55.730
<v Speaker 2>cast iron pot barely didn't even fit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trigger.</v>

1622
01:16:56.090 --> 01:16:56.923
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we seared that whole neck and </v>

1623
01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:03.250
<v Speaker 2>then season it really well I season it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with like a,</v>

1624
01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:04.313
<v Speaker 2>a trigger prime rib rub and then a </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee rub and then I put some of the </v>

1625
01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:13.940
<v Speaker 2>rifle and knocked and loaded coffee in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and then put in.</v>

1626
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:18.380
<v Speaker 2>I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the pot was so massive,</v>

1627
01:17:18.381 --> 01:17:19.214
<v Speaker 2>but I put in about six cups of bone </v>
<v Speaker 2>broth and then covered it with a cast </v>

1628
01:17:24.951 --> 01:17:25.784
<v Speaker 2>iron lid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wrapped it all up in foil and then </v>

1629
01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:28.934
<v Speaker 2>cooked it at 2:25</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for about 18 hours because of </v>

1630
01:17:32.241 --> 01:17:33.074
<v Speaker 2>how big it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we knew it was about ready to </v>

1631
01:17:36.141 --> 01:17:36.974
<v Speaker 2>be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we grilled some peppers and think is </v>

1632
01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:43.063
<v Speaker 2>that all we put in their grilled a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of peppers and stuff was like bell </v>

1633
01:17:45.081 --> 01:17:46.940
<v Speaker 2>peppers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bell Peppers,</v>

1634
01:17:46.941 --> 01:17:49.130
<v Speaker 2>and I'm normally I'd do some Jalapenos </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1635
01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:51.560
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then onions in there too,</v>

1636
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1637
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:53.950
<v Speaker 2>maybe some carrots or something in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1638
01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Well there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was onions.</v>

1639
01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:59.330
<v Speaker 2>We did grill some onions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of until they become allies,</v>

1640
01:17:59.331 --> 01:18:00.164
<v Speaker 2>but then open that up and more or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>just took two forks and it just fell </v>

1641
01:18:03.531 --> 01:18:04.364
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>

1642
01:18:04.570 --> 01:18:06.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean just fell apart and kind of did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it all.</v>

1643
01:18:06.921 --> 01:18:10.130
<v Speaker 2>It looked like a looked like a pulled </v>
<v Speaker 2>pork butt is what it looked like.</v>

1644
01:18:10.131 --> 01:18:12.140
<v Speaker 2>And then we went ahead and put in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1645
01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:17.620
<v Speaker 2>the grilled peppers and stuff in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a little bit of sauce in there,</v>

1646
01:18:18.801 --> 01:18:19.634
<v Speaker 2>some Texas spicy and a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saracha covered it back up and just let </v>

1647
01:18:24.231 --> 01:18:25.064
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually took it out and set it in </v>

1648
01:18:26.241 --> 01:18:27.074
<v Speaker 2>the Yeti and then let it just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit in that Yeti for about what we went </v>

1649
01:18:32.241 --> 01:18:34.310
<v Speaker 2>out on the evening hunt and then we came</v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

1650
01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:37.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we ate it for dinner so it just</v>

1651
01:18:37.401 --> 01:18:38.234
<v Speaker 2>sat in that Yeti and just kinda maintain</v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature and just let all the juices </v>

1652
01:18:42.981 --> 01:18:43.814
<v Speaker 2>and everything re redistribute back </v>
<v Speaker 2>through that shredded meat after we </v>

1653
01:18:47.061 --> 01:18:50.180
<v Speaker 2>shredded it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people just went crazy.</v>

1654
01:18:50.181 --> 01:18:52.010
<v Speaker 2>The amount of people that were coming up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me saying,</v>

1655
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:53.600
<v Speaker 2>what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1656
01:18:53.690 --> 01:18:56.390
<v Speaker 2>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they couldn't believe it.</v>

1657
01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.313
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't believe that a giant bowl </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this neck that practically doubled </v>

1658
01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:04.340
<v Speaker 2>knives trying to cut through was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>that awesome,</v>

1659
01:19:04.341 --> 01:19:05.174
<v Speaker 2>but it really is like low and slow is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the name of the game on some of that </v>

1660
01:19:10.251 --> 01:19:11.084
<v Speaker 2>stuff and</v>

1661
01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.680
<v Speaker 1>well the those traeger grills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of pellet grill is such a great</v>

1662
01:19:15.681 --> 01:19:16.514
<v Speaker 1>way to cook something like that too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can maintain the exact </v>

1663
01:19:19.401 --> 01:19:22.840
<v Speaker 1>temperature for long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about,</v>

1664
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:24.470
<v Speaker 1>if you've never used a pellet grill </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>

1665
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:27.890
<v Speaker 1>they use these pellets that are made out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wood.</v>

1666
01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.110
<v Speaker 1>So like this table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to make this table,</v>

1667
01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:31.213
<v Speaker 1>they would use a saw to make the table </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would take the actual sawdust </v>

1668
01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:34.933
<v Speaker 1>and compress it and the natural sugars </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the would make this a compressed </v>

1669
01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:41.330
<v Speaker 1>pellet so they don't add any chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything.</v>

1670
01:19:41.331 --> 01:19:42.164
<v Speaker 1>It's just wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they have this element that </v>

1671
01:19:45.411 --> 01:19:46.244
<v Speaker 1>heats it up and then they have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>little worm drive that feeds pellets </v>

1672
01:19:49.311 --> 01:19:53.460
<v Speaker 1>down into the heated up areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the heated up area turns into the.</v>

1673
01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:54.440
<v Speaker 1>I look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>

1674
01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:59.410
<v Speaker 1>the heated up area turns into fire and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1675
01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.253
<v Speaker 1>you got this little fire going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this hopper with this hopper feeds down </v>

1676
01:20:04.011 --> 01:20:05.060
<v Speaker 1>into this cup rather.</v>

1677
01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:08.250
<v Speaker 1>So the fires in the competent keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>pellets in there,</v>

1678
01:20:08.251 --> 01:20:09.084
<v Speaker 1>so it's a natural fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fire in wood and it gives us </v>

1679
01:20:12.601 --> 01:20:14.640
<v Speaker 1>great flavor to the food that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking.</v>

1680
01:20:14.641 --> 01:20:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Whatever we cook and vegetables or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

1681
01:20:16.321 --> 01:20:21.321
<v Speaker 1>you're cooking meat and in those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain temperature so well,</v>

1682
01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:27.050
<v Speaker 1>so you could keep it on a 190 degrees </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just keep it at one 94 a fucking day</v>

1683
01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:32.550
<v Speaker 1>and they're so efficient that you never </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to add pellets.</v>

1684
01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:35.130
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do the entire 16,</v>

1685
01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:35.964
<v Speaker 1>18 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where the cooking just on one hopper </v>

1686
01:20:37.531 --> 01:20:38.490
<v Speaker 1>full of pellets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1687
01:20:38.491 --> 01:20:39.630
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easy.</v>

1688
01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:40.553
<v Speaker 1>I think they said I think one bag of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pellets is equivalent to like a full </v>

1689
01:20:43.561 --> 01:20:44.610
<v Speaker 1>propane thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1690
01:20:44.611 --> 01:20:48.020
<v Speaker 1>So this is what we cooked and Camp John </v>
<v Speaker 1>made a.</v>

1691
01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:51.000
<v Speaker 1>That is what's called the backstrap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

1692
01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:52.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be uh,</v>

1693
01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:54.870
<v Speaker 1>essentially a tomahawk cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1694
01:20:55.260 --> 01:21:00.260
<v Speaker 1>It was a full of a full section of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tomahawk steaks.</v>

1695
01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Those are all elk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a pot in the back,</v>

1696
01:21:03.301 --> 01:21:04.134
<v Speaker 1>so it's basically the rib and where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rib goes up to the top of the back and </v>

1697
01:21:08.101 --> 01:21:08.934
<v Speaker 1>the back that meet that goes along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the spine is what most people </v>

1698
01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.840
<v Speaker 1>like best at Elc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1699
01:21:14.841 --> 01:21:18.450
<v Speaker 1>You gotta find that picture of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he cooked it like that with um,</v>

1700
01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:22.110
<v Speaker 1>with the bones attached just for </v>
<v Speaker 1>novelty,</v>

1701
01:21:23.370 --> 01:21:27.070
<v Speaker 1>but it was super delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like having that handled the chow</v>

1702
01:21:27.071 --> 01:21:27.904
<v Speaker 1>down on it was super delicious and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that we were doing in camp from an </v>

1703
01:21:31.411 --> 01:21:35.610
<v Speaker 1>elk that you had shot literally the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>before it was as fresh as it gets.</v>

1704
01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1705
01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:39.590
<v Speaker 1>And then you do an n in the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the view out there and just</v>

1706
01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:40.760
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1707
01:21:40.761 --> 01:21:41.900
<v Speaker 2>it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1708
01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:42.883
<v Speaker 2>I was happy to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to tag out early just because of the </v>

1709
01:21:46.221 --> 01:21:50.240
<v Speaker 2>fact I was at know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of good friends there and we</v>

1710
01:21:50.241 --> 01:21:54.000
<v Speaker 2>were able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to grill out and chill out and,</v>

1711
01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:58.930
<v Speaker 2>and I think we probably ate about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>third of that thing over it a lot.</v>

1712
01:21:58.931 --> 01:22:00.440
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we ate a ton of it.</v>

1713
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:03.170
<v Speaker 2>We ate a ton of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which when you were in Alberta,</v>

1714
01:22:03.171 --> 01:22:06.500
<v Speaker 2>you shot a deer early in your hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't you guys eat the.</v>

01:22:13.101 --> 01:22:14.450
<v Speaker 2>we ate a ton of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1720
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Andy's elk too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Andy Shadows bull on nine slash 11.</v>

1721
01:22:17.481 --> 01:22:20.600
<v Speaker 2>We still had I think five days left of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

1722
01:22:20.601 --> 01:22:24.280
<v Speaker 2>so we ate elk three meals a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

1723
01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:29.480
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I always do is I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>always take a trigger with me or,</v>

1724
01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:30.720
<v Speaker 2>or um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1725
01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:31.633
<v Speaker 2>honestly it sounds weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an investment to even if it's </v>

1726
01:22:34.641 --> 01:22:35.474
<v Speaker 2>one of the portable ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to get one there to that new one </v>

1727
01:22:37.731 --> 01:22:38.930
<v Speaker 2>that they have is awesome.</v>

1728
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:40.610
<v Speaker 2>The ranger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really small one.</v>

1729
01:22:40.611 --> 01:22:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing is perfect.</v>

1730
01:22:42.351 --> 01:22:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not heavy either.</v>

1731
01:22:44.650 --> 01:22:47.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the perfect size for,</v>

1732
01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:48.290
<v Speaker 2>for camping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1733
01:22:48.291 --> 01:22:50.360
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think.</v>

1734
01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the weight is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1735
01:22:51.891 --> 01:22:54.050
<v Speaker 2>it's perfect for camping and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>just plug it in.</v>

1736
01:22:54.051 --> 01:22:59.051
<v Speaker 2>Like I have a ram truck and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually just plug in right inside.</v>

1737
01:22:59.301 --> 01:23:00.134
<v Speaker 2>I normally just have an extension cord </v>
<v Speaker 2>and run it through the rear window and </v>

1738
01:23:04.131 --> 01:23:04.964
<v Speaker 2>just plug and go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I took one with me and Sharon </v>

1739
01:23:09.101 --> 01:23:13.240
<v Speaker 2>went down to Oklahoma hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a thing right there.</v>

1740
01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1741
01:23:14.650 --> 01:23:16.780

<v Speaker 2>where does it say?</v>

1742
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:20.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not super late because I mean they,</v>

1743
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:22.030
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are heavy.</v>

1744
01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.070
<v Speaker 2>They are heavy duty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty one pounds.</v>

1745
01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1746
01:23:25.490 --> 01:23:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

1748
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:30.820
<v Speaker 2>In the new ranger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one's actually a little better than that</v>

1749
01:23:30.821 --> 01:23:32.080
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got a digital.</v>

1750

1755
01:23:48.071 --> 01:23:49.240
<v Speaker 2>You can just plug them in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

1756
01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Well we were talking.</v>

1758
01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing,</v>

1759
01:23:56.450 --> 01:23:57.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lived in the city,</v>

1760
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:58.743
<v Speaker 2>like I forgot to bring them up a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>just because I think what he does is </v>

1761
01:24:01.301 --> 01:24:02.500
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1762
01:24:02.590 --> 01:24:03.423
<v Speaker 2>I've got a buddy that lives in New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I found them on instagram working </v>

1763
01:24:06.221 --> 01:24:08.630
<v Speaker 2>out in central park all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1764
01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.513
<v Speaker 2>one time I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was close to central park in the </v>

1765
01:24:11.411 --> 01:24:13.180
<v Speaker 2>morning and I knew he always worked out </v>
<v Speaker 2>early,</v>

1766
01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:15.520
<v Speaker 2>so I texted him like five in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>

1767
01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.350
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey dude said,</v>

1768

<v Speaker 2>And you text back and said,</v>

1769
01:24:19.031 --> 01:24:20.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name is Joseph.</v>

1770
01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:21.273
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do one of these central park </v>

1771
01:24:23.531 --> 01:24:26.650
<v Speaker 2>workouts with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any just carries some supplies and a big</v>

1772
01:24:26.651 --> 01:24:29.830
<v Speaker 2>backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he rux in and then he literally just</v>

1773
01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:34.240
<v Speaker 2>like has certain rocks and stuff and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a.</v>

1774
01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:36.350
<v Speaker 2>If he got there and you were on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>rock,</v>

1775
01:24:36.351 --> 01:24:38.560
<v Speaker 2>will you get mad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1776
01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:42.010
<v Speaker 2>he would be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you got to learn a lesson here by</v>

1777
01:24:42.011 --> 01:24:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Joseph.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1778
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:44.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1779
01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:47.380
<v Speaker 2>So I did a workout with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1780
01:24:47.381 --> 01:24:48.910
<v Speaker 2>he was telling me he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1781
01:24:48.911 --> 01:24:51.130
<v Speaker 2>if you ever get any of that elk meat or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything I'd love,</v>

1782
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's big into I think Quito.</v>

1783
01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:56.793
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was telling me how much he pays </v>

1784
01:24:59.471 --> 01:25:02.290
<v Speaker 2>for store bought meat in New York and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1785
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:05.170
<v Speaker 2>oh my goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is astronomical.</v>

1786
01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:06.483
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't really know where it comes </v>

1787
01:25:07.541 --> 01:25:08.410
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1788
01:25:08.411 --> 01:25:11.080
<v Speaker 2>And for someone that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in tune with his body,</v>

1789
01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:15.520
<v Speaker 2>he was kind of disappointed that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what his options were.</v>

1790
01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:17.080
<v Speaker 2>But then I started thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1791
01:25:17.081 --> 01:25:18.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have,</v>

1792
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.710
<v Speaker 2>do you have the ability for like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>grill,</v>

1793
01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:21.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in Iowa or live in where you </v>

1794
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:23.441
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are.</v>

1795
01:25:23.441 --> 01:25:25.330
<v Speaker 2>We've got some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some big grills.</v>

1796
01:25:25.331 --> 01:25:26.164
<v Speaker 2>We have the space for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people are thinking back to </v>

1797
01:25:28.901 --> 01:25:31.450
<v Speaker 2>myself when I was in my twenties living </v>
<v Speaker 2>in an apartment,</v>

1798
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:34.570
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have had the space for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That right there is a great,</v>

1799
01:25:35.170 --> 01:25:36.820
<v Speaker 2>great option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1800
01:25:36.850 --> 01:25:39.820
<v Speaker 2>it's literally not much bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a couple of briefcases,</v>

1801
01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:41.650
<v Speaker 2>put it on your patio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it on your patio.</v>

1802
01:25:41.651 --> 01:25:42.484
<v Speaker 2>If you're cooking for two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be perfect and you can easily </v>

1803
01:25:45.401 --> 01:25:46.420
<v Speaker 2>cook for two on that thing.</v>

1804
01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:47.253
<v Speaker 2>You can cook for more than two on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing in the cleanup is the most </v>

1805
01:25:49.871 --> 01:25:53.620
<v Speaker 2>important thing with any pellet grill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If anyone's ever going to get one.</v>

1806
01:25:53.890 --> 01:25:56.980
<v Speaker 2>The two things I can tell you our most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important is one,</v>

1807
01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:00.400
<v Speaker 2>just recognize that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it runs off a wooden pellet.</v>

1808
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:03.950
<v Speaker 2>So treat pellet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>treat the like you would,</v>

1809
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:05.390
<v Speaker 2>campfire would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1810
01:26:05.391 --> 01:26:06.224
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you leave camp firewood out where </v>

1811
01:26:07.581 --> 01:26:08.414
<v Speaker 2>it's getting rained on all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it's going to be a pain to </v>

1812
01:26:11.121 --> 01:26:12.980
<v Speaker 2>start it or it's not going to burn that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1813
01:26:12.981 --> 01:26:16.310
<v Speaker 2>So if you keep those dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always put my pellets after I pour the</v>

1814
01:26:16.311 --> 01:26:17.720
<v Speaker 2>bag in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever's left,</v>

1815
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.690
<v Speaker 2>I actually put in one of my Yeti buckets</v>
<v Speaker 2>and put that,</v>

1816
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:22.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of.</v>

1817
01:26:22.131 --> 01:26:22.910
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1818
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:25.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like a sealable lid that I pushed </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1819
01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trigger makes buckets.</v>

1820
01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:31.640
<v Speaker 2>They're made specifically for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sent me a couple of the buckets are</v>

1821
01:26:31.641 --> 01:26:33.110
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but keeping your Palette,</v>

1822
01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:33.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a high humidity place like </v>

1823
01:26:35.481 --> 01:26:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't keep,</v>

1824
01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:42.260
<v Speaker 2>don't keep your pellets outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1825
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:44.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're in the grill and you're using</v>

1826
01:26:44.151 --> 01:26:44.990
<v Speaker 2>the grill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing,</v>

1827
01:26:44.991 --> 01:26:47.990
<v Speaker 2>but don't keep the bags out there all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

1828
01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:51.230
<v Speaker 2>And then as you use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the little,</v>

1829
01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:53.420
<v Speaker 2>it's called a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they call it a burning pot.</v>

1830
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Essentially your pellets are burning in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a small pot.</v>

1831
01:26:56.690 --> 01:26:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of that just the same as you would</v>

1832
01:26:59.150 --> 01:27:01.940
<v Speaker 2>a campfire pit as you're burning wood </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

1833
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.470
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be ash left in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that pot fills up with ash,</v>

1834
01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:07.453
<v Speaker 2>there's not going to be the ability for </v>
<v Speaker 2>as much pellets to go in there so it's </v>

1835
01:27:10.641 --> 01:27:12.260
<v Speaker 2>not going to burn as hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1836
01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:15.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get to the point where you're not</v>

1837
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.943
<v Speaker 2>able to get to your higher temperatures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably because you have too much </v>

1838
01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:21.980
<v Speaker 2>as you've got too much ash in your pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1839
01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:24.070
<v Speaker 2>clean it out and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1840
01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.440
<v Speaker 2>pretty much from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And be easy,</v>

1841
01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:28.880
<v Speaker 2>as easy as flipping it to on and turn it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

1842
01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:29.880
<v Speaker 2>to the template.</v>

1843
01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:30.571
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you want.</v>

1844
01:27:30.571 --> 01:27:31.410
<v Speaker 1>And it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1845
01:27:31.411 --> 01:27:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I was telling you that I tried cooking </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a regular grill,</v>

1846
01:27:33.751 --> 01:27:36.450
<v Speaker 1>a propane grill the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just sucked.</v>

1847
01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:40.950
<v Speaker 1>It was flaring up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a fire and smoke because the fat</v>

1848
01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:44.670
<v Speaker 1>was dripping down into the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a shitty way of cooking.</v>

1849
01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:48.390
<v Speaker 1>They do have a really cool grill though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cooks from above.</v>

1850
01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I've seen one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad ass.</v>

1851
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1852
01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:52.913
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can raise or lower the heat and </v>

1853
01:27:55.561 --> 01:27:58.530
<v Speaker 1>bring it closer to the meat or lifted </v>
<v Speaker 1>above.</v>

1854
01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.170
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't get any flare ups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just cooks from above.</v>

1855
01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a better way to do it if</v>

1856
01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:05.600
<v Speaker 2>you're using propane because that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>

1857
01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.033
<v Speaker 2>I remember once I bought some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some rib eyes and this was back when I </v>

1858
01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:12.800
<v Speaker 2>didn't have the money to buy good </v>
<v Speaker 2>steaks,</v>

1859
01:28:12.801 --> 01:28:13.634
<v Speaker 2>but I had some people who are and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I'm going to buy some good </v>

1860
01:28:14.961 --> 01:28:15.794
<v Speaker 2>steaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went out and spent quite a bit getting </v>

1861
01:28:17.961 --> 01:28:21.860
<v Speaker 2>some good rib eyes and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because there's so much marbling,</v>

1862
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:25.250
<v Speaker 2>I remember I came inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had those on the grill,</v>

1863
01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:27.710
<v Speaker 2>it didn't even have them that high for </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature.</v>

1864
01:28:27.711 --> 01:28:31.830
<v Speaker 2>I came inside and I started working on </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables are pouring drinks for people</v>

1865
01:28:31.831 --> 01:28:32.664
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden I look out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just smoke rolling out of my </v>

1866
01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Weber and I go out there and lift it up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I revise all that marbling.</v>

1867
01:28:39.471 --> 01:28:42.560
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a big burning mess.</v>

1868
01:28:42.561 --> 01:28:45.320
<v Speaker 2>It looked like I took a flame thrower to</v>
<v Speaker 2>one half of my rib eyes.</v>

1869
01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:46.670
<v Speaker 2>So bummed out.</v>

1870
01:28:46.930 --> 01:28:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard doing it right.</v>

1871
01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1872
01:28:49.091 --> 01:28:49.924
<v Speaker 1>there's an art to cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is one of the things that I'm </v>

1873
01:28:52.150 --> 01:28:52.983
<v Speaker 1>really a learning from getting into </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and getting into cooking my own </v>

1874
01:28:56.441 --> 01:29:00.280
<v Speaker 1>food is learning how to do it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's fun.</v>

1875
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:01.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a real art it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1876
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:02.743
<v Speaker 1>like think that net gross that you made </v>
<v Speaker 1>or like some of the more interesting </v>

1877
01:29:05.341 --> 01:29:07.200
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever do shanks?</v>

1878
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1879
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:09.623
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1880
01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I did two last week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1881
01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:12.893
<v Speaker 2>I shot that white tail in South Dakota </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I took both of the front quarters </v>

1882
01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:22.260
<v Speaker 2>and then did slow cooks with those in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1883
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:24.100
<v Speaker 2>They're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1884
01:29:24.101 --> 01:29:24.934
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key for any of that stuff that </v>

1885
01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:29.970
<v Speaker 2>normally has a lot of tendons and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a tougher section of the meat.</v>

1886
01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:31.283
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people try to cook them too </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast and you don't break down that </v>

1887
01:29:34.111 --> 01:29:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Cartlidge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1888
01:29:35.171 --> 01:29:40.171
<v Speaker 2>you need that cartilage to really cook </v>
<v Speaker 2>slow to the point where like gels and it</v>

1889
01:29:40.381 --> 01:29:43.600
<v Speaker 2>breaks down and it almost turns into </v>
<v Speaker 2>marbling in it.</v>

1890
01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:44.453
<v Speaker 2>Then it'll turn into flavoring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of what happened with </v>

1891
01:29:46.441 --> 01:29:47.610
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the neck,</v>

1892
01:29:47.970 --> 01:29:49.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once it cooks slow enough,</v>

1893
01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:52.260
<v Speaker 2>even all those harder tendons that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there,</v>

1894
01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:53.393
<v Speaker 2>they just slowly start decomposing them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>become more of a marbling that's mixed </v>

1895
01:29:56.671 --> 01:29:57.360
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1896
01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.550
<v Speaker 2>And it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>

1897
01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:01.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's awesome.</v>

1898
01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:02.333
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big advocate on the simpler you </v>

1899
01:30:06.181 --> 01:30:10.650
<v Speaker 2>keep things cooking wise for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better the flavors are that I get.</v>

1900
01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:14.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm a very simple cook and when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked me to do,</v>

1901
01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people see pictures that I post cooking </v>

1902
01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:18.773
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1903
01:30:19.190 --> 01:30:20.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to do a cookbook.</v>

1904
01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:21.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

1905
01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:24.390
<v Speaker 2>My cookbook would be boring because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be,</v>

1906
01:30:24.810 --> 01:30:26.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>olive oil probably,</v>

1907
01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:27.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have coffee for rub and have </v>

1908
01:30:29.611 --> 01:30:31.630
<v Speaker 2>like a prime rib rub,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1909
01:30:31.650 --> 01:30:34.590
<v Speaker 2>probably a decent like rock salt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other than that,</v>

1910
01:30:34.591 --> 01:30:38.760
<v Speaker 2>like grass fed butters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>olive oils or a couple basic rubs,</v>

1911
01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:42.810
<v Speaker 2>that's all I use period in a bone broth </v>
<v Speaker 2>if I do like a.</v>

1912
01:30:43.170 --> 01:30:44.003
<v Speaker 2>If I cook something slow to break down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just literally stay with those </v>

1913
01:30:48.601 --> 01:30:50.820
<v Speaker 2>staple things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from there,</v>

1914
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:53.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll cook according to the directions.</v>

1915
01:30:53.611 --> 01:30:54.444
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I learned to do was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was rest my meat so I won't take meat </v>

1916
01:30:59.031 --> 01:31:00.530
<v Speaker 2>off and just cut right into it.</v>

1917
01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:02.430
<v Speaker 1>And you rested in a cooler?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1918
01:31:02.431 --> 01:31:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a Yeti all the time.</v>

1919
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:05.423
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cover it with aluminum foil and the </v>

1920
01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:09.090
<v Speaker 1>butcher paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either when you do it,</v>

1921
01:31:09.091 --> 01:31:10.830
<v Speaker 1>like do you get it to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperature?</v>

1922
01:31:10.831 --> 01:31:11.664
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say if you want your meat to hit an </v>

1923
01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:14.520
<v Speaker 1>internal temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 1:30,</v>

1924
01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:17.790
<v Speaker 1>do you get it to like 1:20</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then put it in the core and then let</v>

1925
01:31:17.791 --> 01:31:18.624
<v Speaker 1>it rise to like 1:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it's in there because it keeps </v>

1926
01:31:20.971 --> 01:31:21.730
<v Speaker 1>cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1927
01:31:21.730 --> 01:31:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Because it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna rise.</v>

1928
01:31:23.461 --> 01:31:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Some it will rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1929
01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:27.840
<v Speaker 1>you got to plan that out before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested too.</v>

1930
01:31:27.841 --> 01:31:29.250
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to do it in a cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1931
01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normally I do.</v>

1932
01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:33.240
<v Speaker 1>It depends how long you're going to rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1933
01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Normally I plan on about six degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll go up.</v>

1934
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:39.600
<v Speaker 1>But you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're resting in the cooler,</v>

1935
01:31:39.601 --> 01:31:41.030
<v Speaker 1>you can still check it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1936
01:31:41.031 --> 01:31:44.040
<v Speaker 1>you can let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then check it.</v>

1937
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Normally for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five degrees is a really good number.</v>

1938
01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'll stop five degrees less than</v>
<v Speaker 1>where</v>

1939
01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:52.700
<v Speaker 2>eat it because when I put it in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wrap it up,</v>

1940
01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:53.653
<v Speaker 2>most vegetables for me take 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as soon as I pull that off my </v>

1941
01:31:57.591 --> 01:31:58.424
<v Speaker 2>trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll turn it up to high and then take </v>

1942
01:32:01.630 --> 01:32:04.270
<v Speaker 2>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like tossed in olive oil and I'll</v>

1943
01:32:04.271 --> 01:32:07.180
<v Speaker 2>season them with a basic rub,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in there,</v>

1944
01:32:07.181 --> 01:32:09.160
<v Speaker 2>but anything like Broccoli,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asparagus,</v>

1945
01:32:09.161 --> 01:32:11.370
<v Speaker 2>peppers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cauliflower,</v>

1946
01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:12.213
<v Speaker 2>anything like that that I cook on there </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't going to take 20 minutes roughly </v>

1947
01:32:15.131 --> 01:32:18.370
<v Speaker 2>on high and the meat is just resting at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>

1948
01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:22.450
<v Speaker 2>And then I can literally pull the meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>off if I want to do reverse sear,</v>

1949
01:32:22.451 --> 01:32:23.284
<v Speaker 2>I can do it just long enough to where </v>
<v Speaker 2>that temperature hits the exact number </v>

1950
01:32:26.651 --> 01:32:28.840
<v Speaker 2>if it hadn't reached that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1951
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:31.690
<v Speaker 2>otherwise I can just slice it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>according to,</v>

1952
01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:32.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the color throughout that I'll serve it </v>

1953
01:32:34.091 --> 01:32:37.780
<v Speaker 2>out to everybody according to whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want something a little more done.</v>

1954
01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:39.830
<v Speaker 2>You give them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the NPS is if people want it less</v>

1955
01:32:39.831 --> 01:32:41.260
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you give them the peace in the middle.</v>

1956
01:32:41.630 --> 01:32:42.463
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but typically if I'm going to let it </v>

1957
01:32:43.241 --> 01:32:47.500
<v Speaker 2>rest for 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll pull it about 129 degrees because I</v>

1958
01:32:47.501 --> 01:32:50.620
<v Speaker 2>like mine at like 1:35</v>
<v Speaker 2>or so you like,</v>

1959
01:32:50.621 --> 01:32:52.030
<v Speaker 2>here's a little less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You like yours?</v>

1960
01:32:52.031 --> 01:32:52.864
<v Speaker 2>A little redder than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he like yours that more like </v>

1961
01:32:55.090 --> 01:32:56.350
<v Speaker 2>1:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>finished don't yet.</v>

1962
01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:00.700
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing too is besides </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping,</v>

1963
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:01.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basics for seasoning is those </v>

1964
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:08.560
<v Speaker 2>thermopolis right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you have a probe,</v>

1965
01:33:08.890 --> 01:33:12.920
<v Speaker 2>that's the one thing that I learned from</v>
<v Speaker 2>our buddy Chad Ward is,</v>

1966
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he travels,</v>

1967
01:33:14.111 --> 01:33:14.944
<v Speaker 2>he travels with a good knife and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>travels with a probe and minds from </v>

1968
01:33:18.970 --> 01:33:20.500
<v Speaker 2>thermo works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1969
01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:21.373
<v Speaker 2>is one I got as a gift someone gave me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can tell you that that was one of </v>

1970
01:33:25.031 --> 01:33:26.290
<v Speaker 2>the best things to get.</v>

1971
01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:31.760
<v Speaker 1>I have a regular internal thermometer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really cool because I can keep it</v>

1972
01:33:32.811 --> 01:33:36.980
<v Speaker 1>in the kitchen and it's got a one probe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the,</v>

1973
01:33:36.981 --> 01:33:37.814
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it registers to a second unit which you </v>

1974
01:33:41.091 --> 01:33:43.800
<v Speaker 1>can keep as a remote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep it far,</v>

1975
01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:46.610
<v Speaker 1>far away from the grill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tells you what's going on.</v>

1976
01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:48.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like Bluetooth or something or </v>
<v Speaker 1>wireless.</v>
