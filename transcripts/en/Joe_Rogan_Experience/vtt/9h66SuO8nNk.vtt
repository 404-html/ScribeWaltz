00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:51.381
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

151
00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Delivery son course.</v>

152
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

153
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Really Nice.</v>

154
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 1>It worked out for awhile.</v>

155
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Did you put on like a guru attitude?</v>

156
00:04:58.631 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

157
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

158
00:04:59.661 --> 00:05:00.041
<v Speaker 1>it lacks,</v>

159
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I've got it all going on ladies at that time,</v>

160
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

161
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.120
<v Speaker 1>that stage in my life now,</v>

162
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I was a disaster</v>

163
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>and I tried to do that now though in the kitchen.</v>

164
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.511
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

165
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:10.811
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

166
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 1>I had a good story minutes.</v>

167
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>It was really funny and like you were talking about soliciting the government</v>

168
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:14.891
<v Speaker 1>for money,</v>

169
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 1>for being an acid casualties,</v>

170
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 1>which is a good idea.</v>

171
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 1>But I was really high and crack once,</v>

172
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

173
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>and just kind of on a bender,</v>

174
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 1>just losing my mind and crack and I thought in the middle of the night and be a</v>

175
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>really good idea to join the CIA and that they would want me,</v>

176
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>me specifically being like Tim Leary's Kit,</v>

177
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>they'd want me because I have access to shit that they want access to.</v>

178
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

179
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Like I can be an inside.</v>

180
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 1>I was a mall and it was high on crack and I downloaded,</v>

181
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.990
<v Speaker 1>I filled out the form.</v>

182
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.481
<v Speaker 1>I got that deep.</v>

183
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I spent hours on it.</v>

184
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 1>It's really long.</v>

185
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Complicated though.</v>

186
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 1>The whole kindest joined the CIA,</v>

187
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.721
<v Speaker 1>printed out,</v>

188
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>sent it in the mail,</v>

189
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.540
<v Speaker 1>sense it in the mail,</v>

190
00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 1>in your mouth.</v>

191
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 1>You're in the CIA there with Anderson Cooper.</v>

192
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>He worked for CNN.</v>

193
00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.253
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

194
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 1>you're in there and never heard back.</v>

195
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>But it was never heard back.</v>

196
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Maybe never seen laughing,</v>

197
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 1>laughed and threw it in the garbage,</v>

198
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:07.491
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

199
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 1>But it was really funny and kind of a great delusional high on drugs,</v>

200
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

201
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.631
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

202
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>So what did you think that you were going to do?</v>

203
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

204
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Like as nomad a operative.</v>

205
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.191
<v Speaker 1>Are we going to do,</v>

206
00:06:17.191 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 1>we gotta fix it from the inside with crack?</v>

207
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

208
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.890
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

209
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.261
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

210
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy.</v>

211
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

212
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>like you can't fuck them,</v>

213
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>but you could kill him.</v>

214
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

215
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.211
<v Speaker 1>you can eat them,</v>

216
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 1>but you can't fuck them.</v>

217
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

218
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>So you can't do a dual purpose.</v>

219
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:33.021
<v Speaker 1>You can't kill him.</v>

220
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:33.441
<v Speaker 1>Fuck him.</v>

221
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Then eat them because then you're fucking a dead animal.</v>

222
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:36.614
<v Speaker 1>And that's gross.</v>

223
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.973
<v Speaker 2>Illegal.</v>

224
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more legal to fuck a dead animal than a live animal.</v>

225
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.451
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

226
00:06:43.451 --> 00:06:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Because what are you doing?</v>

227
00:06:44.311 --> 00:06:46.990
<v Speaker 2>And then you're really just masturbating cause there's not a living thing in</v>

228
00:06:46.991 --> 00:06:47.824
<v Speaker 2>your presence.</v>

229
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.900
<v Speaker 2>It can't be raped</v>

230
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.680
<v Speaker 1>debt.</v>

231
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.830
<v Speaker 1>But you notice how there's like stages of like how you feel about the dead</v>

232
00:06:52.831 --> 00:06:53.430
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

233
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.190
<v Speaker 1>There's like one stage one is the live animal,</v>

234
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

235
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.750
<v Speaker 1>If you fucking alive animal you crazy asshole,</v>

236
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.220
<v Speaker 1>what are you subject to that animal to sage to your fucking a dead animal.</v>

237
00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Like what is wrong with you?</v>

238
00:07:03.361 --> 00:07:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>

239
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Why do you want to fuck this thing?</v>

240
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Forget about whether you should be able to do it,</v>

241
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.610
<v Speaker 1>but if you kill it and then eat it right,</v>

242
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.030
<v Speaker 1>everybody's fine with that because that's like what you're supposed to do but</v>

243
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.830
<v Speaker 1>you can't fuck it's body.</v>

244
00:07:16.831 --> 00:07:19.140
<v Speaker 1>But what if you just jerked off with a chicken cutlet?</v>

245
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.203
<v Speaker 1>What if you took a chicken,</v>

246
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.980
<v Speaker 1>he wrapped around your Dick and someone came in the room and like,</v>

247
00:07:22.981 --> 00:07:24.210
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you doing Greg?</v>

248
00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:24.361
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:24.601
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

250
00:07:24.601 --> 00:07:25.111
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

251
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.440
<v Speaker 1>it sounds crazy but it feels so good and I just cleaned it up and then I eat it</v>

252
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>for dinner.</v>

253
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:31.363
<v Speaker 1>It takes a bite.</v>

254
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.790
<v Speaker 1>What's this nice cream sauce?</v>

255
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.923
<v Speaker 1>How dare you,</v>

256
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.740
<v Speaker 2>now that you say fucking a chicken cutlet,</v>

257
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.590

<v Speaker 2>It's soft.</v>

259
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.280
<v Speaker 2>When those GMO chickens,</v>

260
00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:45.450
<v Speaker 2>it would wrap right around your heart.</v>

261
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>

262
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.060
<v Speaker 2>And it's a breast.</v>

263
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.160
<v Speaker 2>You thinking about it being at your tit fuck in it.</v>

264
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.720
<v Speaker 1>You know what you would do?</v>

265
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 1>You would take a bag like a,</v>

266
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

267
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm Ziploc storage bags.</v>

268
00:07:57.381 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 1>You get the chicken cutlet in the bag and then heat up some water to about a 99</v>

269
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:07.061
<v Speaker 1>degrees and then you dunk the chicken cutlet in the water so that it heats up.</v>

270
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.091
<v Speaker 1>It gets,</v>

271
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:10.180
<v Speaker 1>but you know like a body skin temperature.</v>

272
00:08:10.181 --> 00:08:10.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

273
00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Then you just covered that bitch with k y yeah.</v>

274
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Just lather it in there.</v>

275
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.410
<v Speaker 1>And then you put an oven Mitt on</v>

276
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.903
<v Speaker 1>the cutlet.</v>

277
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>You wrapped that Cutler around your shaft.</v>

278
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

279
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 1>crimes against humanity.</v>

280
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Never felt so good.</v>

281
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.110
<v Speaker 2>And then yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're gonna Cook that Shit because you've tenderized it.</v>

285
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Especially like you don't have to use in edible oil.</v>

286
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>You could jerk off with a nice avocado oil or coconut oil.</v>

287
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.040
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

288
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

289
00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 1>avocado oil has a high flashpoints oil to jerk off with.</v>

290
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

291
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Cause then after you're done,</v>

292
00:08:47.851 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Speaker 1>as long as you don't come on your chicken,</v>

293
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:50.611
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

294
00:08:50.611 --> 00:08:50.871
