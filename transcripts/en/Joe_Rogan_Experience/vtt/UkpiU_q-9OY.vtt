24
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Last night I was in a Phoenix walking by restaurant.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's so fun and just shot the documentary sugarcoated.</v>

33
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.651
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Have you seen it?</v>

35
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying.</v>

36
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.773
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

37
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Mother on that sugar movie seen that sugar movie.</v>

38
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

39
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

40
00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Sugar is terrible.</v>

41
00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a conspiracy theory here.</v>

42
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea it was right in front of my fucking face.</v>

43
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not everyone's on everyone's table.</v>

44
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 1>What it is,</v>

45
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

46
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a drug and people are addicted to it and it's in everything.</v>

47
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.681
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

48
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm talking about is there was a conspiracy to pay off Harvard</v>

49
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 1>scientists and professors here we go to keep sugar according to that movie.</v>

50
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:24.451
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna stop movies.</v>

51
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit.</v>

52
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

53
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.903
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it works.</v>

54
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Then when we talking about the sugar association,</v>

55
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want it to be labeled as for what it really was,</v>

56
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.081
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>an addictive toxin.</v>

59
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>They want her to keep it.</v>

60
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>It ain't that bad in moderation and ain't that bad.</v>

61
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 1>It makes things taste sweet.</v>

62
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:41.514
<v Speaker 1>It's about love.</v>

63
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.383
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

64
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>they paid according to this documentary,</v>

65
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 1>they paid out Harvey now cause everyone's like,</v>

66
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:47.424
<v Speaker 1>I'm science,</v>

67
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm a science.</v>

68
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.301
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

69
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm science that says it's beautiful when people do that because then all you do</v>

70
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>is buy up all the scientists and you got everybody.</v>

71
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I love some sugar though,</v>

72
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

73
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loves sugar.</v>

74
00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:57.084
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about it.</v>

75
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>It tastes awesome.</v>

76
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean it doesn't,</v>

77
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:03.921
<v Speaker 1>it's not a drug that works because the effects aren't pleasurable like sugar.</v>

78
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:05.060
<v Speaker 1>It's very pleasurable.</v>

79
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>It also has its benefits too.</v>

80
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Postworkout stuff like that.</v>

81
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Certain athletes need that stuff,</v>

82
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>so it's different than a lot of</v>

83
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>sense that there's arguments against that.</v>

84
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Let's say there's more for it.</v>

85
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that's a sugar coated because I know about the conspiracy.</v>

86
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Brendan is about that.</v>

87
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

88
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I always thought when people ask me about sugar gets bad for you,</v>

89
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>but as long as you don't get too crazy with it and you don't,</v>

90
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>you don't have nothing to worry about.</v>

91
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>You're not fat.</v>

92
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Only fat people have something to worry about as long as,</v>

93
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 1>but according to this documentary,</v>

94
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>people that are in shape are getting adult onset diabetes because they think</v>

95
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:42.831
<v Speaker 1>that apparently according to this doc one coke a day increases your chances for</v>

96
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:45.340
<v Speaker 1>diabetes by 30% if she,</v>

97
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.250
<v Speaker 1>if that Shit's true.</v>

98
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of coke and one coke a day is some insane amount of 50 grams of sugar</v>

99
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>sugar,</v>

100
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 1>40 40 it's only supposed to have 25 in a day.</v>

101
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.680
<v Speaker 1>It's ensuring,</v>

102
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

103
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.220
<v Speaker 1>that's including fruit.</v>

104
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Lactose.</v>

105
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.061
<v Speaker 2>You're only,</v>

106
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:06.061
<v Speaker 2>you're only supposed to get sugar and no more than 25 grams and actually nobody</v>

107
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 2>deals with fuck that noise.</v>

108
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:10.730
<v Speaker 2>As a kid I was balls deep.</v>

109
00:03:10.731 --> 00:03:11.790
<v Speaker 2>200 grams a day.</v>

110
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.143
<v Speaker 2>Watch.</v>

111
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's about.</v>

112
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 2>We bring it back to the postworkout shit cause mark Sisson was talking about</v>

113
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.320
<v Speaker 2>actual gains that your body has more gains if you wait up to an hour after a</v>

114
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 2>working out before you supplement,</v>

115
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 2>before you take anything for you taking any food.</v>

116
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 2>And I started doing it and he said that there's a like a reaction that your body</v>

117
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 2>has where it produces more um,</v>

118
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 2>hormones because your body is just had like this brutal workout and your body</v>

119
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 2>hasn't had a replenishment.</v>

120
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 2>So because it has an end,</v>

121
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:40.121
<v Speaker 2>a replenishment,</v>

122
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 2>I guess during that time period,</v>

123
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 2>if you replenish,</v>

124
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I think the sign,</v>

125
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 2>the sciences or the your according to him,</v>

126
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

127
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what studies smartest done.</v>

128
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 2>It does a very smart dude.</v>

129
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.150
<v Speaker 2>I'll take his word.</v>

130
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

131
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 2>That it's better to do it that way.</v>

132
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:58.471
<v Speaker 2>You get more results hormonally than you do if you immediately glycogen load</v>

133
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise your body stops doing what was going to do.</v>

134
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:02.051
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

135
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Because let's slow it slows it.</v>

136
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:04.631
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

137
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to,</v>

138
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:05.981
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

139
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck do you know exactly how someone got their gains?</v>

140
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.271
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

141
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about athletes,</v>

142
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:11.621
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

143
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:13.350
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about people all work out hard.</v>

144
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 2>There's some of genetic freaks and you know,</v>

145
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.110
<v Speaker 2>most people are on slightly varied diets and slightly varied sleep schedules.</v>

146
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 2>So it's super hard to say like,</v>

147
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 2>if a guy didn't do it that way,</v>

148
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 2>how much of a game he would calculate?</v>

149
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.100
<v Speaker 2>I had some silly bitch telling me forever to drink chocolate milk mail that was</v>

150
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be the craze for get them off the time that was supposed to be the</v>

151
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:35.310
<v Speaker 2>craze.</v>

152
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.530
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

153
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a good excuse to eat chocolate milk.</v>

154
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.103
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>

155
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.071
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>

156
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 2>It was so Nestle Quik,</v>

157
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 2>so with a fight that's about to start.</v>

158
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:43.241
<v Speaker 2>Bruce Bruce,</v>

159
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 2>buffer looking slick as always is Josh Berkman verses Paul Felder.</v>

160
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 2>This is a fucking amazing fight.</v>

161
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.331
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

162
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

163
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Josh Berkman has fought as high as two oh five.</v>

164
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Josh Berkman fought Jeremy Horn one day and uh,</v>

165
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Horn choked him out and spit on him and his aggressive.</v>

166
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.191
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

167
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 2>They must have said some really dark shit to each other before that fight.</v>

168
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 2>That's aggressive.</v>

169
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 2>But Josh Barkman is a bad motherfucker dude.</v>

170
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 2>And at one 55 he's so God damn strong.</v>

171
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 2>If he can do it and do it successfully,</v>

172
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.290
<v Speaker 2>he's a bully at this weight.</v>

173
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 2>He's just a tough,</v>

174
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 2>tough motherfucker and he's slick.</v>

175
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 2>But this Paul Felder kid can crack a lot of tools.</v>

176
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it has more tools I think standing he does,</v>

177
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 2>but Berkman is down dude,</v>

178
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.090
<v Speaker 2>that guy with his board game.</v>

179
00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like the game,</v>

180
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 2>it's evolving fast and filters more evolved them accent and younger and less</v>

181
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:34.920
<v Speaker 2>miles.</v>

182
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 2>What I like about this less miles for sure,</v>

183
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 2>but what I like about this fight is,</v>

184
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 2>this is essentially an old real fucking crafty veteran in Berkman who is a dog.</v>

185
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a fucking bull dog.</v>

186
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Game is they comp and you have less other yeah,</v>

187
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.611
<v Speaker 2>fuck him.</v>

188
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:52.031
<v Speaker 2>And he shut.</v>

189
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Heck Act along bowed down to one point.</v>

190
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 2>One word was on Tuesday and Lavard was juiced up and you know,</v>

191
00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:58.214
<v Speaker 2>Lombard</v>

192
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>kept swinging at him and Berkman kept moon.</v>

193
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>But Berkman was cracking him a little.</v>

194
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

195
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>And it got lumbar to a point where Lombard slowed down his,</v>

196
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

197
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 1>his attack because he kind of knew that he wasn't gonna Take Burke Mountain.</v>

198
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>He was going to have to do the long haul.</v>

199
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Like our Feldman TKL.</v>

200
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Do we have to say man?</v>

201
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

202
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 1>it's four 50 right now for 48,</v>

203
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 1>four 47 first round.</v>

204
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:20.084
<v Speaker 1>Paul Felder,</v>

205
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Josh Bergman,</v>

206
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 1>a fight that I've been really looking to for this.</v>

207
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I feel like this whole card is totally under the radar.</v>

208
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean Hanan Barao was fighting Jeremy Stevens,</v>

209
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>the fucking,</v>

210
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>the Khomeini.</v>

211
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.751
<v Speaker 1>It's incest,</v>

212
00:06:30.751 --> 00:06:31.380
<v Speaker 1>the combing.</v>

213
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more,</v>

214
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

216
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>like for the average fan,</v>

217
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:36.800
<v Speaker 1>there's no huge draws.</v>

218
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 1>But as far as Joe Silva and those,</v>

219
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.030
<v Speaker 1>and Joe Silva,</v>

220
00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 1>who's the other dude who does the matchups,</v>

221
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Sean,</v>

222
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Sean Shelby,</v>

223
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

224
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 1>they got their money's worth.</v>

225
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.621
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

226
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Like they paid them exactly what they should do because these matchups,</v>

227
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.010
<v Speaker 1>these aren't matchups that you can go like five or six,</v>

228
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

229
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Two verse three there are amazing to me it's the best card of the year.</v>

230
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure Sean handles the match ups for the lighter weight fighters.</v>

231
00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

232
00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.871
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

233
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what,</v>

234
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.681
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

235
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Wait a silver takes over,</v>

236
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:03.340
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

237
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 1>both of them are doing a fucking awesome job.</v>

238
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:05.221
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

239
00:07:05.221 --> 00:07:06.054
<v Speaker 1>this card,</v>

240
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.380
<v Speaker 1>this card show,</v>

241
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.851
<v Speaker 1>you look at it,</v>

242
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:08.780
<v Speaker 1>you're like Jesus Christ.</v>

243
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.643
<v Speaker 1>They just want the matchups.</v>

244
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.461
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't think about it.</v>

245
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 1>They just went shinny Shin.</v>

246
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Let's pay attention to the year though.</v>

247
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

248
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.391
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

249
00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:13.520
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

250
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Really good cars.</v>

251
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 1>As far as match up match up wise,</v>

252
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing card.</v>

253
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good card.</v>

254
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:19.581
<v Speaker 1>It's way,</v>

255
00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>way better than people are giving it credit for.</v>

256
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:22.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a,</v>

257
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.490
<v Speaker 1>this is the first UFC I ever saw.</v>

258
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.801
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

259
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:25.634
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

260
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 1>what a nutty sport.</v>

261
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll call this UFC just fucking watch.</v>

262
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Just like straight up.</v>

263
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Just watch it man.</v>

264
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't know the guys,</v>

265
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:35.400
<v Speaker 1>but this is going to be a great night of fights and if you're betting it's can</v>

266
00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:37.460
<v Speaker 1>be tough to pick man for experts.</v>

267
00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Try picking this card.</v>

268
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see someone just go,</v>

269
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.850
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

270
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

271
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 1>eight for eight.</v>

272
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.033
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a beast.</v>

273
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

274
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:44.594
<v Speaker 1>You know what man?</v>

275
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 1>This is a sneaky fight.</v>

276
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.941
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>

277
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Nice front kick to the body by Felder and Josh returns it</v>

278
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.763
<v Speaker 3>perfect.</v>

279
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Felt has got a lot of tools when it comes to standup.</v>

280
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 1>He's a real sneaky,</v>

281
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.310
<v Speaker 1>he does a lot of weird shit like cowboy man training at the ranch.</v>

282
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Real similar in some ways,</v>

283
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 1>but also because he's got a taekwondo background.</v>

284
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.480
<v Speaker 1>He throws more spinning shit than cowboy does.</v>

285
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Cowboys like straight Moy Tai who these guys are straight forward a couple of</v>

286
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.021
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

287
00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Man had a lot of checking.</v>

288
00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:16.341
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

289
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:17.930
<v Speaker 1>good defensive skills here.</v>

290
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.133

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

327
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.090
<v Speaker 1>weight in 20 somethings rounds.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

331
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I would think that's a fatigue thing.</v>

332
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more he just don't want to be there.</v>

333
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like self sabotage.</v>

334
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Need the money.</v>

335

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Super legit.</v>

337
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 1>It'd be real hard to tap that guy for doing black belt.</v>

338
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

341
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:24.744
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Jason's no joke.</v>

343
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.581
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

344
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:26.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

345

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

347
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Jason fought Jake shields and had his back and had a fully locked in Vernon</v>

348
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 1>naked choke in the fucking bell rang.</v>

349
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had a,</v>

350
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I believe he had gable grip,</v>

351
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 1>but he had it under the Chin and everything.</v>

352
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.873
<v Speaker 1>It was a tight,</v>

353
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.750
<v Speaker 1>tight squeeze.</v>

354
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

355

00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 1>You see?</v>

359
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.680
<v Speaker 1>But this is what Berkman wants.</v>

360
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Fell down.</v>

361
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.920
<v Speaker 1>He's a not do this.</v>

362
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 1>He's more technical.</v>

363
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

367
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Failed is in a bad place here because on the ground Berchmans a beast.</v>

368
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Super fucking strong again.</v>

369
00:09:56.491 --> 00:10:00.780
<v Speaker 1>You gotta think about Berkman has fought successfully at one 70 and all the way</v>

370
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 1>up to like two oh five we get that old man strength through.</v>

371
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.060
<v Speaker 1>He just tossed as youngness.</v>

372
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.610
<v Speaker 1>He's just a guy who's been around a long fucking time.</v>

373
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:09.840
<v Speaker 1>He's a smart dude too.</v>

374
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:10.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

375
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:10.671
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

376
00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:12.810
<v Speaker 1>that Hector Lombard fight shows how smart he is.</v>

377
00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:14.160
<v Speaker 1>He was never really in the pocket.</v>

378
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:15.760
<v Speaker 1>He just avoid all his is.</v>

379
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.520
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't lose his shit.</v>

380
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.141
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

381
00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

382
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.460
<v Speaker 1>like the fire will be hot as fuck and he sits in there and doesn't lose control</v>

383
00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:22.651
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

384
00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

385
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 1>He can do what he can do and he's not going to fall short.</v>

386
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Psychologic stays in his lane to,</v>

387
00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:30.060
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't try anything too crazy.</v>

388
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:30.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

389
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I can see you have fricking stupid Chris Weidman bullshit spinning kick or</v>

390
00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:34.180
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

391
00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

392
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.090
<v Speaker 1>we never saw that from Weidman here.</v>

393
00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:36.370
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

394
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Well let's not see it ever again as crazy.</v>

395
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

396
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.650
<v Speaker 1>It costs you the fight son.</v>

397
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

398
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.510
<v Speaker 1>The Art of getting back up is,</v>

399
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's so deep.</v>

400
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:46.090
<v Speaker 1>It's the fence crawl.</v>

401
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Some is really good at it.</v>

402
00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Some guys are okay and who's the best I've ever seen who?</v>

403
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:51.773
<v Speaker 1>Keith treading.</v>

404
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

405
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

406
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.550
<v Speaker 1>He's tried to do things.</v>

407
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.720
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Animal Dude.</v>

408
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:55.440
<v Speaker 1>He would always go,</v>

409
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:55.640
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

410
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 1>go straight to the cage and walk,</v>

411
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.373
<v Speaker 1>go walk.</v>

412
00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 1>He was just such a beast.</v>

413
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Straight to the Cajun way.</v>

414
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Wherever you work,</v>

415
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.180
<v Speaker 1>you got to get to the case.</v>

416
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 1>That was his thing and that's what I started doing.</v>

417
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:04.951
<v Speaker 1>That people like no,</v>

418
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:05.350
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

419
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Like I doesn't a pound your face and,</v>

420
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 1>but that was Keith thing really.</v>

421
00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:11.460
<v Speaker 1>So he was one of the first guys to figure out to use the case to get up.</v>

422
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:11.940
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

423
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.601
<v Speaker 1>that was his thing.</v>

424
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:13.920
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you get taken down.</v>

425
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:14.940
<v Speaker 1>If the guy had your hips,</v>

426
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:17.490
<v Speaker 1>you are scooting to get to the cage to use it to crawl up,</v>

427
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.200
<v Speaker 1>and then he was so fucking good at it,</v>

428
00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:19.500
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

429
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.480
<v Speaker 1>None of us get holding down.</v>

430
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

431
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.133
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

432
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:22.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

433
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Keith Jardeen is a guy who doesn't get the credit he deserves and a lot of ways</v>

434
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.420
<v Speaker 1>that's fight with chuck.</v>

435
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fight with trial.</v>

436
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.640
<v Speaker 1>What a fight.</v>

437
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:30.631

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

440
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Keith was real smart with the application of leg kicks and he hit him with that</v>

441
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 1>big right hand.</v>

442
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.870
<v Speaker 1>So awkward man.</v>

443
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

444
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.530
<v Speaker 1>this whole like I rang a Tang jump,</v>

445
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.373
<v Speaker 1>jiggy hands,</v>

446

<v Speaker 1>so offered.</v>

447
00:11:41.141 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 1>He wrote Turang and tank style.</v>

448
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.493
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

449
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Berkman cracked him.</v>

450
00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

451
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.920
<v Speaker 1>This oh sidekick.</v>

452
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.391
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

453
00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Straight left lunging sidekick.</v>

454
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:50.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

455
00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:51.450
<v Speaker 1>he's doing that.</v>

456
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys are doing that till legs now.</v>

457
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.551
<v Speaker 2>Dangerous.</v>

458
00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones loves doing that.</v>

459
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Dangerous.</v>

460
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.550
<v Speaker 2>You mean for someone's knee?</v>

461
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

462
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.450
<v Speaker 2>you see Berchmans willing these exchanges.</v>

463
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:00.881
<v Speaker 2>What would you,</v>

464
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:02.290
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather have someone do that to my knee.</v>

465
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Then someone Shin kicked me in the head.</v>

466
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Definitely dangerous.</v>

467
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.340
<v Speaker 2>It's more dangerous than that.</v>

468
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.110
<v Speaker 2>It's totally agree.</v>

469
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:08.620
<v Speaker 2>100% totally good point.</v>

470
00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.493
<v Speaker 2>There's good.</v>

471
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

472
00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:15.151
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is that we're used to being able to tap from knee injuries.</v>

473
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.541
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

474
00:12:16.541 --> 00:12:16.721
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

475
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:16.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

476
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 2>because of like a knee bar.</v>

477
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.760
<v Speaker 2>So when people look at a strike to a naval go all that's not fair because he</v>

478
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 2>can't tap.</v>

479
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:22.991
<v Speaker 2>But Eddie,</v>

480
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 2>you made the perfect point.</v>

481
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 2>It's the perfect point.</v>

482
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 2>That's a fight.</v>

483
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:26.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

484
00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Because if you kick somebody in the head,</v>

485
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:29.110
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking way worse.</v>

486
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:30.130
<v Speaker 2>You can't tap to that.</v>

487
00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:30.630
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

488
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.630
<v Speaker 2>let's just pull up,</v>

489
00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:32.411
<v Speaker 2>but let's just go over the,</v>

490
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:36.520
<v Speaker 2>so if you knocked me out by head kick on what spending six months you kicked me</v>

491
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:37.070
<v Speaker 2>in that front knee,</v>

492
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 2>you blow blow my ACL.</v>

493
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.681
<v Speaker 2>NCL.</v>

494
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I can't work for a year.</v>

495
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:40.750
<v Speaker 2>At least I,</v>

496
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.580
<v Speaker 2>we'll come back.</v>

497
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.000
<v Speaker 2>Let's be totally honest.</v>

498
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:43.880
<v Speaker 2>If you get,</v>

499
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.040
<v Speaker 2>never heard of that ever happening.</v>

500
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:45.874
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of it.</v>

501
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:46.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

502
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.310
<v Speaker 2>just start with just the new thing.</v>

503
00:12:48.311 --> 00:12:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Give a title in the UFC it's always,</v>

504
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:51.491
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

505
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:51.551
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

506
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:51.760
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

507
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.571
<v Speaker 2>it's been legal.</v>

508
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:55.080
<v Speaker 2>But Jon Jones is really the first guy to start doing it.</v>

509
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Act upon felt to just cracked him.</v>

510
00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Guys getting kicked like that.</v>

511
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Like does one five eggs break.</v>

512
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.030
<v Speaker 2>There's one finance Miguel Torres,</v>

513
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.620
<v Speaker 2>Miguel Torres gets um,</v>

514
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.710
<v Speaker 2>he get an oblique kicked on the knee and is this was in a legacy kickboxing</v>

515
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:11.021
<v Speaker 2>fight?</v>

516
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:11.854
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>

517
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.880
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty recent,</v>

518
00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 2>like within two years.</v>

519
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.580
<v Speaker 2>And Miguel Torres,</v>

520
00:13:15.581 --> 00:13:18.040
<v Speaker 2>his knee just went fucking sideways.</v>

521
00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:23.041
<v Speaker 2>It was nasty and he screamed and fell down and got back up and kept fighting.</v>

522
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:25.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the fuck he did it.</v>

523
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.300
<v Speaker 2>That's one guy that I thought it was the Sharon Woods would still be at the top.</v>

524
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:28.900
<v Speaker 2>Miguel.</v>

525
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.733
<v Speaker 2>Miguel.</v>

526
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.173
<v Speaker 2>Well this is what,</v>

527
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:32.621
<v Speaker 2>this is what I was going to say.</v>

528
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Knockouts,</v>

529
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.203
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

530
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

531
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:38.770
<v Speaker 2>it's not just as simple as you get your ligament repair and you do your rehab</v>

532
00:13:38.771 --> 00:13:39.251
<v Speaker 2>and your back.</v>

533
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Nine months later you might not ever be the same guy again.</v>

534
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Talking about the dot count.</v>

535
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

536
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:44.330
<v Speaker 2>like a real knockout,</v>

537
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.700
<v Speaker 2>like a real knockout.</v>

538
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.320
<v Speaker 2>But that's what you sign up for.</v>

539
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:48.910
<v Speaker 2>You expect concussions now.</v>

540
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't expect get my need blown out in a fight.</v>

541
00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:52.840
<v Speaker 2>But it's a part of your body.</v>

542
00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone can attack your head walk,</v>

543
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't he be able to attack your knee?</v>

544
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Will same.</v>

545
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.140
<v Speaker 2>Seems crazy.</v>

546
00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Fell let's same reason the NFL.</v>

547
00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:02.230
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't attack the idea that sells a sport.</v>

548
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

549
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.150
<v Speaker 2>let's use,</v>

550
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:05.560
<v Speaker 2>this is a sport,</v>

551
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.380
<v Speaker 2>but this is the sport of fighting what?</v>

552
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.230
<v Speaker 2>With rules?</v>

553
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:08.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

554
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:09.880
<v Speaker 2>but the rules are stricter.</v>

555
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Rules are already really brutal.</v>

556
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea of taking out a rule of kicking the knee when you can kick a guy</v>

557
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:16.840
<v Speaker 2>in the fucking jaw face.</v>

558
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.260
<v Speaker 2>But I can't kick him in the face if he has three points on the ground.</v>

559
00:14:20.261 --> 00:14:21.120
<v Speaker 2>So there are rules.</v>

560
00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:22.680
<v Speaker 2>So you can't say it in that sport.</v>

561
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.760
<v Speaker 2>Well honestly I don't agree with that either.</v>

562
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with that either.</v>

563
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.110
<v Speaker 2>I think this,</v>

564
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.900
<v Speaker 2>you see where that UFC line is?</v>

565
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 2>See where the outside logo is and this is the line,</v>

566
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:32.920
<v Speaker 2>the inner rock to guys.</v>

567
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.100
<v Speaker 2>What I say is everything outside that octagon,</v>

568
00:14:36.101 --> 00:14:38.770
<v Speaker 2>you can't kick him in the face because it's too close to the cage.</v>

569
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.470
<v Speaker 2>The only problem with kicking someone in the face when they're down is that the</v>

570
00:14:41.471 --> 00:14:44.770
<v Speaker 2>cage could prevent you from moving and you'd get kicked with something that you</v>

571
00:14:44.771 --> 00:14:46.540
<v Speaker 2>couldn't normally have prevented.</v>

572
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.140
<v Speaker 2>So there's a an obstacle and that obstacle is sort of artificial.</v>

573
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.780
<v Speaker 2>And since we can't just an enormous basketball size playing field,</v>

574
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:54.950
<v Speaker 2>which is really ideal,</v>

575
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.100
<v Speaker 2>the ideal way to do MMA is not to have any walls.</v>

576
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 2>There's something stupid about having walls.</v>

577
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:00.361
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

578
00:15:00.361 --> 00:15:04.490
<v Speaker 2>we really should have is a large like football size arena.</v>

579
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.841
<v Speaker 2>Put a guy and I said,</v>

580
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:06.141
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

581
00:15:06.141 --> 00:15:07.100
<v Speaker 2>You have it for football,</v>

582
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.380
<v Speaker 2>but a guy,</v>

583
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.571
<v Speaker 2>he put it,</v>

584
00:15:09.571 --> 00:15:10.180
<v Speaker 2>God guys,</v>

585
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:10.790
<v Speaker 2>look and feel it.</v>

586
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.340
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way you're not having this bullshit.</v>

587
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.941
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

588
00:15:13.941 --> 00:15:17.360
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with learning how to clinch and fight up against the cage.</v>

589
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.540
<v Speaker 2>It's super important because you use a cage.</v>

590
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 2>But in reality a real fight should not have anything to do with the wall.</v>

591
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:27.260
<v Speaker 2>You press the guy up against in a sport,</v>

592
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:28.880
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a structure,</v>

593
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:29.080
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

594
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

595
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:29.780
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

596
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.770
<v Speaker 2>you stay in bounds.</v>

597
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.790
<v Speaker 2>This is your boundaries.</v>

598
00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:32.624
<v Speaker 2>You have a big ass,</v>

599
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.460
<v Speaker 2>terrible experience at Disney babies.</v>

600
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:39.590
<v Speaker 2>But you wouldn't have this shit.</v>

601
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.840
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't have this pressing against the wall.</v>

602
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 2>It is an art form,</v>

603
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:47.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's an art form that's artificially created by an obstacle.</v>

604
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.860
<v Speaker 2>This obstacle should not be there.</v>

605
00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:49.560
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't be.</v>

606
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be able to press people against it.</v>

607
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.621
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

608
00:15:51.621 --> 00:15:51.950
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

609
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't be.</v>

610
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.500
<v Speaker 2>But that shouldn't be a part of fighting.</v>

611
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.310
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

612
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.150
<v Speaker 2>there's water everywhere to you.</v>

613
00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Free treason.</v>

614
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.333
<v Speaker 2>He can't do it.</v>

615
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it in football.</v>

616
00:16:02.191 --> 00:16:04.220
<v Speaker 2>That's like saying well there should be no out of bounds.</v>

617
00:16:04.221 --> 00:16:05.054
<v Speaker 2>You guys just run.</v>

618
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Football has bounds.</v>

619
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.070
<v Speaker 2>They have plenty of room cause you never larger.</v>

620
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.070
<v Speaker 2>They have a large arena but oh fell to just cracked him on the left hand.</v>

621
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:15.111
<v Speaker 2>This man,</v>

622
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:15.810
<v Speaker 2>I said second round,</v>

623
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:16.340
<v Speaker 2>just hill.</v>

624
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.720
<v Speaker 2>I think offenses are artificial and I think they should fight in large</v>

625
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.450
<v Speaker 2>unenclosed areas and if you hate viewership,</v>

626
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.063
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

627
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:25.760
<v Speaker 2>purity.</v>

628
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.930
<v Speaker 2>I want no gloves,</v>

629
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.191
<v Speaker 2>no more gloves,</v>

630
00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:29.060
<v Speaker 2>no more hand wraps,</v>

631
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:29.511
<v Speaker 2>no risks,</v>

632
00:16:29.511 --> 00:16:30.680
<v Speaker 2>shapes Dr own shit.</v>

633
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:31.851

634
00:16:31.851 --> 00:16:32.490
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

635
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.440
<v Speaker 2>this is nonsense.</v>

636
00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:34.370
<v Speaker 2>He's gloves are stupid.</v>

637
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.413
<v Speaker 2>These gloves,</v>

638
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.210
<v Speaker 2>these gloves only exists for people to watch at home day,</v>

639
00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:39.044
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>

640
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Only for people watching at home.</v>

641
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.410
<v Speaker 2>If you're a real martial artist,</v>

642
00:16:42.411 --> 00:16:44.360
<v Speaker 2>you would not want gloves because gloves,</v>

643
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:49.100
<v Speaker 2>gloves give you this artificial idea that you can hit someone as hard as you</v>

644
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:49.970
<v Speaker 2>want with your hands,</v>

645
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.380
<v Speaker 2>without them exploding on you,</v>

646
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.690
<v Speaker 2>but you got everything taped up wrapped up.</v>

647
00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're going to Nelson,</v>

648
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.770
<v Speaker 2>that gangster ass motherfucker doesn't even wear wraps.</v>

649
00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:58.933
<v Speaker 2>He's just good.</v>

650
00:16:59.060 --> 00:16:59.893
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to</v>

651
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.390
<v Speaker 2>punch you and choke you.</v>

652
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:02.931
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

653
00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to fit in my hands.</v>

654
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.990
<v Speaker 2>I could fit it better.</v>

655
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.040
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting on Fox with no,</v>

658
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Felton was getting hit by Barbosa with those kicks.</v>

659
00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.023
<v Speaker 2>Felder,</v>

660
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.300

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:24.683
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

664
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.840
<v Speaker 2>he said he just walked in with a bottle of wine and two fucking goat cheese,</v>

665
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.271
<v Speaker 2>milk,</v>

666
00:17:32.271 --> 00:17:32.550
<v Speaker 2>cheese.</v>

667
00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:33.383
<v Speaker 2>Everyone.</v>

668
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Good enzyme.</v>

669
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.390
<v Speaker 2>Get it at whole foods.</v>

670
00:17:35.391 --> 00:17:35.901
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yes.</v>

671
00:17:35.901 --> 00:17:36.860
<v Speaker 2>I got it from whole foods.</v>

672
00:17:36.861 --> 00:17:38.270
<v Speaker 2>You son of a gun and a lot of money too.</v>

673
00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:39.350
<v Speaker 2>They were like ha that much.</v>

674
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:39.740
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

675
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.341
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

676
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:43.040
<v Speaker 2>I have a successful podcast and I'm friends with Eddie Bravo.</v>

677
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.570
<v Speaker 2>They said you have that last powerful cheese anyway,</v>

678
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.410
<v Speaker 2>no gloves.</v>

679
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:49.080
<v Speaker 2>You're crazy.</v>

680
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Don't wear Shin Pads.</v>

681
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:50.990
<v Speaker 2>How come you,</v>

682
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.190
<v Speaker 2>how come you don't wear Shin pads means you have to wear gloves.</v>

683
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.083
<v Speaker 2>That's stupid.</v>

684
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.620
<v Speaker 2>And why it impedes grappling.</v>

685
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Keeps you from getting chokes.</v>

686
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Do you want no gloves boxing to know if they want to do that?</v>

687
00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:04.080
<v Speaker 2>That's their nonsense.</v>

688
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.380
<v Speaker 2>So if it's combat,</v>

689
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:06.703
<v Speaker 2>combat,</v>

690
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 2>silly,</v>

691
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.310
<v Speaker 2>there's no kicks</v>

692
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:10.663
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

693
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

694
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you,</v>

695
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you smoked before this,</v>

696
00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:16.560
<v Speaker 2>but you're crazy.</v>

697
00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good way to do it.</v>

698
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean box,</v>

699
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.720
<v Speaker 2>they're doing wonderful sport.</v>

700
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.220
<v Speaker 2>It's wonderful sport to watch it.</v>

701
00:18:23.221 --> 00:18:24.270
<v Speaker 2>But as far as like fighting,</v>

702
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.590
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good way to do it.</v>

703
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Like this is the only way to do it.</v>

704
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:27.960
<v Speaker 2>This is fighting.</v>

705
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.231
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

706
00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:29.730
<v Speaker 2>So if we represent real fighting,</v>

707
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:30.960
<v Speaker 2>and this is what this represents,</v>

708
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.180
<v Speaker 2>this represents what happened when guys are led to do everything,</v>

709
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.370
<v Speaker 2>when they'll have to do knees,</v>

710
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:34.981
<v Speaker 2>like that step,</v>

711
00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:35.980
<v Speaker 2>and he fell to just slander.</v>

712
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Take kick to the body.</v>

713
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Fellow just landed.</v>

714
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh see this is,</v>

715
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.510
<v Speaker 2>this is a real fight.</v>

716
00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:40.890
<v Speaker 2>This is what you do when you can do everything.</v>

717
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:41.723
<v Speaker 2>You do everything.</v>

718
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.170
<v Speaker 2>So I love boxing,</v>

719
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's rough.</v>

720
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.600
<v Speaker 2>It's only a sport.</v>

721
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:46.913
<v Speaker 2>This is fighting.</v>

722
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:47.850
<v Speaker 2>So if we've got,</v>

723
00:18:47.851 --> 00:18:48.930
<v Speaker 2>if this is real fighting,</v>

724
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.191
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

725
00:18:49.191 --> 00:18:50.370
<v Speaker 2>why are we wearing gloves?</v>

726
00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:50.931
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

727
00:18:50.931 --> 00:18:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Why do we have wrist tapes and all that nonsense on?</v>

728
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:54.960
<v Speaker 2>I got a question for you.</v>

729
00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:55.830
<v Speaker 2>If somebody doesn't get cut.</v>

730
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.131
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

731
00:18:56.131 --> 00:18:57.540
<v Speaker 2>it's so you don't break your hands as easy,</v>

732
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:58.031
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

733
00:18:58.031 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be doing things that break your hands.</v>

734
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we put knows protectors on it cause you want to head butt each other</v>

735
00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:02.994
<v Speaker 2>with our faces,</v>

736
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:03.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

737
00:19:03.631 --> 00:19:06.780
<v Speaker 2>oh my nose is getting broken too much every time I headbutts well don't head,</v>

738
00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:09.090
<v Speaker 2>but then you'd have to figure out what it actually does work.</v>

739
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Even artificial surface over your hands that protects your hands.</v>

740
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 2>As far as I'm curious.</v>

741
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.930
<v Speaker 2>As far as the Pearson a pure fight,</v>

742
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.980
<v Speaker 2>you're probably right as far as a sport and growing it and getting kids to get</v>

743
00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:20.640
<v Speaker 2>involved in,</v>

744
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.290
<v Speaker 2>you have to have some sort of structure.</v>

745
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.240
<v Speaker 2>I think one day they're going to figure it out.</v>

746
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.140
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have no gloves.</v>

747
00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:26.370
<v Speaker 2>We're going to look at this and then go to say,</v>

748
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:28.590
<v Speaker 2>this is silly and guys got hit with a lot more shots.</v>

749
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.080
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

750
00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:29.930
<v Speaker 2>we're going to see more,</v>

751
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.800
<v Speaker 2>more shit.</v>

752
00:19:30.801 --> 00:19:33.480
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna see probably bigger gloves you see from the head gear or some shit.</v>

753
00:19:33.481 --> 00:19:34.320
<v Speaker 2>All that would be worse there.</v>

754
00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:35.820
<v Speaker 2>The science says just like football,</v>

755
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:36.773
<v Speaker 2>but just like football,</v>

756
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.060
<v Speaker 2>but bigger gloves is actually no better,</v>

757
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.290
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>

758
00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:39.670
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

759
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:40.170
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>

760
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 2>And so to the science doesn't support it.</v>

761
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:42.970
<v Speaker 2>And even headgear,</v>

762
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.860
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking now,</v>

763
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:44.341
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

764
00:19:44.341 --> 00:19:45.810
<v Speaker 2>we just tagged them with a right hand.</v>

765
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:46.021
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

766
00:19:46.021 --> 00:19:46.854
<v Speaker 2>gear does nothing.</v>

767
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Headgear actually can can give you a larger fulcrum point apparently,</v>

768
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.590
<v Speaker 2>and he can spin your head around more.</v>

769
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 2>You know what I like about the gloves is that they can fucking punk.</v>

770
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Full blast.</v>

771
00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:57.933
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

772
00:19:58.770 --> 00:19:59.980
<v Speaker 2>And you don't cut your headline,</v>

773
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.800
<v Speaker 2>but how come he can't take from here?</v>

774
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Shannon's like you could just hit them harder.</v>

775
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.440
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you tape up your insteps and you shins like they doing Muay Thai</v>

776
00:20:07.441 --> 00:20:08.010
<v Speaker 2>fights?</v>

777
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:08.640
<v Speaker 2>They should,</v>

778
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.320
<v Speaker 2>but then it's up.</v>

779
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:10.501
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

780
00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:12.540
<v Speaker 2>granted you can say the gloves or hindrance grappling,</v>

781
00:20:12.541 --> 00:20:15.810
<v Speaker 2>but if you have shin pads on you're going to move as well.</v>

782
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

783
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.660
<v Speaker 2>you ever see like some of those really good guys who do their Shin and ankle</v>

784
00:20:19.661 --> 00:20:19.861
<v Speaker 2>ankles?</v>

785
00:20:19.861 --> 00:20:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Like I was in Maurice's corner once,</v>

786
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Maury Smith when he had a kickboxing fight and uh,</v>

787
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:25.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

788
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.570
<v Speaker 2>he's taping his ankles up and shit.</v>

789
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.990
<v Speaker 2>You know when those guys do that mean they make that thing like almost like a</v>

790
00:20:30.991 --> 00:20:31.824
<v Speaker 2>cast,</v>

791
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:32.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

792
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.480
<v Speaker 2>it's all protected in their,</v>

793
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:34.560
<v Speaker 2>they layered in there.</v>

794
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Some dude's more than others.</v>

795
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean some guys don't wear shit.</v>

796
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.460
<v Speaker 2>You see a lot,</v>

797
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.700
<v Speaker 2>even the top guys in glory and lion fight and those kinds of things,</v>

798
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:42.810
<v Speaker 2>they don't wear shit.</v>

799
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm psyched that bell towards going to have that kickboxing organization.</v>

800
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.360

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:50.810
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome man.</v>

803
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.730

808
00:21:04.301 --> 00:21:04.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And fucked and decisions a bunch.</v>

811
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.991
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

812

814
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.290
<v Speaker 1>hard being the crazy clothes.</v>

815
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.620
<v Speaker 1>But when people get upset,</v>

816
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.460

817

<v Speaker 1>that's just reality.</v>

818
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.000
<v Speaker 1>That's where you stand and you got to get better.</v>

819
00:21:19.001 --> 00:21:19.751
<v Speaker 1>Like he looks right here.</v>

820
00:21:19.751 --> 00:21:20.620
<v Speaker 1>It looks better right here.</v>

821
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

822
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.020
<v Speaker 1>And why don't you say [inaudible] go for a finish.</v>

823
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:23.831
<v Speaker 1>No Man.</v>

824
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 1>He just needs to keep training and fighting and being Paul Felder,</v>

825
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.700
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get better.</v>

826
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.031
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

827
00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:28.750
<v Speaker 1>look at that knee,</v>

828
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:29.021
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

829
00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:30.280
<v Speaker 1>He's already getting better.</v>

830
00:21:30.281 --> 00:21:30.461
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

831
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:31.240
<v Speaker 1>look at this fight.</v>

832
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.490
<v Speaker 1>He's performing spectacularly in this fight.</v>

833
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:34.630
<v Speaker 1>He's smooth.</v>

834
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.960
<v Speaker 1>His timing looks excellent and he's fighting a fucking animal.</v>

835
00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:39.220
<v Speaker 1>It's for an older guy too though.</v>

836
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Fighting an animal though.</v>

837
00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:42.120
<v Speaker 1>He's very good.</v>

838
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Bob Dale.</v>

839
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.660
<v Speaker 1>He's not.</v>

840
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.081
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

841
00:21:44.081 --> 00:21:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I guess it performances and slacked.</v>

842
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:46.870
<v Speaker 1>He might be older,</v>

843
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:48.760
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't look bad.</v>

844
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Berkman hasn't looked tired or weak in a fight.</v>

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.001

<v Speaker 1>It's a rule.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We made rules for you guys.</v>

861
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 1>One of them is we try not to chew into the microphone cause I don't know that</v>

862
00:22:15.221 --> 00:22:15.941
<v Speaker 1>it's so annoying.</v>

863
00:22:15.941 --> 00:22:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're at the gym and you have headphones on.</v>

864
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.823
<v Speaker 1>You're mcing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

866
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.650
<v Speaker 1>If you have headphones on,</v>

867
00:22:20.651 --> 00:22:24.460
<v Speaker 1>it's even more rude because it's like in someone's ear.</v>

868
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:26.703
<v Speaker 1>That's a nice wine.</v>

869
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.050
<v Speaker 1>So Bergman's cut.</v>

872
00:22:31.451 --> 00:22:34.540
<v Speaker 1>We were talking and I didn't get a chance to see what the fuck happened.</v>

873
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.400
<v Speaker 1>But he's got a pretty nasty cut.</v>

874
00:22:36.401 --> 00:22:38.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of blood I can't see.</v>

875
00:22:38.831 --> 00:22:40.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it's as nose man.</v>

876
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.090
<v Speaker 1>It might be as nose.</v>

877
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:43.883
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

878
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:45.750
<v Speaker 1>nice knee to the body filter beneath the,</v>

879
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:46.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

880
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 1>it looks like the forehead.</v>

881
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe more than one cut.</v>

882
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.070
<v Speaker 1>It looks like there's something coming out of the nose.</v>

883
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.720
<v Speaker 1>The bridge of his nose and his forehead.</v>

884
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Does this kind of blood make the sport more popular or less popular?</v>

885
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.970
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't have an effect on it.</v>

886
00:22:57.971 --> 00:22:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

887
00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that sponsors had an effect on it either.</v>

888
00:23:00.551 --> 00:23:01.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody looked at it and goes,</v>

889
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:05.500
<v Speaker 1>this shit is how come they don't all have the same clothes on.</v>

890
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Nobody looked at it and said it needed a uniform like that.</v>

891
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.840
<v Speaker 1>That's more of the UFC brass doing it for a corporate to try and be like</v>

892
00:23:13.841 --> 00:23:14.674
<v Speaker 1>everyone else,</v>

893
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.903
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't matter.</v>

894
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.661
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

895
00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I like bud and manner well in pro wrestling and just tuck down.</v>

896
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Fell,</v>

897
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.380
<v Speaker 1>got paid on blood,</v>

898
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.210
<v Speaker 1>fell on his back and the other round.</v>

899
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.640

<v Speaker 2>The fight too because they're replaying it.</v>

922
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Felder so durable.</v>

923
00:23:52.491 --> 00:23:55.730
<v Speaker 2>When Barboza was kicking him in the side and you could hear it,</v>

924
00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:57.500
<v Speaker 2>it's like having a gun shot and he just didn't,</v>

925
00:23:57.501 --> 00:23:58.880
<v Speaker 2>he never stopped.</v>

926
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.380
<v Speaker 2>He just wondered how somebody can take that kind of a beating in the Bible.</v>

927
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:01.941
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you something.</v>

928
00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:02.721
<v Speaker 2>He hit Barboza.</v>

929
00:24:02.721 --> 00:24:03.730
<v Speaker 2>What's some good shots too?</v>

930
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:04.731
<v Speaker 2>It felt,</v>

931
00:24:04.731 --> 00:24:07.340
<v Speaker 2>but Barboza is just so God damn fast,</v>

932
00:24:07.341 --> 00:24:07.970
<v Speaker 2>too quick fluff,</v>

933
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:12.050
<v Speaker 2>and that was just one of his first jaunt into the higher echelons of MMA.</v>

934
00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.550
<v Speaker 2>And what's going to happen is Felder,</v>

935
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.020
<v Speaker 2>as you see in this fight,</v>

936
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.710
<v Speaker 2>I think you looked as good in this fight is he's ever looked and he's going to</v>

937
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.710
<v Speaker 2>continue to get better.</v>

938
00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.540
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't even those other fights he did,</v>

939
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:22.040
<v Speaker 2>but I think he looks even better now.</v>

00:30:40.331 --> 00:30:40.481
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1158
00:30:40.481 --> 00:30:40.631
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1159
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:42.040
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't think about for health.</v>

1160
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:42.970
<v Speaker 1>I would think about it.</v>

1161
00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:44.003
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

1162
00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:49.060
<v Speaker 1>there's apparently very little evidence that with all of the steroid use that</v>

1163
00:30:49.061 --> 00:30:53.110
<v Speaker 1>people do all the crazy bodybuilders like not that many are dying.</v>

1164
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:54.340
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1165
00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.173
<v Speaker 1>There's</v>

1166
00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.440
<v Speaker 1>fester or watch.</v>

1167
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Wwe is dealing with painkillers,</v>

1168
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.410
<v Speaker 1>you know that and I know that pain killers and steroids,</v>

1169
00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.800
<v Speaker 1>steroid use shore but it's the painkillers that are killing everybody.</v>

1170
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:06.371
<v Speaker 1>My boy Chris,</v>

1171
00:31:06.371 --> 00:31:06.971
<v Speaker 1>Ben was like,</v>

1172
00:31:06.971 --> 00:31:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1173
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:08.230
<v Speaker 1>He was on some shit.</v>

1174
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:10.120
<v Speaker 1>That guy also had some serious CTE.</v>

1175
00:31:10.121 --> 00:31:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Probably good Jay and all those dudes are still blaming each other and hitting</v>

1176
00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:15.100
<v Speaker 1>each other with chairs and shit.</v>

1177
00:31:15.101 --> 00:31:17.410
<v Speaker 1>What about all the time bodybuilders like if they're still alive,</v>

1178
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:17.661
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

1179
00:31:17.661 --> 00:31:17.990
<v Speaker 1>aren't they?</v>

1180
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are still alive and there's some of them were really abusive.</v>

1181
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Like definitely there are endocrine system is shutdown.</v>

1182
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Definitely they have to take hormone replacement therapy but that's available.</v>

1183
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:28.503
<v Speaker 1>You can do that.</v>

1184
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.580
<v Speaker 1>What you look at them though and you're,</v>

1185
00:31:30.581 --> 00:31:35.581
<v Speaker 1>you're not looking at like a old boxers or old like you go to like Muhammad</v>

1186
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Ali's era,</v>

1187
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.590
<v Speaker 1>which is the same I guess maybe,</v>

1188
00:31:38.591 --> 00:31:38.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1189
00:31:38.861 --> 00:31:42.280
<v Speaker 1>he predated Swartz and by a little bit like 10 years or so,</v>

1190
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.473
<v Speaker 1>maybe more,</v>

1191
00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:43.960
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

1192
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.680
<v Speaker 1>more when he,</v>

1193
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.840
<v Speaker 1>when sourcing our first burst onto the scene.</v>

1194
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.011
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

1195
00:31:48.011 --> 00:31:50.620
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Sally and you look at,</v>

1196
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1197
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.690
<v Speaker 1>obviously he's in a bad,</v>

1198
00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:53.381
<v Speaker 1>bad place,</v>

1199
00:31:53.381 --> 00:31:53.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1200
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.340
<v Speaker 1>But you look at Joe Frazier before he died and you look at a lot of those older</v>

1201
00:31:57.341 --> 00:31:58.420
<v Speaker 1>boxes from that era,</v>

1202
00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:59.320
<v Speaker 1>they're fucked.</v>

1203
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:00.603
<v Speaker 1>They're fucked.</v>

1204
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.860
<v Speaker 1>But the older bodybuilders,</v>

1205
00:32:02.861 --> 00:32:04.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them that are still a restaurant.</v>

1206
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Arnold doing physics,</v>

1207
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:06.100
<v Speaker 1>he's fine.</v>

1208
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:06.931
<v Speaker 1>He's a chill in the,</v>

1209
00:32:06.931 --> 00:32:08.230
<v Speaker 1>had had a panel at its heart,</v>

1210
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.180
<v Speaker 1>heart surgery,</v>

1211
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.820
<v Speaker 1>but he's fine.</v>

1212
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.440
<v Speaker 1>And that was that valve issue.</v>

1213
00:32:11.441 --> 00:32:11.890
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1214
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.170
<v Speaker 1>they said that was something that he was hard.</v>

1215
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.970
<v Speaker 1>They said that was something that he was born with,</v>

1216
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1217
00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:17.950
<v Speaker 1>That it was a a condition.</v>

1218
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:18.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1219
00:32:18.641 --> 00:32:18.851
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1220
00:32:18.851 --> 00:32:22.630
<v Speaker 1>if there's no evidence that steroids into special is terrible for you is like we</v>

1221
00:32:22.631 --> 00:32:22.901
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

1222
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:23.081
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1223
00:32:23.081 --> 00:32:25.420
<v Speaker 1>Because it started with is Zeto remember that he was like,</v>

1224
00:32:25.421 --> 00:32:26.440
<v Speaker 1>oh I have this cancer,</v>

1225
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.330
<v Speaker 1>this brain tumor cause I took steroids.</v>

1226
00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.870
<v Speaker 1>But there's the scientific research to back problem is some people just get</v>

1227
00:32:31.871 --> 00:32:32.651
<v Speaker 1>brain tumors.</v>

1228
00:32:32.651 --> 00:32:35.830
<v Speaker 1>So you got to wonder like how come everybody's not getting a brain tumor?</v>

1229
00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1230
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Are we sure that the brain tumors from that?</v>

1231
00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Like it's theirs.</v>

1232
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:39.913
<v Speaker 1>There's very</v>

1233
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.120
<v Speaker 2>individual cases apparently it's really hard to tell what's the ultimate cause</v>

1234
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:48.170
<v Speaker 2>cause you're dealing with all sorts of environmental and also look at broad</v>

1235
00:32:48.171 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 2>trends like they were talking about cell phone use,</v>

1236
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:52.730
<v Speaker 2>cell phone use has gone up a great deal.</v>

1237
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:55.940
<v Speaker 2>But since 1992 from the last statistic I just read,</v>

1238
00:32:55.941 --> 00:32:56.780
<v Speaker 2>which was yesterday,</v>

1239
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:58.550
<v Speaker 2>the Gliomas,</v>

1240
00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.413
<v Speaker 2>brain tumors,</v>

1241
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 2>the really dangerous one kind have not,</v>

1242
00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:06.150
<v Speaker 2>they've stayed pretty steady since 1992 so you'd think with all that solution.</v>

1243
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:07.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1244
00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1245
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1246
00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.540
<v Speaker 2>that is interesting Brian.</v>

1247
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:12.680
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

1248
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1249
00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:17.320
<v Speaker 2>So you would see a huge market rise over the last 20 years,</v>

1250
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:18.470
<v Speaker 2>the massive course,</v>

1251
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.550
<v Speaker 2>but you just haven't,</v>

1252
00:33:19.551 --> 00:33:21.000
<v Speaker 2>but the 26 years you haven't,</v>

1253
00:33:21.001 --> 00:33:21.920
<v Speaker 2>it stayed very steady.</v>

1254
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it takes like,</v>

1255
00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's like cigarettes for awhile they said cigarettes don't cause lung</v>

1256
00:33:26.991 --> 00:33:27.490
<v Speaker 2>cancer.</v>

1257
00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1258
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:29.030
<v Speaker 2>50 years to figure it out,</v>

1259
00:33:29.031 --> 00:33:30.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's not ionizing radiation.</v>

1260
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.300
<v Speaker 2>It's radio frequency.</v>

1261
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:37.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not ionizing ionizing like which would be x rays and gamma rays,</v>

1262
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:38.721
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff.</v>

1263
00:33:38.721 --> 00:33:39.531
<v Speaker 2>That's ionizing,</v>

1264
00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:42.800
<v Speaker 2>so what that does actually is it changes.</v>

1265
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:43.611
<v Speaker 2>It knocks Adams,</v>

1266
00:33:43.611 --> 00:33:46.280
<v Speaker 2>I guess off the DNA or if screws with your DNA,</v>

1267
00:33:46.281 --> 00:33:49.280
<v Speaker 2>which can then lead to cancer itself,</v>

1268
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.490
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean that it necessarily will,</v>

1269
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.990
<v Speaker 2>but what happens is like if one guy dies of whatever cancer,</v>

1270
00:33:56.991 --> 00:33:58.730
<v Speaker 2>he's took steroids and he accused that,</v>

1271
00:33:58.760 --> 00:33:59.271
<v Speaker 2>then we liked,</v>

1272
00:33:59.271 --> 00:33:59.391
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1273
00:33:59.391 --> 00:34:00.320
<v Speaker 2>that's what steroids do.</v>

1274
00:34:00.321 --> 00:34:01.580
<v Speaker 2>If there's one example,</v>

1275
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:02.301
<v Speaker 2>the media,</v>

1276
00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:02.900
<v Speaker 2>Russia's,</v>

1277
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:03.920
<v Speaker 2>here's an important point.</v>

1278
00:34:03.921 --> 00:34:08.921
<v Speaker 2>Crispin Rob was just a bad dude with some CTE and for a lot of things wrong,</v>

1279
00:34:09.021 --> 00:34:09.980
<v Speaker 2>he was on drugs,</v>

1280
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.460
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of painkillers.</v>

1281
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Who's on steroids to steer those things?</v>

1282
00:34:13.221 --> 00:34:13.641
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1283
00:34:13.641 --> 00:34:14.840
<v Speaker 2>when you're taking painkillers,</v>

1284
00:34:14.841 --> 00:34:15.680
<v Speaker 2>certain painkillers,</v>

1285
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:19.930
<v Speaker 2>they react really badly to other drugs and of course alcohol.</v>

1286
00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:21.170
<v Speaker 2>If alcohol is involved,</v>

1287
00:34:21.171 --> 00:34:22.004
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was,</v>

1288
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.690
<v Speaker 2>but then they react even worse.</v>

1289
00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.480
<v Speaker 2>It could've been just a shitty person too.</v>

1290
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:28.940
<v Speaker 2>You don't like maybe he's a bad dude and they got all high and did some fucked</v>

1291
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:30.330
<v Speaker 2>up stuff and he could've,</v>

1292
00:34:30.331 --> 00:34:30.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1293
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:31.431
<v Speaker 2>gone crazy.</v>

1294
00:34:31.431 --> 00:34:32.264
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck knows?</v>

1295
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.610
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1296
00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:35.900
<v Speaker 2>the Lyles adal an important point is that lie allows,</v>

1297
00:34:35.901 --> 00:34:40.520
<v Speaker 2>ido was taking human growth hormone hormone and a time where they were getting</v>

1298
00:34:40.521 --> 00:34:41.750
<v Speaker 2>it from cadavers,</v>

1299
00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:42.851
<v Speaker 2>they would get there.</v>

1300
00:34:42.851 --> 00:34:46.190
<v Speaker 2>We're getting human growth hormone in a different way than they gather it.</v>

1301
00:34:46.191 --> 00:34:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

1302
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:51.110
<v Speaker 2>The way they gather it now as they produce it with bacteria that they use yams</v>

1303
00:34:51.111 --> 00:34:51.620
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

1304
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.250
<v Speaker 2>That's for testosterone can,</v>

1305
00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.060
<v Speaker 2>it's also for estrogen.</v>

1306
00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:56.570
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1307
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.640
<v Speaker 2>there's steroid,</v>

1308
00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1309
00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:59.780
<v Speaker 2>fucking soaked yams,</v>

1310
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:00.980
<v Speaker 2>it sounds so crazy,</v>

1311
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:05.690
<v Speaker 2>but they get testosterone and they can get a female birth control out of why</v>

1312
00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Mexican wild yams</v>

1313
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:09.800
<v Speaker 2>yams are super good.</v>

1314
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.473
<v Speaker 2>Super good.</v>

1315
00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:18.140
<v Speaker 2>So like everybody that is on testosterone replacement therapy is getting it from</v>

1316
00:35:18.891 --> 00:35:19.724
<v Speaker 2>yams.</v>

1317
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1318
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem with it now according to what Novitsky is that they're,</v>

1319
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.320
<v Speaker 2>they seem to have figured out a way to get it from animals.</v>

1320
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:31.460
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to get testosterone from animals and it will be because the Carl</v>

1321
00:35:31.461 --> 00:35:32.171
<v Speaker 2>identical.</v>

1322
00:35:32.171 --> 00:35:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1323
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Cause the carbon and they figure it out cause there's a,</v>

1324
00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.620
<v Speaker 2>it has a different carbon ratio or something.</v>

1325
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Carbon Isotope ratio keys on it.</v>

1326
00:35:39.241 --> 00:35:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he still figured that shit.</v>

1327
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.570
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking altimeter when it comes to that shit.</v>

1328
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.423
<v Speaker 2>Snitch.</v>

1329
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Golden snatch,</v>

1330
00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.490
<v Speaker 2>the whole golden showers.</v>

1331
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:48.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1332
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.260
<v Speaker 2>ultimately we are finding out what really does and does not,</v>

1333
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:56.070
<v Speaker 2>what's really real legit and we didn't know as well works.</v>

1407
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.620
<v Speaker 2>They don't go that far,</v>

1408
00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's like legit.</v>

1409
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's paying attention by fake marijuana.</v>

<v Speaker 4>What do they do?</v>

1426
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.270
<v Speaker 4>They would distribute it and like the people that would,</v>

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:14.980
<v Speaker 4>They would get hit up by the FDA or wherever it was against it,</v>

1431
00:38:14.981 --> 00:38:15.531
<v Speaker 4>the DEA,</v>

1432
00:38:15.531 --> 00:38:18.200
<v Speaker 4>and they would tell him what specific chemicals were illegal.</v>

1433
00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:22.100
<v Speaker 4>They would then go back to the lab is to take that specific molecule out.</v>

1434
00:38:22.101 --> 00:38:23.750
<v Speaker 4>Change the number like from CLL.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Larkin and underdog.</v>

1595
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:17.893
<v Speaker 1>A little surprised.</v>

1596
00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Well Larkin had that fight with tune off.</v>

1597
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:20.540
<v Speaker 1>It could have gone either way.</v>

1598
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:20.991
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1599
00:42:20.991 --> 00:42:22.420
<v Speaker 1>that was super close.</v>

1600
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:26.210
<v Speaker 1>Fight Larkin is a slick stand up fighter.</v>

1601
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:26.931
<v Speaker 1>Real slick,</v>

1602
00:42:26.931 --> 00:42:30.140
<v Speaker 1>but so is mosfet all remember Mossville dolls like kind of the first Kimbo</v>

1603
00:42:30.141 --> 00:42:30.711
<v Speaker 1>slice.</v>

1604
00:42:30.711 --> 00:42:33.590
<v Speaker 1>He was a backyard fighter in Miami.</v>

1605
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:34.453
<v Speaker 1>Well he was,</v>

1606
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:34.761
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1607
00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:36.410
<v Speaker 1>He was in the same group as Kimbo.</v>

1608
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1609
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1610
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1611
00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was in some of those early videos.</v>

1612
00:42:38.771 --> 00:42:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1613
00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.380
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1614
00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.460
<v Speaker 1>super game.</v>

1615
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenal Ref.</v>

1616
00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.560
<v Speaker 1>He's good at everything.</v>

1617
00:42:42.561 --> 00:42:42.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1618
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:43.450
<v Speaker 1>he's good at everything.</v>

1619
00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:44.390
<v Speaker 1>He's a very smart guy.</v>

1620
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:45.741
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

1621
00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:46.574
<v Speaker 1>very sneaky.</v>

1622
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:47.511
<v Speaker 1>Remember when he fought,</v>

1623
00:42:47.511 --> 00:42:49.770
<v Speaker 1>he fought eve Edwards and I think it was Bo dog.</v>

1624
00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:50.613
<v Speaker 1>He had kicked him.</v>

1625
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:51.321
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1626
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:52.071
<v Speaker 1>if he's on,</v>

1627
00:42:52.071 --> 00:42:52.904
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

1628
00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how guys beat the,</v>

1629
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.980
<v Speaker 1>that was what you did that everything is back when ease was considered to be one</v>

1630
00:42:57.981 --> 00:42:59.030
<v Speaker 1>of the best in the world.</v>

1631
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thought ease was,</v>

1632
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean is after ease.</v>

1633
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:05.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it was after he had beat and Josh Thompson so talented for a long time.</v>

1634
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:06.643
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah man.</v>

1635
00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:06.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1636
00:43:06.801 --> 00:43:07.634
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1637
00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:09.530
<v Speaker 1>father time catches up to everybody.</v>

1638
00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:10.821
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

1639
00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:14.420
<v Speaker 1>just people that can do things that your body just can't do anymore after.</v>

1640
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Not just father time,</v>

1641
00:43:16.011 --> 00:43:17.840
<v Speaker 1>but I think more importantly,</v>

1642
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:18.973
<v Speaker 1>beatings.</v>

1643
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1644
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1645
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:20.871
<v Speaker 1>I can't take the beans.</v>

1646
00:43:20.871 --> 00:43:22.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more the reaction.</v>

1647
00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Like last,</v>

1648
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.930
<v Speaker 1>like last night I was working at Shane Mosley fight and asked him afterwards,</v>

1649
00:43:26.931 --> 00:43:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1650
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1651
00:43:27.621 --> 00:43:28.401
<v Speaker 1>he fought a young guy,</v>

1652
00:43:28.401 --> 00:43:29.234
<v Speaker 1>he's 25.</v>

1653
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:29.721
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1654
00:43:29.721 --> 00:43:30.411
<v Speaker 1>what was the difference?</v>

1655
00:43:30.411 --> 00:43:30.621
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1656
00:43:30.621 --> 00:43:32.210
<v Speaker 1>my reaction times just not there.</v>

1657
00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:33.290
<v Speaker 1>He's way younger,</v>

1658
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:34.630
<v Speaker 1>faster like I have to do.</v>

1659
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1660
00:43:35.211 --> 00:43:35.991
<v Speaker 1>He lost his decision.</v>

1661
00:43:35.991 --> 00:43:36.171
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1662
00:43:36.171 --> 00:43:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to throw something.</v>

1663
00:43:37.101 --> 00:43:38.030
<v Speaker 1>It's just not there anymore.</v>

1664
00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:40.730
<v Speaker 1>He was like this the first time I've noticed it to go.</v>

1665
00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.910
<v Speaker 1>And how long has it been since his last fight?</v>

1666
00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1667
00:43:45.651 --> 00:43:46.880
<v Speaker 1>he felt like six months ago.</v>

1668
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:47.743
<v Speaker 1>Seven months ago.</v>

1669
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:48.290
<v Speaker 1>But he fought,</v>

1670
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1671
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:49.670
<v Speaker 1>not the same caliber guys.</v>

1672
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:50.830
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't fighting getting guys.</v>

1673
00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:50.991
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1674
00:43:50.991 --> 00:43:51.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like an older guys.</v>

1675
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:57.130
<v Speaker 1>And I fought a young hungry line and Shane was always so quick and he was young.</v>

1676
00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.190
<v Speaker 1>So quick man.</v>

1677
00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:03.220
<v Speaker 1>But you gotta think Shane's also been punishing his body through camps 44 yeah,</v>

1678
00:44:03.291 --> 00:44:05.780
<v Speaker 1>for all these years level for 20 years,</v>

1679
00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:06.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1680
00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.430
<v Speaker 1>for more than 20 units.</v>

1681
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:08.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1682
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:09.670
<v Speaker 1>he was a stellar,</v>

1683
00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.270
<v Speaker 1>a nice switch kick to the body.</v>

1684
00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 1>He was a stellar,</v>

1685
00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.930
<v Speaker 1>a amateur fighter as well as the amateur fighters.</v>

1686
00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:21.060
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to think about all those years of boxing and all the damage that</v>

1687
00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:21.581
<v Speaker 1>does to you.</v>

1688
00:44:21.581 --> 00:44:23.990
<v Speaker 1>After awhile your body just does not want to perform anymore.</v>

1689
00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.850
<v Speaker 1>He still almost beat that young cat,</v>

1690
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Larkin fight out of,</v>

1691
00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:28.910
<v Speaker 1>what's it?</v>

1692
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:29.691
<v Speaker 1>He's good man.</v>

1693
00:44:29.691 --> 00:44:31.100
<v Speaker 1>He's stands on any Jujitsu.</v>

1694
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm millennium MMA,</v>

1695
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.390
<v Speaker 1>but he is he a stand up fighter first and grappler second?</v>

1696
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:35.760
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

1697
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:36.151
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1698
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:36.600
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1699
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:36.991
<v Speaker 1>well he's,</v>

1700
00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:38.550
<v Speaker 1>he's got skills in the ground for sure.</v>

1701
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1702
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:39.961
<v Speaker 1>on his feet.</v>

1703
00:44:39.961 --> 00:44:40.840
<v Speaker 1>He's super sweet.</v>

1704
00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.740
<v Speaker 1>He looks for his take down a fence is amazing.</v>

1705
00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:46.530
<v Speaker 1>He came to rain one time and just wrestling.</v>

1706
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:46.951
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1707
00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:47.340
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>

1708
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.300
<v Speaker 1>people couldn't get them down.</v>

1709
00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Tell him he owes Cummings myself.</v>

1710
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1711
00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:51.030
<v Speaker 1>He's a monster.</v>

1712
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.600
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1713
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:51.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1714
00:44:51.751 --> 00:44:53.410
<v Speaker 1>he fought it and high level class,</v>

1715
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.510
<v Speaker 1>he beat Robbie Lawler and Strikeforce at one 85 people forget about that.</v>

1716
00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.200
<v Speaker 1>The Larkin is legit and at this weight class now?</v>

1717
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:01.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1718
00:45:01.511 --> 00:45:03.600
<v Speaker 1>at one 70 he's really,</v>

1719
00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:04.434
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

1720
00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:07.770
<v Speaker 1>But it just shows you how deep the pool is because Tumen off beat him.</v>

1721
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.431
<v Speaker 1>Although I,</v>

1722
00:45:08.431 --> 00:45:09.240
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1723
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.073
<v Speaker 1>it could've gone either way.</v>

1724
00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:10.440
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1725
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:15.440
<v Speaker 1>he throws this really creepy fucking spinning heel kick to the legs,</v>

1726
00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.710
<v Speaker 1>a lot nasty.</v>

1727
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.920
<v Speaker 1>He's really good at it and he does it on the inside and the outside.</v>

1728
00:45:19.921 --> 00:45:22.320
<v Speaker 1>But he did it on the outside a couple of times against [inaudible] and I was</v>

1729
00:45:22.321 --> 00:45:22.501
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1730
00:45:22.501 --> 00:45:23.334
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1731
00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:24.151
<v Speaker 1>I want to see him.</v>

1732
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:26.190
<v Speaker 1>That Jude last fight,</v>

1733
00:45:26.191 --> 00:45:26.491
<v Speaker 1>he fought.</v>

1734
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:27.151
<v Speaker 1>He was in the guy in the,</v>

1735
00:45:27.151 --> 00:45:27.881
<v Speaker 1>and the calf.</v>

1736
00:45:27.881 --> 00:45:29.280
<v Speaker 1>It was just crazy.</v>

1737
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking about like,</v>

1738
00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:31.860
<v Speaker 1>these guys are so talented.</v>

1739
00:45:31.861 --> 00:45:31.981
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1740
00:45:31.981 --> 00:45:32.761
<v Speaker 1>And you look at welterweight,</v>

1741
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:33.420
<v Speaker 1>you look at middleweight,</v>

1742
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.201
<v Speaker 1>it's like Bisbee.</v>

1743
00:45:34.201 --> 00:45:36.090
<v Speaker 1>It took him 10 years to get a title shot.</v>

1744
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.953
<v Speaker 1>10 fucking,</v>

1745
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.190
<v Speaker 1>that's how tough it is,</v>

1746
00:45:38.191 --> 00:45:38.400
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1747
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:38.911
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1748
00:45:38.911 --> 00:45:43.500
<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile if you all were marrow didn't get popped and if was ray didn't get</v>

1749
00:45:43.501 --> 00:45:43.950
<v Speaker 1>hurt,</v>

1750
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:45.300
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't have even gotten that call.</v>

1751
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Never got a title shot.</v>

1752
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:47.210
<v Speaker 1>It's your son.</v>

1753
00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:47.401
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

1754
00:45:47.401 --> 00:45:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

1755
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:48.780
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily true.</v>

1756
00:45:48.781 --> 00:45:51.060
<v Speaker 1>He could have beaten one more guy and got a title shot,</v>

1757
00:45:51.061 --> 00:45:52.170
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't really in line.</v>

1758
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:53.370
<v Speaker 1>He's in a tough spot,</v>

1759
00:45:53.371 --> 00:45:54.041
<v Speaker 1>man with it,</v>

1760
00:45:54.041 --> 00:45:54.420
<v Speaker 1>with with,</v>

1761
00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.051
<v Speaker 1>with this career.</v>

1762
00:45:55.051 --> 00:45:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Physically his eye.</v>

1763
00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.950
<v Speaker 1>He's tough with Joel.</v>

1764
00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Go to Jackson's.</v>

1765
00:45:58.801 --> 00:45:59.634
<v Speaker 1>Is he training there?</v>

1766
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said,</v>

1767
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1768
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I had heard something like that too.</v>

1769
00:46:02.491 --> 00:46:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're going to do with him.</v>

1770
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:04.840
<v Speaker 1>He was another one.</v>

1771
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:09.180
<v Speaker 1>He is another one that he had a supplement that he took an off the counter</v>

1772
00:46:09.181 --> 00:46:11.490
<v Speaker 1>supplement over the counter supplement that was tainted.</v>

1773
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1774
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of them that are changing shit.</v>

1775
00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1776
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:15.443
<v Speaker 1>but it works.</v>

1777
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:17.603
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

1778
00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.500
<v Speaker 1>There's other reasons why this stuff has shifted.</v>

1779
00:46:19.501 --> 00:46:19.780
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

1780
00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.010
<v Speaker 1>there's reason you can't take it.</v>

1781
00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

1782
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:23.460
<v Speaker 1>your friend tells me it works and you're going to work.</v>

1783
00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:24.620
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>

1784
00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:25.620
<v Speaker 1>you're going to next wines.</v>

1785
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1786
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:28.710
<v Speaker 1>but he just makes it,</v>

1787
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I was glad to see him get a title shot,</v>

1788
00:46:31.051 --> 00:46:31.651
<v Speaker 1>but it sucks.</v>

1789
00:46:31.651 --> 00:46:32.161
<v Speaker 1>It's that way.</v>

1790
00:46:32.161 --> 00:46:34.410
<v Speaker 1>But now I think of it's probably the only way it was going to happen.</v>

1791
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:34.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1792
00:46:34.801 --> 00:46:35.634
<v Speaker 1>most likely.</v>

1793
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Mosbey dog just slandered.</v>

1794
00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Good right hand.</v>

1795
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Well you mean it could have happened.</v>

1796
00:46:38.941 --> 00:46:39.481
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't look.</v>

1797
00:46:39.481 --> 00:46:40.470
<v Speaker 1>He just beat Anderson.</v>

1798
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:42.150
<v Speaker 1>You know they're both older though.</v>

1799
00:46:42.151 --> 00:46:44.720
<v Speaker 1>July Keon some joc gray Hillel,</v>

1800
00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Weidman,</v>

1801
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:45.940
<v Speaker 1>the eye,</v>

1802
00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.430
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be tough night for him.</v>

1803
00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:48.633
<v Speaker 1>Could be,</v>

1804
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:49.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1805
00:46:49.501 --> 00:46:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean the odds are it won't be in my favor.</v>

1806
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.590
<v Speaker 1>The odds would be in that favorite,</v>

1807
00:46:54.591 --> 00:46:56.430
<v Speaker 1>but not 100%.</v>

1808
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:57.480
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1809
00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a thing about guys that are tough,</v>

1810
00:46:59.281 --> 00:47:02.450
<v Speaker 1>like Bisping as they figure out a way to get shit done.</v>

1811
00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:06.150
<v Speaker 1>So he just poked his shit out of his eyes and it looks all my God,</v>

1812
00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Ahh,</v>

1813
00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:10.410
<v Speaker 1>muscle can't fight after coming back from that.</v>

1814
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:11.641
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1815
00:47:11.641 --> 00:47:12.870
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate Ipos.</v>

1816
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:13.800
<v Speaker 1>He knew right away too.</v>

1817
00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:14.131
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1818
00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:15.350
<v Speaker 1>fuck nothing.</v>

1819
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:17.850
<v Speaker 1>His finger probably went into his brain.</v>

1820
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:18.301
<v Speaker 1>Hey Joe.</v>

00:47:58.310 --> 00:47:59.490
<v Speaker 1>do you think about when you get poked in the eye,</v>

1845
00:47:59.491 --> 00:48:01.040
<v Speaker 1>how long it takes before you're ready?</v>

1846
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.000

1854
00:48:12.861 --> 00:48:14.780

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:23.530
<v Speaker 1>You go through history of birding happen.</v>

1871
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:40.003
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

1872
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:41.030
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

1873
00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:42.591
<v Speaker 1>Remember when Chris does?</v>

1874
00:48:42.591 --> 00:48:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Sure it got kicked in the nuts by Gonzaga and they're like,</v>

1875
00:48:44.961 --> 00:48:45.501
<v Speaker 1>you good bro.</v>

1876
00:48:45.501 --> 00:48:46.430
<v Speaker 1>He got kicked so hard.</v>

1877
00:48:46.431 --> 00:48:46.880
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1878
00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:47.181
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1879
00:48:47.181 --> 00:48:47.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

1880
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it looks like shit.</v>

1881
00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.010
<v Speaker 1>He's a Douche.</v>

1882
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.200
<v Speaker 1>I had kick game over.</v>

1883
00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Not that I wouldn't happen anyways.</v>

1884
00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:53.900
<v Speaker 1>That was the worst I've ever seen.</v>

1885
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1886
00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:55.640
<v Speaker 1>it can be bad.</v>

1887
00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:56.840
<v Speaker 1>It certainly can be bad.</v>

1888
00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Is part of Congo's gables a tricky now cause you got a cup.</v>

1889
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:03.950
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes like when these guys are going at it,</v>

1890
00:49:03.951 --> 00:49:04.190
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1891
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Gilbert ival and Bandera Lake fought in pride and,</v>

1892
00:49:07.431 --> 00:49:07.900
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1893
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.140
<v Speaker 1>and vandalize kick Gilbert and the balls.</v>

1894
00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.290
<v Speaker 1>His cousin matter what his cop,</v>

1895
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:17.070
<v Speaker 1>his cup was caught like right on his balls and it like that.</v>

1896
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:17.913
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at your balls.</v>

1897
00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:19.850
<v Speaker 1>It was a different kind of pain,</v>

1898
00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:23.480
<v Speaker 1>still pain that he could not recover from.</v>

1899
00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:24.920
<v Speaker 1>It was a different game.</v>

1900
00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:29.830
<v Speaker 1>But I want to see a statistic on what happens to guys when it's a close fight</v>

1901
00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.090
<v Speaker 1>like mitre on and Travis Brown and then it gets,</v>

1902
00:49:32.091 --> 00:49:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I poked and then from then on it's a blowout and there's a lot of fights like</v>

1903
00:49:35.721 --> 00:49:36.650
<v Speaker 1>that where a guy gets,</v>

1904
00:49:36.651 --> 00:49:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I poked and like it looked towards the end,</v>

1905
00:49:38.871 --> 00:49:40.070
<v Speaker 1>like mosfet all had recovered.</v>

1906
00:49:40.071 --> 00:49:42.920
<v Speaker 1>He looked like he was fighting really smooth and well it didn't look like,</v>

1907
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:46.940
<v Speaker 1>like Travis and Mitch reone is a perfect example of like metro was not the same</v>

1908
00:49:46.941 --> 00:49:47.300
<v Speaker 1>after that.</v>

1909
00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Hypo.</v>

1910
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.410
<v Speaker 1>You could tell he got Jack Dan poke twice.</v>

1911
00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes he did.</v>

1912
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:52.303
<v Speaker 1>And they did nothing.</v>

1913
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1914
00:49:52.821 --> 00:49:54.230
<v Speaker 1>it was not a good refereeing job.</v>

1915
00:49:54.231 --> 00:49:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe who did it.</v>

1916
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:57.560
<v Speaker 1>What do you do that way you don't want to call them out.</v>

1917
00:49:57.561 --> 00:49:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I just remember being upset with it.</v>

1918
00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Like when a guy gets his eye poked that bad.</v>

1919
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:02.031
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1920
00:50:02.031 --> 00:50:05.690
<v Speaker 1>like there's a real problem with making a guy go fight when you know he's</v>

1921
00:50:05.691 --> 00:50:06.411
<v Speaker 1>compromised.</v>

1922
00:50:06.411 --> 00:50:08.330
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why he's compromised as a foul,</v>

1923
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:10.040
<v Speaker 1>so everybody was watching,</v>

1924
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:11.450
<v Speaker 1>wants to fight to continue.</v>

1925
00:50:11.451 --> 00:50:12.770
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to be disappointed,</v>

1926
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:16.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like the fight is being stopped because of a legit technique.</v>

1927
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:18.410
<v Speaker 1>The fights being stopped because of a foul.</v>

1928
00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.273
<v Speaker 1>Well that's where,</v>

1929
00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:20.990
<v Speaker 1>or what would you do?</v>

1930
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I would stop the fight.</v>

1931
00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:22.763
<v Speaker 1>He's blinking,</v>

1932
00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:23.750
<v Speaker 1>blinking a lot.</v>

1933
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:24.890
<v Speaker 1>He won't stop blinking now.</v>

1934
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:26.103
<v Speaker 1>I would honestly,</v>

1935
00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I think a guy goes down</v>

1936
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:28.580
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1937
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:31.040
<v Speaker 2>There's almost a good argument to stop the fight.</v>

1938
00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 2>It definitely changes the dynamics.</v>

1939
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:34.910
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see those statistics too.</v>

1940
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:36.280
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you it's probably in the,</v>

1941
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:37.570
<v Speaker 2>the favor of the go pokes.</v>

1942
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:41.540
<v Speaker 2>The judges should be allowed to see the replay and go,</v>

1943
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:41.871
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1944
00:50:41.871 --> 00:50:43.010
<v Speaker 2>that shit was deliberate.</v>

1945
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:43.581
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

1946
00:50:43.581 --> 00:50:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Minus a point where it's not deliberate.</v>

1947
00:50:45.141 --> 00:50:46.340
<v Speaker 2>It most times not deliberate,</v>

1948
00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.140
<v Speaker 2>but if it is certain guys,</v>

1949
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:49.440
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to judge that though it,</v>

1950
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:50.323
<v Speaker 2>but what if it's cleaned?</v>

1951
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:50.780
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

1952
00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:51.441
<v Speaker 2>If it's delivered,</v>

1953
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:52.370
<v Speaker 2>who cares what they were thinking?</v>

1954
00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.780
<v Speaker 2>If it you fucking landed it,</v>

1955
00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:55.850
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get penalized 100% that's it.</v>

1956
00:50:55.851 --> 00:50:57.980
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make me the best way to stop it for sure.</v>

1957
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:58.970
<v Speaker 2>It's never going to stop.</v>

1958
00:50:58.971 --> 00:51:01.670
<v Speaker 2>But because it's an instinct and because a lot of guys trained Moy,</v>

1959
00:51:01.671 --> 00:51:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Tai and so they used to open handing people on the forehead and push him off and</v>

1960
00:51:06.291 --> 00:51:09.350
<v Speaker 2>then you go to do it with a regular gloves [inaudible] time.</v>

1961
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:09.801
<v Speaker 2>They do it.</v>

1962
00:51:09.801 --> 00:51:11.090
<v Speaker 2>If you don't get a point taken off,</v>

1963
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:12.590
<v Speaker 2>if like for the first shot,</v>

1964
00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:15.260
<v Speaker 2>then a guy knows he has one free shot at the balls.</v>

1965
00:51:15.261 --> 00:51:15.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1966
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Here's the words a while they don't have complete data,</v>

1967
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:20.870
<v Speaker 2>they did find 32 I pokes.</v>

1968
00:51:20.871 --> 00:51:25.460
<v Speaker 2>That led to a pause in the action from a sample of 1,333 fights and Ramey</v>

1969
00:51:25.461 --> 00:51:29.810
<v Speaker 2>estimated you're likely to see an eye poke in three to 4% of UFC fights taking</v>

1970
00:51:29.811 --> 00:51:30.620
<v Speaker 2>it at the high end,</v>

1971
00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:34.040
<v Speaker 2>you're likely to see an pope once every 25 fights are so conservatively.</v>

1972
00:51:34.041 --> 00:51:35.770
<v Speaker 2>96% of fights transpired,</v>

1973
00:51:35.771 --> 00:51:36.261
<v Speaker 2>devoid of,</v>

1974
00:51:36.261 --> 00:51:38.760
<v Speaker 2>I Prokes didn't say the,</v>

1975
00:51:38.761 --> 00:51:41.150
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't say the success rate success.</v>

1976
00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.800
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting now to hear that.</v>

1977
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1978
00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:43.940
<v Speaker 2>it has.</v>

1979
00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:45.290
<v Speaker 2>I figured behind that three,</v>

1980
00:51:45.291 --> 00:51:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean three,</v>

1981
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:46.341
<v Speaker 2>4%.</v>

1982
00:51:46.341 --> 00:51:46.611
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1983
00:51:46.611 --> 00:51:47.870
<v Speaker 2>how many John Jones fights?</v>

1984
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:50.270
<v Speaker 2>That's probably the three to 4%.</v>

1985
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1986
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:57.230
<v Speaker 2>there's some guys that just their style and he's so long to see that rumble.</v>

1987
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:58.190
<v Speaker 2>John's fight because,</v>

1988
00:51:58.610 --> 00:51:58.761
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1989
00:51:58.761 --> 00:52:01.100
<v Speaker 2>they're not blowing enough fighting Carmine's going to fight</v>

1990
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:04.633
<v Speaker 2>all</v>

1991
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:06.990
<v Speaker 2>over grumpy.</v>

1992
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm just crush can fight mosfet all it looks okay,</v>

1993
00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:10.161
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1994
00:52:10.161 --> 00:52:12.560
<v Speaker 2>only he knows whether or not he got really compromised from that.</v>

1995
00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:13.860
<v Speaker 2>Pokies definitely compromised.</v>

1996
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:14.820
<v Speaker 2>But you can still get a win,</v>

1997
00:52:14.821 --> 00:52:15.610
<v Speaker 2>but it's definitely,</v>

1998
00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:16.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the same.</v>

1999
00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:17.413
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2000
00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:18.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>

2001
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:21.040
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't mind if they stopped then came back</v>

2002
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.591
<v Speaker 2>to us.</v>

2003
00:52:24.591 --> 00:52:25.371
<v Speaker 2>It all looks good.</v>

2004
00:52:25.371 --> 00:52:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I'd be pissed if they stopped it.</v>

2005
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.160
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

2006
00:52:28.161 --> 00:52:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I'd be pissed that they stopped it in this fight.</v>

2007
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:31.430
<v Speaker 2>But I think in the mitre own fight,</v>

2008
00:52:31.431 --> 00:52:32.840
<v Speaker 2>there's a good argument for stopping it.</v>

2009
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.560
<v Speaker 2>That fight.</v>

2010
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.180
<v Speaker 2>He looked like way more fucked up.</v>

2011
00:52:35.181 --> 00:52:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Like when he went back.</v>

2012
00:52:36.051 --> 00:52:36.321
<v Speaker 2>He never,</v>

2013
00:52:36.321 --> 00:52:38.390
<v Speaker 2>why he's saying it terrible man.</v>

2014
00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:43.790
<v Speaker 2>They do ninth there's a good argument for stopping it is cause it's almost an</v>

2015
00:52:43.791 --> 00:52:44.890
<v Speaker 2>unfair to let it die.</v>

2016
00:52:44.891 --> 00:52:45.950
<v Speaker 2>He's qualified on,</v>

2017
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it does qualify to get poker.</v>

2018
00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:51.530
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking two to three times what the fuck you gotta do and it's still</v>

2019
00:52:51.531 --> 00:52:53.360
<v Speaker 2>an accident and even if it's an accident,</v>

2020
00:52:53.361 --> 00:52:54.194
<v Speaker 2>it's still,</v>

2021
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.131
<v Speaker 2>it's still,</v>

2022
00:52:55.131 --> 00:52:56.210
<v Speaker 2>it's still does damage,</v>

2023
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:57.900
<v Speaker 2>but then you have to kind of the rough,</v>

2024
00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I think it's up to the ref.</v>

2025
00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:01.310
<v Speaker 2>The ref's kind of assess exactly what kind of an,</v>

2026
00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:04.070
<v Speaker 2>I put too much pressure on the ref to give them that kind of power.</v>

2027
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Mosfet I a not.</v>

2028
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.940
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if he can get a Lorens to the ground.</v>

2029
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Lorenzo's fighting it off cause take down a fence.</v>

2030
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Neth di Lorenzo is so slick but so's Mazda Donald Man,</v>

2031
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm liking the,</v>

2032
00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:19.440
<v Speaker 2>he's fighting here real that right.</v>

2033
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:22.881
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>

2034
00:53:22.881 --> 00:53:23.181

2038
00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:28.380

<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like an animated series man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

2048
00:53:40.591 --> 00:53:41.700
<v Speaker 1>how long it took to me.</v>

2049
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.100
<v Speaker 1>It's funny cause the UFC made those little,</v>

2050
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:47.460
<v Speaker 1>they made a lot of hotels and they made me one of me and they,</v>

2051
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:51.300
<v Speaker 1>they'd given it to me whatever the company was and I was like laughing.</v>

2052
00:53:51.301 --> 00:53:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I was like that is so ridiculous.</v>

2053
00:53:52.591 --> 00:53:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't look anything like me.</v>

2054

2056
00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Just loving it was back when I was bald.</v>

2057

<v Speaker 1>I think I had hair back then but it was so bad.</v>

2058
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:07.070
<v Speaker 1>It looks like your torso and your arms just like me.</v>

2059
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:08.910
<v Speaker 1>The guy did a great job.</v>

2060
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:10.800
<v Speaker 1>You look a little older than that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2062
00:54:11.341 --> 00:54:12.180

2063
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:12.990
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say that's fine.</v>

2064
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:14.370
<v Speaker 1>You know we're all getting older.</v>

2065
00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:17.290

2073
00:54:26.581 --> 00:54:29.970
<v Speaker 1>but for us in our late forties compared to you guys,</v>

2074
00:54:29.971 --> 00:54:30.804

<v Speaker 1>Once you hit 40 you want those guys that had food.</v>

2078
00:54:37.381 --> 00:54:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Look at that too.</v>

2079
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:38.131
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2080
00:54:38.131 --> 00:54:38.460

<v Speaker 1>You guys are wiser though.</v>

2085
00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.920
<v Speaker 1>It's good to have friends to Larkin.</v>

2086
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Let's look in smooth hair,</v>

00:54:49.531 --> 00:54:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

2092
00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.200
<v Speaker 1>I love that switch.</v>

2093
00:54:51.201 --> 00:54:52.590
<v Speaker 1>How many he's to get caught here.</v>

2094
00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.270
<v Speaker 1>That upper cut and them.</v>

2095
00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:54.511
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2096
00:54:54.511 --> 00:54:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Mazda dolls.</v>

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Real,</v>

2098
00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:57.540
<v Speaker 1>real sneaky but so's Larkin.</v>

2099
00:54:57.541 --> 00:55:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Larkin's real sneaky with this arc and stuff to train for man.</v>

2100
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2101
00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:01.710
<v Speaker 1>so unconventional.</v>

2102
00:55:01.711 --> 00:55:02.730
<v Speaker 1>His angles are weird.</v>

2103
00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Is Weird.</v>

2104
00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:04.501
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

2105
00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:08.690
<v Speaker 1>he's got a little bit of like karate mixed in with a lot of boxing and more time</v>

2106
00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:08.921
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2107
00:55:08.921 --> 00:55:11.730
<v Speaker 1>oh look at some of his moves are like karate moves,</v>

2108
00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:13.140
<v Speaker 1>but Mazda dot might have tagged them.</v>

2109
00:55:13.141 --> 00:55:14.330
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at this La Rocco.</v>

2110
00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:16.183
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

2111
00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Who saw that coming when I'm around for sure.</v>

2112
00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Ooh y'all.</v>

2113
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:22.890
<v Speaker 1>All I was saying on those title shots.</v>

2114
00:55:22.891 --> 00:55:25.460
<v Speaker 1>What if you know how they say anyone in,</v>

2115
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:25.870
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2116
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:27.240
<v Speaker 1>in the top five needs stay in shape.</v>

2117
00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Just the case guy gets hurt.</v>

2118
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:32.700
<v Speaker 1>What if during the title shot the UFC tells a guy he's the reserve,</v>

2119
00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:33.301
<v Speaker 1>so find me,</v>

2120
00:55:33.301 --> 00:55:34.134
<v Speaker 1>gets hurt.</v>

2121
00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:35.413
<v Speaker 1>You're up brother.</v>

2122
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:38.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go a training camp but be ready because you're the first guy</v>

2123
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:39.390
<v Speaker 1>we go to.</v>

2124
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:44.390
<v Speaker 1>So we should have one around that like laid out like on the card,</v>

2125
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.870
<v Speaker 1>like the alternative.</v>

2126
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you tell people because why not say in DC Jones case,</v>

2127
00:55:49.681 --> 00:55:50.371
<v Speaker 1>let's say rumbles.</v>

2128
00:55:50.371 --> 00:55:52.160
<v Speaker 1>The alternate people want to see that fight.</v>

2129
00:55:52.161 --> 00:55:53.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like come on to hopefully get hurt.</v>

2130
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:54.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you tell anyone.</v>

2131
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:55.651
<v Speaker 1>You just surprise him,</v>

2132
00:55:55.651 --> 00:56:00.270
<v Speaker 1>but only up fight or nose and you start paying people I think was the most</v>

2133
00:56:00.271 --> 00:56:04.080
<v Speaker 1>dangerous fight in many ways because Jones does take hits to the face and he</v>

2134
00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:05.790
<v Speaker 1>can't do that with,</v>

2135
00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:06.840
<v Speaker 1>with a rumble.</v>

2136
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can do tomatoes.</v>

2137
00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:11.580
<v Speaker 1>The alternate either.</v>

2138
00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Either fighter might have someone pay someone off to make sure that</v>

2139
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.500
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>

2140
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.333
<v Speaker 1>you don't tell anyone.</v>

2141
00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:20.610
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to do that happen in big title fight.</v>

2142
00:56:20.611 --> 00:56:20.851
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2143
00:56:20.851 --> 00:56:21.061
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

2144
00:56:21.061 --> 00:56:21.831
<v Speaker 1>I want to fight that guy.</v>

2145
00:56:21.831 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fight.</v>

2146
00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Which you'd have to about is some unscrupulous promoter or Sonia for sure.</v>

2147
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Like you get about Tonya Harding.</v>

2148
00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I think if they told Bisbing hey bro,</v>

2149
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:30.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2150
00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:32.330
<v Speaker 1>you know Susan's out for awhile,</v>

2151
00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I'll see our boy.</v>

2159
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:43.590
<v Speaker 1>you're one of five guys were thinking about.</v>

2160
00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2161
00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:46.870
<v Speaker 1>but don't say one to five and they talk to you a fucking move.</v>

2162
00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:48.700
<v Speaker 1>No one knows the,</v>

2163
00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.530
<v Speaker 1>you realize you're at the end of your career.</v>

2164
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.550
<v Speaker 1>You've got to take that movie.</v>

2165
00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2167
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:53.171

2168
00:56:53.171 --> 00:56:55.750
<v Speaker 1>if the UFC had a plan in place,</v>

2169
00:56:55.751 --> 00:56:56.200
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2170
00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.790
<v Speaker 1>but then he would still have to take that movie.</v>

2171
00:56:58.330 --> 00:56:58.661
<v Speaker 1>Can you get,</v>

2178
00:57:09.581 --> 00:57:12.910
<v Speaker 1>if you had a backup in case you still have a fight.</v>

2182
00:57:18.191 --> 00:57:20.430
<v Speaker 1>He says he'll be back for that Madison Square Garden Card.</v>

2183
00:57:20.431 --> 00:57:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2184
00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:21.371
<v Speaker 1>he wants to be,</v>

2185
00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:23.770
<v Speaker 1>but he's gotta be real careful because you don't want to rush something like</v>

2186
00:57:23.771 --> 00:57:23.991

<v Speaker 1>He's bridging on his name.</v>

2241
00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:54.880
<v Speaker 1>He's in trouble now.</v>

2242
00:58:54.881 --> 00:58:56.400
<v Speaker 1>It's over the neck.</v>

2243
00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Hand defense.</v>

2244
00:58:58.840 --> 00:58:59.591
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of sweat.</v>

2245
00:58:59.591 --> 00:59:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful defense.</v>

2246
00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Mazda dollars.</v>

2247
00:59:01.751 --> 00:59:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Fucking relentless to Jesus Christ.</v>

2248
00:59:04.581 --> 00:59:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Larkins take down events.</v>

2249
00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:06.370
<v Speaker 1>These man.</v>

2250
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:06.481
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2251
00:59:06.481 --> 00:59:07.314
<v Speaker 1>come to fence.</v>

2252
00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:08.193
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>

2253
00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:11.080
<v Speaker 1>He just went up on his head.</v>

2254
00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:12.620
<v Speaker 1>His good team defense too.</v>

2255
00:59:12.621 --> 00:59:13.454
<v Speaker 1>It was insane.</v>

2256
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Especially at this when he's this tired.</v>

2257
00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:16.923
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2258
00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Third round of Mike Ross started wearing rash guards.</v>

2259
00:59:19.841 --> 00:59:20.920
<v Speaker 1>If they wanted to know,</v>

2260
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.681
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to wear that.</v>

2261
00:59:21.681 --> 00:59:22.700
<v Speaker 1>If you want to girls wearing,</v>

2262
00:59:22.701 --> 00:59:23.071
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

2263
00:59:23.071 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Why we keep the girls are titties out</v>

2264
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:27.763
<v Speaker 1>takes sweat.</v>

2265
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:29.210
<v Speaker 1>It takes sweat out of the game.</v>

2266
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Which I think would a show more technique,</v>

2267
00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:32.490
<v Speaker 1>especially grappling</v>

2268
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.983
<v Speaker 1>increase</v>

2269
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.180
<v Speaker 1>is that kind of</v>

2270
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:42.050
<v Speaker 1>matters accounts guy gets right back.</v>

2271
00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.520
<v Speaker 1>They should make rash guards mandatory.</v>

2272
00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.713
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2273
00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:46.683
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2274
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:47.570
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2275
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:47.830
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2276
00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:48.030
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2277
00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:49.160
<v Speaker 1>I should wear sunglasses.</v>

2278
00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:49.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2279
00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:50.570
<v Speaker 1>there's benefits to it.</v>

2280
00:59:50.571 --> 00:59:51.560
<v Speaker 1>And then there's negatives to it.</v>

2281
00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.650
<v Speaker 1>If you're a striker you want to keep Fabi rendering walked in.</v>

2282
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2283
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh he tagged him with an upper cut price.</v>

2284
00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:59.600
<v Speaker 1>This fight is amazing.</v>

2285
00:59:59.630 --> 01:00:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Crazy nuts.</v>

2286
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not mandatory.</v>

2287
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>But you got to,</v>

2288
01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:07.490
<v Speaker 1>we got to remember this is greasing illegal or illegal.</v>

2289
01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Illegal.</v>

2290
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>It's easy cause it's the Ford stuff.</v>

2291
01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2292
01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:12.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2293
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:12.321
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2294
01:00:12.321 --> 01:00:12.441
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2295
01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:12.591
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2296
01:00:12.591 --> 01:00:13.424
<v Speaker 1>But why though?</v>

2297
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's some substance and then what happens?</v>

2298
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:17.961
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

2299
01:00:17.961 --> 01:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Don't play games.</v>

2300
01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.830
<v Speaker 1>So benefits the benefits that guy that has it on him because he can't get the</v>

2301
01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:22.131
<v Speaker 1>tannins.</v>

2302
01:00:22.131 --> 01:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>A foreign substance.</v>

2303
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2304
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:24.021
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

2305
01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:25.130
<v Speaker 1>But it's nothing like sweat.</v>

2306
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>

2307
01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:27.770
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing like,</v>

2308
01:00:27.771 --> 01:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>it's very much like sweat.</v>

2309
01:00:28.971 --> 01:00:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Sweat is slippery and grieves me,</v>

2310
01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:31.250
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

2311
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:32.330
<v Speaker 1>What is very slippery?</v>

2312
01:00:32.331 --> 01:00:33.141
<v Speaker 1>It's very similar.</v>

2313
01:00:33.141 --> 01:00:33.411
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2314
01:00:33.411 --> 01:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>it's just shut down.</v>

2315
01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot more extreme.</v>

2316
01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:40.610
<v Speaker 1>That brain and that pattern just dealt double duty.</v>

2317
01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.090
<v Speaker 1>And he wasn't going to do though.</v>

2318
01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2319
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.113
<v Speaker 1>put a,</v>

2320
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking to your back for your aisle.</v>

2321
01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:49.600
<v Speaker 1>That's like the key argument when I was in everybody wear a g no,</v>

2322
01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:50.570
<v Speaker 1>it's just if,</v>

2323
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2324
01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>if going home is illegal because it makes it too slowly.</v>

2325
01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:55.220
<v Speaker 1>If Greece is illegal,</v>

2326
01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.390
<v Speaker 1>if it has nothing to do with the gate,</v>

2327
01:00:56.510 --> 01:01:00.080
<v Speaker 1>if greasing is illegal because then make shit too greasy and it's a foreign,</v>

2328
01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.450
<v Speaker 1>the problem is there's no tests for it.</v>

2329
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.901
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2330
01:01:02.901 --> 01:01:03.520
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2331
01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>rash guards,</v>

2332
01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:05.390
<v Speaker 1>foreign substance,</v>

2333
01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:09.050
<v Speaker 1>you can crash cart tests because there is no test.</v>

2334
01:01:09.051 --> 01:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>But tell me about the test,</v>

2335
01:01:09.891 --> 01:01:10.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2336
01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:10.481
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2337
01:01:10.481 --> 01:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>with the Vaseline or whatever.</v>

2338
01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>How do they test?</v>

2339
01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:13.791
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2340
01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:17.210
<v Speaker 1>you can tell you have a commission following you around from the locker room</v>

2341
01:01:17.211 --> 01:01:17.990
<v Speaker 1>till the cage,</v>

2342
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.823
<v Speaker 1>but there was no tea,</v>

2343
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:19.820
<v Speaker 1>there's no swab.</v>

2344
01:01:19.821 --> 01:01:20.511
<v Speaker 1>And then they put it in,</v>

2345
01:01:20.511 --> 01:01:21.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like testing in a cup.</v>

2346
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:25.400
<v Speaker 1>There's no official test that says that you went over the grief limit.</v>

2347
01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2348
01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>we can't,</v>

2349
01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:26.510
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

2350
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.841
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

2351
01:01:26.841 --> 01:01:29.690
<v Speaker 1>let me stop this right now because one thing you definitely could do,</v>

2352
01:01:29.691 --> 01:01:34.220
<v Speaker 1>100% that has been done is you take a mineral oil bath the night before.</v>

2353
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2354
01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:38.450
<v Speaker 1>take a mineral oil bath the night before she could get into that cage and you</v>

2355
01:01:38.451 --> 01:01:39.410
<v Speaker 1>don't have anything on.</v>

2356
01:01:39.411 --> 01:01:40.011
<v Speaker 1>You took a shower,</v>

2357
01:01:40.011 --> 01:01:40.671
<v Speaker 1>you don't have anything on.</v>

2358
01:01:40.671 --> 01:01:43.010
<v Speaker 1>You are so Lippert right</v>

2359
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:46.220
<v Speaker 1>the fucking time.</v>

2360
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing anybody can do about it.</v>

2361
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.171
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

2362
01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Anyone can do official tests,</v>

2363
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.380
<v Speaker 1>but there's no official task.</v>

2364
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:52.610
<v Speaker 1>But since girls are wearing,</v>

2365
01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>girls were rock stars all the time.</v>

2366
01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2367
01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>I need a rescue guy.</v>

2368
01:01:56.641 --> 01:01:56.991
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2369
01:01:56.991 --> 01:01:59.750
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think he was a huge issue where the Dana's going,</v>

2370
01:01:59.751 --> 01:02:01.450
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck everyone's slipping missions.</v>

2371
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:02.690
<v Speaker 1>We'll figure something out here.</v>

2372
01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Every year the NFL has meetings to change stuff to make the sport more a</v>

2373
01:02:10.281 --> 01:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>offensive.</v>

2374
01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>They always,</v>

2375
01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:13.340
<v Speaker 1>they're always figuring out a way.</v>

2376
01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:15.170
<v Speaker 1>They're always handicapping the defense.</v>

2377
01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Try,</v>

2378
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:17.210
<v Speaker 1>you know you can't hit the receiver.</v>

2379
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>You're always handicap in the deep and she wanted authentic as a league.</v>

2380
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>The same thing with can be done for MMA.</v>

2381
01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>You get together and go,</v>

2382
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>how do we improve submissions?</v>

2383
01:02:25.381 --> 01:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

2384
01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>you improve submissions by make it around.</v>

2385
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>They want knocked out the one that counts as much as they want.</v>

2386
01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Some Mitchell.</v>

2387
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.261
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2388
01:02:31.261 --> 01:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>We do something for the knockouts too.</v>

2389
01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>But you do something for submissions to you every year.</v>

2390
01:02:35.311 --> 01:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>You do something a little bit here and there.</v>

2391
01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:37.501
<v Speaker 1>Girls,</v>

2392
01:02:37.501 --> 01:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>whereas cards all the time,</v>

2393
01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.210
<v Speaker 1>so I can take her titties.</v>

2394
01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll take rash guards,</v>

2395
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>no gloves for a thousand hours.</v>

2396
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Damn it.</v>

2397
01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2398
01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>no guys,</v>

2399
01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:48.841
<v Speaker 1>no gloves.</v>

2400
01:02:48.841 --> 01:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

2401
01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:50.183
<v Speaker 1>That'd be perfect.</v>

2402
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't have to create this test for this thing that you made illegal.</v>

2403
01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.231
<v Speaker 1>It's illegal,</v>

2404
01:02:55.231 --> 01:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>but there's no test cause it's not that big of a legal,</v>

2405
01:02:59.020 --> 01:02:59.850
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

2406
01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:00.241
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

2407
01:03:00.241 --> 01:03:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're rice all the time.</v>

2408
01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Don't think you're right.</v>

2409
01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Cause I know that herb dean tested someone before.</v>

2410
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:05.371
<v Speaker 1>I know her,</v>

2411
01:03:05.371 --> 01:03:06.750
<v Speaker 1>talked to him personally.</v>

2412
01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.190
<v Speaker 1>He took a swab off.</v>

2413
01:03:08.191 --> 01:03:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Someone did is just to test it.</v>

2414
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:11.743
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2415
01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:12.590
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2416
01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:13.190
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2417
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2418
01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:14.553
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2419
01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy event</v>

2420
01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't horse.</v>

2421
01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a tremendous advantage.</v>

2422
01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:29.220
<v Speaker 1>What did her upset?</v>

2423
01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Try grappling with someone greasy.</v>

2424
01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:31.710
<v Speaker 1>What did herb say?</v>

2425
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:32.543
<v Speaker 1>Punch him in the face.</v>

2426
01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:33.510
<v Speaker 1>You said you talked to her.</v>

2427
01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:37.770
<v Speaker 1>He said that he's done like onsite shit where he'll like look and see,</v>

2428
01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.930
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't stop a guy along Moses.</v>

2429
01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a couple months ago,</v>

2430
01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:43.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe three months ago,</v>

2431
01:03:43.051 --> 01:03:44.840
<v Speaker 1>and I know there was at least I was asking,</v>

2432
01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:46.800
<v Speaker 1>there's no test.</v>

2433
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.800
<v Speaker 1>They just Lorens Larkin the monsoon because that's a good question.</v>

2434
01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:55.080
<v Speaker 1>That's close to close,</v>

2435
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:55.361
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't,</v>

2436
01:03:55.361 --> 01:03:56.880
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want you to close enough to judge,</v>

2437
01:03:56.881 --> 01:03:59.280
<v Speaker 1>but his take down definitely helped them.</v>

2438
01:03:59.281 --> 01:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Those two take talk a little bit more amazing fight,</v>

2439
01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:04.680
<v Speaker 1>but we barely paid attached to,</v>

2440
01:04:04.681 --> 01:04:05.281
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest,</v>

2441
01:04:05.281 --> 01:04:08.870
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about illegal greasing and rash guard.</v>

2442
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.430
<v Speaker 1>While I'm saying if it's illegal,</v>

2443
01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:12.750
<v Speaker 1>come up with an official test.</v>

2444
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:14.160
<v Speaker 1>If there's no official test,</v>

2445
01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:15.203
<v Speaker 1>then the symbol,</v>

2446
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:16.920
<v Speaker 1>the symbol could still expensive.</v>

2447
01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Temple do what the girls did.</v>

2448
01:04:18.901 --> 01:04:20.690
<v Speaker 1>The girls wear tops mean.</v>

2449
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:24.780
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting with sweat is that it was sweat the,</v>

2450
01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.090
<v Speaker 1>the conditions naturally change.</v>

2451
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.230
<v Speaker 1>They actually changed.</v>

2452
01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:31.170
<v Speaker 1>They start off dependent upon your preparation.</v>

2453
01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Like that's one of the things where Nate Marquardt fought Paul Harris.</v>

2454
01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:39.440
<v Speaker 1>He wore a rubber suit backstage and Nate like really got super sweaty and then</v>

2455
01:04:40.081 --> 01:04:41.190
<v Speaker 1>when he went out there to fight,</v>

2456
01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:45.720
<v Speaker 1>he was already sweaty as fuck and so when Paul hires one for that leg lock,</v>

2457
01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Nate was all sweated up.</v>

2458
01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Nate slipped out and Pahar started pointing at a Nate punches fucking lights on.</v>

2459
01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.670
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>

2460
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:52.800
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorites of all time.</v>

2461
01:04:52.801 --> 01:04:53.371
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

2462
01:04:53.371 --> 01:04:54.390
<v Speaker 1>It was his greatest dude.</v>

2463
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2464
01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:57.960
<v Speaker 1>it was a great ending and he was like Turkish oil wrestling.</v>

2465
01:04:57.961 --> 01:04:58.581
<v Speaker 1>You should check it.</v>

2466
01:04:58.581 --> 01:04:59.414
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2467
01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I'll Turkish oil to the rest of the,</v>

2468
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:04.560
<v Speaker 1>they look like they look like you had mustaches.</v>

2469
01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:06.780
<v Speaker 1>It does guys reach into each other's pants.</v>

2470
01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Then the gravity of this deck and they usually just,</v>

2471
01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:10.183
<v Speaker 1>Dick</v>

2472
01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.150
<v Speaker 1>don't know Bruno.</v>

2473
01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:13.891
<v Speaker 1>When it goes,</v>

2474
01:05:13.891 --> 01:05:14.940
<v Speaker 1>the body will follow it.</v>

2475
01:05:14.941 --> 01:05:16.890
<v Speaker 1>You guys want that to no gloves and Dick,</v>

2476
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:18.063
<v Speaker 1>what's your</v>

2477
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.053
<v Speaker 2>mustache?</v>

2478
01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:21.391
<v Speaker 2>Handlebar mustache.</v>

2479
01:05:21.391 --> 01:05:22.150
<v Speaker 2>You'd look good.</v>

2480
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.983
<v Speaker 2>I have a question for you.</v>

2481
01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Head gear is there,</v>

2482
01:05:25.151 --> 01:05:29.200
<v Speaker 2>is that science that it actually is worse for you when your box can be worse?</v>

2483
01:05:29.201 --> 01:05:30.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily worse,</v>

2484
01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:31.780
<v Speaker 2>but it can be worse.</v>

2485
01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Why's?</v>

2486
01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:36.370
<v Speaker 2>It makes a larger fulcrum because it's a larger thing and you get clipped and it</v>

2487
01:05:36.371 --> 01:05:37.630
<v Speaker 2>makes your head spin more.</v>

2488
01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2489
01:05:38.561 --> 01:05:39.670
<v Speaker 2>And it's also a heavy,</v>

2490
01:05:39.830 --> 01:05:40.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2491
01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.380
<v Speaker 2>So you have this thing,</v>

2492
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:43.030
<v Speaker 2>what is a way like half a pound,</v>

2493
01:05:43.031 --> 01:05:44.740
<v Speaker 2>a pound or hash?</v>

2494
01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:46.203
<v Speaker 2>It makes your head,</v>

2495
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:47.860
<v Speaker 2>it's slower for your head to move.</v>

2496
01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:50.410
<v Speaker 2>One of the things about punches as you see them coming,</v>

2497
01:05:50.411 --> 01:05:53.800
<v Speaker 2>you got to learn how to roll with Shit and you can't roll with shit if you have</v>

2498
01:05:53.801 --> 01:05:55.510
<v Speaker 2>this big ass fucking head gear on,</v>

2499
01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:57.700
<v Speaker 2>but then you can't begin because it's good for cuts.</v>

2500
01:05:57.701 --> 01:05:58.840
<v Speaker 2>So he can't get cut.</v>

2501
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.430
<v Speaker 2>But that's just in training.</v>

2502
01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.940
<v Speaker 2>It's only training.</v>

2503
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2504
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:02.980
<v Speaker 2>it was not,</v>

2505
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2506
01:06:04.151 --> 01:06:04.984
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2507
01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I think you're better off grease in your fucking head up,</v>

2508
01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:09.520
<v Speaker 2>but then there's a problem cause they grease heads up,</v>

2509
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:11.230
<v Speaker 2>the grease faces up and shit.</v>

2510
01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.680
<v Speaker 2>And then you take that same grease and you put it on a dude's chest as you're</v>

2511
01:06:14.681 --> 01:06:15.640
<v Speaker 2>trying to take them down.</v>

2512
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.800
<v Speaker 2>And then you grab your arms,</v>

2513
01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:18.940
<v Speaker 2>you wrap it around at night and get grease on your arms.</v>

2514
01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Boxers aren't bottoms,</v>

2515
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Vaseline in the face up.</v>

2516
01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:25.840
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed much Vaseline are they using in the UFC these days they're using</v>

2517
01:06:25.841 --> 01:06:26.674
<v Speaker 2>less and less.</v>

2518
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.930
<v Speaker 2>That's like leftover bullshit boxing shit.</v>

2519
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:32.290
<v Speaker 2>While it makes Vaseline all over your fucking seeking slip punches,</v>

2520
01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:34.300
<v Speaker 2>makes punches not cut you off.</v>

2521
01:06:34.301 --> 01:06:35.121
<v Speaker 2>So they hit you,</v>

2522
01:06:35.121 --> 01:06:40.121
<v Speaker 2>but they slide off instead of instead of them grazing and scrap by with the</v>

2523
01:06:40.331 --> 01:06:41.170
<v Speaker 2>leather gloves.</v>

2524
01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:41.861
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2525
01:06:41.861 --> 01:06:42.611
<v Speaker 2>I'm down with that.</v>

2526
01:06:42.611 --> 01:06:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I will say this.</v>

2527
01:06:43.661 --> 01:06:44.500
<v Speaker 2>No Vaseline,</v>

2528
01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:45.334
<v Speaker 2>no gloves,</v>

2529
01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:45.760
<v Speaker 2>cheese,</v>

2530
01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.061
<v Speaker 2>rash,</v>

2531
01:06:46.061 --> 01:06:46.510
<v Speaker 2>guard,</v>

2532
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:47.890
<v Speaker 2>no gloves and rash guard.</v>

2533
01:06:47.891 --> 01:06:49.350
<v Speaker 2>You said rash cause you could wear a rash guards.</v>

2534
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's a problem with rash guards,</v>

2535
01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:52.170
<v Speaker 2>but I think rational idea.</v>

2536
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:57.930
<v Speaker 2>I feel like your phones would cut skin rash guard you against that optional.</v>

2537
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.210
<v Speaker 2>This theophany Kamozi it's a bad look.</v>

2538
01:07:01.211 --> 01:07:02.640
<v Speaker 2>You could put your fucking Reebok on that.</v>

2539
01:07:02.641 --> 01:07:02.951
<v Speaker 2>A big,</v>

2540
01:07:02.951 --> 01:07:05.170
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine the Reebok rash guards that can come up with,</v>

2541
01:07:05.171 --> 01:07:08.230
<v Speaker 2>with the red and the black love and closes his door.</v>

2542
01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Vito Vito Miranda.</v>

2543
01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:11.280
<v Speaker 2>This dude's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2544
01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.730
<v Speaker 2>This is a serious fight here.</v>

2545
01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Kamozi Miranda.</v>

2546
01:07:14.081 --> 01:07:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2547
01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:15.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2548
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:17.350
<v Speaker 2>It'd be a grade d.</v>

2549
01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Where's he from it?</v>

2550
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:23.510
<v Speaker 2>I got a zeal Kamozi so game his name and his game as fuck and he's been training</v>

2551

2553
01:07:26.711 --> 01:07:27.960
<v Speaker 2>and then he was going out to wipe off the camp.</v>

2554
01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Tough man and soul.</v>

2555
01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Miranda Miranda is a little older thing.</v>

2556
01:07:31.331 --> 01:07:31.631
<v Speaker 2>Miranda,</v>

2557
01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I want to say he's 34 35 but he's a multiple time kickboxing champion.</v>

2558
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.660
<v Speaker 2>He said nasty.</v>

2559
01:07:36.661 --> 01:07:39.490
<v Speaker 2>You start remembering the fraction and a Russian assassin.</v>

2560
01:07:39.491 --> 01:07:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Even though he's from Brazil,</v>

2561
01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:42.940
<v Speaker 2>he's not rush.</v>

2562
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:44.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Russian.</v>

2563
01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:47.140
<v Speaker 2>He was a finalist in the ultimate fighter Brazil.</v>

2564
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.983
<v Speaker 2>Remember Jesus,</v>

2565
01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:49.220

2568
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:51.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough fight for Kamozi.</v>

2569
01:07:51.521 --> 01:07:52.510
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] to tell.</v>

2570

2572
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:56.170

2598
01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:19.420
<v Speaker 1>It was nasty and Gomorrah was,</v>

2599
01:08:19.421 --> 01:08:20.254
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2600
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:24.620
<v Speaker 1>was a really good striker himself and the clinic has to fight to woo.</v>

2601
01:08:24.621 --> 01:08:24.981
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2602
01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

2603

<v Speaker 1>Ultimate fighter finale.</v>

2605
01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>And he'd just wrestled him the whole time.</v>

2606
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:30.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2607
01:08:30.121 --> 01:08:31.280

<v Speaker 1>I'll fight for Kamozi stylized.</v>

2609
01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Kamozi is not a wrestler.</v>

2610
01:08:33.741 --> 01:08:34.421
<v Speaker 1>He's not a grapple.</v>

2615
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.590
<v Speaker 1>He's just so fucking tough.</v>

2616
01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:40.251
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those dudes.</v>

2617
01:08:40.251 --> 01:08:42.150
<v Speaker 1>You just can't count out now unless you,</v>

01:08:48.441 --> 01:08:49.550
<v Speaker 1>The exact same way.</v>

2626
01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I'll do this shit all day.</v>

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:01.993
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2634
01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.920
<v Speaker 1>That was fucked up twice.</v>

2635
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Short notes fights those killer [inaudible] Shakuri his ground game was he tore</v>

2640
01:09:12.651 --> 01:09:15.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a little beat up from training camp for Vituro tour.</v>

2641
01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:16.730
<v Speaker 1>What he did to veto was just she,</v>

2642
01:09:16.731 --> 01:09:17.564
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

2643
01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:20.360
<v Speaker 1>he should have taken a fucking cortisone shot and jumped in that fight.</v>

2644
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:21.221
<v Speaker 1>He really showed up.</v>

2645
01:09:21.221 --> 01:09:22.054
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2646
01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:22.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2647
01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.920
<v Speaker 1>I almost failing unless it's really fucked up.</v>

2648
01:09:24.921 --> 01:09:26.180
<v Speaker 1>But I just feel like man,</v>

2649
01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:27.620
<v Speaker 1>he's going to get a title shot.</v>

2650
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:30.830
<v Speaker 1>But he fought against Rockhold and everybody knows it.</v>

2651
01:09:30.831 --> 01:09:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Rockhold took that last fight with staff.</v>

2652
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:33.980
<v Speaker 1>It's staff and it's fun.</v>

2653
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:34.940
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucked up.</v>

2654
01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Everybody fights hurt.</v>

2655
01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:36.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2656
01:09:36.981 --> 01:09:39.820
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me like this opportunity I guess maybe just wasn't,</v>

2657
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.030
<v Speaker 1>he was eating donuts and shit.</v>

2658
01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just wanting to break or maybe went on the boom bar.</v>

2659
01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.601
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know what it is.</v>

2660
01:09:50.601 --> 01:09:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you laugh and you know,</v>

2661
01:09:51.871 --> 01:09:52.010
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2662
01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:53.300
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about steroids.</v>

2663
01:09:53.301 --> 01:09:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2664
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:54.743
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2665
01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he did.</v>

2666
01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would drop right.</v>

2667
01:09:56.781 --> 01:09:56.991
<v Speaker 1>Did,</v>

2668
01:09:56.991 --> 01:09:57.824
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2669
01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:01.060
<v Speaker 1>it sucks that he didn't take that fight cause I think stylistically that's a</v>

2670
01:10:01.061 --> 01:10:02.480
<v Speaker 1>really interesting gonna happen though.</v>

2671
01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.130
<v Speaker 1>You mean,</v>

2672
01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:04.790
<v Speaker 1>you mean it's going rock hauling?</v>

2673
01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Rockhold they fought,</v>

2674
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:08.420
<v Speaker 1>they fought in Strikeforce and Rockhold wanted decision.</v>

2675
01:10:08.690 --> 01:10:09.730
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>

2676
01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:10.970
<v Speaker 1>I still think,</v>

2677
01:10:10.971 --> 01:10:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I still think the guy who's going to beat both Weidman and rock hall by any of</v>

2678
01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:16.280
<v Speaker 1>those guys is a Yoel Romero.</v>

2679
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's just so Romero barely beat Jacques hurray.</v>

2680
01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2681
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.951
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

2682
01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:22.910
<v Speaker 1>But like what is,</v>

2683
01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.270
<v Speaker 1>when you think about why,</v>

2684
01:10:24.271 --> 01:10:24.950
<v Speaker 1>when you think about it,</v>

2685
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:25.761
<v Speaker 1>of course it's tracking,</v>

2686
01:10:25.761 --> 01:10:27.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's raising Jocko raped,</v>

2687
01:10:27.630 --> 01:10:28.760
<v Speaker 1>beat Ramiro rather.</v>

2688
01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:29.870
<v Speaker 1>That's why he uh,</v>

2689
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:30.860
<v Speaker 1>he was next in line,</v>

2690
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.311
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2691
01:10:31.311 --> 01:10:31.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2692
01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.140
<v Speaker 1>when Jocko Ray beat Ramiro,</v>

2693
01:10:33.141 --> 01:10:34.820
<v Speaker 1>he almost got taken out in that first round,</v>

2694
01:10:34.821 --> 01:10:37.310
<v Speaker 1>but then he came back in one second and third.</v>

2695
01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2696
01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:38.600
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2697
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Ramiro,</v>

2698
01:10:39.441 --> 01:10:40.270
<v Speaker 1>I think we,</v>

2699
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:41.600
<v Speaker 1>we fucking missed out.</v>

2700
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:43.070
<v Speaker 1>You can keep it up here hiding.</v>

2701
01:10:43.071 --> 01:10:46.340
<v Speaker 1>We'd for Ramiro missed out in that.</v>

2702
01:10:46.341 --> 01:10:47.690
<v Speaker 1>He's like 30,</v>

2703
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:49.340
<v Speaker 1>late thirties,</v>

2704
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:50.930
<v Speaker 1>like 30 6:37 PM late.</v>

2705
01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:51.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2706
01:10:51.261 --> 01:10:55.490
<v Speaker 1>If we got ahold of Romero when he was like 26 what I mean,</v>

2707
01:10:55.491 --> 01:10:59.360
<v Speaker 1>he was just a God damn super duper athletes.</v>

2708
01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.433
<v Speaker 1>All natural.</v>

2709
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:01.663
<v Speaker 1>He's a free,</v>

2710
01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2711
01:11:02.181 --> 01:11:03.014
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2712
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2713
01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:05.701
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

2714
01:11:05.701 --> 01:11:06.560
<v Speaker 1>he did beat,</v>

2715
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:07.423
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2716
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Cael Sanderson twice,</v>

2717
01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:10.880
<v Speaker 1>twice,</v>

2718
01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:11.301
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

2719
01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:11.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2720
01:11:11.561 --> 01:11:13.010
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the Olympic gold medal.</v>

2721
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>He walked through</v>

2722
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:14.430
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2723
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:16.980
<v Speaker 2>in that finals against that Korean guy to win the gold medal.</v>

2724
01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:18.240
<v Speaker 2>He walked through that guy.</v>

2725
01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:18.511
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2726
01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:19.290
<v Speaker 2>he was just,</v>

2727
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:22.290
<v Speaker 2>he was just crazy man in monsters as a wrestler.</v>

2728
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:22.891
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2729
01:11:22.891 --> 01:11:25.050
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him do stuff inside the octagon like you,</v>

2730
01:11:25.051 --> 01:11:25.261
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

2731
01:11:25.261 --> 01:11:26.094
<v Speaker 2>his movements.</v>

2732
01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.410
<v Speaker 2>So like when I'm watching fights,</v>

2733
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:28.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2734
01:11:28.771 --> 01:11:31.410
<v Speaker 2>up close and you watch like thousands of them or whatever,</v>

2735
01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:32.580
<v Speaker 2>I've watched at this point,</v>

2736
01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:36.420
<v Speaker 2>do you like get you still at certain speeds that people move under and every now</v>

2737
01:11:36.421 --> 01:11:38.070
<v Speaker 2>and then someone to move at a speed that you're like,</v>

2738
01:11:38.071 --> 01:11:38.371
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2739
01:11:38.371 --> 01:11:39.750
<v Speaker 2>my brain is not recognizing this.</v>

2740
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:39.871
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2741
01:11:39.871 --> 01:11:41.520
<v Speaker 2>how's like Barboza switch kick?</v>

2742
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:42.660
<v Speaker 2>My brain just goes,</v>

2743
01:11:42.661 --> 01:11:42.801
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

2744
01:11:42.801 --> 01:11:42.971
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

2745
01:11:42.971 --> 01:11:43.191
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2746
01:11:43.191 --> 01:11:43.920
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

2747
01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:44.753
<v Speaker 2>I'm good dude.</v>

2748
01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:51.680
<v Speaker 2>And I think that one of the biggest examples of that is Yotel.</v>

2749
01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2750
01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2751
01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:55.320
<v Speaker 2>the way he moves when he throws people around,</v>

2752
01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:57.870
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like he's not even the same thing as them.</v>

2753
01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:58.401
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2754
01:11:58.401 --> 01:12:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I can just toss this guys around like,</v>

2755
01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:01.161
<v Speaker 2>like you're,</v>

2756
01:12:01.161 --> 01:12:01.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2757
01:12:01.411 --> 01:12:01.750
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2758
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:05.070
<v Speaker 2>like he's just some crazy ass silver bag and you're some dude in a rubber</v>

2759
01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:05.904
<v Speaker 2>gorilla outfit.</v>

2760
01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:08.220
<v Speaker 2>He lost the Tim,</v>

2761
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:09.720
<v Speaker 2>he lost a jock gray I think.</v>

2762
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Well he didn't lose the Tim but he definitely should have been disqualified.</v>

2763
01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:13.571
<v Speaker 2>Definitely cheated.</v>

2764
01:12:13.571 --> 01:12:14.750
<v Speaker 2>And I thought he loved me out.</v>

2765
01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:18.720
<v Speaker 2>He knocked out Tim and the third round but never made it to the third brown.</v>

2766
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:19.500
<v Speaker 2>They should have.</v>

2767
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:19.951
<v Speaker 2>He didn't,</v>

2768
01:12:19.951 --> 01:12:23.460
<v Speaker 2>he was not capable of coming off his stool for the third round.</v>

2769
01:12:23.461 --> 01:12:26.160
<v Speaker 2>They should have stopped the fight and they should've given to cheating.</v>

2770
01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:26.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2771
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:29.700
<v Speaker 2>I think he should have laundry or per site based off that disqualified.</v>

2772
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:31.280
<v Speaker 2>I thought he lost her job gray.</v>

2773
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:33.780
<v Speaker 2>He definitely lost a jock ray.</v>

2774
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:35.100
<v Speaker 2>He lost a decision.</v>

2775
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:36.751
<v Speaker 2>He definitely know.</v>

2776
01:12:36.751 --> 01:12:39.150
<v Speaker 2>But he was like kind of close and they know,</v>

2777
01:12:39.151 --> 01:12:42.390
<v Speaker 2>I think well he almost put joc raise lights out in the first that's spinning</v>

2778
01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:44.040
<v Speaker 2>back fist and then after that was,</v>

2779
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.441
<v Speaker 2>thank you ma'am.</v>

2780
01:12:44.441 --> 01:12:47.360
<v Speaker 2>But I think you're crazy if he had him and half guards,</v>

2781
01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:51.490
<v Speaker 2>you see that when he stood right up like you know there's something about Joel</v>

2782
01:12:51.491 --> 01:12:54.230
<v Speaker 2>morale or where's that where it seems like Jocko Jujitsu,</v>

2783
01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.140
<v Speaker 2>nothing was going to work.</v>

2784
01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:55.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2785
01:12:55.351 --> 01:12:56.250
<v Speaker 2>it was a very close fight.</v>

2786
01:12:56.251 --> 01:12:57.810
<v Speaker 2>But I mean he's the ultimate athlete.</v>

2787
01:12:57.811 --> 01:12:59.850
<v Speaker 2>He makes other athletes like fat slobs.</v>

2788
01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:01.860
<v Speaker 2>He's afraid he makes like real Alec.</v>

2789
01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:04.070
<v Speaker 2>If you saw like Chris Weidman as a study.</v>

2790
01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2791
01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 2>Chris Weidman is standing next to y'all was like,</v>

2792
01:13:06.901 --> 01:13:07.141
<v Speaker 2>Chris,</v>

2793
01:13:07.141 --> 01:13:07.974
<v Speaker 2>why don't you work out?</v>

2794
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2795
01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.230
<v Speaker 2>And Chris is a great restaurant but it's wrestling.</v>

2796
01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Chris looks like next door.</v>

2797
01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.300
<v Speaker 2>It was just like super skinny.</v>

2798
01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:16.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm bummed out.</v>

2799
01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:18.400
<v Speaker 2>He's got a neck injury cause I want to see that motherfucker fight.</v>

2800
01:13:18.401 --> 01:13:19.234
<v Speaker 2>It's a great fight.</v>

2801
01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.450
<v Speaker 2>It's up and the rematch matched amazing.</v>

2802
01:13:21.451 --> 01:13:22.860
<v Speaker 2>But that neck injuries,</v>

2803
01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:23.401
<v Speaker 2>no joke.</v>

2804
01:13:23.401 --> 01:13:28.140
<v Speaker 2>And I just hope he doesn't do something drastic quickly in order to repair</v>

2805
01:13:28.141 --> 01:13:28.974
<v Speaker 2>himself quickly.</v>

2806
01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.450
<v Speaker 2>Tried to get from passage where it goes.</v>

2807
01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Does he needs surgery for the neck or is it just might not be,</v>

2808
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:34.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2809
01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:36.530
<v Speaker 2>it sounds similar to the exact injury that I had.</v>

2810
01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.530
<v Speaker 2>What I had to do is take a log time and you have to do decompression.</v>

2811
01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.101
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

2812
01:13:41.101 --> 01:13:44.100
<v Speaker 2>I have this neck harness that I hang on a door.</v>

2813
01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:46.680
<v Speaker 2>It hangs on a doorframe and it's like I'm hanging myself.</v>

2814
01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:47.970
<v Speaker 2>It velcros in place.</v>

2815
01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.920
<v Speaker 2>I pull it down tight and I'd go like this,</v>

2816
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:50.191
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

2817
01:13:50.191 --> 01:13:50.431
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

2818
01:13:50.431 --> 01:13:50.701
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

2819
01:13:50.701 --> 01:13:50.971
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

2820
01:13:50.971 --> 01:13:51.301
<v Speaker 2>click,</v>

2821
01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:52.740
<v Speaker 2>and I hang on my neck.</v>

2822
01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:54.841
<v Speaker 2>How long,</v>

2823
01:13:54.841 --> 01:13:56.850
<v Speaker 2>how long does it take?</v>

2824
01:13:56.851 --> 01:13:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Why they need surgery?</v>

2825
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.771
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

2826
01:13:58.771 --> 01:14:01.560
<v Speaker 2>why he does this and in doing that and doing that,</v>

2827
01:14:01.561 --> 01:14:05.100
<v Speaker 2>what I just described over a long period of time and Regena keen,</v>

2828
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:06.660
<v Speaker 2>those two things,</v>

2829
01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:10.470
<v Speaker 2>it stopped my bulging disc and it's sucked back into my neck.</v>

2830
01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 2>My disc stuck out.</v>

2831
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Like there was an Mri when they looked at the disc and it was like six</v>

2832
01:14:16.091 --> 01:14:17.080
<v Speaker 2>millimeter bulge.</v>

2833
01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Now I have none.</v>

2834
01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:19.180
<v Speaker 2>It went back.</v>

2835
01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:20.013
<v Speaker 2>You can do it,</v>

2836
01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:21.580
<v Speaker 2>but when you go to doctors,</v>

2837
01:14:21.581 --> 01:14:23.200
<v Speaker 2>one of the first things you want to do is cut you.</v>

2838
01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously is a super important to talk about everybody's injuries different</v>

2839
01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:28.870
<v Speaker 2>because it worked for me.</v>

2840
01:14:28.871 --> 01:14:29.920
<v Speaker 2>It might not work for you.</v>

2841
01:14:29.921 --> 01:14:30.131
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>

2842
01:14:30.131 --> 01:14:33.400
<v Speaker 2>your injury might be worse than mine and it might get to a point where there's</v>

2843
01:14:33.401 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 2>nothing they can do except for surgery.</v>

2844
01:14:34.901 --> 01:14:39.901
<v Speaker 2>But you don't know that just by talking to some doctors because some doctors are</v>

2845
01:14:40.331 --> 01:14:44.020
<v Speaker 2>just ready to cut you and they might be right and they might have had success</v>

2846
01:14:44.021 --> 01:14:44.230
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

2847
01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:47.650
<v Speaker 2>But that gentleman was on TV right now is a testament to the fact that it does</v>

2848
01:14:47.651 --> 01:14:48.550
<v Speaker 2>not always work.</v>

2849
01:14:48.850 --> 01:14:53.110
<v Speaker 2>And boss will tell you he's had several neck surgeries and because of that,</v>

2850
01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.090
<v Speaker 2>because of his neck injury,</v>

2851
01:14:55.150 --> 01:14:55.990
<v Speaker 2>his arm,</v>

2852
01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:56.651
<v Speaker 2>he has one arm.</v>

2853
01:14:56.651 --> 01:14:59.410
<v Speaker 2>It's atrophy that he calls baby arm because his,</v>

2854
01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:03.770
<v Speaker 2>his nerves weren't firing to his arm was impinged.</v>

2855
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2856
01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:05.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean serious,</v>

2857
01:15:05.851 --> 01:15:06.700
<v Speaker 2>serious shit.</v>

2858
01:15:06.701 --> 01:15:06.860
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

2859
01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:10.760
<v Speaker 2>what they're going to ask what Chris is decision to be based off of what's going</v>

2860
01:15:10.761 --> 01:15:11.890
<v Speaker 2>to get me back faster.</v>

2861
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:12.790
<v Speaker 2>It's probably gonna be surgery.</v>

2862
01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:13.450
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

2863
01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:15.010
<v Speaker 2>but he's got a thing called the no,</v>

2864
01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:15.401
<v Speaker 2>tell him.</v>

2865
01:15:15.401 --> 01:15:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

2866
01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:18.610
<v Speaker 2>he's got to think about the future because he's one of the baddest motherfuckers</v>

2867
01:15:18.611 --> 01:15:20.980
<v Speaker 2>on the planet and I think you can get back in action but he's got,</v>

2868
01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:24.670
<v Speaker 2>it's an injury and you've got to let it heal up instead of like cutting it out.</v>

2869
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Now in Eddie's case,</v>

2870
01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Eddie's got a totally different case.</v>

2871
01:15:26.951 --> 01:15:28.030
<v Speaker 2>Any disc is gone,</v>

2872
01:15:28.031 --> 01:15:28.864
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>

2873
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:33.790
<v Speaker 2>It's just my lower back is in constant in a constant state of inflammation.</v>

2874
01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:35.980
<v Speaker 2>It's been like that for maybe eight years.</v>

2875
01:15:35.981 --> 01:15:37.260
<v Speaker 2>I've tried fucking everything.</v>

2876
01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:38.830
<v Speaker 2>He also has finally,</v>

2877
01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:40.570
<v Speaker 2>well finally got my Mri.</v>

2878
01:15:40.571 --> 01:15:43.990
<v Speaker 2>People kept saying get an Mri and I tried all everything,</v>

2879
01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:46.030
<v Speaker 2>fucking chiropractor,</v>

2880
01:15:46.031 --> 01:15:46.864
<v Speaker 2>all this shit,</v>

2881
01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:47.770
<v Speaker 2>acupuncture.</v>

2882
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:48.940
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2883
01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.600
<v Speaker 2>finally I got an MRI and Mri shows.</v>

2884
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:56.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean any fool can see there is no distance and bone to bone.</v>

2885
01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:56.780
<v Speaker 2>I know you,</v>

2886
01:15:56.780 --> 01:15:57.200
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2887
01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.340
<v Speaker 2>you are in a constant state of inflammation cause I would stop working out.</v>

2888
01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Once I started having back spasms in my back,</v>

2889
01:16:02.711 --> 01:16:04.810
<v Speaker 2>felt like it was just going to completely cut out.</v>

2890
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I stopped working out altogether and in two months I still felt like I did dead</v>

2891
01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:10.930
<v Speaker 2>lifts the fucking day before.</v>

2892
01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2893
01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Miranda's back probably think great.</v>

2894
01:16:13.091 --> 01:16:14.960
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't it these 37 yeah,</v>

2895
01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:15.530
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>

2896
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:16.271
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

2897
01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was a young dude.</v>

2898
01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:17.861
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2899
01:16:17.861 --> 01:16:20.890
<v Speaker 2>I think he was 35 when he was on the ultimate fighter for him.</v>

2900
01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:21.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2901
01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:21.360
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2902
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.630
<v Speaker 2>he's a stud and,</v>

2903
01:16:22.631 --> 01:16:23.464
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2904
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:26.500
<v Speaker 2>hormonally the thing is when you get to be that age,</v>

2905
01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:27.221
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're,</v>

2906
01:16:27.221 --> 01:16:31.570
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with a reduced level of testosterone unless you're like super</v>

2907
01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.310
<v Speaker 2>vittores saying pre super on point with your diet soup trunk point with your</v>

2908
01:16:36.311 --> 01:16:37.090
<v Speaker 2>rest.</v>

2909
01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Super on point with consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol.</v>

2910
01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:41.740
<v Speaker 2>That's very important.</v>

2911
01:16:41.741 --> 01:16:44.710
<v Speaker 2>If you want to have a natural testosterone production,</v>

2912
01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:49.000
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that I really get pissed off when people start talking</v>

2913
01:16:49.001 --> 01:16:50.590
<v Speaker 2>about the dangers of saturated fats.</v>

2914
01:16:50.591 --> 01:16:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>

2915
01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:51.690
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2916
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:54.190
<v Speaker 2>you're preaching some outdated nonsense,</v>

2917
01:16:54.191 --> 01:16:58.030
<v Speaker 2>some nonscientific bullshit that people have said and they've said it to</v>

2918
01:16:58.031 --> 01:16:59.490
<v Speaker 2>demonize meat consumption.</v>

2919
01:16:59.491 --> 01:17:00.040
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>

2920
01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.150
<v Speaker 2>And meat consumption.</v>

2921
01:17:01.151 --> 01:17:04.390
<v Speaker 2>Look who scientifically it's not bad.</v>

2922
01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:06.550
<v Speaker 2>What's bad is ethically and we,</v>

2923
01:17:06.551 --> 01:17:09.530
<v Speaker 2>I think we all agree that factory farming's bad ethically,</v>

2924
01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 2>but when</v>

2925
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.620
<v Speaker 1>it comes to like scientific conceit,</v>

2926
01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:12.493
<v Speaker 1>consumption,</v>

2927
01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:16.280
<v Speaker 1>saturated fats are super important for testosterone production.</v>

2928
01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Super Important for brain function.</v>

2929
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Cholesterol,</v>

2930
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:21.830
<v Speaker 1>not just cholesterol produced by the body,</v>

2931
01:17:21.831 --> 01:17:23.240
<v Speaker 1>but dietary cholesterol,</v>

2932
01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:27.770
<v Speaker 1>which by the way apparently barely moves the needle on blood lipids.</v>

2933
01:17:27.771 --> 01:17:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2934
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:29.083
<v Speaker 1>that's a big,</v>

2935
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:30.081
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2936
01:17:30.081 --> 01:17:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Does the new science new?</v>

2937
01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:31.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2938
01:17:31.921 --> 01:17:32.181
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2939
01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:34.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean eating the yolk of the egg is not,</v>

2940
01:17:34.131 --> 01:17:36.630
<v Speaker 1>is not going to move the needle in terms of what you,</v>

2941
01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:38.540
<v Speaker 1>you and that's where most of the nutrients are.</v>

2942
01:17:38.541 --> 01:17:39.350
<v Speaker 1>US.</v>

2943
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I just got five new chickies.</v>

2944
01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2945
01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I got five,</v>

2946
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:42.670
<v Speaker 1>a little baby chicks.</v>

2947
01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:43.030
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2948
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:45.370
<v Speaker 1>where do you get from the other chickens?</v>

2949
01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:47.650
<v Speaker 1>You had a little farm and ever seen here?</v>

2950
01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:48.513
<v Speaker 1>Old Chicken?</v>

2951
01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:48.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2952
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.891
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2953
01:17:48.891 --> 01:17:49.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat them.</v>

2954
01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:49.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2955
01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:50.483
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2956
01:17:50.690 --> 01:17:51.620
<v Speaker 1>no other pets.</v>

2957
01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:52.370
<v Speaker 1>They're like pets.</v>

2958
01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:53.900
<v Speaker 1>We've put them out here to play with them and stuff.</v>

2959
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:57.020
<v Speaker 1>I remember one thing about factories and shit.</v>

2960
01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:57.441
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2961
01:17:57.441 --> 01:17:58.550
<v Speaker 1>There's no way we can't eat.</v>

2962
01:17:58.551 --> 01:17:59.360
<v Speaker 1>You can't even,</v>

2963
01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.193
<v Speaker 1>they've died.</v>

2964
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:00.860
<v Speaker 1>They've died.</v>

2965
01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:02.310
<v Speaker 1>We don't eat them shot.</v>

2966
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.781
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2967
01:18:02.781 --> 01:18:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>

2968
01:18:03.210 --> 01:18:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2969
01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:04.603
<v Speaker 1>Now they're pets.</v>

2970
01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

2971
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:06.770
<v Speaker 1>While I can be nice there,</v>

2972
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:10.280
<v Speaker 1>patty mandated standards like about like her own food,</v>

2973
01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:11.920
<v Speaker 1>chickens,</v>

2974
01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.640
<v Speaker 1>you raise them to eat 'em to do it.</v>

2975
01:18:13.641 --> 01:18:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Like I thought that was the ethical way and he's going,</v>

2976
01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:16.850
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

2977
01:18:16.850 --> 01:18:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I hardly ever eat chicken.</v>

2978
01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:18.963
<v Speaker 1>You're using them.</v>

2979
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:20.570
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't,</v>

2980
01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't eat them because we have a different kind of relationship.</v>

2981
01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:26.330
<v Speaker 1>The relationship that I have with them is that they're egg layers and there are</v>

2982
01:18:26.331 --> 01:18:29.970
<v Speaker 1>little friends like we go in there and my daughter picks them up so they still</v>

2983
01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:31.300
<v Speaker 1>pay him off from personalities?</v>

2984
01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:32.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2985
01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.250
<v Speaker 1>they have different personalities.</v>

2986
01:18:34.290 --> 01:18:37.940
<v Speaker 1>He was there like one of them was really smart and she knows when you actually</v>

2987
01:18:37.941 --> 01:18:38.870
<v Speaker 1>my dog killed that one,</v>

2988
01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.240
<v Speaker 1>but we had one that was really smart and she would uh,</v>

2989
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:42.111
<v Speaker 1>pick up the,</v>

2990
01:18:42.111 --> 01:18:42.171
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2991
01:18:42.171 --> 01:18:43.340
<v Speaker 1>the dog got in the chicken coop.</v>

2992
01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:43.491
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2993
01:18:43.491 --> 01:18:44.031
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>

2994
01:18:44.031 --> 01:18:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Like in the Fox,</v>

2995
01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:45.793
<v Speaker 1>in the chicken coop.</v>

2996
01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Smart with time.</v>

2997
01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately the smart one wanted to have the lowest perch.</v>

2998
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:50.360
<v Speaker 1>I guess she wasn't that sports.</v>

2999
01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3000
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:53.750
<v Speaker 1>it was a smart one.</v>

3001
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3002
01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:57.260
<v Speaker 1>She knew to follow me around and uh,</v>

3003
01:18:57.350 --> 01:19:01.370
<v Speaker 1>like she knew that if anybody picked up rocks that like my wife would like lift</v>

3004
01:19:01.371 --> 01:19:03.470
<v Speaker 1>up rocks and she would go into that and get the bugs.</v>

3005
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:04.130
<v Speaker 1>She knew she,</v>

3006
01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:07.430

<v Speaker 1>He got something.</v>

3069
01:20:52.261 --> 01:20:52.981
<v Speaker 1>If he wants it,</v>

3070
01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:54.560
<v Speaker 1>he'd fucking definitely it.</v>

3071
01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.100
<v Speaker 1>If he knows what he's doing.</v>

3072
01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:56.551
<v Speaker 1>He's got,</v>

3073
01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:56.960
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

3078
01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.430
<v Speaker 1>How hard are those elbows to the thigh from that?</v>

3079
01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:06.810
<v Speaker 1>How much does that suck?</v>

3080
01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:07.700
<v Speaker 1>No one ever.</v>

3081
01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I've known I've never had it done cause you would think that a guy who's got</v>

3082
01:21:11.221 --> 01:21:14.980
<v Speaker 1>really good elbows could seriously fuck your leg up like this here.</v>

3083
01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:16.253
<v Speaker 1>You see what I'm saying?</v>

3084
01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Like Miranda is like got some serious elbows and I'm watching him and I'm like I</v>

3085
01:21:20.131 --> 01:21:22.050
<v Speaker 1>bet this guy can fuck your legs up.</v>

3086
01:21:22.450 --> 01:21:27.450
<v Speaker 1>The this is interesting cause cause come along and have a question like this.</v>

3087
01:21:28.321 --> 01:21:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3088
01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:29.773
<v Speaker 1>He could,</v>

3089
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:32.570
<v Speaker 1>he could release that body locking</v>

3090
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:38.880
<v Speaker 1>the body launch rare is a week of moseys punching him in the face from the</v>

3091
01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:40.123
<v Speaker 1>fucking</v>

3092
01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:43.500

<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

3095
01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Rarely do people say get a leg lock position but instead of finishing them</v>

3096
01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.480
<v Speaker 1>because Kamozi isn't an offensive position,</v>

3097
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:52.440
<v Speaker 1>he could go after that.</v>

3098
01:21:52.441 --> 01:21:55.020
<v Speaker 1>He'll fucking thing that's going on.</v>

3099
01:21:55.050 --> 01:21:55.331
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

3100
01:21:55.331 --> 01:21:55.591
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3101
01:21:55.591 --> 01:21:56.940
<v Speaker 1>he's punching the guy back.</v>

3102
01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:59.220
<v Speaker 1>What's going on is Miranda backwards.</v>

3103
01:21:59.221 --> 01:21:59.311
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3104
01:21:59.311 --> 01:22:00.061
<v Speaker 1>this was going on.</v>

3105
01:22:00.061 --> 01:22:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Miranda's trapped.</v>

3106
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Kamozi can move his body forward and back.</v>

3107
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Where's Miranda can't.</v>

3108
01:22:05.161 --> 01:22:05.321
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3109
01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:05.801
<v Speaker 1>now come on.</v>

3110
01:22:05.801 --> 01:22:07.880
<v Speaker 1>And he's trying to lock it in and he's Oh,</v>

3111
01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:09.210
<v Speaker 1>times out puzzles.</v>

3112
01:22:09.211 --> 01:22:10.170
<v Speaker 1>He hit him with some hard,</v>

3113
01:22:10.171 --> 01:22:10.930
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3114
01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:12.150
<v Speaker 1>The rest are going to score that.</v>

3115
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:12.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3116
01:22:12.451 --> 01:22:13.284
<v Speaker 1>you should</v>

3117
01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:15.271
<v Speaker 1>give that rounded.</v>

3118
01:22:15.271 --> 01:22:15.931
<v Speaker 1>Kamozi well,</v>

3119
01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:16.711
<v Speaker 1>not just that,</v>

3120
01:22:16.711 --> 01:22:17.544
<v Speaker 1>that position,</v>

3121
01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.350
<v Speaker 1>even though Miranda's above him,</v>

3122
01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:22.770
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand who's close to getting something done and who's being</v>

3123
01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:23.550
<v Speaker 1>more effective.</v>

3124
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Kamozi had a,</v>

3125
01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.021
<v Speaker 1>he had a heel,</v>

3126
01:22:25.021 --> 01:22:27.810
<v Speaker 1>he hit a potential him and then he also punched him in the face of the big</v>

3127
01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:28.051
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

3128
01:22:28.051 --> 01:22:29.010
<v Speaker 1>the punches in the face.</v>

3129
01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Even though Miranda's on top.</v>

3130
01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Kamozi is tagging him with that right hand.</v>

3131
01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Kamozi also made that position happen.</v>

3132
01:22:36.211 --> 01:22:37.660
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't put on Bob exactly,</v>

3133
01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:38.280
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's doing,</v>

3172
01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.130
<v Speaker 2>he's attacking the knee itself.</v>

3173
01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:40.970
<v Speaker 2>May last three strikes have gone like right on the two skinny.</v>

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:42.350
<v Speaker 2>He looks like he's got skinny knees there.</v>

3175
01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Kamasi is made out of iron.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's iron man.</v>

3178
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's needs are your needs.</v>

01:23:47.081 --> 01:23:47.990
<v Speaker 2>And I made for sports.</v>

<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

3181
01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead and kick the knee.</v>

3182
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:50.761
<v Speaker 2>That's all bone.</v>

3183
01:23:50.761 --> 01:23:51.230
<v Speaker 2>So well.</v>

3184
01:23:51.230 --> 01:23:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Moran has been slamming his Shin into the outside and the inside of that nature.</v>

3185
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Ouch.</v>

3186
01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:56.720
<v Speaker 2>The mushy parts.</v>

3187
01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:56.991
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3188
01:23:56.991 --> 01:23:57.920

3189
01:23:57.921 --> 01:23:58.754
<v Speaker 2>it looks a little</v>

3190

01:24:03.151 --> 01:24:04.640
<v Speaker 2>but why is that one okay?</v>

3193
01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:07.520
<v Speaker 2>If people that are upset about attacking the knee,</v>

3194
01:24:07.670 --> 01:24:09.260
<v Speaker 2>that one is almost as devastating,</v>

3195
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:11.180
<v Speaker 2>especially the outside low kick.</v>

3196
01:24:11.181 --> 01:24:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Like Ernesto who style.</v>

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:26.120
<v Speaker 5>I thought about what you're saying this whole time where you were saying this</v>

3201
01:24:26.941 --> 01:24:27.774
<v Speaker 5>whole time.</v>

3207
01:24:38.010 --> 01:24:39.780
<v Speaker 5>Are they going to walk with the grandchildren?</v>

3208
01:24:39.810 --> 01:24:40.740
<v Speaker 5>People don't think about,</v>

3209
01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.593
<v Speaker 5>they never think of Google.</v>

3210
01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:44.460
<v Speaker 5>Eddie Miranda's got a maze to get to his fucking buy.</v>

3211
01:24:44.461 --> 01:24:45.870

3212
01:24:45.930 --> 01:24:47.130
<v Speaker 5>Looking at Miranda's left leg.</v>

3213
01:24:47.131 --> 01:24:48.420
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing to get to his dick.</v>

<v Speaker 5>There's no cheese,</v>

3224
01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:15.203

<v Speaker 5>strong.</v>

3229
01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.730
<v Speaker 5>The mass</v>

3230
01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:36.953
<v Speaker 5>oil</v>

3231
01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:39.590
<v Speaker 5>oil.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'll be answering you just um,</v>

3236
01:25:46.321 --> 01:25:46.681
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

3237
01:25:46.681 --> 01:25:50.010
<v Speaker 5>it's not an oil sweat for debt for the body on body.</v>

3238
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.120
<v Speaker 5>They're just working out really hard in your body.</v>

3239
01:25:55.170 --> 01:25:56.970
<v Speaker 5>Your body heats up and um,</v>

3240
01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:58.690
<v Speaker 5>hit hit all the head here.</v>

3241
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:59.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3242
01:25:59.200 --> 01:25:59.491
<v Speaker 5>Why,</v>

3243
01:25:59.491 --> 01:26:01.320
<v Speaker 5>why are they are so strong?</v>

3244
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:03.080
<v Speaker 5>Because they're,</v>

3245
01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:04.310
<v Speaker 5>they're fighting</v>

3246
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.761
<v Speaker 2>other men.</v>

3247
01:26:04.761 --> 01:26:05.720
<v Speaker 2>They have to be strong.</v>

3248
01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you get your ass kicked and you know,</v>

3249
01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:11.060
<v Speaker 2>you want to protect your joints and stuff sometimes,</v>

3250
01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:11.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3251
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:12.450
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous.</v>

3252
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Come up.</v>

3253
01:26:13.090 --> 01:26:13.923
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3254
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.991
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3255
01:26:14.991 --> 01:26:15.261

01:26:15.710 --> 01:26:16.461
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty tight.</v>

3258
01:26:16.461 --> 01:26:20.420
<v Speaker 2>They've got quality Reebok gear on here and cops and stuff.</v>

3259
01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Everything's fine.</v>

3260
01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.610
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to worry about that.</v>

3261
01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.473
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3262
01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:24.770
<v Speaker 2>You already smelling good.</v>

3263
01:26:24.771 --> 01:26:25.440
<v Speaker 2>You are.</v>

3264
01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.120
<v Speaker 2>Judy will shower all day and I just got back from bear hunt,</v>

3265
01:26:28.930 --> 01:26:32.090
<v Speaker 2>smell like bear and I smell and I like the forest.</v>

3266
01:26:34.650 --> 01:26:37.160
<v Speaker 2>Vito Miranda cut over the left eye.</v>

3267
01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:38.091
<v Speaker 2>Joey what?</v>

3268
01:26:38.091 --> 01:26:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Chris most Wellman Kamozi working animals ground.</v>

3269
01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>

3270
01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:42.230
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3271
01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:45.980
<v Speaker 2>you know as well as anybody that the gaps in grappling are the hardest to close</v>

3272
01:26:45.981 --> 01:26:46.700
<v Speaker 2>for some reason mind,</v>

3273
01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:46.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3274
01:26:46.911 --> 01:26:47.744
<v Speaker 2>not the hardest,</v>

3275
01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.041
<v Speaker 2>the hardest.</v>

3276
01:26:49.041 --> 01:26:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Every,</v>

3277
01:26:49.670 --> 01:26:51.290
<v Speaker 2>every gap is a hard gap to close.</v>

3278
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3279
01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:55.760
<v Speaker 2>You say striking but not necessarily in the case of like a guy like Damien Maia</v>

3280
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:57.770
<v Speaker 2>to a guy who was a good high school wrestler,</v>

3281
01:26:58.190 --> 01:27:00.140
<v Speaker 2>you're never closing that gap and your lifetime.</v>

3282
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:03.500
<v Speaker 2>Like you're going to have to become obsessed with Jujitsu and live on the mats</v>

3283
01:27:03.501 --> 01:27:06.080
<v Speaker 2>for the next 10 years to even get in his neighborhood.</v>

3284
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:06.771
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

3285
01:27:06.771 --> 01:27:07.604
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's got like,</v>

3286
01:27:07.630 --> 01:27:10.910
<v Speaker 2>like Alistair Overeem who's just look at this,</v>

3287
01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Ben Rothwell for ratio for doom added the tool three in Cleveland,</v>

3288
01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:18.940
<v Speaker 2>googly Mowgli in that crazy that uh,</v>

3289
01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I liked that fight and you got Steve Bay over him as the main event.</v>

3290
01:27:22.161 --> 01:27:23.540
<v Speaker 2>I like that fight too.</v>

3291
01:27:24.170 --> 01:27:26.660
<v Speaker 2>So why is there not an automatic rematch for,</v>

3292
01:27:26.690 --> 01:27:28.310
<v Speaker 2>for Steve Bay?</v>

3293
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Everybody doesn't get an automatic reminder.</v>

3294
01:27:30.150 --> 01:27:30.480
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>

3295
01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.313
<v Speaker 2>It has to be,</v>

3296
01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:31.970
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

3297
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:35.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why he doesn't do that cause it was a Kia that was in his,</v>

3298
01:27:35.370 --> 01:27:37.190
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people waiting in line like over him.</v>

3299
01:27:37.191 --> 01:27:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I want to see the Overeem.</v>

3300
01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:39.980
<v Speaker 2>I want to see the Overeem steep a fight.</v>

3301
01:27:39.981 --> 01:27:44.981
<v Speaker 2>As much as I want to see any fight in the UFC other than the cane and VRE doom</v>

3302
01:27:45.131 --> 01:27:45.620
<v Speaker 2>rematch,</v>

3303
01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:47.060
<v Speaker 2>I want to see Cain for doom,</v>

3304
01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:47.894
<v Speaker 2>sea level</v>

3305
01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Kane.</v>

3306
01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:53.600
<v Speaker 2>I want to see Cain in great shape.</v>

3307
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:55.760
<v Speaker 2>I think I still maintained that.</v>

3308
01:27:55.761 --> 01:27:56.780
<v Speaker 2>I've seen like again,</v>

3309
01:27:56.781 --> 01:27:59.990
<v Speaker 2>it's just coming to movements and what you see inside fights.</v>

3310
01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:01.041
<v Speaker 2>I think Kane,</v>

3311
01:28:01.041 --> 01:28:03.410
<v Speaker 2>like in the second fight with junior dos Santos,</v>

3312
01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:08.540
<v Speaker 2>I think that is right up there in my eyes with faders fight with cro cop where</v>

3313
01:28:08.541 --> 01:28:13.230
<v Speaker 2>you just seeing a a mauling by a better animal against an animal in his prime or</v>

3314
01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:15.480
<v Speaker 2>the best game we've ever seen in that.</v>

3315
01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:17.000
<v Speaker 2>I really would.</v>

3316
01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.910
<v Speaker 2>I really would have wanted more than anything else in the history of the</v>

3317
01:28:19.911 --> 01:28:24.170
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight division is that cane versus that fade or fade or versus cro?</v>

3318
01:28:24.171 --> 01:28:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Cop vs Cain junior too.</v>

3319
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.780
<v Speaker 2>That's sick.</v>

3320
01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:30.470
<v Speaker 2>That would be the ultimate who's the greatest heavyweight of all time because</v>

3321
01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:32.630
<v Speaker 2>right now then it just becomes speculation.</v>

3322
01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:33.351
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3323
01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:37.610
<v Speaker 2>after Cain gets like a back injury and two knee surgeries and shoulder</v>

3324
01:28:37.611 --> 01:28:38.091
<v Speaker 2>surgeries,</v>

3325
01:28:38.091 --> 01:28:38.924
<v Speaker 2>you got to go.</v>

3326
01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:40.850
<v Speaker 2>How much of him does he have left?</v>

3327
01:28:40.851 --> 01:28:41.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3328
01:28:41.031 --> 01:28:41.930
<v Speaker 2>how much are we seeing?</v>

3329
01:28:41.931 --> 01:28:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Are we seeing the same came that fought junior dos Santos?</v>

3330
01:28:45.010 --> 01:28:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Are we seeing the same cane that uh,</v>

3331
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3332
01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:51.140
<v Speaker 2>ran through guys on the way up to the title of the ran through Rothwell.</v>

3333
01:28:51.141 --> 01:28:53.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if we are with specially with his style.</v>

3334
01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3335
01:28:53.970 --> 01:28:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Style.</v>

3336
01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Just break everything including himself.</v>

3337
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Bull dog training,</v>

3338
01:28:59.090 --> 01:29:00.200
<v Speaker 2>mental toughness,</v>

3339
01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 2>ferocious born</v>

3340
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:05.160
<v Speaker 1>to fight and the body just can't keep up with the mind.</v>

3341
01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3342
01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:07.680
<v Speaker 1>So to me those are the two does,</v>

3343
01:29:07.681 --> 01:29:08.310
<v Speaker 1>that's number one.</v>

3344
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.701
<v Speaker 1>Number two.</v>

3345
01:29:08.701 --> 01:29:13.701
<v Speaker 1>But then Cain and bull and fade or both submitted by Verdugo.</v>

3346
01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:14.993
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3347
01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Both of them for dumb submitted the three greatest heavyweight talk to you for</v>

3348
01:29:19.351 --> 01:29:20.011
<v Speaker 1>dooms the grace.</v>

3349
01:29:20.011 --> 01:29:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Have we had look,</v>

3350
01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:20.751
<v Speaker 1>could are,</v>

3351
01:29:20.751 --> 01:29:21.371
<v Speaker 1>you really can't.</v>

3352
01:29:21.371 --> 01:29:23.040
<v Speaker 1>It could be Steve Bay.</v>

3353
01:29:23.041 --> 01:29:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Just shut the fucking show off so you can't argue that you still can.</v>

3354
01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.950
<v Speaker 1>You can't base it off one fight.</v>

3355
01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3356
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:30.120
<v Speaker 1>The product,</v>

3357
01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:35.120
<v Speaker 1>you can argue it and also Verdomme realistically is in his late thirties and</v>

3358
01:29:35.911 --> 01:29:36.660
<v Speaker 1>clean.</v>

3359
01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:37.500
<v Speaker 1>What's going on over here?</v>

3360
01:29:37.501 --> 01:29:38.334
<v Speaker 1>Why did they stop?</v>

3361
01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Cut His cut.</v>

3362
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.471
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad one.</v>

3363
01:29:41.471 --> 01:29:42.304
<v Speaker 1>Above the eye.</v>

3364

3366
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:45.743

3367

<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3368

01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:47.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3370

01:30:01.171 --> 01:30:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Now he's not saying that.</v>

3382
01:30:05.230 --> 01:30:07.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to stop that kind of shit.</v>

3390
01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like his kickboxing has gotten smoother.</v>

3391
01:30:21.931 --> 01:30:25.370
<v Speaker 1>It's timing has gotten better and a must be because he was really concentrating</v>

3392
01:30:25.371 --> 01:30:28.170
<v Speaker 1>it and knowing it was going to fight Miranda and I think that,</v>

3393
01:30:28.171 --> 01:30:32.190
<v Speaker 1>and then he also went to these coasts training with Ray Longo and why going back</v>

3394
01:30:32.191 --> 01:30:34.660
<v Speaker 1>to Denver re log in is Chad man wait long.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

3440
01:31:54.481 --> 01:31:55.440

3443
01:32:02.170 --> 01:32:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're just being gay with me cause you want to be funny.</v>

3446
01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:09.281
<v Speaker 1>Randy.</v>

3447
01:32:09.281 --> 01:32:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Got Back to his feet and need of the body.</v>

3448
01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:12.040
<v Speaker 1>He's exhausted.</v>

3449
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Turned on as well.</v>

3450
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:17.200
<v Speaker 1>That helps your hands into the size and then you could probably do anything.</v>

3451
01:32:17.201 --> 01:32:18.034
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

3452
01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.233
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

3453
01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.810
<v Speaker 1>you better not hold me down.</v>

3454
01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Miranda taking down.</v>

3455
01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Still throwing head Kish.</v>

3456
01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:27.221
<v Speaker 1>Shoot.</v>

3457
01:32:27.221 --> 01:32:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Kamozi Miranda's going for it man.</v>

3458
01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

3459
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:33.183
<v Speaker 1>Wrestle him.</v>

3460
01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:34.870
<v Speaker 1>This is a frantic fight.</v>

3461
01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing.</v>

3462
01:32:38.051 --> 01:32:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Here's another thing to take into consideration.</v>

3463
01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Time limits,</v>

3464
01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:42.760
<v Speaker 1>time limits for rounds.</v>

3465
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.930
<v Speaker 1>They impose a different style of fighting because sometimes sense of urgency.</v>

3466
01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3467
01:32:47.650 --> 01:32:48.470
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

3468
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:49.390
<v Speaker 1>better entertainment.</v>

3469
01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:53.290
<v Speaker 1>But are we sacrificing reality for entertainment?</v>

3470
01:32:53.291 --> 01:32:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'd make better fights.</v>

3471
01:32:54.401 --> 01:32:54.841
<v Speaker 1>I think you,</v>

3472
01:32:54.841 --> 01:32:57.640
<v Speaker 1>you got to see under barriers.</v>

3473
01:32:57.641 --> 01:32:57.791
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3474
01:32:57.791 --> 01:32:58.061
<v Speaker 1>under,</v>

3475
01:32:58.061 --> 01:32:58.490
<v Speaker 1>under,</v>

3476
01:32:58.490 --> 01:32:58.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3477
01:32:58.720 --> 01:32:59.980
<v Speaker 1>confines and boundaries.</v>

3478
01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:03.430
<v Speaker 1>You can still have the same kind of excitement or maybe more excitement.</v>

3479
01:33:03.431 --> 01:33:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Listen to me,</v>

3480
01:33:04.190 --> 01:33:08.050
<v Speaker 1>but if the goal is fields one 30 minute round,</v>

3481
01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:09.191
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3482
01:33:09.191 --> 01:33:11.170
<v Speaker 1>come on dude,</v>

3483
01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:12.813
<v Speaker 1>this is too much.</v>

3484
01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:13.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3485
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:14.423
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

3486
01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:16.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm a visionary.</v>

3487
01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:17.653
<v Speaker 1>A football field.</v>

3488
01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.010
<v Speaker 1>You throw like trash cans in there and hook.</v>

3489
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.291
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3490
01:33:21.291 --> 01:33:21.501
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3491
01:33:21.501 --> 01:33:21.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3492
01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:22.060
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3493
01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Homes now looking for reality.</v>

3494
01:33:24.071 --> 01:33:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking for the least amount of variables possible.</v>

3495
01:33:26.771 --> 01:33:28.290
<v Speaker 1>And you can pick the weaponry.</v>

3496
01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:32.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like an alley.</v>

3497
01:33:32.170 --> 01:33:34.360
<v Speaker 1>The stage is an alley and that's the fight is done.</v>

3498
01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:35.021
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

3499
01:33:35.021 --> 01:33:35.854
<v Speaker 1>in reality,</v>

3500
01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:39.340
<v Speaker 1>he knows in reality trains for a street fight for six weeks.</v>

3501
01:33:39.490 --> 01:33:41.170
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about reality,</v>

3502
01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:43.690
<v Speaker 1>not talking about the purest form of the competition.</v>

3503
01:33:43.890 --> 01:33:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Did Frank Mir on our podcast said that he would never,</v>

3504
01:33:47.470 --> 01:33:51.550
<v Speaker 1>he just recently started warming up because he considered a fight in the</v>

3505
01:33:51.551 --> 01:33:52.240
<v Speaker 1>octagon.</v>

3506
01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:56.230
<v Speaker 1>He was looking at it as practice for a real street fight.</v>

3507
01:33:56.770 --> 01:33:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Frank Mir is a maniac.</v>

3508
01:33:58.061 --> 01:34:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Walks down like an armed fucking weapon.</v>

3509
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3510
01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:01.953
<v Speaker 1>Straight up.</v>

3511
01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:02.800
<v Speaker 1>He's a maniac.</v>

3512
01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Very ready for the,</v>

3513
01:34:03.851 --> 01:34:04.810
<v Speaker 1>for the Zombie apocalypse.</v>

3514
01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:07.930
<v Speaker 1>He's one concussion away from doing some crazy shit.</v>

3515
01:34:07.931 --> 01:34:08.751
<v Speaker 1>I think all of us,</v>

3516
01:34:08.751 --> 01:34:10.050
<v Speaker 1>the be money for the gun store.</v>

3517
01:34:10.090 --> 01:34:10.691
<v Speaker 1>Frank would be like,</v>

3518
01:34:10.691 --> 01:34:11.381
<v Speaker 1>I've been ready.</v>

3519
01:34:11.381 --> 01:34:12.790
<v Speaker 1>I've been waiting for this moment my whole life.</v>

3520
01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Great guys.</v>

3521

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:22.270
<v Speaker 1>He's a great guy.</v>

3524
01:34:22.290 --> 01:34:23.050
<v Speaker 1>I love framework.</v>

3525
01:34:23.050 --> 01:34:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Can't have 60 guns on you though.</v>

3526
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3527
01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:25.970
<v Speaker 1>you can flip right.</v>

3528
01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Even one is,</v>

3529
01:34:28.090 --> 01:34:31.600
<v Speaker 1>oh look at this Kamozi with the uppercut and Miranda tries a wheel kick.</v>

3530
01:34:31.601 --> 01:34:32.620
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy fight.</v>

3531
01:34:32.621 --> 01:34:33.280
<v Speaker 1>We're missing it.</v>

3532
01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Frank Mir was the most dangerous man on the planet.</v>

3533
01:34:34.831 --> 01:34:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I'd be going nuts right now.</v>

3534
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3535
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:40.390
<v Speaker 1>One thing I really worry about that all the years of yelling in the UFC have</v>

3536
01:34:40.391 --> 01:34:43.570
<v Speaker 1>strengthened my vocal chords and my vocal cords will get out of shape if I</v>

3537
01:34:43.571 --> 01:34:47.900
<v Speaker 1>stopped coming to me now cause you're going to stand or will they blow like</v>

3538
01:34:47.901 --> 01:34:48.160
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

3539
01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

3540
01:34:48.850 --> 01:34:52.540
<v Speaker 1>but the yelling is I'll fucking 100% natural when when fights,</v>

3541
01:34:52.570 --> 01:34:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't even realize I'm doing it until it's out of my mouth.</v>

3542
01:34:54.851 --> 01:34:56.960
<v Speaker 1>So like you've never lost your passion for the,</v>

3543
01:34:57.770 --> 01:34:58.220
<v Speaker 1>I dunno</v>

3544
01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.053
<v Speaker 5>how it is done.</v>

3545
01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:00.043
<v Speaker 5>Just keep screaming,</v>

3546
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.420
<v Speaker 5>creaming.</v>

3547
01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:01.340
<v Speaker 5>Yet even just,</v>

3548
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:02.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how many times I've said this,</v>

3549
01:35:02.691 --> 01:35:06.170

3746
01:41:11.450 --> 01:41:13.930
<v Speaker 2>You're going to help anybody more than anybody else is going to throw anybody</v>

3756
01:41:28.930 --> 01:41:33.340
<v Speaker 2>White's probably super used to public speaking and I think nick to tooth does a</v>

<v Speaker 2>lot of drugs so there should be a lot of fun.</v>

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

3865
01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:32.733
<v Speaker 2>Straps</v>

3866
01:44:34.810 --> 01:44:35.660
<v Speaker 2>that hold your risk.</v>

3867
01:44:35.690 --> 01:44:39.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to let you know those young guys just call him or how'd that,</v>

3868
01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:43.550
<v Speaker 2>how'd that all fucking all night break Sukarno was also 285 pounds.</v>

3869
01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:44.601
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

3870
01:44:44.601 --> 01:44:46.150
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's like some,</v>

3871
01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:50.390
<v Speaker 2>some ridiculous like grapple strength that certain do tat for sure.</v>

3872
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Shield has a squeeze to be developing in every choke.</v>

3873
01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:57.560
<v Speaker 2>It's not just chicken to squeeze in one choke.</v>

3874
01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Marcello Marcel is a perfect example.</v>

3875
01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:04.150
<v Speaker 2>The chrome Gracie from Great Britain,</v>

3876
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.600
<v Speaker 2>the shop has that kind of strength,</v>

3877
01:45:06.810 --> 01:45:08.240
<v Speaker 2>but Brendan is also a gorilla,</v>

3878
01:45:08.630 --> 01:45:12.530
<v Speaker 2>but there's the thing about crone is it crone looks physically imposing.</v>

3879
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Like when clone crone doesn't have a shirt off you go.</v>

3880
01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:16.190
<v Speaker 2>When he has his shirt off,</v>

3881
01:45:16.191 --> 01:45:17.060
<v Speaker 2>rather you look at him,</v>

3882
01:45:17.061 --> 01:45:17.301

3884
01:45:17.421 --> 01:45:19.790
<v Speaker 2>that kid is obviously doing something.</v>

3885
01:45:19.791 --> 01:45:21.290
<v Speaker 2>He's obviously doing some gymnastics,</v>

3886
01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:23.040
<v Speaker 2>but you think it's like,</v>

3887
01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:23.893
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

3888

<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3889
01:45:25.941 --> 01:45:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>

3890
01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I saw crone.</v>

3891
01:45:27.650 --> 01:45:31.540
<v Speaker 2>There's a video of him doing the shit on Venice beach where he sourced Sanama</v>

3892
01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:36.050

<v Speaker 2>His Dad would roll in.</v>

3941
01:46:47.991 --> 01:46:48.800
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget this,</v>

3942
01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 2>the room full of the baddest dudes</v>

3943
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:51.310
<v Speaker 1>on UFC fighters.</v>

3944
01:46:51.650 --> 01:46:53.160

3946
01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.740
<v Speaker 1>It was like Blue Fossa</v>

3947
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:57.530
<v Speaker 6>bowed down and shit.</v>

3948
01:46:57.930 --> 01:46:58.671
<v Speaker 6>Let me get on a neat,</v>

3949
01:46:58.671 --> 01:46:59.100
<v Speaker 6>the one,</v>

3950
01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:04.100
<v Speaker 6>the one thing he has the most high level Jujitsu players don't have good light</v>

3951
01:47:05.730 --> 01:47:08.710
<v Speaker 6>when they're going to MMA besides a good looks is uh,</v>

3952
01:47:09.070 --> 01:47:09.360
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3953
01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:09.840
<v Speaker 6>when you're,</v>

3954
01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.780
<v Speaker 6>when you're talking about just pure Jujitsu,</v>

3955
01:47:11.790 --> 01:47:13.190
<v Speaker 6>whether it's gear Nogi,</v>

3956
01:47:13.410 --> 01:47:16.200
<v Speaker 6>the full guard is totally optional.</v>

3957
01:47:16.201 --> 01:47:18.510
<v Speaker 6>You don't ever need to develop a full guard of,</v>

3958
01:47:18.511 --> 01:47:19.291
<v Speaker 6>it's just grappling.</v>

3959
01:47:19.291 --> 01:47:20.790
<v Speaker 6>If you ever have someone to full guard and I want to play,</v>

3960
01:47:20.970 --> 01:47:23.040
<v Speaker 6>you open it up and then you start playing,</v>

3961
01:47:23.041 --> 01:47:23.400
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3962
01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:24.660
<v Speaker 6>butterfly guard or whatever.</v>

3963
01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:25.530
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3964
01:47:25.530 --> 01:47:27.990
<v Speaker 6>full guard is totally optional.</v>

3965
01:47:27.991 --> 01:47:31.320
<v Speaker 6>There's many great jujitsu players that just said,</v>

3966
01:47:31.321 --> 01:47:32.051
<v Speaker 6>fuck plan,</v>

3967
01:47:32.051 --> 01:47:32.881
<v Speaker 6>full guard.</v>

3968
01:47:32.881 --> 01:47:33.870
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to do some other shit.</v>

3969
01:47:33.871 --> 01:47:35.760
<v Speaker 6>We're going play open guard della Hiva.</v>

3970
01:47:35.970 --> 01:47:38.250
<v Speaker 6>We start opening up and start swinging around.</v>

3971
01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:42.510
<v Speaker 6>Never really engage in this full guard dimension that's completely optional.</v>

3972
01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:43.710
<v Speaker 6>Geeky or no Gig,</v>

3973
01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:44.341
<v Speaker 6>no gay.</v>

3974
01:47:44.341 --> 01:47:45.450
<v Speaker 6>If you don't want to play full guard,</v>

3975
01:47:45.451 --> 01:47:46.860
<v Speaker 6>if you don't want to develop a full guard,</v>

3976
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:50.770
<v Speaker 6>you don't have to just open up your fucking legs and then just start planning</v>

3977
01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:53.340
<v Speaker 6>MMA.</v>

3978
01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:53.820
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry.</v>

3979
01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:54.780
<v Speaker 6>Let me just finish this real quick.</v>

3980
01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:58.620
<v Speaker 6>But in MMA it's the most important guard.</v>

3981
01:47:58.920 --> 01:47:59.753
<v Speaker 6>Full Guard.</v>

3982
01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:01.620
<v Speaker 6>It's the most important.</v>

3983
01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:06.000
<v Speaker 6>You have to fucking play full guard when a guy is trying to smash your fucking</v>

3984
01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:07.140
<v Speaker 6>face and controls.</v>

3985
01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:08.490
<v Speaker 6>So now,</v>

3986
01:48:08.490 --> 01:48:10.740
<v Speaker 6>so now you're forced to play a card.</v>

3987
01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:15.000
<v Speaker 6>You didn't have to play in grappling ever and now an MMA,</v>

3988
01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:20.060
<v Speaker 6>but crone is one of those rare Jujitsu guys that in his grappling,</v>

3989
01:48:20.610 --> 01:48:22.790
<v Speaker 6>his full guard is his main weapon.</v>

3990
01:48:22.791 --> 01:48:24.960
<v Speaker 6>So he gets dudes in full guard.</v>

3991
01:48:25.050 --> 01:48:25.920
<v Speaker 6>That's his shit.</v>

3992
01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:29.490
<v Speaker 6>If he watches geeky grappling or Nogi grappling,</v>

3993
01:48:29.491 --> 01:48:30.930
<v Speaker 6>he wants to get you in full guard.</v>

3994
01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:33.300
<v Speaker 6>His Guillotine is among the best.</v>

3995
01:48:33.570 --> 01:48:38.430
<v Speaker 6>That's why he's doing good in MMA because in MMA he's forced to play a guard</v>

3996
01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:39.860
<v Speaker 6>that he wants to plain rice.</v>

3997
01:48:40.410 --> 01:48:40.741
<v Speaker 1>Pardon me,</v>

3998
01:48:40.741 --> 01:48:42.000
<v Speaker 1>in front of a ton of people.</v>

3999
01:48:42.001 --> 01:48:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Super embarrassing,</v>

4000
01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:43.890
<v Speaker 1>super ambitious.</v>

4001
01:48:44.490 --> 01:48:45.900
<v Speaker 1>That's got a real rough considering.</v>

4002
01:48:45.901 --> 01:48:46.241
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4003
01:48:46.241 --> 01:48:51.241
<v Speaker 1>they were clapping 70 may be enrolled for 25 minutes straight and then we were</v>

4004
01:48:51.721 --> 01:48:52.531
<v Speaker 1>like going back forth.</v>

4005

4017
01:49:10.831 --> 01:49:11.600
<v Speaker 1>He submitted me.</v>

4018
01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:12.380
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4019
01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:13.213
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

4020
01:49:13.230 --> 01:49:15.870
<v Speaker 1>One of the most satisfied baskets in the world ever.</v>

4021
01:49:15.930 --> 01:49:20.370
<v Speaker 1>One of the most satisfying aspects of Jujitsu is that it's truly one of the only</v>

4022
01:49:20.371 --> 01:49:22.950
<v Speaker 1>martial arts where a smaller,</v>

4023
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:25.410
<v Speaker 1>more tactical person can overcome a bigger,</v>

4024
01:49:25.411 --> 01:49:29.190
<v Speaker 1>more powerful person Shankar when roles in that motherfucker gorilla.</v>

4025
01:49:29.190 --> 01:49:32.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a different girl at [inaudible] so far beyond,</v>

4026
01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:35.790
<v Speaker 1>but I guarantee you if he got in there with Fabrizio over doom and they were</v>

4027
01:49:35.791 --> 01:49:37.650
<v Speaker 1>just grappling for Breeshia would tap him.</v>

4028
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:39.440
<v Speaker 1>You know it and I know it correct.</v>

4029
01:49:39.650 --> 01:49:42.960
<v Speaker 1>100% for [inaudible] here is going to tap them and who is bigger for breezy or</v>

4030
01:49:42.961 --> 01:49:43.351
<v Speaker 1>Shane?</v>

4031
01:49:43.351 --> 01:49:44.041
<v Speaker 1>Shane's bigger,</v>

4032
01:49:44.041 --> 01:49:45.180
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't Matte Taller.</v>

4033
01:49:45.210 --> 01:49:45.481
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

4034
01:49:45.481 --> 01:49:46.530
<v Speaker 1>but there's a level,</v>

4035
01:49:46.650 --> 01:49:50.710
<v Speaker 1>I guess it gets to a certain level where the technique can overcome massive</v>

4036
01:49:50.711 --> 01:49:51.410
<v Speaker 1>physical as well.</v>

4037
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:52.243
<v Speaker 1>Pecking order.</v>

4038
01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:52.661

4041
01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Cade is maybe one,</v>

4042
01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:03.580
<v Speaker 1>how much does kid way one 35 one maybe one 35 that motherfucker has put me in</v>

4043
01:50:03.581 --> 01:50:04.390
<v Speaker 1>danger.</v>

4044
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Tanga golf lunch.</v>

4045
01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:09.580
<v Speaker 1>At times I'll waste smallest one 35 locked me up and triangles where I'm like,</v>

4046
01:50:09.610 --> 01:50:10.241
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

4047
01:50:10.241 --> 01:50:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to tap to a dude who 70 pounds go ahead and rampage.</v>

4048
01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:16.571
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4049
01:50:16.571 --> 01:50:17.321
<v Speaker 1>I could do that.</v>

4050
01:50:17.321 --> 01:50:18.011
<v Speaker 1>But he's your friend.</v>

4051
01:50:18.011 --> 01:50:18.844
<v Speaker 1>You know it's supposed to do.</v>

4052
01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:22.330
<v Speaker 1>But I mean what I'm saying is that his technique that some of them,</v>

4053
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:25.870
<v Speaker 1>like my friend and my friend Danny is lighter than mean Denny.</v>

4054
01:50:25.871 --> 01:50:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Denny taps me all the time.</v>

4055
01:50:27.370 --> 01:50:27.620
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

4056
01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.350
<v Speaker 1>if Denny and I roll right now,</v>

4057
01:50:29.351 --> 01:50:30.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not having rolled in a while,</v>

4058
01:50:30.401 --> 01:50:31.330
<v Speaker 1>but if we were rolling,</v>

4059
01:50:31.331 --> 01:50:32.164
<v Speaker 1>he would always tag me.</v>

4060
01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:33.030
<v Speaker 1>He's better than me.</v>

4061
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Cause even though he's smaller than me,</v>

4062
01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:35.051
<v Speaker 1>someone's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're just better.</v>

4065
01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:38.350
<v Speaker 1>They're just better.</v>

4066
01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Like Marcello's when I was watching lines up with your weight has anyone else's</v>

01:53:38.561 --> 01:53:39.271
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck's going on?</v>

4152
01:53:39.271 --> 01:53:39.591
<v Speaker 5>And what it was.</v>

4153
01:53:39.591 --> 01:53:40.261
<v Speaker 5>It was a master.</v>

4154
01:53:40.261 --> 01:53:41.750
<v Speaker 5>I still hold on,</v>

4155
01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:42.410
<v Speaker 5>I am,</v>

4156
01:53:42.410 --> 01:53:43.243
<v Speaker 5>don't take it.</v>

4157
01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:49.100
<v Speaker 5>It was a cardiovascular thing for it's ability for it to lower blood pressure</v>

4158
01:53:49.330 --> 01:53:50.650
<v Speaker 5>that everyone got the right shit.</v>

4159
01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:51.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4160
01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:51.261
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

4161
01:53:51.261 --> 01:53:52.330
<v Speaker 5>that stuff's not good for you.</v>

4162
01:53:54.110 --> 01:53:54.591
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

4163
01:53:54.591 --> 01:53:58.310
<v Speaker 5>because they took it out and then when I got off and Ari took it and it made</v>

4164
01:53:58.311 --> 01:53:59.040
<v Speaker 5>them depressed.</v>

4165
01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.560

<v Speaker 5>His cock you might be.</v>

4167
01:54:03.561 --> 01:54:05.360
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you'd be more happy if you weren't on it.</v>

4168
01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:06.201
<v Speaker 5>That stuff,</v>

4169
01:54:06.201 --> 01:54:06.861
<v Speaker 5>I'm not kidding.</v>

4170
01:54:06.861 --> 01:54:11.630
<v Speaker 5>That stuff is very directly to depression because it fucks with your body's</v>

4171
01:54:11.631 --> 01:54:12.860
<v Speaker 5>ability to produce hormones.</v>

4172
01:54:12.970 --> 01:54:13.160
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

4173
01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:15.350
<v Speaker 5>it suppresses dihydrotestosterone,</v>

4174
01:54:15.351 --> 01:54:19.160
<v Speaker 5>which is a derivative of testosterone that causes you to go to balls and that is</v>

4175
01:54:19.161 --> 01:54:22.850
<v Speaker 5>a part of your overall system and when you suppress that one aspect of your</v>

4176
01:54:22.851 --> 01:54:23.450
<v Speaker 5>system,</v>

4177
01:54:23.450 --> 01:54:24.710
<v Speaker 5>it could fuck up your whole end.</v>

4178
01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:25.660
<v Speaker 5>Chris was Joe.</v>

4179
01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:29.310
<v Speaker 5>He's already like the same thing with steroids.</v>

4180
01:54:31.010 --> 01:54:33.890
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to be sad with a lot of hair than happy with no hair.</v>

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:34.730
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4182
01:54:34.730 --> 01:54:36.770
<v Speaker 5>You and I are very different obviously,</v>

4183
01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:37.221
<v Speaker 5>but Joe,</v>

4184
01:54:37.221 --> 01:54:39.110
<v Speaker 5>don't you think a always the exception?</v>

<v Speaker 5>No super depressed.</v>

4186
01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:40.881
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4187
01:54:40.881 --> 01:54:42.770
<v Speaker 5>because it's a common common side.</v>

4188
01:54:42.771 --> 01:54:43.520
<v Speaker 5>Disposed to that.</v>

4189
01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:43.731
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4190
01:54:43.731 --> 01:54:44.930
<v Speaker 5>it's a common side effect.</v>

4191
01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:47.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you already gone off that shit and it changed him.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It changed him.</v>

4193
01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:51.480
<v Speaker 5>It a nice set of here that might be yanked total dose.</v>

4194
01:54:51.570 --> 01:54:51.741
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4195
01:54:51.741 --> 01:54:53.360
<v Speaker 5>it kept his hair barely.</v>

4196
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:54.090
<v Speaker 5>Just like me.</v>

4197
01:54:54.090 --> 01:54:56.720
<v Speaker 5>Kept my hair barely and when I got off of it,</v>

4198
01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:58.400
<v Speaker 5>my body felt way better.</v>

4199
01:54:58.401 --> 01:54:59.510
<v Speaker 5>I had more endurance.</v>

4200
01:54:59.690 --> 01:55:02.390
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking I had chronic fatigue syndrome or something.</v>

4201
01:55:02.690 --> 01:55:03.021
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4202
01:55:03.021 --> 01:55:04.430
<v Speaker 5>why am I fucking tired all the time?</v>

4203
01:55:04.431 --> 01:55:06.320
<v Speaker 5>It's hard for me to muster up energy to work out.</v>

4204
01:55:06.321 --> 01:55:07.700
<v Speaker 5>It was doing it all on willpower.</v>

4205
01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:09.420
<v Speaker 5>I got off probation.</v>

4206
01:55:09.450 --> 01:55:10.283

<v Speaker 1>Look at his body.</v>

4290
01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Bodies like that are meant to come.</v>

01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:43.320
<v Speaker 1>He's the most to me all over the land.</v>

4292
01:57:44.610 --> 01:57:45.443

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:51.691
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

4299
01:57:51.691 --> 01:57:52.370
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

4300
01:57:52.370 --> 01:57:53.203
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

4301
01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:54.091
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

4305
01:57:59.401 --> 01:58:00.234
<v Speaker 1>But it's true.</v>

4306
01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:02.020
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to run to the street.</v>

4307
01:58:02.410 --> 01:58:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Gulf cocking your neighbors.</v>

4308

4314
01:58:07.471 --> 01:58:08.101
<v Speaker 1>I want to raise my,</v>

4315
01:58:08.101 --> 01:58:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I want to raise your child.</v>

4316
01:58:09.090 --> 01:58:09.871

<v Speaker 1>I got to come.</v>

4318
01:58:10.501 --> 01:58:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Don't be fucking calm to look at stuff.</v>

4319
01:58:14.070 --> 01:58:15.810
<v Speaker 1>A Dean with story on his back.</v>

4320
01:58:15.811 --> 01:58:16.644
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

4321
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Safa Dean took story down.</v>

4322
01:58:18.450 --> 01:58:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Sabba didn't trains with guys like Henderson.</v>

4323
01:58:20.891 --> 01:58:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4324
01:58:21.230 --> 01:58:23.460
<v Speaker 1>well that's who we went to when he first started.</v>

4325
01:58:23.461 --> 01:58:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4326
01:58:23.850 --> 01:58:25.230
<v Speaker 1>getting into the MMA game.</v>

4327
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

4328
01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:29.580
<v Speaker 1>You can go to her and Olympic wrestler figuring out how to stop this bullshit.</v>

4329
01:58:29.710 --> 01:58:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Good clinicians.</v>

4330
01:58:30.590 --> 01:58:31.730
<v Speaker 1>That black house a lot too.</v>

4331
01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4332
01:58:32.170 --> 01:58:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Warren.</v>

4333
01:58:32.730 --> 01:58:32.861
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4334
01:58:32.861 --> 01:58:37.861
<v Speaker 1>you know that fight with Nate Marquardt was a fucking excellent example of a guy</v>

4335
01:58:38.281 --> 01:58:41.250
<v Speaker 1>who's got just like super fucking high level.</v>

4336
01:58:41.770 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

4337
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:43.210
<v Speaker 2>tactical striking.</v>

4338
01:58:45.490 --> 01:58:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Nate was trying to eat it for a while and then when you eat a few of those you</v>

4339
01:58:49.061 --> 01:58:49.430
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4340
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.960
<v Speaker 2>you were like,</v>

4341
01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:50.411
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

4342
01:58:50.411 --> 01:58:51.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm stuck in a pattern.</v>

4343
01:58:51.611 --> 01:58:53.590
<v Speaker 2>And then you got to take yourself out of the pattern.</v>

4344
01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4345
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:55.150
<v Speaker 2>We got to break yourself out.</v>

4346
01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4347
01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:59.230
<v Speaker 2>you can't go against a high level Bob kickbox like this and go,</v>

4348
01:58:59.231 --> 01:59:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going chuck them all night.</v>

4349
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:01.031
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this.</v>

4350
01:59:01.031 --> 01:59:04.420
<v Speaker 2>If you ever had a fight where you went into it and you were too relaxed,</v>

4351
01:59:04.421 --> 01:59:05.470
<v Speaker 2>you were too confident.</v>

4352
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:06.640
<v Speaker 2>You asking me,</v>

4353
01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:07.473
<v Speaker 2>Roy Nelson,</v>

4354
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:08.351
<v Speaker 2>Roy Nelson,</v>

4355
01:59:08.351 --> 01:59:09.160
<v Speaker 2>fight the teacher,</v>

4356
01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:11.170
<v Speaker 2>big knock fight way to relax.</v>

4357
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:13.270
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad place to be.</v>

4358
01:59:13.271 --> 01:59:15.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like everybody wants to be super confident,</v>

4359
01:59:15.461 --> 01:59:16.840
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to be too confident,</v>

4360
01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:18.520
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>

4361
01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:19.353
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4362
01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:20.553
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

4363
01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:21.250
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4364
01:59:21.250 --> 01:59:21.661
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

4365
01:59:21.661 --> 01:59:24.700
<v Speaker 2>it varies with person to person from instance to instance.</v>

4366
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:29.890
<v Speaker 2>But I would think that you're almost better off being fucking terrified and</v>

4367
01:59:29.891 --> 01:59:31.990
<v Speaker 2>dealing with all the horrible feeling.</v>

4368
01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Because I remember the taekwondo days whenever I felt like too good about things</v>

4369
01:59:37.691 --> 01:59:38.381
<v Speaker 2>I didn't find,</v>

4370
01:59:38.381 --> 01:59:39.190
<v Speaker 2>never went good.</v>

4371
01:59:39.190 --> 01:59:43.810
<v Speaker 2>I fought like clumsy and I was too aware of what I was doing instead of being</v>

4372
01:59:43.811 --> 01:59:44.830
<v Speaker 2>instinctive and,</v>

4373
01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:47.800
<v Speaker 2>and like real fast twitch and sharp terrified.</v>

4374
01:59:47.801 --> 01:59:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4375
01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:48.993
<v Speaker 2>I hear Ya.</v>

4376
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:49.300
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4377
01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:52.360
<v Speaker 2>but nobody wants to deal with that feeling that all,</v>

4378
01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:56.320
<v Speaker 2>all the day of the way ends the day of the fucking,</v>

4379
01:59:56.321 --> 01:59:57.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's also what makes,</v>

4380
01:59:57.550 --> 02:00:02.380
<v Speaker 2>makes you great and it's also what makes the experience of being victorious so</v>

4381
02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:03.160
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

4382
02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:08.160
<v Speaker 2>When you see a guy like chocolate Dell run around the cage and throw his arms</v>

4383
02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:11.440
<v Speaker 2>when he would roar,</v>

4384
02:00:11.441 --> 02:00:13.660
<v Speaker 2>like when he knocked out Tito or when he knocked out,</v>

4385
02:00:13.661 --> 02:00:15.820
<v Speaker 2>Bob on board did the same shit exactly.</v>

4386
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Like you've got to realize that feeling doesn't just come from victory.</v>

4387
02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:25.260
<v Speaker 2>That feeling comes from all that turmoil and that did the fucking who knows</v>

4388
02:00:25.301 --> 02:00:26.380
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen.</v>

4389
02:00:28.150 --> 02:00:31.720
<v Speaker 2>It comes from when it comes to chuck and he knew how much bigger that picture,</v>

4390
02:00:31.721 --> 02:00:32.554
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn,</v>

4391
02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:35.240
<v Speaker 2>look at chocolate has the best picture in UFC history.</v>

4392
02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:38.150
<v Speaker 2>Those trunks he's got,</v>

4393
02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:39.940
<v Speaker 2>you know how much pussy this is going to get me?</v>

4394
02:00:43.210 --> 02:00:43.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the truth.</v>

4395
02:00:43.890 --> 02:00:44.321
<v Speaker 2>Hey Joe.</v>

4396
02:00:44.321 --> 02:00:46.150
<v Speaker 2>But he was an animal,</v>

4397
02:00:46.210 --> 02:00:47.560
<v Speaker 2>but just as good as the winds are.</v>

4398
02:00:47.561 --> 02:00:48.430
<v Speaker 2>When you're that scared,</v>

4399
02:00:48.431 --> 02:00:49.330
<v Speaker 2>when you do lose,</v>

4400
02:00:49.331 --> 02:00:49.601
<v Speaker 2>when you're like,</v>

4401
02:00:49.601 --> 02:00:49.721
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4402
02:00:49.721 --> 02:00:50.500
<v Speaker 2>what's what's can happen,</v>

4403
02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:51.520
<v Speaker 2>you lose the worst way.</v>

4404
02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Those same fears,</v>

4405
02:00:52.601 --> 02:00:52.811
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

4406
02:00:52.811 --> 02:00:54.040
<v Speaker 2>fuck going through that man.</v>

4407
02:00:54.070 --> 02:00:54.641
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

4408
02:00:54.641 --> 02:00:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Because you don't get the same pay off.</v>

4409
02:00:56.110 --> 02:00:56.860
<v Speaker 2>There's some extent.</v>

4410
02:00:56.860 --> 02:00:58.030
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly that as well.</v>

4411
02:00:58.031 --> 02:01:00.710
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly that as well and there's lows are low and the highs are high.</v>

4412
02:01:00.711 --> 02:01:05.711
<v Speaker 2>It's also guys where you start realizing the lows are coming repeatedly and it</v>

4413
02:01:05.951 --> 02:01:08.770
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seem like there's an escape for them and you've got to realize what are</v>

4414
02:01:08.771 --> 02:01:10.240
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of these lows.</v>

4415
02:01:10.450 --> 02:01:13.750
<v Speaker 2>They're permanent like a really smart guy like Mac Dansik,</v>

4416
02:01:13.930 --> 02:01:15.850
<v Speaker 2>like when Mac Danzig decided to retire,</v>

4417
02:01:15.851 --> 02:01:16.330
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

4418
02:01:16.330 --> 02:01:17.740
<v Speaker 2>that's a smart dude.</v>

4419
02:01:17.741 --> 02:01:18.580
<v Speaker 2>He should've done it before.</v>

4420
02:01:18.581 --> 02:01:19.720
<v Speaker 2>That may be,</v>

4421
02:01:19.721 --> 02:01:22.030
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard to see when you're inside of it.</v>

4422
02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:23.050
<v Speaker 2>Very few people,</v>

4423
02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:27.640
<v Speaker 2>me included can see themselves as well as other people can see you because we</v>

4424
02:01:27.641 --> 02:01:32.350
<v Speaker 2>all have a certain amount of protective layers of ego and of narcissism,</v>

4425
02:01:32.351 --> 02:01:33.184
<v Speaker 2>professional fighter.</v>

4426
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:34.150
<v Speaker 2>If anybody,</v>

4427
02:01:34.151 --> 02:01:36.810
<v Speaker 2>anybody that's trying to do good at anything and anything you,</v>

4428
02:01:36.811 --> 02:01:40.100
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a certain amount of self esteem and ego in order to pursue that</v>

4429
02:01:40.101 --> 02:01:43.430
<v Speaker 2>goal because otherwise for sure for sure,</v>

4430
02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:44.300
<v Speaker 2>but most,</v>

4431

<v Speaker 2>most also,</v>

4432
02:01:45.590 --> 02:01:49.280
<v Speaker 2>most likely their motivation for getting in the first place is they had really</v>

4433
02:01:49.281 --> 02:01:53.210
<v Speaker 2>low self esteem at one point in time in life and fighting showed them the way</v>

<v Speaker 2>Correct fight.</v>

4437
02:01:58.221 --> 02:01:59.750

4462
02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:34.131

<v Speaker 2>the hunt for wild edible plants.</v>

4567
02:05:29.070 --> 02:05:30.000

4572
02:05:38.461 --> 02:05:41.310
<v Speaker 2>whether they're understanding things about the way plants communicate with each</v>

4573
02:05:41.311 --> 02:05:42.144
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

4574
02:05:42.650 --> 02:05:45.480
<v Speaker 2>they're not much different than look octopus,</v>

4575
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:49.230
<v Speaker 2>it's really super arguable that we probably shouldn't need octopus because</v>

4576
02:05:49.231 --> 02:05:51.190
<v Speaker 2>octopus are smart as shit.</v>

4577
02:05:51.570 --> 02:05:53.340
<v Speaker 2>They can read your facial expressions right?</v>

4578
02:05:53.370 --> 02:05:54.121
<v Speaker 2>That well not only that,</v>

4579
02:05:54.121 --> 02:05:56.220
<v Speaker 2>they communicate through the texture of their skin.</v>

4580
02:05:56.430 --> 02:05:57.263
<v Speaker 2>They can kill,</v>

4581
02:05:57.490 --> 02:06:00.990
<v Speaker 2>they have ink that they blast in front of things so they can get the fuck away.</v>

4582
02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:01.640
<v Speaker 2>See Ya.</v>

4583
02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:02.540
<v Speaker 2>They're really complex.</v>

4584
02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:05.900
<v Speaker 2>Many times I'm a freak out guys.</v>

4585
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:06.930
<v Speaker 2>We can't talk over each.</v>

4586
02:06:06.931 --> 02:06:07.310
<v Speaker 2>All don't,</v>

4587
02:06:07.310 --> 02:06:09.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry someone has to just back off.</v>

4588
02:06:11.310 --> 02:06:12.143
<v Speaker 2>You got this Eddie.</v>

4589
02:06:12.150 --> 02:06:14.040
<v Speaker 2>I was just wondering if octopus was like spinach.</v>

4590
02:06:14.610 --> 02:06:15.443
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

4591
02:06:15.590 --> 02:06:16.291
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're saying you,</v>

4592
02:06:16.291 --> 02:06:19.230
<v Speaker 2>there's a real good argument between the plant life and hell.</v>

4593
02:06:19.290 --> 02:06:19.951
<v Speaker 2>Smarter plan is,</v>

4594
02:06:19.951 --> 02:06:20.341
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

4595
02:06:20.341 --> 02:06:21.174
<v Speaker 2>I'll get really weird.</v>

4596
02:06:21.690 --> 02:06:21.871
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4597
02:06:21.871 --> 02:06:22.201
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

4598
02:06:22.201 --> 02:06:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Doug,</v>

4599
02:06:22.530 --> 02:06:23.870
<v Speaker 2>don't talking about spinach and AUC.</v>

4600
02:06:23.871 --> 02:06:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to be a podcast or just certain things.</v>

4601
02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:30.450
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be willing to get so high you say stupid shit be with us.</v>

4602
02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:31.800
<v Speaker 2>He will watch this bro.</v>

4603
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:32.410
<v Speaker 2>So what were you saying?</v>

4604
02:06:32.410 --> 02:06:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Gosh,</v>

4605
02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:33.930
<v Speaker 2>to buses and spinach.</v>

4606
02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:34.681
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4607
02:06:34.681 --> 02:06:34.891
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4608
02:06:34.891 --> 02:06:37.200
<v Speaker 2>you were saying there's a real argument about plant life.</v>

4609
02:06:37.201 --> 02:06:38.100
<v Speaker 2>How smart they are.</v>

4610
02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:39.211
<v Speaker 2>Cause Vegan sale.</v>

4611
02:06:39.211 --> 02:06:39.361
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4612
02:06:39.361 --> 02:06:39.931
<v Speaker 2>we plants,</v>

4613
02:06:39.931 --> 02:06:40.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4614
02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Well the,</v>

4615
02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:41.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4616
02:06:41.190 --> 02:06:41.491
<v Speaker 2>Well the,</v>

4617
02:06:41.491 --> 02:06:45.090
<v Speaker 2>the argument is that we're starting to understand that plants communicate with</v>

4618
02:06:45.091 --> 02:06:46.890
<v Speaker 2>each other and very strange way.</v>

4619
02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:48.930
<v Speaker 2>Don't eat octopus.</v>

4620
02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:50.580
<v Speaker 2>They have more genes than you.</v>

4621
02:06:50.581 --> 02:06:50.721
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

4622
02:06:50.721 --> 02:06:51.161
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

4623
02:06:51.161 --> 02:06:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Nice on the Guardian.</v>

4624
02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

4625
02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:53.470
<v Speaker 2>Taste delicious.</v>

4626
02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:53.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4627
02:06:53.700 --> 02:06:53.810
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4628
02:06:53.810 --> 02:06:54.510
<v Speaker 2>Not to eat.</v>

4629
02:06:54.510 --> 02:06:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Apparently much friends,</v>

4630
02:06:55.650 --> 02:06:56.041
<v Speaker 2>plants,</v>

4631
02:06:56.041 --> 02:06:56.851
<v Speaker 2>we have those chickens.</v>

4632
02:06:56.851 --> 02:06:57.550
<v Speaker 2>His friends.</v>

4633
02:06:57.550 --> 02:07:01.650
<v Speaker 2>I'd like octopuses friends plants react and don't show it,</v>

4634
02:07:01.660 --> 02:07:05.070
<v Speaker 2>but the same way they do calculations.</v>

4635
02:07:05.070 --> 02:07:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's weird about plants.</v>

4636
02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:09.390
<v Speaker 2>They do calculations and they communicate with each other than it's weird way.</v>

4637
02:07:09.391 --> 02:07:09.511
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4638
02:07:09.511 --> 02:07:10.650
<v Speaker 2>here's a perfect example.</v>

4639
02:07:10.770 --> 02:07:11.730
<v Speaker 2>And acacia tree,</v>

4640
02:07:11.970 --> 02:07:14.370
<v Speaker 2>if an Acacia tree is upwind or uh,</v>

4641
02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:14.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4642
02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:15.091
<v Speaker 2>it's up.</v>

4643
02:07:15.091 --> 02:07:16.260
<v Speaker 2>When the animals eat it,</v>

4644
02:07:16.261 --> 02:07:17.310
<v Speaker 2>like a giraffe eats it,</v>

4645
02:07:17.490 --> 02:07:20.070
<v Speaker 2>the wind goes down and the wind goes down,</v>

4646
02:07:20.071 --> 02:07:20.881
<v Speaker 2>hits the other case,</v>

4647
02:07:20.881 --> 02:07:21.271
<v Speaker 2>you trees.</v>

4648
02:07:21.271 --> 02:07:22.950
<v Speaker 2>And they changed the way they taste.</v>

4649
02:07:23.190 --> 02:07:24.420
<v Speaker 2>What they become bitter.</v>

4650
02:07:24.570 --> 02:07:28.470
<v Speaker 2>We fact there's a problem with animals that are downwind of a constant breeds</v>

4651
02:07:28.471 --> 02:07:31.830
<v Speaker 2>where they literally could starve to death because they won't eat their</v>

4652
02:07:31.831 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 2>preferred food because it tastes bad or reason to those plants up.</v>

4653
02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:36.880
<v Speaker 5>How about that?</v>

4654
02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:37.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4655
02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:38.253
<v Speaker 5>How about that?</v>

4656
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:42.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird communication going on also with the ground itself because we look</v>

4657
02:07:42.631 --> 02:07:43.980
<v Speaker 2>at the ground as being just dirt,</v>

4658
02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:45.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

4659
02:07:45.390 --> 02:07:47.030
<v Speaker 2>It's full of arts and ecosystems.</v>

4660
02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:50.010
<v Speaker 2>It's filled with all sorts of different things and most importantly it's,</v>

4661
02:07:50.011 --> 02:07:51.030
<v Speaker 2>here's a big factor,</v>

4662
02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:54.240
<v Speaker 2>decomposing plant and animal material,</v>

4663
02:07:54.390 --> 02:07:56.970
<v Speaker 2>which gets absorbed into the ground.</v>

4664
02:07:57.330 --> 02:07:59.160
<v Speaker 2>Like when you eat plant food,</v>

4665
02:07:59.250 --> 02:08:02.980
<v Speaker 2>when you plant like vegetables and then you have to add soy,</v>

4666
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:04.680
<v Speaker 2>you have to add minerals to the soil,</v>

4667
02:08:04.860 --> 02:08:07.020
<v Speaker 2>you have to add fertilizer to the soil.</v>

4668
02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4669
02:08:07.380 --> 02:08:09.030
<v Speaker 2>For most lance,</v>

4670
02:08:09.031 --> 02:08:10.920
<v Speaker 2>because we've depleted the minerals in the soil,</v>

4671
02:08:11.070 --> 02:08:12.090
<v Speaker 2>but when you go to the woods,</v>

4672
02:08:12.091 --> 02:08:13.260
<v Speaker 2>no one's adding shit.</v>

4673
02:08:13.530 --> 02:08:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4674
02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:18.300
<v Speaker 2>What's happening is things are decomposing the recycling animals are decomposing</v>

4675
02:08:18.301 --> 02:08:21.720
<v Speaker 2>bodies or all sorts of things that are left behind are composing.</v>

4676
02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:22.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4677
02:08:22.321 --> 02:08:22.711
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

4678
02:08:22.711 --> 02:08:24.270
<v Speaker 2>it's legitimately what it is.</v>

4679
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:27.390
<v Speaker 2>And plants need that as much as they need water.</v>

4680
02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:29.700
<v Speaker 2>There's like this constant thing going on.</v>

4681
02:08:29.850 --> 02:08:32.940
<v Speaker 2>So without animal life and animal life dying,</v>

4682
02:08:32.970 --> 02:08:37.920
<v Speaker 2>these plants are not going to exist like this day and their existing eating this</v>

4683
02:08:37.921 --> 02:08:42.921
<v Speaker 2>weird fucking ground and then water and then they're breathing in oxygen and</v>

4684
02:08:43.231 --> 02:08:46.230
<v Speaker 2>spitting or breathing in carbon dioxide and spitting out oxygen.</v>

4685
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:48.060
<v Speaker 5>How about some Venus fly trap?</v>

4686
02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:48.810
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

4687
02:08:48.810 --> 02:08:49.530
<v Speaker 5>The things,</v>

4688
02:08:49.530 --> 02:08:49.981
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

4689
02:08:49.981 --> 02:08:50.814
<v Speaker 5>that's a plant.</v>

4690
02:08:50.910 --> 02:08:51.540
<v Speaker 5>How about,</v>

4691
02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:53.340
<v Speaker 5>how about the one in the Amazon eats rats.</v>

4692
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:57.260
<v Speaker 5>God does a plant that plant that each rock off.</v>

4693
02:08:57.690 --> 02:08:58.523
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

4694
02:08:59.250 --> 02:09:00.083
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

4695
02:09:00.090 --> 02:09:00.820
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

4696
02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:01.470
<v Speaker 5>Jamie.</v>

4697
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:02.820
<v Speaker 5>We played this a dozen times.</v>

4698
02:09:02.940 --> 02:09:07.370
<v Speaker 5>There's a fucking plant in the Amazon that honey Dick's rat on a out to fall</v>

4699
02:09:07.371 --> 02:09:09.780
<v Speaker 5>inside of it and it closes up on it.</v>

4700
02:09:09.781 --> 02:09:10.980
<v Speaker 5>It's this fat crazy.</v>

4701
02:09:11.010 --> 02:09:11.640
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>

4702
02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:12.473
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>

4703
02:09:13.590 --> 02:09:14.530
<v Speaker 5>Just sweat this.</v>

4704
02:09:14.531 --> 02:09:15.750
<v Speaker 5>Sweat this whole watch.</v>

4705
02:09:15.751 --> 02:09:16.350
<v Speaker 5>What happens.</v>

4706
02:09:16.350 --> 02:09:16.681
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4707
02:09:16.681 --> 02:09:17.514
<v Speaker 5>that's a wrap.</v>

4708
02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:18.390
<v Speaker 5>Sweden there.</v>

4709
02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:19.681
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

4710
02:09:19.681 --> 02:09:22.230
<v Speaker 5>It's sweet and it's slippery.</v>

4711
02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:26.730
<v Speaker 5>And this mouses Foxville now that mouse is not getting out.</v>

4712
02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:27.593
<v Speaker 5>Never.</v>

4713
02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:28.381
<v Speaker 5>They get eaten.</v>

4714
02:09:28.381 --> 02:09:29.490
<v Speaker 5>Well that's a Venus fly trap.</v>

4715
02:09:29.790 --> 02:09:33.200

4735
02:10:11.521 --> 02:10:12.510
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird photo.</v>

02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:12.871
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

4738
02:10:13.291 --> 02:10:15.030
<v Speaker 5>The rat is stuck in there and he's like,</v>

4739
02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:16.140
<v Speaker 5>Oh snap.</v>

4740
02:10:16.141 --> 02:10:16.920
<v Speaker 5>It's over.</v>

4741
02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:17.930
<v Speaker 5>That's a little rat.</v>

4742
02:10:21.530 --> 02:10:22.363
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

4743
02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:25.650
<v Speaker 5>Why the fuck is the plant eating rats though?</v>

4744
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.823
<v Speaker 5>Because</v>

4745
02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:28.590
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

4746
02:10:28.590 --> 02:10:29.700
<v Speaker 5>he gets nutrients from it.</v>

4747
02:10:29.701 --> 02:10:30.451
<v Speaker 5>The same way it gets.</v>

4748
02:10:30.451 --> 02:10:34.220
<v Speaker 5>Nutrients are decomposing plainly grab animal matter gets into the ground.</v>

4749
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:35.203
<v Speaker 2>Fucking plan.</v>

4750
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.991
<v Speaker 2>What I was going to say,</v>

4751
02:10:35.991 --> 02:10:39.950
<v Speaker 2>it's all of the fertilizer that we use today,</v>

4752
02:10:40.010 --> 02:10:43.250
<v Speaker 2>either as it as it has to have nitrogen in it cause that's like one of the key</v>

4753
02:10:43.251 --> 02:10:44.084
<v Speaker 2>components,</v>

4754
02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:45.530
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of like what it is like,</v>

4755
02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:47.210
<v Speaker 2>especially when people make compost,</v>

4756
02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:48.530
<v Speaker 2>that's like the best.</v>

4757
02:10:48.710 --> 02:10:53.480
<v Speaker 2>When people throw their food waste in and then they throw worms and leaves and</v>

4758
02:10:53.481 --> 02:10:54.950
<v Speaker 2>everything sort of decomposes.</v>

4759
02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:55.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4760
02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:56.001
<v Speaker 2>that's stuff.</v>

4761
02:10:56.001 --> 02:10:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Decomposes it and you can use that in your garden and that's like one of the</v>

4762
02:10:58.521 --> 02:11:01.370
<v Speaker 2>best ways of sort of replenishing nutrients in the soil.</v>

4763
02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:04.190
<v Speaker 2>You do that shit when you're hanging out with a chick stories.</v>

4764
02:11:04.191 --> 02:11:04.730
<v Speaker 2>There's one.</v>

4765
02:11:04.730 --> 02:11:05.121
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4766
02:11:05.121 --> 02:11:05.990
<v Speaker 2>I compost.</v>

4767
02:11:05.991 --> 02:11:06.824
<v Speaker 2>I grow.</v>

4768
02:11:07.190 --> 02:11:08.990
<v Speaker 2>I grow vegetables in the hangout with chickens,</v>

4769
02:11:10.190 --> 02:11:11.240
<v Speaker 2>but it makes me happy.</v>

4770
02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:12.453
<v Speaker 2>Makes me happy.</v>

4771
02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:13.430
<v Speaker 2>When I eat a salad,</v>

4772
02:11:13.431 --> 02:11:15.950
<v Speaker 2>when I eat like a some tomatoes that I grew,</v>

4773
02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:16.933
<v Speaker 2>it makes me happy,</v>

4774
02:11:17.410 --> 02:11:18.380
<v Speaker 2>so it makes me feel good.</v>

4775
02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:19.933
<v Speaker 2>It feels good.</v>

4776
02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:20.580
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

4777
02:11:20.580 --> 02:11:21.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird way.</v>

4778
02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:21.891
<v Speaker 2>It's cool,</v>

4779
02:11:21.891 --> 02:11:22.540
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4780
02:11:22.540 --> 02:11:23.630
<v Speaker 2>The patient makes me feel good.</v>

4781
02:11:23.631 --> 02:11:24.464
<v Speaker 2>It's a fun.</v>

4782
02:11:27.950 --> 02:11:30.110
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things that I think a is like,</v>

4783
02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:31.700
<v Speaker 2>have you ever caught fish before?</v>

4784
02:11:31.780 --> 02:11:32.340
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4785
02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:33.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4786
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:34.670
<v Speaker 2>When you catch a fish,</v>

4787
02:11:34.970 --> 02:11:35.803
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

4788
02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:36.793
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

4789
02:11:36.860 --> 02:11:37.760
<v Speaker 2>You get excited.</v>

4790
02:11:37.761 --> 02:11:38.481
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>

4791
02:11:38.481 --> 02:11:40.830
<v Speaker 2>There's also a similar reaction to people that are,</v>

4792
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:44.150
<v Speaker 2>if you're a a a bug collector,</v>

4793
02:11:44.151 --> 02:11:45.960
<v Speaker 2>like a moth collector,</v>

4794
02:11:45.961 --> 02:11:46.611
<v Speaker 2>or not my friend,</v>

4796
02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:50.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any friends that do that.</v>

4797
02:11:50.211 --> 02:11:54.830
<v Speaker 2>There's something because human beings for a long period of time where</v>

4798
02:11:54.831 --> 02:11:57.470
<v Speaker 2>apparently insectivores Rick story won that fight.</v>

4799
02:11:58.490 --> 02:11:59.230
<v Speaker 2>A bear.</v>

4800
02:11:59.230 --> 02:12:00.080
<v Speaker 2>That's outrageous.</v>

4801
02:12:00.890 --> 02:12:01.723
<v Speaker 2>We do that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

4818
02:12:22.620 --> 02:12:25.220
<v Speaker 2>We were brainwashed to believe that we're herbivores.</v>

4819
02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:25.641
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

02:12:27.111 --> 02:12:28.790
<v Speaker 2>but when they get a chance to eat checks,</v>

4827
02:12:36.050 --> 02:12:37.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a little ground graphs.</v>

4828
02:12:37.730 --> 02:12:38.451
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy,</v>

4829
02:12:38.451 --> 02:12:39.284
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

4830
02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:40.170
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you find that?</v>

4831
02:12:41.450 --> 02:12:42.380
<v Speaker 2>I forget where I saw it,</v>

4832
02:12:42.381 --> 02:12:43.520
<v Speaker 2>but I just makes me sick.</v>

4833
02:12:43.550 --> 02:12:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

4834
02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen deer chase birds and eat them?</v>

4835
02:12:46.730 --> 02:12:47.630
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

4836
02:12:47.631 --> 02:12:48.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4839
02:12:48.990 --> 02:12:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Deer eat birds regularly.</v>

4840
02:12:50.930 --> 02:12:51.501
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

4841
02:12:51.501 --> 02:12:53.870
<v Speaker 2>there is a fence that was put up and uh,</v>

4842
02:12:53.871 --> 02:12:55.010
<v Speaker 2>it was one of these weird,</v>

4843
02:12:55.011 --> 02:13:00.011
<v Speaker 2>a nettings and a bird's got stuck in the netting and deer were eating the birds</v>

4844
02:13:00.741 --> 02:13:01.610
<v Speaker 2>out of the netting.</v>

4845
02:13:01.611 --> 02:13:03.910
<v Speaker 2>Some evil as dare the Burgess.</v>

4846
02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:07.610
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't differentiate between the whole and the string.</v>

4847
02:13:07.611 --> 02:13:09.680
<v Speaker 2>And they ran right into it and got stuck on it.</v>

4848
02:13:09.681 --> 02:13:10.250
<v Speaker 2>And the birds,</v>

4849
02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:12.740
<v Speaker 2>the deer just aid them and they just needed the protein or something.</v>

4850
02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:14.270
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a fuck about birds.</v>

4851
02:13:14.271 --> 02:13:15.230
<v Speaker 2>That's what's really going on.</v>

4852
02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:16.220
<v Speaker 2>They're not Bambi.</v>

4853

02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:22.340
<v Speaker 2>In Disney's fucked our brains for the time we were babies.</v>

<v Speaker 2>everyday friends.</v>

02:14:27.110 --> 02:14:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4913
02:14:27.310 --> 02:14:28.050
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

4914
02:14:28.050 --> 02:14:28.411
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4915
02:14:28.411 --> 02:14:29.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4916
02:14:29.130 --> 02:14:31.530
<v Speaker 2>this camp that we would go to in Alberta,</v>

4917
02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:33.330
<v Speaker 2>my friend John and Jen Rivet,</v>

4918
02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:37.680
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking awesome human beings and it places amazing and they have GI and</v>

4919
02:14:38.010 --> 02:14:39.360
<v Speaker 2>what kind of beers and here's the thing.</v>

4920
02:14:39.950 --> 02:14:40.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4921
02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:41.310
<v Speaker 2>but black bears and they,</v>

4922
02:14:41.311 --> 02:14:42.510
<v Speaker 2>there's grizzlies up there too.</v>

4923
02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:43.680
<v Speaker 2>I saw a Grizzly,</v>

4924
02:14:43.890 --> 02:14:44.611
<v Speaker 2>I saw a Grizzly,</v>

4925
02:14:44.611 --> 02:14:45.780
<v Speaker 2>not where we were hunting,</v>

4926
02:14:45.781 --> 02:14:46.500
<v Speaker 2>but near it,</v>

4927
02:14:46.500 --> 02:14:46.801
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

4928
02:14:46.801 --> 02:14:48.030
<v Speaker 2>on the weight I saw links.</v>

4929
02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:48.810
<v Speaker 2>I saw many,</v>

4930
02:14:48.810 --> 02:14:49.591
<v Speaker 2>many Moose.</v>

4931
02:14:49.591 --> 02:14:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Mule deer all kill you,</v>

4932
02:14:50.971 --> 02:14:51.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4933
02:14:51.450 --> 02:14:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4934
02:14:51.810 --> 02:14:52.643
<v Speaker 2>So I'm in,</v>

4935
02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:57.480
<v Speaker 2>well you got to do them during certain times when we're in the bear time.</v>

4936
02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:58.890
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing about bears,</v>

4937
02:14:59.130 --> 02:15:02.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like it actually does help the population because they eat babies,</v>

4938
02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:03.630
<v Speaker 2>they eat cubs.</v>

4939
02:15:03.940 --> 02:15:06.030
<v Speaker 2>If you kill the big boars,</v>

4940
02:15:06.031 --> 02:15:07.390
<v Speaker 2>it actually is good for the popular.</v>

4941
02:15:07.390 --> 02:15:09.530
<v Speaker 2>So I need to hear it sounds counter intuitive.</v>

4942
02:15:09.690 --> 02:15:10.450
<v Speaker 2>That's all we need.</v>

4943
02:15:10.450 --> 02:15:12.030
<v Speaker 2>As long as I have a reason that I'll do it,</v>

4944
02:15:12.031 --> 02:15:14.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing conservation as well.</v>

4945
02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:14.680
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

4946
02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:14.901
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4947
02:15:14.901 --> 02:15:15.140
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4948
02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:15.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4949
02:15:15.570 --> 02:15:17.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a side effect of hunting.</v>

4950
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:21.000
<v Speaker 2>But here's one thing that my friend Ben O'brian pointed this out this weekend.</v>

4951
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:22.470
<v Speaker 2>He's a good buddy of mine.</v>

4952
02:15:22.471 --> 02:15:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I used to write for a Peterson's,</v>

4953
02:15:23.951 --> 02:15:24.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4954
02:15:24.270 --> 02:15:25.110
<v Speaker 2>hunting magazine.</v>

4955
02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:27.570
<v Speaker 2>He's a super intelligent guy and he came hunting with us.</v>

4956
02:15:27.990 --> 02:15:31.280
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that he said is it like honey as a con.</v>

4957
02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Conservation is a side effect of hunting.</v>

4958
02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:34.860
<v Speaker 2>And until we're honest about that,</v>

4959
02:15:34.861 --> 02:15:38.670
<v Speaker 2>people are going to always have this argument against us or against people that</v>

4960
02:15:38.671 --> 02:15:41.730
<v Speaker 2>hunt because like people like to say that hunting is conservation.</v>

4961
02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:42.690
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

4962
02:15:42.690 --> 02:15:44.130
<v Speaker 2>but it's a side effect of honey.</v>

4963
02:15:44.131 --> 02:15:44.381
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

4964
02:15:44.381 --> 02:15:46.080
<v Speaker 2>you really want to hunt because you want meat.</v>

4965
02:15:46.140 --> 02:15:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4966
02:15:46.370 --> 02:15:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Not trying.</v>

4967
02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4968
02:15:47.610 --> 02:15:50.130
<v Speaker 2>but then there's people that don't and they don't really even really want me.</v>

4969
02:15:50.131 --> 02:15:52.050
<v Speaker 2>I knew a dude who used to hunt all the time.</v>

4970
02:15:52.051 --> 02:15:55.340
<v Speaker 2>He hated wild game and he hunted concerts to kill beef.</v>

4971
02:15:55.410 --> 02:15:56.243
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>

4972
02:15:56.460 --> 02:15:57.150
<v Speaker 2>he likes to kill.</v>

4973
02:15:57.150 --> 02:15:57.840
<v Speaker 2>He enjoyed,</v>

4974
02:15:57.840 --> 02:15:58.673
<v Speaker 2>he didn't,</v>

4975
02:15:58.740 --> 02:16:00.300
<v Speaker 2>he was a real problem dude.</v>

4976
02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:00.990
<v Speaker 2>He had a,</v>

4977
02:16:00.990 --> 02:16:01.470
<v Speaker 2>he's got,</v>

4978
02:16:01.470 --> 02:16:02.310
<v Speaker 2>he's got other,</v>

4979
02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:03.960
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about hunting horses.</v>

4980
02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:05.611
<v Speaker 2>There's something about hunting.</v>

4981
02:16:05.611 --> 02:16:09.300
<v Speaker 2>When you wake up in the middle of nowhere and you're walking through like in</v>

4982
02:16:09.301 --> 02:16:10.134
<v Speaker 2>Alaska,</v>

4983
02:16:10.230 --> 02:16:14.700
<v Speaker 2>there is something very primordial and very interesting about like not knowing</v>

4984
02:16:14.701 --> 02:16:16.320
<v Speaker 2>what you're going to see around the next corner.</v>

4985
02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:16.651
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4986
02:16:16.651 --> 02:16:17.191
<v Speaker 2>when you and I,</v>

4987
02:16:17.191 --> 02:16:17.820
<v Speaker 2>we did that.</v>

4988
02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:19.710
<v Speaker 2>That island in Alaska is one of my,</v>

4989
02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:24.650
<v Speaker 2>two of my favorite times as a human being is when we were in Montana and when we</v>

4990
02:16:24.651 --> 02:16:26.880
<v Speaker 2>were in Alaska and we laughed.</v>

4991
02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:29.470
<v Speaker 2>So fucking hot and miserable.</v>

4992
02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4993
02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:30.573
<v Speaker 2>Kill anything.</v>

4994
02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:31.061
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4995
02:16:31.061 --> 02:16:31.894
<v Speaker 2>we did.</v>

4996
02:16:32.110 --> 02:16:32.831
<v Speaker 2>We both did,</v>

4997
02:16:32.831 --> 02:16:34.510
<v Speaker 2>but in Alaska and neither one of us did.</v>

4998
02:16:34.570 --> 02:16:34.811
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

4999
02:16:34.811 --> 02:16:36.100
<v Speaker 2>how long would the bear humpy?</v>

5000
02:16:36.450 --> 02:16:36.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5001
02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:37.870
<v Speaker 2>the bear on I just did,</v>

5002
02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:39.400
<v Speaker 2>but was three days of hunting.</v>

5003
02:16:39.430 --> 02:16:41.380
<v Speaker 2>I can do one day of travel on each end,</v>

5004
02:16:41.381 --> 02:16:44.740
<v Speaker 2>so it was a five day hunt and I was unsuccessful with my friend Cameron Hanes.</v>

5005
02:16:44.741 --> 02:16:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Shout,</v>

5006
02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:46.330
<v Speaker 2>a seven foot eight bear.</v>

5007
02:16:46.650 --> 02:16:47.600
<v Speaker 2>Take telling you guys about it.</v>

5008
02:16:48.330 --> 02:16:49.540
<v Speaker 2>We ate that bear by the way,</v>

5009
02:16:49.570 --> 02:16:50.610
<v Speaker 2>and it's fucking delicious.</v>

5010
02:16:50.611 --> 02:16:52.450
<v Speaker 2>What about the rug and you going to make a rug from home?</v>

5011
02:16:52.451 --> 02:16:54.630
<v Speaker 2>We're going to use every aspect for the rug.</v>

5012
02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:54.821
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5013
02:16:54.821 --> 02:16:54.971
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5014
02:16:54.971 --> 02:16:56.650
<v Speaker 2>We'll use every aspect of the bear,</v>

5015
02:16:57.130 --> 02:16:59.050
<v Speaker 2>but the thing about bears is they do two things.</v>

5016
02:16:59.051 --> 02:16:59.411
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

5017
02:16:59.411 --> 02:17:01.240
<v Speaker 2>they eat cubs like all of them,</v>

5018
02:17:01.241 --> 02:17:02.480
<v Speaker 2>100% of them mechanical.</v>

5019
02:17:02.550 --> 02:17:04.140
<v Speaker 2>That's all I needed to hit all come out.</v>

5020
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Not only they come out of hibernation,</v>

5021
02:17:05.531 --> 02:17:06.460
<v Speaker 2>they come into hibernation.</v>

5022
02:17:06.461 --> 02:17:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Looking to get a cub stone cold cause cubs are easy.</v>

5023
02:17:09.761 --> 02:17:12.970
<v Speaker 2>So they go into dance because the females tend to sleep laters in the later than</v>

5024
02:17:12.971 --> 02:17:13.804
<v Speaker 2>the males.</v>

5025
02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:16.810
<v Speaker 2>And it's something that's set up because nature knows they don't have any</v>

5026
02:17:16.811 --> 02:17:17.310
<v Speaker 2>predator.</v>

5027
02:17:17.310 --> 02:17:22.090
<v Speaker 2>This is nature's or like a complex but really efficient system and nature</v>

5028
02:17:22.091 --> 02:17:24.160
<v Speaker 2>realize that there's these things are bears.</v>

5029
02:17:24.310 --> 02:17:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Nothing can fuck with them other than them.</v>

5030
02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:31.000
<v Speaker 2>So what it did is it made the men cannibals where it's very different from</v>

5031
02:17:31.001 --> 02:17:31.630
<v Speaker 2>wolves.</v>

5032
02:17:31.630 --> 02:17:32.500
<v Speaker 2>See Wolves.</v>

5033
02:17:32.860 --> 02:17:33.280
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>

5034
02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:36.120
<v Speaker 2>a wolf could have a battle and get killed by a mountain lions.</v>

5035
02:17:36.121 --> 02:17:38.560
<v Speaker 2>There's videos online of wolves getting killed by a mountain lion.</v>

5036
02:17:38.561 --> 02:17:42.370
<v Speaker 2>A really recent one that Jamie and I played the other day of a mountain lion</v>

5037
02:17:42.371 --> 02:17:44.830
<v Speaker 2>killing a [inaudible] where the guy that was light on it mount.</v>

5038
02:17:44.831 --> 02:17:45.101
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

5039
02:17:45.101 --> 02:17:45.581
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

5040
02:17:45.581 --> 02:17:46.090
<v Speaker 2>You've seen it.</v>

5041
02:17:46.090 --> 02:17:46.810
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

5042
02:17:46.810 --> 02:17:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Mountain lions are just way more gangster than wolves.</v>

5043
02:17:49.090 --> 02:17:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Wolves can suck mountain lines.</v>

5044
02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:55.500
<v Speaker 2>Dick was a mountain lion is like Kevin Randleman is prime and a wolf is like a</v>

5045
02:17:57.251 --> 02:17:59.320
<v Speaker 2>14 year old girl in a fucking mic.</v>

5046
02:17:59.321 --> 02:18:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Dojo karate class.</v>

5047
02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:07.570
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite analogy of all time.</v>

5048
02:18:07.780 --> 02:18:09.760
<v Speaker 2>But there's a mountain lion eating a wolf.</v>

5049
02:18:09.790 --> 02:18:12.040
<v Speaker 2>He's just killing a wolf would his fucking face.</v>

5050
02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:12.461
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5051
02:18:12.461 --> 02:18:15.850
<v Speaker 2>cats are just as the cats are as gangster gangsters.</v>

5052
02:18:15.851 --> 02:18:17.020
<v Speaker 2>Any animal that's ever lived,</v>

5053
02:18:17.050 --> 02:18:18.820
<v Speaker 2>they kill crocodiles in the Amazon.</v>

5054
02:18:18.850 --> 02:18:19.683
<v Speaker 2>The tiger killed.</v>

5055
02:18:20.250 --> 02:18:21.110
<v Speaker 2>But surely you've seen.</v>

5056
02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:23.200
<v Speaker 2>But if you surely seen these,</v>

5057
02:18:23.201 --> 02:18:24.940
<v Speaker 2>a jaguars killed crocodiles.</v>

5058
02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:26.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5059
02:18:26.050 --> 02:18:27.550
<v Speaker 2>I've only seen any top tiger.</v>

5060
02:18:27.551 --> 02:18:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Do it please.</v>

5061
02:18:28.910 --> 02:18:30.200
<v Speaker 2>Jack Joe Jaguar,</v>

5062
02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Haman in the,</v>

5063
02:18:33.890 --> 02:18:35.650
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of love for this face.</v>

5064
02:18:36.250 --> 02:18:37.880
<v Speaker 2>Cats are so gangster.</v>

5065
02:18:37.881 --> 02:18:40.000
<v Speaker 2>No fucking around moving.</v>

5066
02:18:40.001 --> 02:18:41.050
<v Speaker 2>He's not freaking out.</v>

5067
02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:42.130
<v Speaker 2>He's barely breathing.</v>

5068
02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:43.900
<v Speaker 2>He's just slowly killing that wall,</v>

5069
02:18:43.930 --> 02:18:44.411
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

5070
02:18:44.411 --> 02:18:44.591
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>

5071
02:18:44.591 --> 02:18:45.424

02:18:46.390 --> 02:18:47.620
<v Speaker 2>the Puma Puma.</v>

5073
02:18:47.621 --> 02:18:48.454
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you're looking at.</v>

5074
02:18:48.670 --> 02:18:51.880
<v Speaker 2>The Boma is considered the most athletic of all cats.</v>

5075
02:18:51.881 --> 02:18:52.181
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

5076
02:18:52.181 --> 02:18:52.870
<v Speaker 2>you're correct.</v>

5077
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:53.770
<v Speaker 2>So a house cat,</v>

5078
02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:54.251
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

5079
02:18:54.251 --> 02:18:57.580
<v Speaker 2>they say if a house cat was as big as a house cat and be running shit,</v>

5080
02:18:57.581 --> 02:18:57.820
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

5081
02:18:57.820 --> 02:18:59.590
<v Speaker 2>It'd be neat to not a cat guy.</v>

5082
02:18:59.591 --> 02:18:59.861

5093
02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:13.993

5124
02:20:00.370 --> 02:20:03.620
<v Speaker 2>I look at it through the water.</v>

5125

<v Speaker 2>we can't show this house.</v>

5127

<v Speaker 2>They just swims across the God damn ready.</v>

5131
02:20:21.350 --> 02:20:23.330
<v Speaker 2>If you got a 10 year old boy in a headlock,</v>

5132
02:20:23.331 --> 02:20:25.090
<v Speaker 2>do you think you'd be worried about swimming with them?</v>

5133
02:20:27.050 --> 02:20:28.130
<v Speaker 2>It could be a problem.</v>

5134
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:29.900
<v Speaker 2>That can be a problem,</v>

5135
02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:33.640
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

5136

02:20:36.050 --> 02:20:36.950
<v Speaker 2>super gangs.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I ask or do that.</v>

5140
02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:40.730
<v Speaker 2>So with bears,</v>

5141
02:20:40.820 --> 02:20:42.530
<v Speaker 2>because they don't have natural predators,</v>

5142
02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:44.330
<v Speaker 2>they've nature is developed this,</v>

5143
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:45.890
<v Speaker 2>this really dark,</v>

5144
02:20:45.891 --> 02:20:48.040
<v Speaker 2>dark system where the males eat,</v>

5146
02:20:48.890 --> 02:20:53.890
<v Speaker 2>so the struggle is constantly the males try and eat other babies in order to</v>

5147
02:20:54.021 --> 02:20:55.020
<v Speaker 2>bring the woman back,</v>

5148
02:20:55.050 --> 02:20:58.760
<v Speaker 2>the female parents back into estrous so he can meet with her and pass on his own</v>

5149
02:20:58.761 --> 02:20:59.510
<v Speaker 2>genetics.</v>

5150
02:20:59.510 --> 02:21:04.190
<v Speaker 2>And just the fact that it's hard to come by protein because they run fairly</v>

5151
02:21:04.191 --> 02:21:04.611
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>

5152
02:21:04.611 --> 02:21:06.290
<v Speaker 2>but they don't run as quick as deer.</v>

5153
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:11.090
<v Speaker 2>So the only deer they get to eat realistically or the babies or the injured</v>

5154
02:21:11.091 --> 02:21:11.924
<v Speaker 2>ones,</v>

5155
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:13.070
<v Speaker 2>mostly Fonz.</v>

5156
02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:18.160
<v Speaker 2>So they say that bear in Alberta eat 50% of all moose calves and deer.</v>

5157
02:21:19.731 --> 02:21:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Fox got to kill him when we were,</v>

5158
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:23.300
<v Speaker 2>when we were in a Alaska,</v>

5159
02:21:23.301 --> 02:21:27.980
<v Speaker 2>we saw a female bear with her cub and I came out with what yon?</v>

5160
02:21:27.981 --> 02:21:28.814
<v Speaker 2>What was his name?</v>

5161
02:21:29.210 --> 02:21:30.043
<v Speaker 2>You tell us.</v>

5162
02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Said that probably what was going on with she was keeping him in the highlands.</v>

5163
02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Is Her,</v>

5164
02:21:35.350 --> 02:21:36.870
<v Speaker 2>her baby away from the males?</v>

5165
02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5166
02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:42.110
<v Speaker 2>because she was keeping them up high way too late in the season just to try to</v>

5167
02:21:42.111 --> 02:21:45.760
<v Speaker 2>protect his life because the males eat them and then you say mother nature's a</v>

5168
02:21:45.761 --> 02:21:46.260
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>

5169
02:21:46.260 --> 02:21:47.120
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're saying,</v>

5170
02:21:47.140 --> 02:21:48.650
<v Speaker 2>mother nature a fucker.</v>

5171
02:21:49.490 --> 02:21:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5172
02:21:49.940 --> 02:21:51.950
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying is that people who love animals,</v>

5173
02:21:51.951 --> 02:21:53.390
<v Speaker 2>the sentiment is beautiful,</v>

5174
02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:54.440
<v Speaker 2>but when you,</v>

5175
02:21:55.220 --> 02:22:00.220
<v Speaker 2>when you really try to let all your predisposed or your preconceived notions or</v>

5176
02:22:02.391 --> 02:22:03.320
<v Speaker 2>morphic this,</v>

5177
02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:05.960
<v Speaker 2>then there's a little of that putting given the us.</v>

5178
02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:07.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not just anthropomorphic,</v>

5179
02:22:07.941 --> 02:22:11.360
<v Speaker 2>it's also even little love of actual animals that are in your environment that</v>

5180
02:22:11.361 --> 02:22:16.361
<v Speaker 2>are not trying to eat you like squirrels and birds and dogs and cats and pets</v>

5181
02:22:17.091 --> 02:22:18.110
<v Speaker 2>that you and I both have,</v>

5182
02:22:18.111 --> 02:22:18.944
<v Speaker 2>we both love,</v>

5183
02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:22.790
<v Speaker 2>but there's a big goddamn difference between all of those things.</v>

5184
02:22:22.970 --> 02:22:24.110
<v Speaker 2>And then the wild itself,</v>

5185
02:22:24.111 --> 02:22:25.530
<v Speaker 2>which is this weird system.</v>

5186
02:22:25.620 --> 02:22:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5187
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:27.390
<v Speaker 2>and it's weird system.</v>

5188
02:22:27.391 --> 02:22:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Wildlife Biologists have studied this weird system over decades and they've</v>

5189
02:22:31.141 --> 02:22:36.141
<v Speaker 2>concluded that there's some benefit to removing certain dominant males from the</v>

5190
02:22:37.051 --> 02:22:37.620
<v Speaker 2>equation.</v>

5191
02:22:37.620 --> 02:22:38.670
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you hunt.</v>

5192
02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5193
02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:40.260
<v Speaker 2>And that's intended about Rhino,</v>

5194
02:22:40.261 --> 02:22:40.610
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5195
02:22:40.610 --> 02:22:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5196
02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:41.310
<v Speaker 2>What's it,</v>

5197
02:22:41.310 --> 02:22:45.030
<v Speaker 2>well that's one of the reasons why that Cory Knowlton guy got off the hook,</v>

5198
02:22:45.031 --> 02:22:45.950
<v Speaker 2>whereas the,</v>

5199
02:22:45.980 --> 02:22:46.431
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5200
02:22:46.431 --> 02:22:48.660
<v Speaker 2>the lion killer killer didn't.</v>

5201
02:22:48.661 --> 02:22:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5202
02:22:48.900 --> 02:22:49.290
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5203
02:22:49.290 --> 02:22:50.670
<v Speaker 2>They were going to kill that rhino anyway.</v>

5204
02:22:50.671 --> 02:22:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Cause that rhino was killing other male rhinos.</v>

5205
02:22:53.011 --> 02:22:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5206
02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:54.240
<v Speaker 2>So Corey,</v>

5207
02:22:54.390 --> 02:22:59.120
<v Speaker 2>in spending $250,000 plus two to bid on killing that rhino,</v>

5208
02:22:59.121 --> 02:23:03.270
<v Speaker 2>rhino fed like a hundred fucking families.</v>

5209
02:23:03.271 --> 02:23:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5210
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Not only did he feed a hundred families,</v>

5211
02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:09.870
<v Speaker 2>he gave $250,000 to conservation to protect the rhinos and killed a rhino.</v>

5212
02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:10.800
<v Speaker 2>They were going to have to kill it.</v>

5213
02:23:10.820 --> 02:23:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5214
02:23:11.070 --> 02:23:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Which helps out the rhinos.</v>

5215
02:23:12.330 --> 02:23:13.061
<v Speaker 2>It helps out the wrong,</v>

5216
02:23:13.061 --> 02:23:16.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's so complicated because you would think that if you love rhinos,</v>

5217
02:23:16.501 --> 02:23:19.290
<v Speaker 2>the last thing we'd want to some dude paying money to kill a rhino,</v>

5218
02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:19.801
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

5219
02:23:19.801 --> 02:23:20.634
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>

5220
02:23:20.850 --> 02:23:22.080
<v Speaker 2>That's just the education.</v>

5221
02:23:22.290 --> 02:23:25.470
<v Speaker 2>But when you say hunting takes out the big males that kill all these,</v>

5222
02:23:25.471 --> 02:23:26.250
<v Speaker 2>that's what you hunt.</v>

5223
02:23:26.250 --> 02:23:26.940
<v Speaker 2>How do,</v>

5224
02:23:26.940 --> 02:23:28.090
<v Speaker 2>how can you tell the difference?</v>

5225
02:23:28.091 --> 02:23:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Just size.</v>

5226
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:30.090
<v Speaker 2>That's what it 100%.</v>

5227
02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:31.800
<v Speaker 2>You tell by size.</v>

5228
02:23:31.801 --> 02:23:32.640
<v Speaker 2>I tell by smell.</v>

5229
02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5230
02:23:33.450 --> 02:23:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Brian is what's called game.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's what I say when I work.</v>

02:23:48.390 --> 02:23:48.751
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

02:23:48.751 --> 02:23:49.770
<v Speaker 2>I gotta be honest with you.</v>

02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:20.640
<v Speaker 2>The straight right guys keeping his head down and correct.</v>

5294
02:25:20.641 --> 02:25:23.130
<v Speaker 2>Hit behind the ear or not a good place.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Stevens.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

5297
02:25:27.850 --> 02:25:28.590
<v Speaker 2>It's not an auction,</v>

5298
02:25:28.590 --> 02:25:29.520
<v Speaker 2>but somebody started singing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hid behind the here.</v>

5302
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:34.030
<v Speaker 2>There's very few things going wrong.</v>

5303
02:25:34.090 --> 02:25:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm allowed to be obnoxious about it.</v>

5304
02:25:35.741 --> 02:25:36.371
<v Speaker 2>Other than calling.</v>

5310
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.983
<v Speaker 2>He got tagged.</v>

5311
02:25:47.230 --> 02:25:48.070

<v Speaker 2>Have we forgotten how good morale as well.</v>

5316
02:25:51.610 --> 02:25:52.630
<v Speaker 2>He was without a doubt,</v>

5317
02:25:52.631 --> 02:25:57.420
<v Speaker 2>one of the best in the world at one 35 and I think it's better for him at one 42</v>

5318
02:25:57.430 --> 02:25:58.600
<v Speaker 2>much of a piece for him to cut.</v>

5319
02:25:58.601 --> 02:26:00.020
<v Speaker 2>They said they said it always killed him.</v>

5320
02:26:00.050 --> 02:26:04.070
<v Speaker 2>So you know he might be a monster at 45 how about him verse all at four Oh five</v>

5321
02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:05.740
<v Speaker 2>all we know where he would never do.</v>

5322
02:26:05.741 --> 02:26:07.270
<v Speaker 2>They train them to be surprised.</v>

5323
02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:10.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them to,</v>

5324
02:26:10.570 --> 02:26:11.291
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them to,</v>

5325
02:26:11.291 --> 02:26:12.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't want friends to fight.</v>

5326
02:26:12.371 --> 02:26:13.204
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>

5327
02:26:13.630 --> 02:26:14.463
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>

5328
02:26:14.910 --> 02:26:16.000
<v Speaker 2>I'd be down for Tj,</v>

5329
02:26:16.001 --> 02:26:16.990
<v Speaker 2>like it's kind of fun.</v>

5330
02:26:17.050 --> 02:26:17.561
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5331
02:26:17.561 --> 02:26:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Barao with the take down.</v>

5332
02:26:19.010 --> 02:26:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's kind of fun that there's sacred things.</v>

5333
02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:24.250
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's kind of fun that some people just won't check.</v>

5334
02:26:24.251 --> 02:26:26.560
<v Speaker 2>She and those guys think it's fun though.</v>

5335
02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:28.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what they think I know,</v>

5336
02:26:28.930 --> 02:26:30.580
<v Speaker 2>but they make the match of stuff.</v>

5337
02:26:31.030 --> 02:26:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

5338
02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:33.400
<v Speaker 2>But my personal opinion,</v>

5339
02:26:33.401 --> 02:26:33.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5340
02:26:33.731 --> 02:26:34.091
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

5341
02:26:34.091 --> 02:26:34.531
<v Speaker 2>I call it,</v>

5342
02:26:34.531 --> 02:26:34.920
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

5343
02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:38.320
<v Speaker 2>I love every matchup I call every match up with with love.</v>

5344
02:26:38.350 --> 02:26:39.250
<v Speaker 2>I love them all,</v>

5345
02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:40.480
<v Speaker 2>but I don't personally,</v>

5346
02:26:40.481 --> 02:26:41.530
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of these guys,</v>

5347
02:26:41.531 --> 02:26:42.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to seen them fight there,</v>

5348
02:26:42.850 --> 02:26:43.690
<v Speaker 2>but if Hennen Browne,</v>

5349
02:26:43.691 --> 02:26:44.650
<v Speaker 2>all those fighting,</v>

5350
02:26:44.651 --> 02:26:45.261
<v Speaker 2>you got to call it,</v>

5351
02:26:45.261 --> 02:26:46.450
<v Speaker 2>you ain't shit in less.</v>

5352
02:26:46.450 --> 02:26:47.281
<v Speaker 2>This is what I want to say.</v>

5353
02:26:47.281 --> 02:26:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Unless they want to fight their friends and they think it's okay.</v>

5354
02:26:50.610 --> 02:26:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

5355
02:26:51.010 --> 02:26:51.240
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5356
02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:52.270
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Pena.</v>

5357
02:26:52.330 --> 02:26:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Julianna Pena is very close with Misha Tate.</v>

5358
02:26:54.701 --> 02:26:58.480
<v Speaker 2>And apparently Julianna Pena said I would fight her for the title and if she</v>

5359
02:26:58.481 --> 02:27:00.100
<v Speaker 2>wins her next fight and I expect her to win,</v>

5360
02:27:00.310 --> 02:27:01.240
<v Speaker 2>I'll fight it for the title.</v>

5361
02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:01.601
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5362
02:27:01.601 --> 02:27:02.200
<v Speaker 2>so you're cool.</v>

5363
02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:03.000
<v Speaker 2>And they're cool with it?</v>

5364
02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5365
02:27:03.350 --> 02:27:04.390
<v Speaker 2>because they're both cool with it.</v>

5366
02:27:04.391 --> 02:27:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they realize it's business that's life changing and they'll,</v>

5367
02:27:07.180 --> 02:27:09.760
<v Speaker 2>and they'll go back to being friends and being cool with each other.</v>

5368
02:27:11.110 --> 02:27:11.760
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5369
02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:13.360
<v Speaker 2>where's Tim Kennedy and why is he not fire?</v>

5370
02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:13.781
<v Speaker 2>Jim?</v>

5371
02:27:13.781 --> 02:27:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Tim Kennedy is still serving.</v>

5372
02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5373
02:27:15.940 --> 02:27:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Tim Kennedy is still involved in multiple things.</v>

5374
02:27:18.251 --> 02:27:19.510
<v Speaker 2>You can't talk about it,</v>

5375
02:27:19.511 --> 02:27:20.850
<v Speaker 2>but he's also trying to get a fight.</v>

5376
02:27:20.851 --> 02:27:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5377
02:27:21.170 --> 02:27:23.380
<v Speaker 2>And they haven't given him mad and he would take a fight again.</v>

5378
02:27:23.410 --> 02:27:24.310
<v Speaker 2>And you know there's,</v>

5379
02:27:24.370 --> 02:27:25.690
<v Speaker 2>there's a legit problem,</v>

5380
02:27:25.691 --> 02:27:26.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to start any noise,</v>

5381
02:27:26.741 --> 02:27:30.100
<v Speaker 2>but Tim Kennedy is a very vocal critic of all sorts of different things.</v>

5382
02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:31.233
<v Speaker 2>You listen,</v>

5383
02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Tim Kennedy is a legit war hero and you,</v>

5384
02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:35.490
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

5385
02:27:35.490 --> 02:27:39.360
<v Speaker 2>you can't get legit war heroes to play games now.</v>

5386
02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:40.820
<v Speaker 2>But also when they speak,</v>

5387
02:27:41.170 --> 02:27:41.820
<v Speaker 2>you speak,</v>

5388
02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:42.491
<v Speaker 2>it matters.</v>

5389
02:27:42.491 --> 02:27:42.941
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

5390
02:27:42.941 --> 02:27:43.270
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

5391
02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:44.350
<v Speaker 2>he's a critical thinker.</v>

5392
02:27:44.351 --> 02:27:44.951
<v Speaker 2>He's not a hater.</v>

5393
02:27:44.951 --> 02:27:45.940
<v Speaker 2>He's a critical thinker.</v>

5394
02:27:46.350 --> 02:27:47.183
<v Speaker 2>Nice level.</v>

5395
02:27:47.290 --> 02:27:47.830
<v Speaker 2>He is.</v>

5396
02:27:47.830 --> 02:27:48.663
<v Speaker 2>And at the,</v>

5397
02:27:48.670 --> 02:27:49.630
<v Speaker 2>at the highest level,</v>

5398
02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:50.110
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

5399
02:27:50.110 --> 02:27:50.801
<v Speaker 2>every sport,</v>

5400
02:27:50.801 --> 02:27:51.790
<v Speaker 2>every endeavor,</v>

5401
02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:53.950
<v Speaker 2>every application in your own,</v>

5402
02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:56.050
<v Speaker 2>your own creativity and your own ideals.</v>

5403
02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:59.500
<v Speaker 2>But whatever you're trying to pursue in this life should be done to the highest</v>

5404
02:27:59.501 --> 02:27:59.711
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

5405
02:27:59.711 --> 02:28:02.080
<v Speaker 2>So all criticism should be taken into consideration,</v>

5406
02:28:02.350 --> 02:28:03.910
<v Speaker 2>whether it's valid or invalid.</v>

5407
02:28:04.210 --> 02:28:06.100
<v Speaker 2>And a guy like Tim Kennedy,</v>

5408
02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I think is an important voice.</v>

5409
02:28:07.810 --> 02:28:09.940
<v Speaker 2>He's an important voice cause he's a legit human being.</v>

5410
02:28:09.941 --> 02:28:10.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5411
02:28:10.121 --> 02:28:10.361
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

5412
02:28:10.361 --> 02:28:11.950
<v Speaker 2>is legit as a man gets</v>

02:28:13.450 --> 02:28:16.660
<v Speaker 2>humid American in the fucking UFC for what he does.</v>

5414
02:28:16.690 --> 02:28:17.890
<v Speaker 2>He's one of them for sure.</v>

5415
02:28:17.900 --> 02:28:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Everyone falls short and they should.</v>

5416
02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:20.291
<v Speaker 2>They should.</v>

5417
02:28:20.291 --> 02:28:21.124
<v Speaker 2>He's legit.</v>

5418
02:28:21.350 --> 02:28:22.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5419
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:24.200
<v Speaker 1>I've legit like massive respect,</v>

5420
02:28:24.201 --> 02:28:27.620

5421
02:28:27.650 --> 02:28:28.640
<v Speaker 1>You need people like that,</v>

5422
02:28:28.641 --> 02:28:28.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5423
02:28:28.940 --> 02:28:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Don't think you don't.</v>

5424
02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's people like that and the other side,</v>

5425
02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:32.930

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5579
02:32:25.830 --> 02:32:26.730
<v Speaker 2>It's what your culture</v>

5580
02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:29.250
<v Speaker 2>is established.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's why I said is five feelings.</v>

5609
02:33:18.780 --> 02:33:21.810
<v Speaker 2>Like he's admitted Hixon Gracie AB workout,</v>

5610
02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:23.530
<v Speaker 2>any of sucking it up pretty fast.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He got 69 is five nine,</v>

5612
02:33:25.291 --> 02:33:25.591
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5613
02:33:25.591 --> 02:33:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Because 12 inch and five six and five nine and then 66 so,</v>

5614
02:33:29.101 --> 02:33:29.934
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

5615
02:33:30.210 --> 02:33:30.511

5616
02:33:30.511 --> 02:33:31.410
<v Speaker 2>nine and five six.</v>

5617
02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:34.980
<v Speaker 2>But when you look at them and in Borow doesn't look that much shorter than him.</v>

5618
02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:35.611
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

5619
02:33:35.611 --> 02:33:38.800
<v Speaker 2>he looks like more slender and not as like thick,</v>

5620
02:33:39.260 --> 02:33:40.093
<v Speaker 2>like definitely</v>

5621
02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:43.710
<v Speaker 2>hard when you're bending at the knees and moving.</v>

5622
02:33:43.711 --> 02:33:44.450
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

5623
02:33:44.450 --> 02:33:46.290
<v Speaker 2>Thick is Grau has a wider stance.</v>

5624
02:33:46.410 --> 02:33:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

5625
02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:47.673
<v Speaker 2>backache.</v>

5626
02:33:48.030 --> 02:33:52.080
<v Speaker 2>My vision is getting so shitty that it's hard for me to tell what that blown up</v>

5627
02:33:52.410 --> 02:33:53.243
<v Speaker 2>we're getting all of us,</v>

5628
02:33:53.490 --> 02:33:56.210
<v Speaker 2>whether it says 69 inches or five foot nine.</v>

5629
02:33:56.220 --> 02:33:56.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5630
02:33:56.670 --> 02:33:57.630
<v Speaker 2>I have beautiful eyes.</v>

5631
02:33:58.050 --> 02:34:01.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like just at that point where the six is blurry,</v>

5632
02:34:01.230 --> 02:34:02.310
<v Speaker 2>even as big as it is.</v>

5633
02:34:02.311 --> 02:34:03.540
<v Speaker 2>Hampson so depressing.</v>

5634
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:04.530
<v Speaker 2>So you'll wear glasses?</v>

5635
02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:06.810
<v Speaker 2>I bread them only when I read things.</v>

5636
02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:08.280
<v Speaker 2>What about the laser show clothes?</v>

5637
02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:09.173
<v Speaker 2>And that's no good.</v>

5638
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:10.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5639
02:34:10.470 --> 02:34:13.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's only good for certain types of,</v>

5640
02:34:13.351 --> 02:34:14.184
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5641
02:34:14.250 --> 02:34:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Connie's well issues with your,</v>

5642
02:34:16.261 --> 02:34:16.591
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

5643
02:34:16.591 --> 02:34:16.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5644
02:34:16.990 --> 02:34:17.823
<v Speaker 2>your retina.</v>

5645
02:34:17.860 --> 02:34:18.070
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

5646
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:21.000
<v Speaker 1>you're traveling long distances now.</v>

5647
02:34:21.010 --> 02:34:21.641
<v Speaker 1>Much more.</v>

5648
02:34:21.641 --> 02:34:22.630
<v Speaker 1>It's close distances,</v>

5649
02:34:22.631 --> 02:34:23.680
<v Speaker 1>but even long distance,</v>

5650
02:34:23.681 --> 02:34:24.290
<v Speaker 1>not so hot.</v>

5651
02:34:24.290 --> 02:34:26.560
<v Speaker 1>I have no problem with long closer if,</v>

5652
02:34:26.561 --> 02:34:27.040
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5653
02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I still probably have pretty good vision.</v>

5654
02:34:29.830 --> 02:34:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Like I see you crystal clear.</v>

5655
02:34:31.271 --> 02:34:32.104
<v Speaker 1>I see you a Christian.</v>

5656
02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:33.611
<v Speaker 1>I can read it,</v>

5657
02:34:33.611 --> 02:34:34.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

5658
02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:34.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5659
02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:34.721
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

5660
02:34:34.721 --> 02:34:38.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of aura to the numbers.</v>

5661
02:34:38.650 --> 02:34:38.890
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

5662
02:34:38.890 --> 02:34:39.660
<v Speaker 1>not clear.</v>

5663
02:34:39.660 --> 02:34:41.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like say sick gave it to me on lights.</v>

5664
02:34:42.130 --> 02:34:44.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll put these glasses on and Bam and money.</v>

5665
02:34:44.651 --> 02:34:45.100
<v Speaker 1>It's crystal.</v>

5666
02:34:45.100 --> 02:34:46.660
<v Speaker 1>So just wear those like Malcolm X.</v>

5667
02:34:46.660 --> 02:34:47.493
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5668
02:34:47.730 --> 02:34:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Like man,</v>

5669
02:34:48.510 --> 02:34:49.130
<v Speaker 1>just shit.</v>

5670
02:34:49.130 --> 02:34:49.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5671
02:34:49.450 --> 02:34:49.961
<v Speaker 1>that's your shit.</v>

5672
02:34:49.961 --> 02:34:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Now they get in the way that my contacts off for good and fuck the contacts.</v>

5673
02:34:54.731 --> 02:34:57.040
<v Speaker 1>I would just want to cook glasses this year for sure.</v>

5674
02:34:57.060 --> 02:34:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Feel lucky.</v>

5675
02:34:57.490 --> 02:34:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the money to do lasik eventually.</v>

5676
02:34:59.710 --> 02:35:02.650
<v Speaker 1>But your problem with lasix is like Kathy Griffin and a real issue with it.</v>

5677
02:35:02.650 --> 02:35:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Apparently she's the Brown.</v>

5678
02:35:05.270 --> 02:35:06.440
<v Speaker 1>He's a crisp.</v>

5679
02:35:06.450 --> 02:35:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Ben Wa have lasik.</v>

5680
02:35:07.390 --> 02:35:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5681
02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:08.750
<v Speaker 1>And Brown wouldn't say town,</v>

5682
02:35:08.751 --> 02:35:09.584
<v Speaker 1>but Jeremy Steals.</v>

5683
02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

5684
02:35:10.490 --> 02:35:11.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll look and take that back.</v>

5685
02:35:12.370 --> 02:35:13.121
<v Speaker 1>Don't kid yourself.</v>

5686
02:35:13.121 --> 02:35:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Stevens passed his seat.</v>

5687
02:35:14.890 --> 02:35:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Where are you at this bigger Stevens is also a training partner for Dominick.</v>

5688
02:35:18.251 --> 02:35:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Cruz is training at alliance.</v>

5689
02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:20.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5690
02:35:20.471 --> 02:35:22.420
<v Speaker 1>he's down there with l Eric Dolphy Futuro.</v>

5691
02:35:22.421 --> 02:35:24.730
<v Speaker 1>One of the most underrated coaches in the world.</v>

5692
02:35:25.330 --> 02:35:26.163
<v Speaker 1>Mountain Matt.</v>

5693
02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:27.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5694
02:35:27.140 --> 02:35:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Melanzane went to black house,</v>

5695
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:29.943
<v Speaker 1>didn't he?</v>

5696
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5697
02:35:30.150 --> 02:35:30.941
<v Speaker 1>he goes to both.</v>

5698
02:35:30.941 --> 02:35:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>

5699
02:35:31.470 --> 02:35:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5700
02:35:31.570 --> 02:35:31.901
<v Speaker 1>he goes back.</v>

5701
02:35:31.901 --> 02:35:32.830
<v Speaker 1>He was there forever.</v>

5702
02:35:32.831 --> 02:35:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he is that black house too,</v>

5703
02:35:34.591 --> 02:35:35.231
<v Speaker 1>was there forever.</v>

5704
02:35:35.231 --> 02:35:37.400
<v Speaker 1>But I think they brought him in the black house in normal.</v>

5705
02:35:37.410 --> 02:35:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Jay was,</v>

5706
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:39.860
<v Speaker 1>is out of a alliance camp there.</v>

5707
02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:40.713
<v Speaker 1>They're monsters.</v>

5708
02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Gustafson was down there with him.</v>

5709
02:35:42.881 --> 02:35:43.840
<v Speaker 1>They brought Pearson.</v>

5710
02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Did they give to us when a fight?</v>

5711
02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:49.390
<v Speaker 1>I feel like they feel like Gustafson just said something about not knowing what</v>

5712
02:35:49.391 --> 02:35:50.130
<v Speaker 1>he's doing.</v>

5713
02:35:50.130 --> 02:35:51.310
<v Speaker 1>I thought he said he lost the,</v>

5714
02:35:51.311 --> 02:35:51.570

02:35:53.011 --> 02:35:57.040
<v Speaker 1>he flew from Sweden to San Diego to see if the fire was still there and he still</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think he does.</v>

5727
02:36:05.801 --> 02:36:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not even real money.</v>

5728
02:36:07.031 --> 02:36:07.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but it's not even an immense.</v>

5734
02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:12.370
<v Speaker 1>He was always a kind of a problem child growing up,</v>

5735
02:36:12.670 --> 02:36:14.170
<v Speaker 1>but now he's a superstar.</v>

02:36:14.690 --> 02:36:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Hardge and sweet.</v>

5737
02:36:15.610 --> 02:36:18.550

5743
02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.460
<v Speaker 1>The only money is that it is a high tax rate.</v>

5744
02:36:30.461 --> 02:36:31.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like something like crazy.</v>

5955
02:42:13.110 --> 02:42:16.650
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it important to admit like things that you're a failure at support and</v>

5956
02:42:16.651 --> 02:42:19.680
<v Speaker 5>then you and I have had this conversation many times I'm a failure at almost</v>

5957
02:42:19.681 --> 02:42:20.580
<v Speaker 5>everything I've ever done.</v>

5958
02:42:20.610 --> 02:42:21.240
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

5959
02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:24.330
<v Speaker 5>Ultimately you find ways to be successful at it,</v>

5960
02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:25.980
<v Speaker 5>but I've failed at everything.</v>

5961
02:42:26.010 --> 02:42:26.131
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5962

<v Speaker 5>What'd you fail in a way to get everybody to wisdom.</v>

5965
02:42:32.570 --> 02:42:33.220
<v Speaker 5>Wisdom.</v>

5966
02:42:33.220 --> 02:42:36.820
<v Speaker 5>Wisdom is not failed on the land.</v>

5967
02:42:36.860 --> 02:42:37.170
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

02:42:38.730 --> 02:42:39.361
<v Speaker 5>You always fail.</v>

5972
02:42:39.361 --> 02:42:41.130
<v Speaker 5>That's why I always say to younger people,</v>

5973
02:42:41.131 --> 02:42:42.570
<v Speaker 5>listen to me because I've made more mistakes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

5977
02:42:46.990 --> 02:42:48.140
<v Speaker 5>No wisdom is</v>

5978
02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:54.030
<v Speaker 5>wisdom is coming to terms with your limitations and learning what to do with it.</v>

5979
02:42:54.340 --> 02:42:56.070
<v Speaker 5>That's where wisdom is.</v>

5980
02:42:56.071 --> 02:42:58.950
<v Speaker 5>Learning that you have limitations coming to terms with that,</v>

5981
02:42:58.951 --> 02:43:02.250
<v Speaker 5>accepting it and then learning what to do with that.</v>

5982
02:43:02.340 --> 02:43:04.230
<v Speaker 5>You're learning how to make that work for you.</v>

5983
02:43:04.290 --> 02:43:05.041
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>

5984
02:43:05.041 --> 02:43:06.570
<v Speaker 5>That's how you learn it.</v>

5988
02:43:08.270 --> 02:43:10.980
<v Speaker 5>you keep adjusting your approach and you can move on to something.</v>

5989
02:43:11.020 --> 02:43:11.853
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

6035
02:44:26.951 --> 02:44:30.010
<v Speaker 2>They could fuck up your confidence for a fight because you can know there's a</v>

6036
02:44:30.011 --> 02:44:31.360
<v Speaker 2>rumble Johnson like that out there.</v>

6037
02:44:31.361 --> 02:44:32.320
<v Speaker 2>If you're some due to trains,</v>

02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:38.291
<v Speaker 2>Why am I doing this?</v>

6042
02:44:38.291 --> 02:44:38.450
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

6043
02:44:38.450 --> 02:44:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I like concussions.</v>

6044
02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:40.481
<v Speaker 2>What am I doing?</v>

6045
02:44:40.481 --> 02:44:41.314
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to learn.</v>

6046
02:44:41.320 --> 02:44:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get better with this fucking dude who's like the freak of freaks</v>

6047
02:44:46.140 --> 02:44:46.973
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

6048
02:44:47.590 --> 02:44:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Although like Anderson,</v>

6049
02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:51.160
<v Speaker 2>that's what makes him so extraordinary.</v>

6050
02:44:51.161 --> 02:44:55.540
<v Speaker 2>His his dominance for so long and then he got knocked out once and then broke</v>

6051
02:44:55.541 --> 02:44:57.620
<v Speaker 2>his leg and well selfless.</v>

6052
02:44:57.730 --> 02:44:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it ends sometimes,</v>

6053
02:44:59.021 --> 02:44:59.410
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

6054
02:44:59.410 --> 02:45:04.410
<v Speaker 2>sometimes just those also 40 there's a hundred factors involved.</v>

6055
02:45:04.770 --> 02:45:06.010
<v Speaker 2>There is life.</v>

6056
02:45:06.030 --> 02:45:06.460
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>

6057
02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:08.970
<v Speaker 2>there's psychology is psychology.</v>

6058
02:45:08.980 --> 02:45:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Psycho is also understanding who you are as a human being and how that gets</v>

6059
02:45:12.971 --> 02:45:17.971
<v Speaker 2>distorted by massive amounts of fame and praise and adulation and love from,</v>

6060
02:45:19.150 --> 02:45:22.330
<v Speaker 2>from your country man and from people around the world because you're the</v>

6061
02:45:22.331 --> 02:45:25.360
<v Speaker 2>champion of the world and recognize my opinion.</v>

6062
02:45:25.390 --> 02:45:27.460
<v Speaker 2>If you want to ask me who's the greatest of all time,</v>

6063
02:45:27.490 --> 02:45:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I will always say Anderson Silva.</v>

6064
02:45:29.620 --> 02:45:30.550
<v Speaker 2>I think Anderson Silva,</v>

6065
02:45:30.610 --> 02:45:32.050
<v Speaker 2>the greatest MMA fighter,</v>

6066
02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:35.130
<v Speaker 2>he's the best.</v>

6067
02:45:35.380 --> 02:45:38.050
<v Speaker 2>The best dinner finished everybody.</v>

6068
02:45:38.051 --> 02:45:43.051
<v Speaker 2>He did things during the apex of the prime of MMA that nobody had been able to</v>

6069
02:45:43.091 --> 02:45:43.924
<v Speaker 2>do before.</v>

6070
02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:44.480
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

6071
02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:47.650
<v Speaker 2>He just was a monster man when he was with the knock out,</v>

6072
02:45:47.830 --> 02:45:49.390
<v Speaker 2>the veto knockout the feature,</v>

6073
02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:50.780
<v Speaker 2>not the person who was</v>

6074
02:45:53.700 --> 02:45:54.850
<v Speaker 2>named Mark Court too.</v>

6075
02:45:55.210 --> 02:45:56.043
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody,</v>

6076
02:45:56.230 --> 02:45:57.130
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

6077
02:45:57.131 --> 02:45:57.580
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

6078
02:45:57.580 --> 02:45:58.061
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>

6079
02:45:58.061 --> 02:45:58.751
<v Speaker 2>He was a month.</v>

6080
02:45:58.751 --> 02:45:59.584
<v Speaker 2>James Irvin,</v>

6081
02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:01.030
<v Speaker 2>how about the Forrest Griffin fight?</v>

6082
02:46:01.090 --> 02:46:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

6083
02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:02.540
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

6084
02:46:02.540 --> 02:46:05.590
<v Speaker 2>a full matrix [inaudible] matrix matrix.</v>

6085
02:46:05.591 --> 02:46:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

6086
02:46:07.300 --> 02:46:08.000
<v Speaker 2>This coming,</v>

6087
02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:08.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6088
02:46:08.530 --> 02:46:09.630
<v Speaker 2>even the,</v>

6089
02:46:10.250 --> 02:46:12.740
<v Speaker 2>even the first one for night but not for me.</v>

6090
02:46:12.830 --> 02:46:15.830
<v Speaker 2>So that was an interesting fight for me because that was a fight where I was</v>

6091
02:46:15.831 --> 02:46:17.840
<v Speaker 2>telling everybody that worked for the UFC.</v>

6092
02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:18.531
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

6093
02:46:18.531 --> 02:46:20.270
<v Speaker 2>do you understand what you have acquired?</v>

6094
02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:21.201
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

6095
02:46:21.201 --> 02:46:21.981
<v Speaker 2>you have acquired,</v>

6096
02:46:21.981 --> 02:46:24.500
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion the baddest motherfucker in this division.</v>

6097
02:46:24.700 --> 02:46:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Like do you understand how good this guy?</v>

6098
02:46:26.390 --> 02:46:29.210
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't that dominant in Japan but it didn't matter.</v>

6099
02:46:29.810 --> 02:46:30.643
<v Speaker 2>Didn't matter.</v>

6100
02:46:31.250 --> 02:46:35.390
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about Andy Simpson when Anderson came over the UFC I was adamant.</v>

6101
02:46:35.390 --> 02:46:39.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm like you guys have a guy who when I watch movement I watched like the way</v>

6102
02:46:39.711 --> 02:46:40.371
<v Speaker 2>guys move.</v>

6103
02:46:40.371 --> 02:46:42.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm like this guy can do some shit.</v>

6104
02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:43.850
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>

6105
02:46:43.850 --> 02:46:45.930
<v Speaker 2>He was he just so much faster than most guys.</v>

6106
02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Only time man.</v>

6107
02:46:47.230 --> 02:46:49.670
<v Speaker 2>He's more ties just like super,</v>

6108
02:46:49.671 --> 02:46:51.290
<v Speaker 2>super high level there is up there.</v>

6109
02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:53.360
<v Speaker 2>This is Anderson versus Forrest Griffin.</v>

6110
02:46:53.570 --> 02:46:54.321
<v Speaker 2>Look at that behind you.</v>

6111
02:46:54.321 --> 02:46:57.170
<v Speaker 2>This is Anderson in his prime and by the way,</v>

6112
02:46:57.530 --> 02:47:02.090
<v Speaker 2>light heavyweight fight to a guy who's 20 pounds less as a champion.</v>

6113
02:47:02.330 --> 02:47:05.600
<v Speaker 2>And this is just an opportunity for Anderson to fight and not have to cut</v>

6114
02:47:05.601 --> 02:47:06.230
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>

6115
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:10.220
<v Speaker 2>And in Brazil was this Brazil against four you?</v>

6116
02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Same card.</v>

6117
02:47:10.850 --> 02:47:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Cause I fought Nogueira that night.</v>

6118
02:47:12.330 --> 02:47:13.100
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure.</v>

6119
02:47:13.100 --> 02:47:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Am I right on,</v>

6120
02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:15.110
<v Speaker 2>do I feel like this is Vegas?</v>

6121
02:47:15.770 --> 02:47:15.981
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

6122
02:47:15.981 --> 02:47:16.880
<v Speaker 2>you might be right Joe.</v>

6123
02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:18.710
<v Speaker 2>I feel like this is Mandalay bay</v>

6124
02:47:20.940 --> 02:47:23.630
<v Speaker 2>because I feel like this was Vegas.</v>

6125
02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this is Brazil.</v>

6126
02:47:25.310 --> 02:47:25.641
<v Speaker 2>Janie,</v>

6127
02:47:25.641 --> 02:47:26.690
<v Speaker 2>find out please.</v>

6128
02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:27.300
<v Speaker 2>Young.</v>

6129
02:47:27.300 --> 02:47:29.450
<v Speaker 2>Maybe shogun fought forest in Brazil.</v>

6130
02:47:29.810 --> 02:47:30.643
<v Speaker 2>Yes he did.</v>

6131
02:47:30.890 --> 02:47:31.491
<v Speaker 2>Yes he did.</v>

6132
02:47:31.491 --> 02:47:32.990
<v Speaker 2>It's why I'm thinking is my bet.</v>

6133
02:47:33.620 --> 02:47:37.100
<v Speaker 2>But when the Anderson Anderson accidently I poked or something and also with any</v>

6134
02:47:37.101 --> 02:47:37.880
<v Speaker 2>does the Matrix,</v>

6135
02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:38.720
<v Speaker 2>this is in Vegas.</v>

6136
02:47:38.721 --> 02:47:39.440
<v Speaker 2>You're right Jill.</v>

6137
02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:43.100
<v Speaker 2>We opens him up and just relax as an Anderson was like really good.</v>

6138
02:47:43.340 --> 02:47:48.230
<v Speaker 2>They'd like figuring out your timing and lulling you to sleep with a false sense</v>

6139
02:47:48.231 --> 02:47:52.880
<v Speaker 2>of security and then out of nowhere he would just drop bombs on you.</v>

6140
02:47:52.970 --> 02:47:54.560
<v Speaker 2>But then he took it to another level.</v>

6141
02:47:54.620 --> 02:47:55.453
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6308
02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:32.040
<v Speaker 1>But that girl behind us,</v>

6309
02:52:32.500 --> 02:52:35.380
<v Speaker 1>we've seen the girl understands the camera's on her right behind.</v>

6310
02:52:35.490 --> 02:52:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Just look at her.</v>

6311
02:52:36.820 --> 02:52:37.960

02:52:40.060 --> 02:52:41.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure she's not a pro.</v>

6316
02:52:41.950 --> 02:52:42.581
<v Speaker 1>What are you trying to say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Bros?</v>

6318
02:52:43.380 --> 02:52:46.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say anything just because the girls are a good looking girl.</v>

6319
02:52:46.540 --> 02:52:47.170
<v Speaker 1>That's all I meant.</v>

6320
02:52:47.170 --> 02:52:48.003
<v Speaker 1>That's all I met.</v>

6321

<v Speaker 1>Professional hot girl.</v>

6322

6325
02:52:56.080 --> 02:52:57.850
<v Speaker 1>that's like the female equivalent to Coty.</v>

6326
02:52:58.150 --> 02:52:59.590
<v Speaker 1>That'd be like a natural thing to say.</v>

6327
02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Too many catches Cody.</v>

6328

<v Speaker 1>Too many tattoos.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

6330
02:53:02.230 --> 02:53:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Now of course I no,</v>

6331
02:53:05.180 --> 02:53:07.270
<v Speaker 1>that's how you attract a certain type of female.</v>

6332
02:53:07.330 --> 02:53:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

02:55:43.581 --> 02:55:44.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6432
02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:44.841
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6433
02:55:44.841 --> 02:55:48.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's something about your parents and this is the most beautiful thing ever.</v>

6434
02:55:48.051 --> 02:55:50.060
<v Speaker 2>I think we're all working together to create a piece of art.</v>

6435
02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:53.090
<v Speaker 2>You just gotta be real careful about stomping on each of those words.</v>

6436
02:55:54.330 --> 02:55:57.590
<v Speaker 2>A piece of bark up the Turkey base to steroids and some of these stick when</v>

6437
02:55:57.591 --> 02:55:58.880
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about gay shit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>all bands.</v>

6440
02:56:00.681 --> 02:56:01.461
<v Speaker 2>A good looking dude.</v>

6441
02:56:01.461 --> 02:56:04.580
<v Speaker 2>I think he's first team Thomas Bro.</v>

6442
02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:06.290
<v Speaker 2>How many times I've got to tell you he's married.</v>

6443
02:56:06.320 --> 02:56:08.240
<v Speaker 2>Tom saw made is not a bad looking fella either.</v>

6444
02:56:10.890 --> 02:56:11.900
<v Speaker 2>If you're a man,</v>

6445
02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:12.561
<v Speaker 2>if he ended up,</v>

6446
02:56:12.561 --> 02:56:13.550
<v Speaker 2>he looks like a Dell</v>

6447
02:56:18.350 --> 02:56:19.161
<v Speaker 2>all due respect.</v>

6448
02:56:19.161 --> 02:56:20.030
<v Speaker 2>A lot of black guys,</v>

6449
02:56:20.990 --> 02:56:22.090
<v Speaker 2>exactly what they're looking for.</v>

6450
02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:24.591
<v Speaker 2>Hey man,</v>

6451
02:56:24.591 --> 02:56:24.861
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

6452
02:56:24.861 --> 02:56:25.680
<v Speaker 2>he's a twink.</v>

6453
02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:29.680
<v Speaker 2>He's called the kid is a fucking savage Tom Summit as a God damn.</v>

6454
02:56:29.730 --> 02:56:31.180
<v Speaker 2>SAS tough fight for garbage.</v>

6455
02:56:31.220 --> 02:56:31.461
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6456
02:56:31.461 --> 02:56:32.001
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

6457
02:56:32.001 --> 02:56:33.410
<v Speaker 2>with this nonsense of winning,</v>

6458
02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:34.760
<v Speaker 2>as you saying about the last fight,</v>

6459
02:56:34.761 --> 02:56:35.594
<v Speaker 2>you were wrong.</v>

6460
02:56:35.830 --> 02:56:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Now I was painting you guys,</v>

6461
02:56:37.041 --> 02:56:37.874
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing,</v>

6462
02:56:38.780 --> 02:56:39.650
<v Speaker 2>he's going to win this fight.</v>

6463
02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:41.240
<v Speaker 2>He certainly can win,</v>

6464
02:56:41.390 --> 02:56:41.961
<v Speaker 2>but you know what,</v>

6465
02:56:41.961 --> 02:56:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Cody can win to both.</v>

6466
02:56:43.161 --> 02:56:44.300
<v Speaker 2>These guys are undefeated.</v>

6467
02:56:44.330 --> 02:56:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I meet as the favorite I made.</v>

6468
02:56:45.621 --> 02:56:47.140
<v Speaker 2>It's got 22 of course he is,</v>

6469
02:56:47.540 --> 02:56:48.860
<v Speaker 2>but let me tell you something.</v>

6470
02:56:48.861 --> 02:56:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Brad pickets stunned.</v>

6471
02:56:50.420 --> 02:56:52.790
<v Speaker 2>I'll meda and he's stunned him and hurt him.</v>

6472
02:56:53.590 --> 02:56:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Pick pickets.</v>

6473
02:56:54.450 --> 02:56:55.283
<v Speaker 2>A great truths.</v>

6474
02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:56.233
<v Speaker 2>It's true,</v>

6475
02:56:56.240 --> 02:56:57.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling you,</v>

6476
02:56:57.440 --> 02:56:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Cody Garbrandt,</v>

6477
02:56:58.670 --> 02:57:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I believe at this stage of his career in life,</v>

6478
02:57:01.281 --> 02:57:02.600
<v Speaker 2>he's only 24 years old.</v>

6479
02:57:02.990 --> 02:57:05.750
<v Speaker 2>He's faster and more dangerous with his hand.</v>

6480
02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:08.990
<v Speaker 2>He also hits harder than anyone at one 30 is boggling background.</v>

6481
02:57:09.020 --> 02:57:09.291
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

6482
02:57:09.291 --> 02:57:11.090
<v Speaker 2>he's a very strong boxing background.</v>

6483
02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:16.120
<v Speaker 2>So if Cody can impose his boxing skills in a similar manner to what Brad picket</v>

6484
02:57:17.031 --> 02:57:17.241
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

6485
02:57:17.241 --> 02:57:20.210
<v Speaker 2>we might see some interesting results by inserting mean Kale.</v>

6486
02:57:20.330 --> 02:57:20.631
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

6487
02:57:20.631 --> 02:57:21.620
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling you,</v>

6488
02:57:21.621 --> 02:57:23.030
<v Speaker 2>this guy's hard to take out.</v>

6489
02:57:23.031 --> 02:57:24.620
<v Speaker 2>He's a God damn savage.</v>

6490
02:57:24.890 --> 02:57:26.180
<v Speaker 2>This fucking kid,</v>

6491
02:57:26.270 --> 02:57:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Almeda is something super special.</v>

6492
02:57:28.470 --> 02:57:29.580
<v Speaker 2>Takes hits though Bro.</v>

6493
02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Chill.</v>

6494
02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:35.400
<v Speaker 2>But it comes back like he came back against Brad Pickett hits fucking hard man.</v>

6495
02:57:37.900 --> 02:57:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Chicken dropped him and Almeda came back and knocked him out with a flying knee</v>

6496
02:57:42.531 --> 02:57:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Kayo in the next round.</v>

6497
02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:49.240
<v Speaker 2>We're about to watch some crazy epic shit that could easily be a world</v>

6498
02:57:49.911 --> 02:57:52.790
<v Speaker 2>championship fight easily.</v>

6499
02:57:52.910 --> 02:57:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Maybe garb brand is a year away from world caliber.</v>

6500
02:57:56.960 --> 02:57:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

6501
02:57:57.470 --> 02:57:58.161
<v Speaker 2>he wins this.</v>

6502
02:57:58.161 --> 02:57:59.150
<v Speaker 2>He's off to the races.</v>

6503
02:57:59.180 --> 02:58:02.460
<v Speaker 2>You got number eight undefeated and you look like that.</v>

6504
02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Cody is like in my opinion,</v>

6505
02:58:04.680 --> 02:58:05.311
<v Speaker 2>a year,</v>

6506
02:58:05.311 --> 02:58:08.130
<v Speaker 2>a year and a half away from fine for title agree,</v>

6507
02:58:08.190 --> 02:58:10.170
<v Speaker 2>which means it could happen tomorrow.</v>

6508
02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:14.850
<v Speaker 2>Hey nicknamed the last guy who was on rank to lead a main event that wasn't like</v>

6509
02:58:14.851 --> 02:58:15.660
<v Speaker 2>a legend.</v>

6510
02:58:15.660 --> 02:58:15.841
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6511
02:58:15.841 --> 02:58:20.340
<v Speaker 2>what is courtesy ranking at all ranked while he's on the top 15 he's certainly</v>

6512
02:58:20.341 --> 02:58:22.650
<v Speaker 2>dangerous and he certainly comes from a really good team.</v>

6513
02:58:22.651 --> 02:58:23.251
<v Speaker 2>He's a team.</v>

6514
02:58:23.251 --> 02:58:23.731
<v Speaker 2>Alpha male.</v>

6515
02:58:23.731 --> 02:58:24.151
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

6516

6517
02:58:27.451 --> 02:58:29.520

6519
02:58:30.300 --> 02:58:30.991
<v Speaker 2>I think he's five.</v>

6520
02:58:30.991 --> 02:58:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Eight.</v>

6521
02:58:31.650 --> 02:58:32.401
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty tall.</v>

6522
02:58:32.401 --> 02:58:33.234
<v Speaker 2>That's not short.</v>

6523
02:58:33.580 --> 02:58:34.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6524
02:58:34.170 --> 02:58:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Well you see five five,</v>

6525
02:58:35.371 --> 02:58:35.551
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

6526
02:58:35.551 --> 02:58:36.720
<v Speaker 2>five is tall enough.</v>

6527
02:58:36.950 --> 02:58:37.783
<v Speaker 2>Tall enough.</v>

6528
02:58:38.060 --> 02:58:39.320
<v Speaker 2>One 35 is tall.</v>

6529
02:58:39.930 --> 02:58:40.410
<v Speaker 2>He's fine.</v>

6530
02:58:40.410 --> 02:58:41.440
<v Speaker 2>I made is five seven.</v>

6531
02:58:41.441 --> 02:58:44.400
<v Speaker 2>When he want to know I made as a gangster dude,</v>

6532
02:58:44.401 --> 02:58:45.600
<v Speaker 2>he's so solid.</v>

6533
02:58:45.810 --> 02:58:46.370
<v Speaker 2>I liked garb.</v>

6534
02:58:46.370 --> 02:58:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Ramp,</v>

6535
02:58:46.560 --> 02:58:46.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6536
02:58:46.840 --> 02:58:47.790
<v Speaker 2>We're watching right now.</v>

6537
02:58:47.791 --> 02:58:52.360
<v Speaker 2>We're about to watch some fucking technical martial arts chaos that's we're</v>

6538
02:58:52.370 --> 02:58:53.203
<v Speaker 2>about to watch.</v>

6539
02:58:53.220 --> 02:58:55.020
<v Speaker 2>You can watch sock him in the face.</v>

6540
02:58:55.050 --> 02:58:58.890
<v Speaker 2>You might watch that or you might watch Almeda hit him with a fucking switch</v>

6541
02:58:58.891 --> 02:59:00.180
<v Speaker 2>knee as he's coming in.</v>

6542
02:59:00.510 --> 02:59:01.980
<v Speaker 2>You might watch some leg kicks.</v>

6543
02:59:01.981 --> 02:59:03.540
<v Speaker 2>It take Cody garb,</v>

6544
02:59:03.541 --> 02:59:04.620
<v Speaker 2>ran out of the game.</v>

6545
02:59:04.650 --> 02:59:05.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6546
02:59:05.450 --> 02:59:07.230
<v Speaker 2>it's all dependent upon approach.</v>

6547
02:59:07.530 --> 02:59:08.340
<v Speaker 2>This is like,</v>

6548
02:59:08.340 --> 02:59:11.430
<v Speaker 2>this is guessing and theoretical ideas.</v>

6549
02:59:11.700 --> 02:59:16.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a theoretical that if Cody keeps it on the feet and sprawls and</v>

6550
02:59:16.291 --> 02:59:16.711
<v Speaker 2>brawls,</v>

6551
02:59:16.711 --> 02:59:17.544
<v Speaker 2>he wins,</v>

6552
02:59:17.790 --> 02:59:20.340
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't necessarily mean it's true.</v>

6553
02:59:20.460 --> 02:59:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Kevin Randleman knocked out Mirko Cro cop with a left hook.</v>

6554
02:59:24.300 --> 02:59:24.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6555
02:59:24.601 --> 02:59:27.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a crazy game where we're about to watch.</v>

6556
02:59:28.020 --> 02:59:28.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6557
02:59:28.231 --> 02:59:29.200
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

6558
02:59:29.201 --> 02:59:31.980
<v Speaker 2>A game as people play sport to bet on it.</v>

6559
02:59:31.990 --> 02:59:34.830
<v Speaker 2>Throw my bones at you with all my mind.</v>

6560
02:59:35.520 --> 02:59:36.000
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

6561
02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:41.000
<v Speaker 2>The same kind of power that produces a 90 plus mile an hour fast ball and I'm</v>

6562
02:59:41.131 --> 02:59:43.350
<v Speaker 2>going to stuff it into your fucking lips.</v>

6563
02:59:43.500 --> 02:59:44.333
<v Speaker 2>The gaming show,</v>

6564
02:59:45.220 --> 02:59:46.053
<v Speaker 2>that's the game.</v>

6565
02:59:47.310 --> 02:59:52.310
<v Speaker 2>Make you quit or shut you up in the house in the fucking house.</v>

6566
02:59:52.560 --> 02:59:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Cody opens up the plan.</v>

6567
02:59:54.060 --> 02:59:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Crazy roundhouse kicks.</v>

6568
02:59:55.261 --> 02:59:57.390
<v Speaker 2>We touched the criminal complaint around house damage.</v>

6569
02:59:57.420 --> 02:59:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem with that.</v>

6570
02:59:58.621 --> 03:00:01.200
<v Speaker 2>You should probably shouldn't be able to touch the ground on purpose and then</v>

6571
03:00:01.201 --> 03:00:02.490
<v Speaker 2>punching out with that same hand.</v>

6572

6573
03:00:03.960 --> 03:00:04.711

6581

<v Speaker 2>Wash his feet.</v>

6584

<v Speaker 2>I say I'm thinking of my people are in the ring though.</v>

6585
03:00:24.610 --> 03:00:25.630
<v Speaker 2>And baby wipes.</v>

6586
03:00:25.631 --> 03:00:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6587
03:00:26.100 --> 03:00:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I liked that part.</v>

6590
03:00:28.051 --> 03:00:28.621
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

6591
03:00:28.621 --> 03:00:29.580
<v Speaker 2>We lost power.</v>

6592
03:00:29.640 --> 03:00:30.570
<v Speaker 2>A Fox sports one.</v>

6593
03:00:30.660 --> 03:00:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

6594
03:00:31.230 --> 03:00:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Came back.</v>

6595
03:00:31.740 --> 03:00:32.573
<v Speaker 2>Calm down.</v>

6596
03:00:32.910 --> 03:00:33.390
<v Speaker 2>Calm down.</v>

6597
03:00:33.390 --> 03:00:34.230
<v Speaker 2>No ideas won't shut.</v>

6598
03:00:34.290 --> 03:00:36.710
<v Speaker 2>The shutters does scary.</v>

6599
03:00:36.780 --> 03:00:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Cody Garbrandt with a left hook arm.</v>

6600
03:00:38.340 --> 03:00:39.173
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6601
03:00:39.210 --> 03:00:43.860
<v Speaker 2>See the thing is [inaudible] oh we fight when it's dangerous.</v>

6602
03:00:43.890 --> 03:00:47.220
<v Speaker 2>Starts off with the hands because you don't feel comfortable enough to start</v>

6603
03:00:47.221 --> 03:00:47.851
<v Speaker 2>throwing kicks.</v>

6604
03:00:47.851 --> 03:00:52.530
<v Speaker 2>And last year some crazy Moy Thai style kick an expert where it's a part of your</v>

6605
03:00:52.531 --> 03:00:54.360
<v Speaker 2>natural thing killer.</v>

6606
03:00:54.650 --> 03:00:57.360
<v Speaker 2>But like guys who are like straight up MMA fighters,</v>

6607
03:00:57.480 --> 03:00:59.080
<v Speaker 2>they tend to favor hands with,</v>

6608
03:00:59.081 --> 03:00:59.914
<v Speaker 2>they're nervous.</v>

6609
03:01:00.010 --> 03:01:01.540
<v Speaker 2>So when your favorite hands,</v>

6610
03:01:01.780 --> 03:01:06.780
<v Speaker 2>carb brands got a pretty fucking nice advantage over a large percentage of the</v>

6611
03:01:06.941 --> 03:01:08.320
<v Speaker 2>people he's faced so far,</v>

6612
03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:09.400
<v Speaker 2>especially with his box.</v>

6613
03:01:09.420 --> 03:01:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

6614
03:01:09.780 --> 03:01:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6615
03:01:10.210 --> 03:01:10.451
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

6616
03:01:10.451 --> 03:01:13.040
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you say most guys favorite grappling in the beginning?</v>

6617
03:01:13.041 --> 03:01:13.990
<v Speaker 2>There's a little bit of that,</v>

6618
03:01:14.020 --> 03:01:18.220
<v Speaker 2>but there's also hands before kicks cause it distance.</v>

6619
03:01:18.250 --> 03:01:19.990
<v Speaker 2>He's got speed and Almeda.</v>

6620
03:01:20.070 --> 03:01:23.020
<v Speaker 2>Almeda license throw knees and likes to throw kicks,</v>

6621
03:01:23.260 --> 03:01:25.120
<v Speaker 2>but he might get counter.</v>

6622
03:01:25.210 --> 03:01:29.280
<v Speaker 2>He might get conservative in his approach because of the fact that Garber hands</v>

6623
03:01:29.290 --> 03:01:32.440
<v Speaker 2>hands are so good that he doesn't want to open himself up to like he brought.</v>

6624
03:01:32.441 --> 03:01:36.310
<v Speaker 2>He probably considered straight right counters to the right leg kicks they garb</v>

6625
03:01:36.311 --> 03:01:37.120
<v Speaker 2>ramp might look.</v>

6626
03:01:37.120 --> 03:01:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Look how heavy garb rant is on the front leg.</v>

6627
03:01:39.340 --> 03:01:42.400
<v Speaker 2>I want to assume that he's ready for a straight right hand counter to that.</v>

6628
03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:46.180
<v Speaker 2>How quicker his right leg kicks to quick move.</v>

6629
03:01:46.181 --> 03:01:47.650
<v Speaker 2>His hands are lightning fast.</v>

6630
03:01:48.100 --> 03:01:50.570
<v Speaker 2>His right leg kick isn't really fast to mass.</v>

6631
03:01:50.970 --> 03:01:51.803
<v Speaker 7>Oh</v>

6632
03:01:53.470 --> 03:01:53.880
<v Speaker 7>hello.</v>

6633
03:01:53.880 --> 03:01:54.720

6634
03:01:56.460 --> 03:01:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Cody garb.</v>

6635
03:01:57.301 --> 03:01:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Brands all over him relax to only,</v>

6636
03:02:01.060 --> 03:02:05.400
<v Speaker 2>and Jesus looks at this killer he's taught to.</v>

6637
03:02:05.410 --> 03:02:06.780
<v Speaker 2>How good is that neck tattoo.</v>

6638
03:02:06.781 --> 03:02:07.770

03:02:16.850 --> 03:02:18.940
<v Speaker 2>Get a star right below his eyes.</v>

6647
03:02:19.100 --> 03:02:22.410
<v Speaker 2>If he wins 100% if I may can take up all bogus shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about tonight.</v>

6715
03:04:30.380 --> 03:04:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Well Hanan Barao was lost a couple of times.</v>

6716
03:04:32.810 --> 03:04:33.501
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about whom?</v>

6717
03:04:33.501 --> 03:04:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Brown Cody Garbrandt and I'll meet a fight.</v>

6718
03:04:37.090 --> 03:04:37.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6719
03:04:37.460 --> 03:04:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Beatles.</v>

6720
03:04:37.740 --> 03:04:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Undefeated.</v>

6721
03:04:38.280 --> 03:04:39.510
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't lost confused.</v>

6722
03:04:39.880 --> 03:04:40.713
<v Speaker 1>I got baffled.</v>

6723
03:04:40.900 --> 03:04:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6724
03:04:41.300 --> 03:04:42.380
<v Speaker 1>we'll cut what Cody do.</v>

6725
03:04:42.381 --> 03:04:43.214
<v Speaker 1>You had to rank them.</v>

6726
03:04:43.550 --> 03:04:43.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6727
03:04:43.821 --> 03:04:48.821
<v Speaker 1>Well Cody did tonight was like impose his skills in a way that I don't think</v>

6728
03:04:49.340 --> 03:04:50.990
<v Speaker 1>you've ever seen him do before.</v>

6729
03:04:51.330 --> 03:04:54.910
<v Speaker 1>That was like the best version of all of his combination.</v>

6730
03:04:54.940 --> 03:04:55.820
<v Speaker 1>That part the most,</v>

6731
03:04:56.270 --> 03:04:56.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6732
03:04:56.930 --> 03:04:57.710
<v Speaker 1>for sure coming out.</v>

6733
03:04:57.710 --> 03:04:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6734
03:04:58.210 --> 03:05:03.210
<v Speaker 1>He's a star now is a good looking dude and calm and all that fire and that fire</v>

6735
03:05:04.371 --> 03:05:07.460
<v Speaker 1>range and then fucking squadron of death range.</v>

6736
03:05:07.461 --> 03:05:08.294
<v Speaker 1>When you got to,</v>

6737
03:05:08.300 --> 03:05:09.111
<v Speaker 1>he was so,</v>

6738
03:05:09.111 --> 03:05:10.430
<v Speaker 1>his eyes are so focused.</v>

6739
03:05:10.431 --> 03:05:14.350
<v Speaker 1>He was so relaxed and I don't know shit about striking but uh,</v>

6740
03:05:15.050 --> 03:05:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean he looks like Bruce Wallace.</v>

6741
03:05:16.490 --> 03:05:16.911
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

6742
03:05:16.911 --> 03:05:18.030
<v Speaker 1>This was a great car here.</v>

6743
03:05:18.070 --> 03:05:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Looks like this is your break card basis because the match ups were fun.</v>

6744
03:05:22.370 --> 03:05:22.910
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

6745
03:05:22.910 --> 03:05:23.481
<v Speaker 1>look what we had,</v>

6746
03:05:23.481 --> 03:05:24.020
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>

6747
03:05:24.020 --> 03:05:26.570
<v Speaker 1>we had Jeremy Stevens beat Hanan Barao was like,</v>

6748
03:05:26.571 --> 03:05:27.290
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

6749
03:05:27.290 --> 03:05:29.600
<v Speaker 1>that was a big fucking wind for chairman Stevens.</v>

6750
03:05:29.601 --> 03:05:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

6751
03:05:30.260 --> 03:05:34.010
<v Speaker 1>And then because we had Cody Garbrandt take it to the totally next level,</v>

6752
03:05:34.130 --> 03:05:34.880
<v Speaker 1>so it was like,</v>

6753
03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:35.750
<v Speaker 1>it was a perfect,</v>

6754
03:05:35.751 --> 03:05:37.590
<v Speaker 1>like coal main and then main right.</v>

6755
03:05:37.650 --> 03:05:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Like said,</v>

6756
03:05:38.260 --> 03:05:39.093
<v Speaker 1>looking forward,</v>

6757
03:05:39.560 --> 03:05:40.351
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>

6758
03:05:40.351 --> 03:05:41.184
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to do that?</v>

6759
03:05:41.330 --> 03:05:46.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's also amazing that Hennen Barao who just two fights ago was the world</v>

6760
03:05:46.851 --> 03:05:51.680
<v Speaker 1>champion and and three sites and sites for pound best for best in the world.</v>

6761
03:05:51.720 --> 03:05:51.890
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

6762
03:05:51.890 --> 03:05:53.180
<v Speaker 1>they're like waiting and I'm in and out.</v>

6763
03:05:53.690 --> 03:05:54.890
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking he was number three.</v>

6764
03:05:54.920 --> 03:05:55.281
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

6765
03:05:55.281 --> 03:05:56.390
<v Speaker 1>it was Jon Jones.</v>

6766
03:05:56.500 --> 03:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>

6767
03:05:57.470 --> 03:05:58.303
<v Speaker 1>well four.</v>

6768
03:05:58.430 --> 03:05:58.821
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

6769
03:05:58.821 --> 03:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>because it was before,</v>

6770
03:05:59.661 --> 03:06:01.580
<v Speaker 1>although it got stopped by Mcgregor,</v>

6771
03:06:01.730 --> 03:06:02.511
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones.</v>

6772
03:06:02.511 --> 03:06:03.344
<v Speaker 1>Demetrius was,</v>

6773
03:06:03.530 --> 03:06:05.780
<v Speaker 1>he was like a little bit below it was in,</v>

6774
03:06:05.840 --> 03:06:06.110
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

6775
03:06:06.110 --> 03:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>it was all,</v>

6776
03:06:06.770 --> 03:06:09.830
<v Speaker 1>it's all subjective but it was in the mix and it was definitely in the mix.</v>

6777
03:06:09.950 --> 03:06:10.651
<v Speaker 1>Top five for sure.</v>

6778
03:06:10.651 --> 03:06:11.101
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

6779
03:06:11.101 --> 03:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>For sure and for all those peanuts are on the fence.</v>

6780
03:06:14.090 --> 03:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>All those people that are on the fence about a neck tattoo.</v>

6781
03:06:17.331 --> 03:06:17.691
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

6782
03:06:17.691 --> 03:06:19.710
<v Speaker 1>they got side kicked over pat time.</v>

6783
03:06:20.740 --> 03:06:23.780
<v Speaker 1>I know for sure it gets to get a neck.</v>

6784
03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:24.561
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>

6785
03:06:24.561 --> 03:06:25.520
<v Speaker 1>I think this is important.</v>

6786
03:06:25.521 --> 03:06:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Talk about for all and then they fans.</v>

6787
03:06:27.710 --> 03:06:28.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

6788
03:06:28.080 --> 03:06:28.491
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

6789
03:06:28.491 --> 03:06:32.840
<v Speaker 1>there's an issue that keeps coming up with MMA and social media that I think</v>

6790
03:06:32.841 --> 03:06:34.130
<v Speaker 1>people need to relax about.</v>

6791
03:06:34.700 --> 03:06:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Like all of us as friends disagree about shit,</v>

6792
03:06:38.480 --> 03:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>but we're not douchey about it.</v>

6793
03:06:40.130 --> 03:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Like if you think that Hennen Barao was going to be able to figure out how to</v>

6794
03:06:43.401 --> 03:06:45.410
<v Speaker 1>weight a way to beat Jeremy Stevens,</v>

6795
03:06:45.560 --> 03:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>but I think that Jeremy Stevens power and experience at 145 pounds going to</v>

6796
03:06:49.461 --> 03:06:50.294
<v Speaker 1>prevail.</v>

6797
03:06:50.300 --> 03:06:51.440
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to be enemies.</v>

6798
03:06:52.370 --> 03:06:53.900
<v Speaker 1>This weird thing going on.</v>

6799
03:06:53.901 --> 03:06:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Like if you say something that you,</v>

6800
03:06:56.791 --> 03:06:57.840
<v Speaker 1>and I disagree with it,</v>

6801
03:06:57.990 --> 03:06:58.960
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>

6802
03:06:58.970 --> 03:06:59.240
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

6803
03:06:59.240 --> 03:06:59.820
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>

6804
03:06:59.820 --> 03:07:01.470
<v Speaker 1>like if that hits online,</v>

6805
03:07:01.650 --> 03:07:03.420
<v Speaker 1>like if two people disagree online,</v>

6806
03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:07.530
<v Speaker 1>people assume that there's like some sort of a horrible argument going on and</v>

6807
03:07:07.531 --> 03:07:08.640
<v Speaker 1>they assume that,</v>

6808
03:07:08.960 --> 03:07:09.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6809
03:07:09.270 --> 03:07:13.570
<v Speaker 1>there's like some negativity to me,</v>

6810
03:07:13.800 --> 03:07:14.071
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

6811
03:07:14.071 --> 03:07:15.610
<v Speaker 1>you hate each other pill.</v>

6812
03:07:15.730 --> 03:07:16.563
<v Speaker 1>No good.</v>

6813
03:07:16.970 --> 03:07:18.490
<v Speaker 1>But that's a tendency for tempo.</v>

6814
03:07:18.700 --> 03:07:19.800
<v Speaker 1>How many times have you,</v>

6815
03:07:19.801 --> 03:07:24.060
<v Speaker 1>and I mean you're as close to it as a human being as I could be with you guys.</v>

6816
03:07:24.061 --> 03:07:24.894
<v Speaker 1>All of you guys,</v>

6817
03:07:24.930 --> 03:07:26.070
<v Speaker 1>you later in my life,</v>

6818
03:07:26.100 --> 03:07:27.450
<v Speaker 1>but I was still up.</v>

6819
03:07:27.451 --> 03:07:28.350
<v Speaker 1>You're up down dog.</v>

6820
03:07:28.351 --> 03:07:29.184
<v Speaker 1>You know Bro.</v>

6821
03:07:29.490 --> 03:07:30.330
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6822
03:07:30.870 --> 03:07:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Dog Coming Times.</v>

6823
03:07:32.551 --> 03:07:33.700
<v Speaker 1>We disagreed about shit.</v>

6824
03:07:33.930 --> 03:07:34.763
<v Speaker 1>We've had some,</v>

6825
03:07:35.220 --> 03:07:37.350
<v Speaker 1>we've had some intense disagreements.</v>

6826
03:07:37.351 --> 03:07:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

6827
03:07:37.890 --> 03:07:39.300
<v Speaker 1>we've had some intense disagreements,</v>

6828
03:07:39.301 --> 03:07:43.050
<v Speaker 1>but through those disagreements you learn to consider other people's</v>

6829
03:07:43.051 --> 03:07:43.850
<v Speaker 1>perspectives,</v>

6830
03:07:43.850 --> 03:07:44.790
<v Speaker 1>but online Joe,</v>

6831
03:07:44.791 --> 03:07:45.920
<v Speaker 1>they call it they,</v>

6832
03:07:45.970 --> 03:07:46.441
<v Speaker 1>they'll say it's,</v>

6833
03:07:46.441 --> 03:07:46.621
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

6834
03:07:46.621 --> 03:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>it's called critical thinking.</v>

6835
03:07:48.510 --> 03:07:52.590
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't listen to my love for both of you and you too.</v>

6836
03:07:52.591 --> 03:07:53.790
<v Speaker 1>All My love for all of you.</v>

6837
03:07:53.850 --> 03:07:57.510
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't change dependent upon whether or not I agree with you or disagree</v>

6838
03:07:57.511 --> 03:07:57.860
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

6839
03:07:57.860 --> 03:07:58.693
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

6840
03:07:59.830 --> 03:08:00.371
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

6841
03:08:00.371 --> 03:08:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Arrest example of that is the chem trail issue.</v>

6842
03:08:06.540 --> 03:08:07.373
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6843
03:08:07.770 --> 03:08:12.770
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good damn chem trail and I'm all about Kevin and feel like I,</v>

6844
03:08:15.010 --> 03:08:16.410
<v Speaker 1>this is what I really feel like.</v>

6845
03:08:16.440 --> 03:08:21.090
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it is entirely possible that at one point in time they have</v>

6846
03:08:21.091 --> 03:08:23.040
<v Speaker 1>experimented with spraying things in the,</v>

6847
03:08:23.250 --> 03:08:23.830
<v Speaker 1>you were fucked.</v>

6848
03:08:23.830 --> 03:08:26.430
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely not possible.</v>

6849
03:08:26.431 --> 03:08:30.860
<v Speaker 1>They do it all the time and then it's just they just scattered will try to</v>

6850
03:08:30.861 --> 03:08:32.260
<v Speaker 1>control it all the time,</v>

6851
03:08:35.160 --> 03:08:40.160
<v Speaker 1>but then there's the issue of all the tensions all go through condensation and</v>

6852
03:08:40.621 --> 03:08:41.400
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere.</v>

6853
03:08:41.400 --> 03:08:46.400
<v Speaker 1>No one said they would actually change the temperature daughter getting sucked</v>

6854
03:08:46.890 --> 03:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>into turbines.</v>

6855
03:08:51.060 --> 03:08:51.893

03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:53.140
<v Speaker 6>I don't care.</v>

7152
03:16:53.140 --> 03:16:53.973
<v Speaker 6>It isn't that.</v>

7153

<v Speaker 6>The book is called David.</v>

7154
03:16:56.720 --> 03:16:57.720
<v Speaker 6>Dave McGough.</v>

7155
03:16:58.680 --> 03:16:59.513

7158
03:17:02.370 --> 03:17:03.570

<v Speaker 5>let your fuck my ass hole.</v>

7194
03:18:15.810 --> 03:18:16.231
<v Speaker 5>All Right,</v>

7195
03:18:16.231 --> 03:18:16.801
<v Speaker 5>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

7196
03:18:16.801 --> 03:18:17.920
<v Speaker 5>this has been the Joe Rogan.</v>

7197
03:18:18.860 --> 03:18:18.931
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

7198
03:18:18.931 --> 03:18:19.764
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>

7199
03:18:21.650 --> 03:18:25.080
<v Speaker 5>I thought I was fucking a lies</v>

7200
03:18:25.090 --> 03:18:25.301
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

7201
03:18:25.301 --> 03:18:28.930
<v Speaker 2>as much as I realized this as much as anybody who has his big brown and we're</v>

7202
03:18:28.931 --> 03:18:29.764
<v Speaker 2>all parents.</v>

7203
03:18:29.950 --> 03:18:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7204
03:18:30.400 --> 03:18:35.400
<v Speaker 2>What we realize is it takes a lot of fucking time and effort to raise children</v>

7205
03:18:35.980 --> 03:18:38.860
<v Speaker 2>and communicate with children and raise children.</v>

7206
03:18:38.890 --> 03:18:40.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of time.</v>

7207
03:18:40.330 --> 03:18:41.770
<v Speaker 2>And if you're working for the government,</v>

7208
03:18:41.771 --> 03:18:44.970
<v Speaker 2>you don't have that kind of time.</v>

7209
03:18:44.971 --> 03:18:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

7210
03:18:45.790 --> 03:18:48.010
<v Speaker 2>Certainly don't have the kind of to hit and</v>

7211
03:18:48.010 --> 03:18:51.550
<v Speaker 5>tie some fucking kid and brainwashed them into make it in the most excellent</v>

7212
03:18:51.551 --> 03:18:52.810
<v Speaker 5>music the world's ever known.</v>

7213
03:18:54.370 --> 03:18:55.060
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

7214
03:18:55.060 --> 03:19:00.060
<v Speaker 5>That is the opposite of what I [inaudible] let you talk.</v>

7215
03:19:01.750 --> 03:19:02.201
<v Speaker 5>Keep going.</v>

7216
03:19:02.201 --> 03:19:03.490
<v Speaker 5>Just the opposite.</v>

7217
03:19:03.530 --> 03:19:07.720
<v Speaker 5>What the opposite is is a child that grows up in an oppressive,</v>

7218
03:19:07.750 --> 03:19:12.370
<v Speaker 5>strict conservative family that's connected to the military and realize that</v>

7219
03:19:12.371 --> 03:19:13.450
<v Speaker 5>this is bullshit.</v>

7220
03:19:13.540 --> 03:19:15.730
<v Speaker 5>And they start doing drugs and acid.</v>

7221
03:19:15.731 --> 03:19:16.780
<v Speaker 5>They start drinking,</v>

7222
03:19:16.880 --> 03:19:20.260
<v Speaker 5>they started hanging out with fucking Weirdos and they produce amazing music.</v>

7223
03:19:20.261 --> 03:19:20.611
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

7224
03:19:20.611 --> 03:19:23.680
<v Speaker 5>And that's what we see and you can connect it to them,</v>

7225
03:19:23.890 --> 03:19:26.020
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's an erroneous connections.</v>

7226
03:19:26.140 --> 03:19:29.890
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a connection and it appeals to your desire to think that the world</v>

7227
03:19:29.891 --> 03:19:34.080
<v Speaker 5>is controlled by a cabal of intelligent super.</v>

7228
03:19:34.470 --> 03:19:34.960
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>

7229
03:19:34.960 --> 03:19:39.960
<v Speaker 5>He and I liked the cabal of intelligent super geniuses that have somehow figured</v>

7230
03:19:40.121 --> 03:19:43.450
<v Speaker 5>out in a way to manage their own love lives.</v>

7231
03:19:43.451 --> 03:19:46.570
<v Speaker 5>They're all in financial accounts are on real estate,</v>

7232
03:19:46.571 --> 03:19:47.740
<v Speaker 5>fucking holdings.</v>

7233
03:19:47.741 --> 03:19:50.050
<v Speaker 5>Their own stock market portfolios,</v>

7234
03:19:50.260 --> 03:19:53.020
<v Speaker 5>their own relationships with their coworkers,</v>

7235
03:19:53.021 --> 03:19:54.310
<v Speaker 5>their hobbies,</v>

7236
03:19:54.500 --> 03:19:58.030
<v Speaker 5>the hookers that they occasionally stick their penis into.</v>

7237
03:19:58.300 --> 03:20:02.020
<v Speaker 5>They have time for all that plus chem trails.</v>

7238

<v Speaker 5>I talked about this.</v>

7242
03:20:17.380 --> 03:20:18.730

7247
03:20:27.470 --> 03:20:32.470

<v Speaker 5>I talked about this before.</v>

7272
03:21:07.090 --> 03:21:07.923
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

7273
03:21:07.940 --> 03:21:10.330
<v Speaker 5>if I would get that fucking oil from Alaska,</v>

7274
03:21:10.450 --> 03:21:12.160
<v Speaker 5>I would go in there and make it,</v>

7275
03:21:12.340 --> 03:21:13.360
<v Speaker 5>make us elect Trump,</v>

<v Speaker 5>these things are true.</v>

7285
03:21:25.450 --> 03:21:27.370
<v Speaker 5>It has to be frustrating at iie to believe something.</v>

<v Speaker 5>with what we were talking about before the podcast.</v>

7289
03:21:38.321 --> 03:21:39.190
<v Speaker 5>Just think about that.</v>

7290
03:21:39.580 --> 03:21:41.020
<v Speaker 5>It's the same shit.</v>

7291
03:21:41.050 --> 03:21:42.160
<v Speaker 5>It's like that.</v>

7292
03:21:42.460 --> 03:21:44.200
<v Speaker 5>It's like God damn.</v>

7293
03:21:44.320 --> 03:21:45.153
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it's,</v>

7294
03:21:45.170 --> 03:21:46.490
<v Speaker 5>please Illuminati.</v>

7295
03:21:46.490 --> 03:21:46.941
<v Speaker 2>Take me.</v>

7296
03:21:46.941 --> 03:21:48.500
<v Speaker 2>I want to fuck these mother fuckers.</v>

7297
03:21:48.770 --> 03:21:52.610
<v Speaker 2>I want to fuck with these motherfuckers that science and,</v>

7298
03:21:52.850 --> 03:21:53.301
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

7299
03:21:53.301 --> 03:21:54.870
<v Speaker 2>I want to get science.</v>

7300
03:21:56.590 --> 03:21:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Why are you measuring shit?</v>

7301
03:21:57.920 --> 03:21:59.580
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

7302
03:22:02.020 --> 03:22:03.460
<v Speaker 2>know that the crazy thing is,</v>

7303
03:22:03.990 --> 03:22:04.370
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

7304
03:22:04.370 --> 03:22:05.600
<v Speaker 2>your distance and your speed.</v>

7305
03:22:06.020 --> 03:22:06.853
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

7306
03:22:08.190 --> 03:22:09.023
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

7307
03:22:09.960 --> 03:22:10.970
<v Speaker 2>What about psychics,</v>

7308
03:22:10.971 --> 03:22:11.804
<v Speaker 2>Bro?</v>

7309
03:22:13.320 --> 03:22:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Your measurable experiments.</v>

7310
03:22:18.170 --> 03:22:19.490
<v Speaker 2>How come y'all see the same shit,</v>

7311
03:22:19.491 --> 03:22:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Bro?</v>

7312
03:22:20.150 --> 03:22:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Every time I went to a psychic bro,</v>

7313
03:22:23.840 --> 03:22:24.680
<v Speaker 2>this tastes like shit.</v>

7314
03:22:24.740 --> 03:22:25.573
<v Speaker 2>I love that chaser.</v>

7315
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:26.130
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

7316
03:22:26.130 --> 03:22:26.720
<v Speaker 2>It's both.</v>

7317
03:22:26.720 --> 03:22:28.070
<v Speaker 2>I think both things are true.</v>

7318
03:22:28.130 --> 03:22:28.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

7319
03:22:28.371 --> 03:22:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Gulf of Tonkin was obviously a coordinated false flag event.</v>

7320
03:22:33.200 --> 03:22:33.601
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

7321
03:22:33.601 --> 03:22:38.601
<v Speaker 2>the operation Northwoods was obviously an idea that they had tried to pass where</v>

7322
03:22:38.781 --> 03:22:40.520
<v Speaker 2>it got through the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</v>

7323
03:22:40.521 --> 03:22:43.940
<v Speaker 2>It was signed and vetoed by Kennedy where they're going to have a false flag.</v>

7324
03:22:43.941 --> 03:22:45.020
<v Speaker 2>And American civilians,</v>

7325
03:22:45.230 --> 03:22:48.350
<v Speaker 2>there's obviously have been throughout human history,</v>

7326
03:22:48.560 --> 03:22:50.960
<v Speaker 2>liars and manipulators that were in charge.</v>

7327
03:22:51.050 --> 03:22:51.883
<v Speaker 2>So we should do,</v>

7328
03:22:51.920 --> 03:22:54.080
<v Speaker 2>we should certainly have some healthy skepticism,</v>

7329
03:22:54.380 --> 03:22:56.690
<v Speaker 2>but we also have to take any consideration.</v>

7330
03:22:56.690 --> 03:22:58.790
<v Speaker 2>How much fucking time does a person having a day?</v>

7331
03:22:59.150 --> 03:23:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Who are all these masterminds?</v>

7332
03:23:00.561 --> 03:23:02.300
<v Speaker 2>I got much of this is just convenient.</v>

7333
03:23:02.470 --> 03:23:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

7334
03:23:03.050 --> 03:23:04.310
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the exception.</v>

7335
03:23:04.430 --> 03:23:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7336
03:23:05.120 --> 03:23:05.841
<v Speaker 2>Well how much of,</v>

7337
03:23:05.841 --> 03:23:06.920
<v Speaker 2>how much of what's going on?</v>

7338
03:23:06.921 --> 03:23:08.300
<v Speaker 2>Like the 60 shit,</v>

7339
03:23:08.450 --> 03:23:09.770
<v Speaker 2>how much is just convenient,</v>

7340
03:23:09.771 --> 03:23:10.550
<v Speaker 2>rebellion,</v>

7341
03:23:10.550 --> 03:23:11.570
<v Speaker 2>obvious rebellion.</v>

7342
03:23:11.880 --> 03:23:16.220
<v Speaker 2>If you grow up with someone who's some sort of a fucking military asshole track</v>

7343
03:23:16.221 --> 03:23:17.240
<v Speaker 2>and he's super strict,</v>

7344
03:23:17.450 --> 03:23:17.691
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

7345
03:23:17.691 --> 03:23:20.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many rock stars have come from that background?</v>

7346
03:23:20.390 --> 03:23:22.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like a giant number.</v>

7347
03:23:22.190 --> 03:23:23.060
<v Speaker 2>It's their outlet.</v>

7348
03:23:23.210 --> 03:23:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Being creative and trying to be a fight.</v>

7349
03:23:26.970 --> 03:23:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Talked to Cody Garbrandt.</v>

7350
03:23:28.370 --> 03:23:31.370
<v Speaker 2>He did not have a fucking cool seventh grade,</v>

7351
03:23:31.670 --> 03:23:36.670
<v Speaker 2>you know for sure some shit who's a Stepdad and mom had turned out brand tattoo</v>

7352
03:23:41.331 --> 03:23:43.610
<v Speaker 2>on your neck that says like self-made.</v>

7353
03:23:43.760 --> 03:23:44.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7354
03:23:45.020 --> 03:23:47.060
<v Speaker 2>That's like you're trying to fight off something.</v>

7355
03:23:47.090 --> 03:23:47.421
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

7356
03:23:47.421 --> 03:23:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7357
03:23:47.840 --> 03:23:49.900
<v Speaker 2>You're not homecoming king and the neck tests,</v>

7358
03:23:50.690 --> 03:23:53.770
<v Speaker 2>but we also have to be taking into consideration that,</v>

7359
03:23:53.771 --> 03:23:55.610
<v Speaker 2>like we were talking about with bears earlier,</v>

7360
03:23:55.730 --> 03:23:57.620
<v Speaker 2>the bears don't have natural predators,</v>

7361
03:23:57.800 --> 03:23:58.980
<v Speaker 2>so nature is rigged.</v>

7362
03:23:58.980 --> 03:23:59.813
<v Speaker 2>Them Weird.</v>

7363
03:23:59.850 --> 03:24:03.500
<v Speaker 2>They've nature's wired them in some weird way with they eat babies,</v>

7364
03:24:03.770 --> 03:24:06.470
<v Speaker 2>whereas wolves don't do that cause he have to survive.</v>

7365
03:24:06.500 --> 03:24:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Elk Don't do that.</v>

7366
03:24:07.641 --> 03:24:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Pigs don't do that.</v>

7367
03:24:08.661 --> 03:24:11.450
<v Speaker 2>They have to take care of their babies because it's not as easy for them to</v>

7368
03:24:11.451 --> 03:24:12.170
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>

7369
03:24:12.170 --> 03:24:14.540
<v Speaker 2>But the bears got to the top of the food chain.</v>

7370
03:24:14.541 --> 03:24:15.110
<v Speaker 2>They realized,</v>

7371
03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:16.100
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

7372
03:24:16.490 --> 03:24:17.211
<v Speaker 2>we're fucked.</v>

7373
03:24:17.211 --> 03:24:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>

7374
03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:18.920
<v Speaker 2>no one can eat us.</v>

7375
03:24:19.070 --> 03:24:23.240
<v Speaker 2>So we can just keep fucking and making millions of us and we overcome all the</v>

7376
03:24:23.241 --> 03:24:24.710
<v Speaker 2>food and we'll all starve to death.</v>

7377
03:24:25.010 --> 03:24:25.311
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

7378
03:24:25.311 --> 03:24:29.180
<v Speaker 2>we can start eating our babies and nature's rigged them in some sort of a weird</v>

7379
03:24:29.181 --> 03:24:29.630
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

7380
03:24:29.630 --> 03:24:30.650
<v Speaker 2>You got to eat a baby.</v>

7381
03:24:30.710 --> 03:24:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Which one out of three babies too?</v>

7382
03:24:33.340 --> 03:24:34.071
<v Speaker 2>When you come to my house,</v>

7383
03:24:34.071 --> 03:24:36.560
<v Speaker 2>do not give me a hard time when you see my fucking mail.</v>

7384
03:24:36.680 --> 03:24:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Seven foot eight maybe eight.</v>

7385
03:24:38.781 --> 03:24:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Six cause I'm dead.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I and I got a nose for fucking bear.</v>

7387
03:24:42.320 --> 03:24:43.980

7388
03:24:43.980 --> 03:24:46.830

7389
03:24:46.831 --> 03:24:47.860

03:24:54.030 --> 03:24:54.750
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's how we talk about it.</v>

7534
03:28:32.030 --> 03:28:34.800
<v Speaker 5>We were on the same routes.</v>

7535
03:28:35.090 --> 03:28:35.800
<v Speaker 5>That's for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 5>We were on the Missouri River.</v>

7541
03:28:42.870 --> 03:28:44.980
<v Speaker 5>We were in the Missouri breaks in Montana.</v>

7542
03:28:44.981 --> 03:28:46.120
<v Speaker 5>It was fucking fantastic.</v>

7543
03:28:46.121 --> 03:28:46.954
<v Speaker 5>Miserable.</v>

7550
03:28:57.820 --> 03:28:59.770
<v Speaker 5>like hyperventilating,</v>

7551
03:28:59.980 --> 03:29:01.300
<v Speaker 5>tears running down my face.</v>

7552
03:29:01.301 --> 03:29:06.130
<v Speaker 5>It's maybe six degrees outside the room called the ravine comer jerking off into</v>

7553
03:29:06.131 --> 03:29:06.820

7577
03:29:42.500 --> 03:29:44.770
<v Speaker 5>We have this deer tied to this tree.</v>

7578
03:29:44.771 --> 03:29:45.610
<v Speaker 5>We pull this deer down.</v>

7579
03:29:45.611 --> 03:29:46.690
<v Speaker 5>We're fuck you freezing.</v>

7580
03:29:46.870 --> 03:29:47.990
<v Speaker 5>We're fucking freezing.</v>

7581
03:29:48.180 --> 03:29:48.731

03:29:48.731 --> 03:29:49.271

<v Speaker 5>The fucking ground is frozen.</v>

7586
03:29:51.971 --> 03:29:53.140
<v Speaker 5>It's eight degrees outside.</v>

7587
03:29:53.290 --> 03:29:55.360
<v Speaker 5>We're cutting this deer and we decided to have a fire.</v>

7588
03:29:55.630 --> 03:29:55.731
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

7591
03:30:02.860 --> 03:30:04.420
<v Speaker 5>He gets near the bridge,</v>

7592
03:30:04.940 --> 03:30:07.150
<v Speaker 5>not a bridge like Lyft</v>

7593
03:30:09.040 --> 03:30:09.873
<v Speaker 5>and he starts,</v>

7594
03:30:10.630 --> 03:30:15.010
<v Speaker 5>he starts jacking off in front of this ravine and saying he's the ravine.</v>

7595
03:30:15.040 --> 03:30:17.140
<v Speaker 5>Calmer because you asked me what I was doing</v>

03:33:58.170 --> 03:33:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Cheetos are incredible.</v>

7719
03:33:59.790 --> 03:34:01.560
<v Speaker 2>They stay a light forever.</v>

7720
03:34:03.500 --> 03:34:08.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a slow to fuck off once or the crunchy ones one.</v>

7721
03:34:09.450 --> 03:34:10.081
<v Speaker 2>That's the one thing.</v>

7722
03:34:10.081 --> 03:34:12.570
<v Speaker 2>All the Zombie movies and TV shows didn't get,</v>

7723
03:34:12.790 --> 03:34:15.180
<v Speaker 2>you know from this point on they're going to use the Cheetos.</v>

7724
03:34:15.550 --> 03:34:16.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a slow burn.</v>

7725
03:34:17.040 --> 03:34:17.461
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

7726
03:34:17.461 --> 03:34:21.930
<v Speaker 2>Bernie took something like trees and we chopped trees down and hacked off the</v>

7727
03:34:21.931 --> 03:34:24.820
<v Speaker 2>bottom of the trees cause that was the driest spot.</v>

7728
03:34:25.020 --> 03:34:25.321
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

7729
03:34:25.321 --> 03:34:29.460
<v Speaker 2>we hacked off the insides of the limbs because the outside of the lambs are more</v>

7730
03:34:29.461 --> 03:34:30.090
<v Speaker 2>wet.</v>

7731
03:34:30.090 --> 03:34:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Do we were Desperado we took paper and we started paper to develop a wet fire</v>

7732
03:34:34.771 --> 03:34:37.350
<v Speaker 2>and we'll wet five means like it's touch and go the whole way.</v>

7733
03:34:37.500 --> 03:34:37.770
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

7734
03:34:37.770 --> 03:34:41.280
<v Speaker 2>you're burning wet stuff and you're trying to get the driest stuff that's</v>

7735
03:34:41.281 --> 03:34:41.851
<v Speaker 2>available.</v>

7736
03:34:41.851 --> 03:34:43.830
<v Speaker 2>And Cheetos saved our ass.</v>

7737
03:34:43.860 --> 03:34:44.321
<v Speaker 2>And tell me,</v>

7738
03:34:44.321 --> 03:34:45.154
<v Speaker 2>if you tell me,</v>

7739
03:34:45.180 --> 03:34:46.013
<v Speaker 2>hey</v>

7740
03:34:47.230 --> 03:34:49.230
<v Speaker 2>you to feel this,</v>

7741
03:34:49.231 --> 03:34:50.041
<v Speaker 2>tell me if you didn't feel this.</v>

7742
03:34:50.041 --> 03:34:51.350
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not being dramatic when I say it.</v>

7743
03:34:51.351 --> 03:34:52.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's not possible.</v>

7744
03:34:52.860 --> 03:34:53.693
<v Speaker 2>Well that's true.</v>

7745
03:34:53.820 --> 03:34:54.653
<v Speaker 2>That's very true.</v>

7746
03:34:54.750 --> 03:34:57.360
<v Speaker 2>But when you're in the middle of that majestic wilderness,</v>

7747
03:34:57.390 --> 03:34:58.830
<v Speaker 2>literally that doesn't care about you.</v>

7748
03:34:59.160 --> 03:35:00.480
<v Speaker 2>You do get a sense.</v>

7749
03:35:00.510 --> 03:35:01.320
<v Speaker 2>There is a very,</v>

7750
03:35:01.320 --> 03:35:02.850
<v Speaker 2>there is a feeling of sadness,</v>

7751
03:35:02.880 --> 03:35:07.110
<v Speaker 2>of feeling of I'm being so insignificant that it makes you a little bit</v>

7752
03:35:07.111 --> 03:35:08.100
<v Speaker 2>depressed sometimes.</v>

7753
03:35:08.160 --> 03:35:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7754
03:35:08.610 --> 03:35:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Did you feel that?</v>

7755
03:35:09.451 --> 03:35:10.200
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever feel that?</v>

7756
03:35:10.200 --> 03:35:14.280
<v Speaker 2>When we were sitting up at the top of this one of these ridges and you and I and</v>

7757
03:35:14.281 --> 03:35:18.240
<v Speaker 2>m Yonis were up there and we were taking a break and we sat up there and we</v>

7758
03:35:18.241 --> 03:35:20.160
<v Speaker 2>glassed this canyon and it was,</v>

7759
03:35:20.161 --> 03:35:23.960
<v Speaker 2>the rain was coming in and going out and we're looking around and I'm,</v>

7760
03:35:24.010 --> 03:35:26.490
<v Speaker 2>and my team was there too and we were just like,</v>

7761
03:35:26.491 --> 03:35:27.121
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

7762
03:35:27.121 --> 03:35:29.340
<v Speaker 2>like this land doesn't give a fuck of your here are gone.</v>

7763
03:35:29.370 --> 03:35:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

7764
03:35:29.730 --> 03:35:31.450
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be the same like a,</v>

7765
03:35:32.220 --> 03:35:36.660
<v Speaker 2>it's like a realization that no matter what mark you think you're laying,</v>

7766
03:35:36.830 --> 03:35:39.630
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if you're fucking King Tut it does it.</v>

7767
03:35:39.631 --> 03:35:40.170
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

7768
03:35:40.170 --> 03:35:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Matter you are ultimately,</v>

7769
03:35:41.731 --> 03:35:42.570
<v Speaker 2>it's all bullshit.</v>

7770
03:35:42.600 --> 03:35:42.841
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

7771
03:35:42.841 --> 03:35:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Like you get this,</v>

7772
03:35:44.100 --> 03:35:49.100
<v Speaker 2>this entirely temporary existence and it the world and the universe is bigger.</v>

7773
03:35:50.190 --> 03:35:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

7774
03:35:50.540 --> 03:35:53.460
<v Speaker 2>You still a grain of sand and that's hard to deal with because you want to pass</v>

7775
03:35:53.461 --> 03:35:56.640
<v Speaker 2>your genes and you want to be special and you want to show greatness and you</v>

7776
03:35:56.641 --> 03:35:58.710
<v Speaker 2>want people to remember your name after you're gone.</v>

7777
03:35:58.950 --> 03:36:00.810
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately that's not really what's important.</v>

7778
03:36:01.080 --> 03:36:03.270
<v Speaker 2>And that when you're confronted with that reality,</v>

7779
03:36:03.271 --> 03:36:05.310
<v Speaker 2>whether it's through psychedelic drugs over there,</v>

7780
03:36:05.311 --> 03:36:10.311
<v Speaker 2>it's through sitting on a mountain in Prince of Wales and best buddies sitting</v>

7781
03:36:11.851 --> 03:36:12.301
<v Speaker 2>there going,</v>

7782
03:36:12.301 --> 03:36:12.511
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

7783
03:36:12.511 --> 03:36:14.220
<v Speaker 2>we can't even fucking find a deer.</v>

7784
03:36:14.460 --> 03:36:17.790
<v Speaker 2>We didn't find a deer for days and days so lonely.</v>

7785
03:36:17.791 --> 03:36:20.160
<v Speaker 2>It's such a lonely part of the world.</v>

7786
03:36:20.600 --> 03:36:23.760
<v Speaker 2>You can see for miles and miles it what you think about it.</v>

7787
03:36:23.820 --> 03:36:24.271
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

7788
03:36:24.271 --> 03:36:26.520
<v Speaker 2>what I thought about it was exactly what he's talking about,</v>

7789
03:36:26.521 --> 03:36:28.680
<v Speaker 2>like the notion that I'm so,</v>

7790
03:36:28.810 --> 03:36:29.643
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

7791
03:36:29.700 --> 03:36:33.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm so insignificant and so much of my effort all day,</v>

7792
03:36:33.031 --> 03:36:34.350
<v Speaker 2>so much mind in a way.</v>

7793
03:36:34.351 --> 03:36:35.410
<v Speaker 2>So much of my effort.</v>

7794
03:36:35.660 --> 03:36:36.130
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

7795
03:36:36.130 --> 03:36:40.030
<v Speaker 1>you also realize how vulnerable you are without food and water without like,</v>

7796
03:36:40.060 --> 03:36:40.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7797
03:36:40.380 --> 03:36:45.380
<v Speaker 1>no how without the culture and the accumulated knowhow of how to survive in that</v>

7798
03:36:46.130 --> 03:36:47.710
<v Speaker 1>we should talk about what we bring.</v>

7799
03:36:47.711 --> 03:36:51.280
<v Speaker 1>We bring a freeze dried foods and we bring some,</v>

7800
03:36:51.281 --> 03:36:53.860
<v Speaker 1>some like hard snack bars.</v>

7801
03:36:53.920 --> 03:36:54.101
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7802
03:36:54.101 --> 03:36:54.191
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7803
03:36:54.191 --> 03:36:55.024
<v Speaker 1>we're fine.</v>

7804
03:36:55.380 --> 03:36:56.690
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing any survivor man,</v>

7805
03:36:57.880 --> 03:37:01.720
<v Speaker 1>firemen shit five to six days.</v>

7806
03:37:02.200 --> 03:37:02.951
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

7807
03:37:02.951 --> 03:37:06.190
<v Speaker 1>We have a limited supply and it lets you know that like without this stuff,</v>

7808
03:37:06.191 --> 03:37:08.710
<v Speaker 1>cause we're not trying to live off this mountain ops food,</v>

7809
03:37:08.740 --> 03:37:09.040
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7810
03:37:09.040 --> 03:37:10.120
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it's called,</v>

7811
03:37:10.121 --> 03:37:11.080
<v Speaker 1>whatever the meals or call.</v>

7812
03:37:11.081 --> 03:37:11.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's mountain ops.</v>

7813
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Not An ops is like a good protein,</v>

7814
03:37:13.930 --> 03:37:15.810
<v Speaker 1>a US company for hunters.</v>

7815
03:37:16.100 --> 03:37:17.010
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

7816
03:37:17.080 --> 03:37:17.980
<v Speaker 1>what will you realize?</v>

7817
03:37:17.981 --> 03:37:20.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like if I didn't have the stuff that I brought with me,</v>

7818
03:37:20.620 --> 03:37:22.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to survive just living off the land.</v>

7819
03:37:22.870 --> 03:37:24.100
<v Speaker 1>It's hard as hell.</v>

7820
03:37:24.280 --> 03:37:25.180
<v Speaker 1>It's hard as hell.</v>

7821
03:37:25.210 --> 03:37:26.980
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying you weren't worried about your Twitter followers?</v>

7822
03:37:26.981 --> 03:37:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Instagram,</v>

7823
03:37:27.450 --> 03:37:29.920
<v Speaker 1>you realize how much bullshit you need,</v>

7824
03:37:29.921 --> 03:37:31.900
<v Speaker 1>less sleep and just that it's not,</v>

7825
03:37:31.901 --> 03:37:33.490
<v Speaker 1>this cell phone doesn't work.</v>

7826
03:37:33.500 --> 03:37:34.333
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there a satellite?</v>

7827
03:37:34.430 --> 03:37:34.771
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7828
03:37:34.771 --> 03:37:35.350
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

7829
03:37:35.350 --> 03:37:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Cell phones or direct to wreck.</v>

7830
03:37:36.970 --> 03:37:37.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

7831
03:37:37.570 --> 03:37:40.870
<v Speaker 1>that's why you have this fake trees and the four or five cell phones.</v>

7832
03:37:42.180 --> 03:37:42.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7833
03:37:42.630 --> 03:37:42.881
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7834
03:37:42.881 --> 03:37:43.061
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

7835
03:37:43.061 --> 03:37:43.511
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

7836
03:37:43.511 --> 03:37:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

7837
03:37:43.940 --> 03:37:45.970
<v Speaker 1>So set gps,</v>

7838
03:37:46.210 --> 03:37:47.830
<v Speaker 1>which is global positioning satellites,</v>

7839
03:37:48.040 --> 03:37:49.420
<v Speaker 1>GPS satellites.</v>

7840
03:37:49.421 --> 03:37:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I here,</v>

7841
03:37:49.810 --> 03:37:54.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll Glen ground and GPS global positioning satellites.</v>

7842
03:37:55.811 --> 03:37:56.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what it literally is.</v>

7843
03:37:56.790 --> 03:37:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

7844
03:37:57.160 --> 03:38:02.160
<v Speaker 1>absolutely correct is not like the GPS in your iPhone is run by satellites.</v>

7845
03:38:03.310 --> 03:38:04.170
<v Speaker 1>This is how it works.</v>

7846
03:38:05.250 --> 03:38:05.911
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain.</v>

7847
03:38:05.911 --> 03:38:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain to you Eddie,</v>

7848
03:38:06.851 --> 03:38:07.684
<v Speaker 1>how it works.</v>

7849
03:38:07.870 --> 03:38:08.703
<v Speaker 1>Launch.</v>

7850
03:38:09.080 --> 03:38:10.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7851
03:38:10.151 --> 03:38:10.451
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7852
03:38:10.451 --> 03:38:10.631
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7853
03:38:10.631 --> 03:38:11.050
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

7854
03:38:11.050 --> 03:38:14.500
<v Speaker 1>It's all land based based on youtube science.</v>

7855
03:38:16.100 --> 03:38:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Let's avoid this.</v>

7856
03:38:17.270 --> 03:38:19.330
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking about just being alone,</v>

7857
03:38:19.360 --> 03:38:20.860
<v Speaker 1>being up there without any,</v>

7858
03:38:21.250 --> 03:38:25.090
<v Speaker 1>any connection to what you are used to realize how small you are.</v>

7859
03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

7860
03:38:25.540 --> 03:38:29.440
<v Speaker 1>it's good to get away from the cell phone and the bullshit and I think,</v>

7861
03:38:29.710 --> 03:38:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I think cell phones are awesome.</v>

7862
03:38:31.420 --> 03:38:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I think computers are awesome.</v>

7863
03:38:32.980 --> 03:38:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I think Google is awesome.</v>

7864
03:38:34.320 --> 03:38:34.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

7865
03:38:34.860 --> 03:38:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I think reality shows are awesome.</v>

7866
03:38:36.161 --> 03:38:37.780
<v Speaker 1>I think basketball wives is awesome.</v>

7867
03:38:37.810 --> 03:38:38.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hilarious.</v>

7868
03:38:39.190 --> 03:38:42.720
<v Speaker 1>I think we should enjoy the most fucked up aspects of the greatest time people</v>

7869
03:38:42.730 --> 03:38:43.510
<v Speaker 1>who've ever been alive.</v>

7870
03:38:43.510 --> 03:38:44.410
<v Speaker 1>I think it's amazing,</v>

7871
03:38:44.800 --> 03:38:49.800
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's also good to push all this external dialogue aside and just how</v>

7872
03:38:52.451 --> 03:38:55.960
<v Speaker 1>do you feel about the world and how much of how you feel about the world is</v>

7873
03:38:55.961 --> 03:38:57.970
<v Speaker 1>honest and how much have you feel,</v>

7874
03:38:58.360 --> 03:39:01.960
<v Speaker 1>how you feel about the world is objective and how much of it is based on the</v>

7875
03:39:01.961 --> 03:39:05.740
<v Speaker 1>actual world itself and not the opinions of all these other people around you</v>

7876
03:39:06.040 --> 03:39:08.810
<v Speaker 1>and get a good look at who you are and what you think about that.</v>

7877
03:39:09.020 --> 03:39:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Do that.</v>

7878
03:39:09.460 --> 03:39:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Every night I try to shut myself up like around when I get home from Jujitsu and</v>

7879
03:39:13.271 --> 03:39:14.104
<v Speaker 1>teaching.</v>

7880
03:39:14.590 --> 03:39:16.630
<v Speaker 1>If there's some important email I got to get to,</v>

7881
03:39:16.631 --> 03:39:17.141
<v Speaker 1>I'll get to it.</v>

7882
03:39:17.141 --> 03:39:19.300
<v Speaker 1>If there's an important text or call I got to get to,</v>

7883
03:39:19.301 --> 03:39:24.301
<v Speaker 1>but generally I'm going to watch them bullshit ass TV for about an hour and a</v>

7884
03:39:25.090 --> 03:39:25.340
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>

7885
03:39:25.340 --> 03:39:26.173
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear,</v>

7886
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:27.383
<v Speaker 1>but see when you're in,</v>

7887
03:39:27.520 --> 03:39:28.353
<v Speaker 1>when you're hunting,</v>

7888
03:39:29.860 --> 03:39:32.170
<v Speaker 1>when you're hunting on youtube and watch like the hottest,</v>

7889
03:39:32.830 --> 03:39:33.800
<v Speaker 1>when hunting those,</v>

7890
03:39:33.801 --> 03:39:35.630
<v Speaker 1>those usual escapes don't exist.</v>

7891
03:39:35.900 --> 03:39:37.190
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times for real,</v>

7892
03:39:37.191 --> 03:39:41.180
<v Speaker 1>what you have is just yourself and the sound of your breathing men and dark.</v>

7893
03:39:41.181 --> 03:39:42.014
<v Speaker 1>Very hard.</v>

7894
03:39:42.040 --> 03:39:42.873
<v Speaker 1>It's sound.</v>

7895
03:39:42.930 --> 03:39:44.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit like feeling.</v>

7896
03:39:44.240 --> 03:39:47.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit like being in a free fall if you're not used to it.</v>

7897
03:39:47.690 --> 03:39:48.860
<v Speaker 1>And in the beginning,</v>

7898
03:39:48.861 --> 03:39:52.670
<v Speaker 1>like the first two days you might panic a little bit or you might kind of need</v>

7899
03:39:52.671 --> 03:39:53.540
<v Speaker 1>to hold on hold on thing.</v>

7900
03:39:53.540 --> 03:39:54.590
<v Speaker 1>But let me just back up.</v>

7901
03:39:54.591 --> 03:39:55.424
<v Speaker 1>She's sleeping.</v>

7902
03:39:55.430 --> 03:39:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Hope your sleep bed.</v>

7903
03:39:56.440 --> 03:39:56.751
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

7904
03:39:56.751 --> 03:39:57.260
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

7905
03:39:57.260 --> 03:39:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

7906
03:39:58.070 --> 03:39:59.990
<v Speaker 1>you're the first American at top of Gracie.</v>

7907
03:40:01.350 --> 03:40:02.070
<v Speaker 1>He's no,</v>

7908
03:40:02.070 --> 03:40:03.170
<v Speaker 1>there's no pussy in you.</v>

7909
03:40:03.171 --> 03:40:04.010
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any pussy.</v>

7910
03:40:04.340 --> 03:40:05.173
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>

7911
03:40:05.710 --> 03:40:06.543
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7912
03:40:07.550 --> 03:40:07.851
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7913
03:40:07.851 --> 03:40:08.001
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7914
03:40:08.001 --> 03:40:08.211
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

7915
03:40:08.211 --> 03:40:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Well you are as an slider.</v>

7916
03:40:09.570 --> 03:40:09.910
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

7917
03:40:09.910 --> 03:40:11.930
<v Speaker 1>You honest about the way you feel.</v>

7918
03:40:12.230 --> 03:40:14.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people pretend to try to do that.</v>

7919
03:40:14.270 --> 03:40:17.720
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people pretend that they feel different than the way they actually</v>

7920
03:40:17.721 --> 03:40:18.290
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>

7921
03:40:18.290 --> 03:40:19.130
<v Speaker 1>But when you,</v>

7922
03:40:19.160 --> 03:40:19.470
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

7923
03:40:19.470 --> 03:40:21.410
<v Speaker 1>when push comes to shove and you perform,</v>

7924
03:40:21.650 --> 03:40:23.840
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things like when we went to Sao Paulo,</v>

7925
03:40:23.960 --> 03:40:26.600
<v Speaker 1>like I'd seen you compete in the trials.</v>

7926
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:28.400
<v Speaker 1>You competed in San Diego and the trials.</v>

7927
03:40:28.670 --> 03:40:30.410
<v Speaker 1>And those are the only times I saw you compete.</v>

7928
03:40:30.590 --> 03:40:32.960
<v Speaker 1>I started competing trials and I saw you compete on video.</v>

7929
03:40:32.961 --> 03:40:34.280
<v Speaker 1>We've looked at some video before,</v>

7930
03:40:34.460 --> 03:40:35.330
<v Speaker 1>but when I saw you compete,</v>

7931
03:40:35.410 --> 03:40:37.160
<v Speaker 1>when we flew down to San Paulo,</v>

7932
03:40:37.280 --> 03:40:38.113
<v Speaker 1>Sao Paulo,</v>

7933
03:40:38.210 --> 03:40:39.170
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

7934
03:40:39.200 --> 03:40:42.200
<v Speaker 1>I saw you tap Gustavo's Dante says,</v>

7935
03:40:42.350 --> 03:40:43.940
<v Speaker 1>who's a Brazilian Jujitsu world champion?</v>

7936
03:40:43.940 --> 03:40:44.180
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

7937
03:40:44.180 --> 03:40:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

7938
03:40:45.110 --> 03:40:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Like Eddie Bravo knows how to perform an depression.</v>

7939
03:40:48.570 --> 03:40:50.480
<v Speaker 1>If there's a moment in the fight for me,</v>

7940
03:40:50.490 --> 03:40:51.350
<v Speaker 1>tell you something good about this.</v>

7941
03:40:51.351 --> 03:40:52.161
<v Speaker 1>It's 2003.</v>

7942
03:40:52.161 --> 03:40:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

7943
03:40:52.480 --> 03:40:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Tapped a world champ.</v>

7944
03:40:53.360 --> 03:40:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something happens.</v>

7945
03:40:54.560 --> 03:40:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo has got this dude in a position where a lot of traditional Brazilian</v>

7946
03:40:59.121 --> 03:41:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu referees practitioners might not have understood what was going on.</v>

7947
03:41:03.380 --> 03:41:06.760
<v Speaker 1>And he was moving towards this guy's back and uh,</v>

7948
03:41:06.890 --> 03:41:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Eddie's holding onto him and the referee is insinuating that there's some</v>

7949
03:41:10.101 --> 03:41:12.530
<v Speaker 1>stalling and then it's going to have to be some moving.</v>

7950
03:41:12.710 --> 03:41:13.660
<v Speaker 1>And Eddie turns to him,</v>

7951
03:41:13.661 --> 03:41:14.720
<v Speaker 1>it looks to me was a star and he was,</v>

7952
03:41:14.721 --> 03:41:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm not stoned,</v>

7953
03:41:15.530 --> 03:41:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to take this dude's back and Gustava Dante,</v>

7954
03:41:18.980 --> 03:41:20.060
<v Speaker 1>she says like what?</v>

7955
03:41:20.350 --> 03:41:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

7956
03:41:20.570 --> 03:41:23.780
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden Eddie takes his back and chokes him out and taps him</v>

7957
03:41:24.200 --> 03:41:28.120
<v Speaker 1>and Wa and gets up on a white truck truck.</v>

7958
03:41:28.240 --> 03:41:28.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7959
03:41:28.430 --> 03:41:29.240
<v Speaker 1>when you will truck,</v>

7960
03:41:29.240 --> 03:41:30.200
<v Speaker 1>but when you were in the truck,</v>

7961
03:41:30.201 --> 03:41:33.700
<v Speaker 1>that's when the referee stepped in and said that you were stalling you.</v>

7962
03:41:33.780 --> 03:41:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm not dawn,</v>

7963
03:41:34.760 --> 03:41:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to take us back.</v>

7964
03:41:36.050 --> 03:41:36.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7965
03:41:36.230 --> 03:41:36.440
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

7966
03:41:36.440 --> 03:41:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I was at,</v>

7967
03:41:36.950 --> 03:41:37.731
<v Speaker 1>when he came in,</v>

7968
03:41:37.731 --> 03:41:39.800
<v Speaker 1>what happened was I swept him.</v>

7969
03:41:39.950 --> 03:41:40.940
<v Speaker 1>We both pulled guard.</v>

7970
03:41:40.941 --> 03:41:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I forced,</v>

7971
03:41:41.540 --> 03:41:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I forced pull guard.</v>

7972
03:41:42.801 --> 03:41:43.341
<v Speaker 1>He pulled guard,</v>

7973
03:41:43.341 --> 03:41:43.800
<v Speaker 1>I poke guard.</v>

7974
03:41:43.800 --> 03:41:43.971
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

7975
03:41:43.971 --> 03:41:45.030
<v Speaker 1>I tried to force each other.</v>

7976
03:41:45.320 --> 03:41:47.090
<v Speaker 1>I forced him on top of me,</v>

7977
03:41:47.300 --> 03:41:49.670
<v Speaker 1>swept him and he stayed in a position.</v>

7978
03:41:49.671 --> 03:41:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I had them in side control and he stayed in a position basically fetal away from</v>

7979
03:41:54.651 --> 03:41:55.400
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

7980
03:41:55.400 --> 03:41:56.930
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as he got up his knees,</v>

7981
03:41:56.931 --> 03:41:58.700
<v Speaker 1>I was going to the truck or if he came into me,</v>

7982
03:41:58.701 --> 03:41:59.331
<v Speaker 1>I was going to the truck,</v>

7983
03:41:59.331 --> 03:42:01.700
<v Speaker 1>but he stayed there for minutes.</v>

7984
03:42:01.790 --> 03:42:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Adam inside Katoi to stay there and I'm like,</v>

7985
03:42:03.621 --> 03:42:04.760
<v Speaker 1>are you going to go this way?</v>

7986
03:42:04.760 --> 03:42:05.481
<v Speaker 1>Whatever way you go,</v>

7987
03:42:05.481 --> 03:42:06.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put you on the truck.</v>

7988
03:42:06.680 --> 03:42:07.513
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't do shit.</v>

7989
03:42:07.520 --> 03:42:08.031
<v Speaker 1>He stayed there.</v>

7990
03:42:08.031 --> 03:42:08.751
<v Speaker 1>He knew the system.</v>

7991
03:42:08.751 --> 03:42:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Mark Layman was in his corner and saying don't do nothing.</v>

7992
03:42:11.150 --> 03:42:12.110
<v Speaker 1>So I was like just sitting.</v>

7993
03:42:12.130 --> 03:42:12.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

7994
03:42:12.411 --> 03:42:13.244
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

7995
03:42:13.430 --> 03:42:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I remember saying to the referee though,</v>

7996
03:42:15.231 --> 03:42:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to take his back.</v>

7997
03:42:16.730 --> 03:42:18.570
<v Speaker 1>The reason I take in a long road here at it,</v>

7998
03:42:18.571 --> 03:42:19.700
<v Speaker 1>the reason I said that,</v>

7999
03:42:20.060 --> 03:42:20.331
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

8000
03:42:20.331 --> 03:42:21.430
<v Speaker 1>the reason I said cut,</v>

8001
03:42:21.530 --> 03:42:22.363
<v Speaker 1>we kind of,</v>

8002
03:42:22.490 --> 03:42:25.730
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I kinda wrapped it up and was that uh,</v>

8003
03:42:25.820 --> 03:42:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I knew mark layman stories before.</v>

8004
03:42:27.771 --> 03:42:28.071
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

8005
03:42:28.071 --> 03:42:28.251
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

8006
03:42:28.251 --> 03:42:28.740
<v Speaker 1>that the ref,</v>

8007
03:42:28.740 --> 03:42:29.720
<v Speaker 1>the referees in Brazil,</v>

8008
03:42:29.721 --> 03:42:30.554
<v Speaker 1>they're going to fuck you.</v>

8009
03:42:31.110 --> 03:42:32.010
<v Speaker 1>The Brazilians</v>

8010
03:42:32.010 --> 03:42:32.521
<v Speaker 5>rafts,</v>

8011
03:42:32.521 --> 03:42:33.720
<v Speaker 5>they don't like Americans.</v>

8012
03:42:33.840 --> 03:42:35.640
<v Speaker 5>And I heard that and I'm like all scared.</v>

8013
03:42:35.641 --> 03:42:37.980
<v Speaker 5>So I'm thinking this guy is actually going to stand me up.</v>

8014
03:42:38.040 --> 03:42:40.590
<v Speaker 5>So the only reason I said anything is because I thought,</v>

8015
03:42:40.650 --> 03:42:41.483
<v Speaker 5>oh shit,</v>

8016
03:42:41.580 --> 03:42:43.880
<v Speaker 5>this motherfucker is going to stand me up in Brazil.</v>

8017
03:42:44.240 --> 03:42:45.850
<v Speaker 5>He was talking to you and I said,</v>

8018
03:42:46.610 --> 03:42:47.700
<v Speaker 5>that's exactly what I said.</v>

8019
03:42:48.090 --> 03:42:49.160
<v Speaker 5>The Rub has taking the law.</v>

8020
03:42:49.940 --> 03:42:51.120
<v Speaker 5>But that's what I said</v>

8021
03:42:52.660 --> 03:42:57.060
<v Speaker 5>is you said I'm about to take his bachelor's gangster as fuck.</v>

8022
03:42:57.120 --> 03:42:58.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm about to take his back.</v>

8023
03:42:58.101 --> 03:42:58.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

8024
03:42:58.270 --> 03:43:02.620
<v Speaker 5>And then he took his back and choked him out some kinks to show,</v>

8025
03:43:03.050 --> 03:43:06.510
<v Speaker 5>but the only reason I said that was because I said don't stand me up.</v>

8026
03:43:07.780 --> 03:43:08.700
<v Speaker 5>You didn't want me to stand you up.</v>

8027
03:43:09.080 --> 03:43:10.380
<v Speaker 5>But you said the weight</v>

8028
03:43:12.100 --> 03:43:14.700
<v Speaker 5>because I was actually worried that we're going to stand me up.</v>

8029
03:43:14.790 --> 03:43:15.361
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

8030
03:43:15.361 --> 03:43:18.330
<v Speaker 5>I think that like w w I was thinking about what bothers me the most.</v>

8031
03:43:18.720 --> 03:43:19.710
<v Speaker 5>That's why I appreciate you.</v>

8032
03:43:19.720 --> 03:43:20.940
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about your friend.</v>

8033
03:43:20.941 --> 03:43:24.330
<v Speaker 5>Like what you did is pretty extraordinary and you'd have to take moments in life</v>

8034
03:43:24.331 --> 03:43:26.880
<v Speaker 5>to fucking say that the Wayne McCullough cause one of my favorite people on the</v>

8035
03:43:26.881 --> 03:43:27.511
<v Speaker 5>fucking plan.</v>

8036
03:43:27.511 --> 03:43:27.801
<v Speaker 5>I love it.</v>

8037
03:43:27.801 --> 03:43:28.634
<v Speaker 5>I love that guy.</v>

8038
03:43:28.830 --> 03:43:31.740
<v Speaker 5>And somebody was talking to Wayne with a lack of respect to me,</v>

8039
03:43:31.741 --> 03:43:32.680
<v Speaker 5>like the in the boxing gym.</v>

8040
03:43:32.700 --> 03:43:36.180
<v Speaker 5>They were acting like he was just a guy who holds mitts and I,</v>

8041
03:43:36.330 --> 03:43:37.380
<v Speaker 5>and I said to the guy,</v>

8042
03:43:37.381 --> 03:43:37.740
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

8043
03:43:37.740 --> 03:43:39.330
<v Speaker 5>I got to just stop you for a second.</v>

8044
03:43:39.331 --> 03:43:40.680
<v Speaker 5>This is fucking important to me.</v>

8045
03:43:40.740 --> 03:43:41.191
<v Speaker 5>Can I stop?</v>

8046
03:43:41.191 --> 03:43:42.210
<v Speaker 5>You just really happened.</v>

8047
03:43:42.270 --> 03:43:42.900
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

8048
03:43:42.900 --> 03:43:43.650
<v Speaker 5>you can ask Wayne.</v>

8049
03:43:43.650 --> 03:43:44.483
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

8050
03:43:44.940 --> 03:43:45.451
<v Speaker 5>but listen to,</v>

8051
03:43:45.451 --> 03:43:46.500
<v Speaker 5>he'll get mad at me for saying this,</v>

8052
03:43:46.501 --> 03:43:47.251
<v Speaker 5>but I want to say this.</v>

8053
03:43:47.251 --> 03:43:47.970
<v Speaker 5>Listen to this.</v>

8054
03:43:47.970 --> 03:43:49.860
<v Speaker 5>You asked such a Dick,</v>

8055
03:43:51.580 --> 03:43:52.413
<v Speaker 5>Dick,</v>

8056
03:43:54.310 --> 03:43:55.020
<v Speaker 5>Dick,</v>

8057
03:43:55.020 --> 03:43:55.340
<v Speaker 5>buddy.</v>

8058
03:43:55.340 --> 03:43:56.010
<v Speaker 5>But listen,</v>

8059
03:43:56.010 --> 03:43:56.610
<v Speaker 5>this is my point.</v>

8060
03:43:56.610 --> 03:43:58.410
<v Speaker 5>My point is exactly what you were saying with Eddie.</v>

8061
03:43:58.620 --> 03:43:59.070
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

8062
03:43:59.070 --> 03:44:00.870
<v Speaker 5>a legit boxer didn't say this to you.</v>

8063
03:44:01.500 --> 03:44:01.980
<v Speaker 5>What's that?</v>

8064
03:44:01.980 --> 03:44:02.910
<v Speaker 5>A legit guidance.</v>

8065
03:44:03.730 --> 03:44:04.221
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

8066
03:44:04.221 --> 03:44:04.930
<v Speaker 5>And I said this,</v>

8067
03:44:04.930 --> 03:44:05.340
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>

8068
03:44:05.340 --> 03:44:08.490
<v Speaker 5>I said crossfit dude way super pale.</v>

8069
03:44:08.910 --> 03:44:11.530
<v Speaker 5>The way the person was tasked gags to trying to be,</v>

8070
03:44:12.690 --> 03:44:16.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to kind of talk around this because somebody wasn't treating Wayne</v>

8071
03:44:16.471 --> 03:44:17.700
<v Speaker 5>with the kind of respect he deserves.</v>

8072
03:44:17.850 --> 03:44:18.690
<v Speaker 5>And I tried to explain,</v>

8073
03:44:18.691 --> 03:44:18.901
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

8074
03:44:18.901 --> 03:44:19.260
<v Speaker 5>listen man,</v>

8075
03:44:19.260 --> 03:44:20.310
<v Speaker 5>let me explain something cause this stuff.</v>

8076
03:44:20.340 --> 03:44:22.080
<v Speaker 5>He was a fucking world champion.</v>

8077
03:44:22.170 --> 03:44:23.890
<v Speaker 5>He was a world like WBC Carey.</v>

8078
03:44:24.090 --> 03:44:24.871
<v Speaker 5>Who are we talking about?</v>

8079
03:44:24.871 --> 03:44:26.090
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about the garbage man.</v>

8080
03:44:26.360 --> 03:44:28.380
<v Speaker 5>A famous person like I don't want you to say his name.</v>

8081
03:44:28.381 --> 03:44:29.880
<v Speaker 5>The dude working at Carl's Jr.</v>

8082
03:44:30.060 --> 03:44:30.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

8083
03:44:30.240 --> 03:44:32.550
<v Speaker 5>What kind of guy is he dropped.</v>

8084
03:44:33.670 --> 03:44:37.080
<v Speaker 5>He was a guy who was trying to box at the actual boxer.</v>

8085
03:44:37.140 --> 03:44:37.510
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

8086
03:44:37.510 --> 03:44:38.020
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

8087
03:44:38.020 --> 03:44:38.210
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

8088
03:44:38.210 --> 03:44:39.043
<v Speaker 5>he's just a guy.</v>

8089
03:44:39.570 --> 03:44:39.841
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

8090
03:44:39.841 --> 03:44:41.300
<v Speaker 5>just somebody who was like calling him gray.</v>

8091
03:44:41.330 --> 03:44:41.700
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

8092
03:44:41.700 --> 03:44:43.000
<v Speaker 5>Who's somebody who's locked.</v>

8093
03:44:43.010 --> 03:44:43.220
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

8094
03:44:43.220 --> 03:44:43.620
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

8095
03:44:43.620 --> 03:44:45.240
<v Speaker 5>So Greg was treating Wayne,</v>

8096
03:44:46.440 --> 03:44:47.273
<v Speaker 5>Wayne,</v>

8097
03:44:47.300 --> 03:44:47.600
<v Speaker 5>Greg,</v>

8098
03:44:47.600 --> 03:44:47.911
<v Speaker 5>the screening.</v>

8099
03:44:47.911 --> 03:44:48.360
<v Speaker 5>Wayne like,</v>

8100
03:44:48.360 --> 03:44:49.140
<v Speaker 5>Oh hey,</v>

8101
03:44:49.140 --> 03:44:50.790
<v Speaker 5>hold these myths from a essentially,</v>

8102
03:44:51.120 --> 03:44:51.890
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

8103
03:44:51.890 --> 03:44:52.440
<v Speaker 5>And I kind of,</v>

8104
03:44:52.440 --> 03:44:52.960
<v Speaker 5>for me,</v>

8105
03:44:52.960 --> 03:44:53.793
<v Speaker 5>that's what he does.</v>

8106
03:44:54.600 --> 03:44:54.991
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

8107
03:44:54.991 --> 03:44:55.824
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't.</v>

8108
03:44:56.370 --> 03:44:56.611
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

8109
03:44:56.611 --> 03:44:57.010
<v Speaker 5>he's got a,</v>

8110
03:44:57.010 --> 03:44:59.310
<v Speaker 5>he's got a legit guy who was fighting right now for our big fight.</v>

8111
03:45:01.020 --> 03:45:04.170
<v Speaker 5>But the point I'm making is that the point I'm making is that you in life,</v>

8112
03:45:04.320 --> 03:45:06.690
<v Speaker 5>when you see somebody who accomplished a great deal,</v>

8113
03:45:06.810 --> 03:45:08.130
<v Speaker 5>you got to fucking give it up.</v>

8114
03:45:08.340 --> 03:45:09.630
<v Speaker 5>You have to have respect for that.</v>

8115
03:45:09.750 --> 03:45:11.010
<v Speaker 5>You have to have gratitude for it.</v>

8116
03:45:11.011 --> 03:45:12.060
<v Speaker 5>You have to market.</v>

8117
03:45:12.061 --> 03:45:14.070
<v Speaker 5>You have to treat it with some reverence.</v>

8118
03:45:14.730 --> 03:45:15.810
<v Speaker 5>Reverence is important.</v>

8119
03:45:16.150 --> 03:45:18.630
<v Speaker 5>We can't use him as an example.</v>

8120
03:45:19.560 --> 03:45:20.341
<v Speaker 5>Here's what is important.</v>

8121
03:45:20.341 --> 03:45:21.780
<v Speaker 5>There's no reason to disrespect him.</v>

8122
03:45:22.060 --> 03:45:23.310
<v Speaker 5>He's not like he's doing anything.</v>

8123
03:45:23.370 --> 03:45:24.001
<v Speaker 5>Even if you will,</v>

8124
03:45:24.001 --> 03:45:24.571
<v Speaker 5>to a legend.</v>

8125
03:45:24.571 --> 03:45:25.260
<v Speaker 5>You should.</v>

8126
03:45:25.260 --> 03:45:25.680
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>

8127
03:45:25.680 --> 03:45:25.951
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

8128
03:45:25.951 --> 03:45:26.970
<v Speaker 5>but it's more than that.</v>

8129
03:45:26.971 --> 03:45:30.250
<v Speaker 5>You know that he's highly accomplished in the sport that you're attempting</v>

8130
03:45:30.330 --> 03:45:30.700
<v Speaker 2>to metal.</v>

8131
03:45:30.700 --> 03:45:31.533
<v Speaker 2>Say Olympics.</v>

8132
03:45:31.630 --> 03:45:32.463
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

8133
03:45:32.930 --> 03:45:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Get your fucking champion boxer.</v>

8134
03:45:34.780 --> 03:45:35.613
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

8135
03:45:36.280 --> 03:45:37.390
<v Speaker 2>but here's what I'm saying.</v>

8136
03:45:37.400 --> 03:45:40.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like why would you want to say bad things about him ever?</v>

8137
03:45:40.540 --> 03:45:41.373
<v Speaker 2>But people,</v>

8138
03:45:41.380 --> 03:45:42.520
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying is people,</v>

8139
03:45:42.521 --> 03:45:42.821
<v Speaker 2>they might,</v>

8140
03:45:42.821 --> 03:45:43.390
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

8141
03:45:43.390 --> 03:45:43.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8142
03:45:43.701 --> 03:45:47.710
<v Speaker 2>But people who don't express gratitude like that and don't like they know older</v>

8143
03:45:47.711 --> 03:45:48.371
<v Speaker 2>boxer though.</v>

8144
03:45:48.371 --> 03:45:50.440
<v Speaker 2>So my hearing's young guy who has no idea.</v>

8145
03:45:50.560 --> 03:45:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I did.</v>

8146
03:45:51.340 --> 03:45:52.173
<v Speaker 2>Here's what it is.</v>

8147
03:45:53.050 --> 03:45:53.920
<v Speaker 2>That's what bothered me.</v>

8148
03:45:54.280 --> 03:45:58.450
<v Speaker 2>People know that when you have something and it's amazing and then you lose it,</v>

8149
03:45:58.451 --> 03:46:00.700
<v Speaker 2>you realize you're not as great as you once were.</v>

8150
03:46:00.760 --> 03:46:04.800
<v Speaker 2>So they recognize that Wayne McCullough was a world champion boxer,</v>

8151
03:46:04.801 --> 03:46:07.060
<v Speaker 2>a silver medalist in the Olympics,</v>

8152
03:46:07.240 --> 03:46:08.710
<v Speaker 2>and it's athletic peak.</v>

8153
03:46:08.711 --> 03:46:11.740
<v Speaker 2>He was lazy love throughout the land and he's not there anymore.</v>

8154
03:46:11.950 --> 03:46:16.810
<v Speaker 2>So they recognize this as an opportunity to see someone who has diminished from</v>

8155
03:46:16.811 --> 03:46:19.060
<v Speaker 2>the previous ice and they try to attack.</v>

8156
03:46:19.090 --> 03:46:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

8157
03:46:19.760 --> 03:46:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Try to attack him to make him feel bad because they know psychologically that</v>

8158
03:46:23.921 --> 03:46:27.760
<v Speaker 2>this has to have some sort of an effect on the way his self esteem because they</v>

8159
03:46:27.761 --> 03:46:30.400
<v Speaker 2>never touched because they never fucking came close to that kind of</v>

8160
03:46:30.520 --> 03:46:32.470
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment doing it.</v>

8161
03:46:32.630 --> 03:46:34.110
<v Speaker 2>It's time to bring him down.</v>

8162
03:46:34.540 --> 03:46:35.840
<v Speaker 2>It's an animal instinct,</v>

8163
03:46:36.060 --> 03:46:36.640
<v Speaker 2>an animalistic,</v>

8164
03:46:36.640 --> 03:46:37.550
<v Speaker 2>and that's a bummer.</v>

8165
03:46:37.580 --> 03:46:38.980
<v Speaker 2>But Shit,</v>

8166
03:46:39.070 --> 03:46:41.150
<v Speaker 2>haters are lose.</v>

8167
03:46:41.151 --> 03:46:42.040
<v Speaker 2>Exactly correct.</v>

8168
03:46:42.120 --> 03:46:43.030
<v Speaker 2>They have to be,</v>

8169
03:46:43.031 --> 03:46:45.010
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I was experiencing recently.</v>

8170
03:46:45.190 --> 03:46:47.700
<v Speaker 2>A winner and also be haters.</v>

8171
03:46:47.740 --> 03:46:48.520
<v Speaker 2>They don't go.</v>

8172
03:46:48.520 --> 03:46:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

8173
03:46:49.350 --> 03:46:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8174
03:46:49.720 --> 03:46:50.560
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I was trying to say.</v>

8175
03:46:50.561 --> 03:46:51.040
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

8176
03:46:51.040 --> 03:46:55.690
<v Speaker 2>if you can't celebrate and have some reverence for what that do did or anybody</v>

8180
03:46:58.291 --> 03:46:58.630
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You see such a random movie trail that she goes a little bit.</v>

8371
03:52:26.040 --> 03:52:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

8372
03:52:26.650 --> 03:52:28.380
<v Speaker 1>what were we trying to encourage?</v>

03:52:28.381 --> 03:52:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo and to bringing back any bravo radio and you want to talk about</v>

<v Speaker 1>tickling funny.</v>

8375
03:52:32.971 --> 03:52:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't have,</v>

8376
03:52:33.390 --> 03:52:35.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to get punched in the face and work as a podcast.</v>

8377
03:52:36.000 --> 03:52:36.833
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

8378
03:52:37.260 --> 03:52:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I loved and doing my podcast.</v>

8379
03:52:39.270 --> 03:52:41.070
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like sometimes,</v>

8380
03:52:41.520 --> 03:52:43.350
<v Speaker 1>you know when you do a podcast and you've got to,</v>

8381
03:52:43.351 --> 03:52:46.380
<v Speaker 1>you get new audience and you've got to tell the fucking same story over and</v>

8382
03:52:46.381 --> 03:52:47.214
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

8383
03:52:47.430 --> 03:52:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I hate saying the same.</v>

8384
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:50.090
<v Speaker 1>You know when people start saying over here,</v>

8385
03:52:50.100 --> 03:52:50.930
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

8386
03:52:50.930 --> 03:52:52.590
<v Speaker 1>why would you say the same story over?</v>

8387
03:52:52.591 --> 03:52:54.840
<v Speaker 1>And it comes up here on a podcast.</v>

8388
03:52:54.841 --> 03:52:55.540
<v Speaker 1>I've done that.</v>

8389
03:52:55.540 --> 03:52:57.600
<v Speaker 1>It's you gotta say you gotta kind of,</v>

8390
03:52:57.630 --> 03:53:00.360
<v Speaker 1>you got to get an abbreviate it and say I've talked about this before,</v>

8391
03:53:00.540 --> 03:53:01.410
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately,</v>

8392
03:53:01.411 --> 03:53:04.260
<v Speaker 1>unless that's like cut up in like a clip,</v>

8393
03:53:04.590 --> 03:53:07.740
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for people just started listening to your podcast to find that.</v>

8394
03:53:07.980 --> 03:53:11.940
<v Speaker 1>So it becomes annoying cause you're speaking of so many people like you were</v>

8395
03:53:11.941 --> 03:53:12.691
<v Speaker 1>getting like what?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Whatever you're getting nothing.</v>

8401
03:53:17.870 --> 03:53:18.240

03:57:42.520 --> 03:57:43.030
<v Speaker 2>They can't stand.</v>

8569
03:57:43.030 --> 03:57:43.880
<v Speaker 2>It's more legit.</v>

8570
03:57:43.940 --> 03:57:44.290
<v Speaker 2>What will,</v>

8571
03:57:44.290 --> 03:57:45.860
<v Speaker 2>if you put something before kid for me,</v>

8572
03:57:45.861 --> 03:57:46.694
<v Speaker 2>what would you call me?</v>

8573
03:57:47.480 --> 03:57:48.313
<v Speaker 2>The old kid,</v>

8574
03:57:49.040 --> 03:57:50.780
<v Speaker 2>I call him creepy creepy kid for sure.</v>

8575
03:57:51.500 --> 03:57:52.250
<v Speaker 2>The perfect kid.</v>

8576
03:57:52.250 --> 03:57:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Mildly Delusional Kid.</v>

8577
03:57:53.800 --> 03:57:54.633
<v Speaker 2>Briefly.</v>

8578
03:57:54.920 --> 03:57:59.300
<v Speaker 2>The wrinkle kid align kid the lying about the fact that my dad,</v>

8579
03:57:59.360 --> 03:58:02.930
<v Speaker 2>how about the fact that I told the story like a really good long story dramatic</v>

8580
03:58:03.110 --> 03:58:05.600
<v Speaker 2>and my father in front of a bunch of people goes like this,</v>

8581
03:58:05.690 --> 03:58:06.800
<v Speaker 2>like friends and he goes,</v>

8582
03:58:07.400 --> 03:58:10.070
<v Speaker 2>now how much of that story do you think is actually true?</v>

8583
03:58:10.280 --> 03:58:11.113
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>

8584
03:58:11.310 --> 03:58:11.641
<v Speaker 2>mother.</v>

8585
03:58:11.641 --> 03:58:11.970
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

8586
03:58:11.970 --> 03:58:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Well the problem is you understand drama so well that you'll occasionally</v>

8587
03:58:15.501 --> 03:58:19.200
<v Speaker 2>sprinkle it in as long as you keep the ethics of the original idea of storing</v>

8588
03:58:19.280 --> 03:58:19.940
<v Speaker 2>about sir.</v>

8589
03:58:19.940 --> 03:58:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Don't know what you're talking to.</v>

8590
03:58:21.820 --> 03:58:25.700
<v Speaker 2>You are more concerned with the entertainment value of what you're saying and</v>

8591
03:58:25.701 --> 03:58:27.380
<v Speaker 2>you are the voracity of the true.</v>

8592
03:58:27.390 --> 03:58:29.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm already involved statements.</v>

8593
03:58:30.860 --> 03:58:31.940
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin Button.</v>

8594
03:58:32.010 --> 03:58:33.650
<v Speaker 2>A case is showing,</v>

8595
03:58:33.860 --> 03:58:38.060
<v Speaker 2>why are we showing that Guy Jamie decided to spice it up with a random shows</v>

8596
03:58:38.061 --> 03:58:40.280
<v Speaker 2>like a naked man in the mirror with glasses on.</v>

8597
03:58:40.340 --> 03:58:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8598
03:58:41.060 --> 03:58:41.893
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin Button.</v>

8599
03:58:42.740 --> 03:58:44.150
<v Speaker 2>I think overall like you,</v>

8600
03:58:44.180 --> 03:58:47.930
<v Speaker 2>you would never change the actual results of the story you're talking about.</v>

8601
03:58:47.960 --> 03:58:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

8602
03:58:48.230 --> 03:58:51.470
<v Speaker 2>But you would flavor that story with additional spices that weren't in the</v>

8603
03:58:51.471 --> 03:58:52.304
<v Speaker 2>original recipe.</v>

8604
03:58:52.470 --> 03:58:53.303
<v Speaker 2>Like a lawyer.</v>

8605
03:58:53.330 --> 03:58:55.670
<v Speaker 2>You'll throw some shit in there to make it better.</v>

8606
03:58:55.700 --> 03:58:56.750
<v Speaker 2>And I appreciate that.</v>

8607
03:58:56.780 --> 03:58:58.220
<v Speaker 2>We took a lie detector test,</v>

8608
03:58:58.221 --> 03:58:59.150
<v Speaker 2>but as a good friend,</v>

8609
03:58:59.180 --> 03:59:02.510
<v Speaker 2>I have to throw things through a filter and when you tell me something,</v>

8610
03:59:02.511 --> 03:59:04.610
<v Speaker 2>I have to go skeptical.</v>

8611
03:59:05.570 --> 03:59:06.403
<v Speaker 2>Skeptical.</v>

8612
03:59:06.680 --> 03:59:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I love this dude.</v>

8613
03:59:07.611 --> 03:59:09.110
<v Speaker 2>But let me see where I go with this.</v>

8614
03:59:09.140 --> 03:59:11.710
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] he goes [inaudible] yeah.</v>

8615
03:59:12.200 --> 03:59:12.501
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

8616
03:59:12.501 --> 03:59:13.490
<v Speaker 2>I took a lie detector test.</v>

8617
03:59:13.491 --> 03:59:13.851
<v Speaker 2>He asked me,</v>

8618
03:59:13.851 --> 03:59:14.181
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

8619
03:59:14.181 --> 03:59:16.730
<v Speaker 2>ask me all the tech went on your site or your psycho.</v>

8620
03:59:16.790 --> 03:59:17.091
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

8621
03:59:17.091 --> 03:59:18.600
<v Speaker 2>the problem was it then I should go to your,</v>

8622
03:59:19.430 --> 03:59:21.380
<v Speaker 2>that's us when Brian tells any story.</v>

8623
03:59:21.650 --> 03:59:22.610
<v Speaker 2>So what happened?</v>

8624
03:59:22.670 --> 03:59:22.821
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

8625
03:59:22.821 --> 03:59:23.540
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

8626
03:59:23.540 --> 03:59:23.931
<v Speaker 2>she goes,</v>

8627
03:59:23.931 --> 03:59:26.830
<v Speaker 2>I live across the board about everything that she said.</v>

8628
03:59:26.890 --> 03:59:29.690
<v Speaker 2>He lies about everything you are true of the ass mate to see.</v>

8629
03:59:29.691 --> 03:59:30.081
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

8630
03:59:30.081 --> 03:59:31.100
<v Speaker 2>it just didn't work out.</v>

8631
03:59:31.101 --> 03:59:33.170
<v Speaker 2>So I went and I sweat.</v>

8632
03:59:33.300 --> 03:59:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing about a lie detector test.</v>

8633
03:59:35.120 --> 03:59:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

8634
03:59:35.480 --> 03:59:36.260
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

8635
03:59:36.260 --> 03:59:37.910
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you're measuring something,</v>

8636
03:59:37.911 --> 03:59:41.170
<v Speaker 2>you're changing what that thing is because you're making someone conscious of</v>

8637
03:59:41.171 --> 03:59:42.230
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you're measuring it.</v>

8638
03:59:42.590 --> 03:59:47.590
<v Speaker 2>And so if you were a completely self conscious person who is always aware of how</v>

8639
03:59:47.691 --> 03:59:48.560
<v Speaker 2>people are viewing him,</v>

8640
03:59:48.710 --> 03:59:49.820
<v Speaker 2>like Brian Cowen,</v>

8641
03:59:50.030 --> 03:59:51.740
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reasons why you're so entertaining.</v>

8642
03:59:51.770 --> 03:59:53.360
<v Speaker 2>It's cause you really want everybody around you.</v>

8643
03:59:53.480 --> 03:59:54.500
<v Speaker 2>You're very accommodating.</v>

8644
03:59:54.560 --> 03:59:54.831
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

8645
03:59:54.831 --> 03:59:56.000
<v Speaker 2>And you're a very like,</v>

8646
03:59:56.030 --> 03:59:56.863
<v Speaker 2>like Brian,</v>

8647
03:59:57.020 --> 03:59:58.160
<v Speaker 2>like way more than me.</v>

8648
03:59:58.640 --> 04:00:01.250
<v Speaker 2>He suffers fools were around fools.</v>

8649
04:00:01.251 --> 04:00:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

8650
04:00:01.580 --> 04:00:03.950
<v Speaker 2>I am seeing us fucking wasted time.</v>

8651
04:00:03.980 --> 04:00:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Is a cloud common.</v>

8652
04:00:05.180 --> 04:00:06.140
<v Speaker 2>We've got to get in the car.</v>

8653
04:00:06.141 --> 04:00:06.711
<v Speaker 2>We got to get out of.</v>

8654
04:00:06.711 --> 04:00:07.544
<v Speaker 2>Brian loves him.</v>

8655
04:00:07.780 --> 04:00:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

8656
04:00:08.270 --> 04:00:08.900
<v Speaker 2>He loves it.</v>

8657
04:00:08.900 --> 04:00:09.710
<v Speaker 2>He loves it.</v>

8658
04:00:09.710 --> 04:00:11.920
<v Speaker 2>He loves him a doofus and loves him in.</v>

8659
04:00:12.250 --> 04:00:14.060
<v Speaker 2>But it's because he's so accommodating.</v>

8660
04:00:14.090 --> 04:00:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8661
04:00:14.450 --> 04:00:15.620
<v Speaker 2>He's like such a nice guy.</v>

8662
04:00:15.621 --> 04:00:17.520
<v Speaker 2>He's a cop and I can't do it any.</v>

8663
04:00:17.521 --> 04:00:20.120
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite pastimes is to go through my life and think about</v>

8664
04:00:20.130 --> 04:00:23.550
<v Speaker 1>all how much time I would have saved if I had just walked away from certain</v>

8665
04:00:23.551 --> 04:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>people and just listened to me.</v>

8666
04:00:25.230 --> 04:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>How many times have I told you yes,</v>

8667
04:00:27.270 --> 04:00:28.830
<v Speaker 1>this has been a dozen times.</v>

8668
04:00:28.831 --> 04:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of skies retarded.</v>

8669
04:00:30.360 --> 04:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>This girl's crazy.</v>

8670
04:00:31.430 --> 04:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8671
04:00:31.620 --> 04:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Like we've got to get away from him.</v>

8672
04:00:32.880 --> 04:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8673
04:00:33.120 --> 04:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy is gonna fucking take you to jail.</v>

8674
04:00:36.610 --> 04:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>You and I will both tell him about the same guy.</v>

8675
04:00:39.510 --> 04:00:39.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

8676
04:00:39.661 --> 04:00:40.500

<v Speaker 1>hold up.</v>

8678
04:00:41.340 --> 04:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't know the same guy?</v>

8679
04:00:42.421 --> 04:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

8680
04:00:42.930 --> 04:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>See I bet cha no you do not.</v>

8681
04:00:45.870 --> 04:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I know by 1994</v>

8682
04:00:52.510 --> 04:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I can count from for 28 years old.</v>

8683
04:00:55.981 --> 04:00:56.431
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

8684

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

04:00:57.421 --> 04:00:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how you have those uh,</v>

8687
04:00:59.250 --> 04:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>those goggles that people wear when they go swimming,</v>

8688
04:01:01.381 --> 04:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>they doing laps in the pool.</v>

8689
04:01:02.670 --> 04:01:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you took those and you painted black around everything except like a</v>

8690
04:01:08.311 --> 04:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>pencil eraser and the seven in the center of each one of those.</v>

8691
04:01:12.090 --> 04:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you looked at the world.</v>

8692
04:01:13.760 --> 04:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>That's how Brian would narrow life.</v>

04:01:38.670 --> 04:01:38.941
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

8708
04:01:38.941 --> 04:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

<v Speaker 1>She was fucking really smart.</v>

8729
04:01:56.040 --> 04:01:56.811
<v Speaker 1>And I called Joe like,</v>

8730
04:01:56.811 --> 04:01:56.931
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

8731
04:01:56.931 --> 04:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>I have to call you because I,</v>

8732
04:01:57.901 --> 04:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>you need to know that I'm a fraud.</v>

8733
04:01:59.251 --> 04:02:00.300
<v Speaker 1>But if I tell you I'm a fraud,</v>

8734
04:02:00.450 --> 04:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good bro.</v>

8735
04:02:01.860 --> 04:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm laying books out about around my fucking place.</v>

8736
04:02:04.950 --> 04:02:06.740
<v Speaker 1>So the girl things I read and I'm keeping,</v>

8737
04:02:06.930 --> 04:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm opening the pages,</v>

8738
04:02:09.840 --> 04:02:12.870
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that I'm telling my my best friend and I'm doing that,</v>

8739
04:02:13.070 --> 04:02:18.070
<v Speaker 1>it means I'm not a fraud like I'm lying but I'm not lying to you is a true</v>

8740
04:02:18.571 --> 04:02:18.991
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>

8741
04:02:18.991 --> 04:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>but the chronology code,</v>

8742
04:02:20.340 --> 04:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>the chronology is broken.</v>

8743
04:02:22.050 --> 04:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I had informed him first that he was a fraud with his books on the coffee table</v>

8744
04:02:26.430 --> 04:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>and I knew it and he was and he denied it and then admitted it and then called</v>

8745
04:02:30.991 --> 04:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

8746
04:02:31.500 --> 04:02:31.981
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

8747
04:02:31.981 --> 04:02:32.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the actual,</v>

8748
04:02:32.831 --> 04:02:33.330
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

8749
04:02:33.330 --> 04:02:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

8750
04:02:34.410 --> 04:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>It's 100% true,</v>

8751
04:02:35.910 --> 04:02:40.910
<v Speaker 1>but you did come clean actually you have to come clean.</v>

8752
04:02:41.131 --> 04:02:42.570
<v Speaker 1>You cannot lie to your friends.</v>

8753
04:02:42.571 --> 04:02:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Your friends have to know who you are.</v>

8754
04:02:43.950 --> 04:02:44.161
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

8755
04:02:44.161 --> 04:02:44.911
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that funny?</v>

8756
04:02:44.911 --> 04:02:49.911
<v Speaker 1>Is that like like being a guy who was like secretly deep is attractive somehow</v>

8757
04:02:51.600 --> 04:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>to the genetics of a woman.</v>

8758
04:02:52.891 --> 04:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>It's searching for a man with character because the guy who secretly deep who</v>

8759
04:02:56.611 --> 04:02:57.444
<v Speaker 1>can deal with shit,</v>

8760
04:02:57.450 --> 04:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>maybe it gets up in the morning,</v>

8761
04:02:58.710 --> 04:03:01.140
<v Speaker 1>sets his alarm clock or 4:00 PM and goes running up a hill.</v>

8762
04:03:01.290 --> 04:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>That guy can understand what it's like to overcome pressure and that's,</v>

8763
04:03:06.030 --> 04:03:11.030
<v Speaker 1>that's a peeling to women's genetics because they know that this whole</v>

8764
04:03:11.671 --> 04:03:14.070
<v Speaker 1>supermarket highway thing,</v>

8765
04:03:14.340 --> 04:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>this ain't going to last if shit hits the fan.</v>

8766
04:03:16.990 --> 04:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>This is great</v>

8767
04:03:18.040 --> 04:03:20.800
<v Speaker 2>for like a small brief window of history,</v>

8768
04:03:21.010 --> 04:03:24.910
<v Speaker 2>but there's a thing called a super volcano and it's sitting in Yellowstone</v>

8769
04:03:24.911 --> 04:03:29.911
<v Speaker 2>national park and it's a continent killer and every six to 800,000 years he</v>

8770
04:03:30.681 --> 04:03:35.681
<v Speaker 2>fucking explodes and everything dies and the earth gets cool because it goes</v>

8771
04:03:36.461 --> 04:03:41.461
<v Speaker 2>into nuclear winter and the last time it happened was 800,000 years ago and it's</v>

8772
04:03:41.771 --> 04:03:42.604
<v Speaker 2>fucking dumb.</v>

8773
04:03:43.540 --> 04:03:45.340
<v Speaker 2>So they need to know you better,</v>

8774
04:03:45.341 --> 04:03:46.174
<v Speaker 2>enjoy this,</v>

8775
04:03:46.570 --> 04:03:47.261
<v Speaker 2>enjoy this.</v>

8776
04:03:47.261 --> 04:03:49.500
<v Speaker 2>So fuck the muscular guys that wake up in the morning,</v>

8777
04:03:49.501 --> 04:03:50.140
<v Speaker 2>be ready.</v>

8778
04:03:50.140 --> 04:03:50.591
<v Speaker 2>You listen,</v>

8779
04:03:50.591 --> 04:03:55.591
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand for what a fucking volcano lava,</v>

8780
04:03:56.381 --> 04:03:58.330
<v Speaker 2>you pausing and I hunt.</v>

8781
04:03:58.570 --> 04:04:00.220

8783
04:04:02.261 --> 04:04:03.094
<v Speaker 2>This is what I think.</v>

8784
04:04:03.230 --> 04:04:04.390
<v Speaker 2>You can't control your breathing.</v>

8785
04:04:04.391 --> 04:04:06.250
<v Speaker 2>We're going to starve the universe.</v>

8786
04:04:06.520 --> 04:04:11.520
<v Speaker 2>The universe is just as content with us being hit by a fucking asteroid and</v>

8787
04:04:11.741 --> 04:04:14.920
<v Speaker 2>being knocked back down to single celled organism.</v>

8788
04:04:14.921 --> 04:04:16.630
<v Speaker 2>This is as it is.</v>

8789
04:04:16.680 --> 04:04:16.871
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

8790
04:04:16.871 --> 04:04:20.410
<v Speaker 2>they don't kill us succeeding and figuring out a way to get to Mars.</v>

8791
04:04:20.590 --> 04:04:22.160
<v Speaker 2>The universe is just as good,</v>

8792
04:04:22.240 --> 04:04:23.920
<v Speaker 2>just as happy with either result.</v>

8793
04:04:23.950 --> 04:04:28.210
<v Speaker 2>You can find out all this paperwork in that fucking air force base in Laurel</v>

8794
04:04:28.210 --> 04:04:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Canyon.</v>

8795
04:04:28.710 --> 04:04:32.940
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

8796
04:04:33.460 --> 04:04:34.293
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>

8797
04:04:35.220 --> 04:04:36.250
<v Speaker 2>I am going to listen.</v>

8798
04:04:36.310 --> 04:04:37.870
<v Speaker 2>I get home Tom's,</v>

8799
04:04:38.000 --> 04:04:41.290
<v Speaker 2>there can be no doubt that the government has tried to manipulate the</v>

8800
04:04:41.291 --> 04:04:43.060
<v Speaker 2>consciousness of the population.</v>

8801
04:04:43.650 --> 04:04:44.470
<v Speaker 2>It can be no doubt,</v>

8802
04:04:44.470 --> 04:04:45.303
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

8803
04:04:45.530 --> 04:04:47.860
<v Speaker 2>power over people form should do it.</v>

8804
04:04:47.861 --> 04:04:48.760
<v Speaker 2>And Nixon was,</v>

8805
04:04:48.910 --> 04:04:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Nixon was like a fucking total sneaky piece of shit.</v>

8806
04:04:52.780 --> 04:04:54.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what Nixon is hold Dame hook.</v>

8807
04:04:54.671 --> 04:04:58.870
<v Speaker 2>They proven that Nixon's war on drugs was about controlling the civil rights</v>

8808
04:04:58.871 --> 04:05:01.060
<v Speaker 2>movement and controlling the antiwar movement.</v>

8809
04:05:01.061 --> 04:05:02.530
<v Speaker 2>It's 100% been proven.</v>

8810
04:05:02.680 --> 04:05:06.250
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things that's being discussed right now in mainstream newspapers</v>

8811
04:05:06.251 --> 04:05:07.600
<v Speaker 2>and mainstream magazines.</v>

8812
04:05:07.900 --> 04:05:11.710
<v Speaker 2>The reason why they went after marijuana and mushrooms and LSD is cause they</v>

8813
04:05:11.711 --> 04:05:12.550
<v Speaker 2>wanted a silence.</v>

8814
04:05:12.551 --> 04:05:15.190
<v Speaker 2>The antiwar people in the civil rights period,</v>

8815
04:05:15.240 --> 04:05:15.930
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

8816
04:05:15.930 --> 04:05:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

8817
04:05:16.310 --> 04:05:17.650
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't create the doors.</v>

8818
04:05:17.920 --> 04:05:18.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

8819
04:05:18.250 --> 04:05:19.430
<v Speaker 2>what's your split?</v>

8820
04:05:19.750 --> 04:05:20.650
<v Speaker 2>But they did,</v>

8821
04:05:20.680 --> 04:05:21.850
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't mean to.</v>

8822
04:05:21.880 --> 04:05:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>

8823
04:05:22.630 --> 04:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>you can't engineer beautiful creativity.</v>

8824
04:05:25.150 --> 04:05:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Don't you love her badly?</v>

8825
04:05:27.100 --> 04:05:27.933
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

8826
04:05:28.030 --> 04:05:28.863
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that</v>

8827
04:05:31.330 --> 04:05:32.650
<v Speaker 2>reg on through</v>

8828
04:05:34.400 --> 04:05:35.233
<v Speaker 2>that guy.</v>

8829
04:05:36.790 --> 04:05:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>

8830
04:05:37.100 --> 04:05:37.630
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

8831
04:05:37.630 --> 04:05:40.960
<v Speaker 2>you're a brilliant creative guy and one of the reasons why you're brilliant</v>

8832
04:05:41.130 --> 04:05:41.560
<v Speaker 2>creative,</v>

8833
04:05:41.560 --> 04:05:43.060
<v Speaker 2>thank you this because you,</v>

8834
04:05:43.090 --> 04:05:44.980
<v Speaker 2>you were repressed as a child.</v>

8835
04:05:45.190 --> 04:05:48.520
<v Speaker 2>You encountered a lot of stress and bullshit and a lot of,</v>

8836
04:05:48.521 --> 04:05:48.911
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

8837
04:05:48.911 --> 04:05:52.360
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that were like counting against you.</v>

8838
04:05:52.400 --> 04:05:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8839
04:05:52.630 --> 04:05:57.220
<v Speaker 2>They were rooting against you and you figured out a way to rise through that and</v>

8840
04:05:57.221 --> 04:06:00.190
<v Speaker 2>figure your way through this maze of life on your own.</v>

8841
04:06:00.370 --> 04:06:04.720
<v Speaker 2>And it's because of that pressure that created this creativity in my opinion.</v>

8842
04:06:04.750 --> 04:06:04.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

8843
04:06:04.931 --> 04:06:05.520
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong,</v>

8844
04:06:05.520 --> 04:06:06.730
<v Speaker 2>liked the doors of Jujitsu,</v>

8845
04:06:06.760 --> 04:06:07.570
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's it.</v>

8846
04:06:07.570 --> 04:06:09.460
<v Speaker 2>This the same thing that happens to a lot of guys,</v>

8847
04:06:09.461 --> 04:06:11.890
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Kurt Cobain or Jimi Hendrix or,</v>

8848
04:06:12.050 --> 04:06:13.060
<v Speaker 2>or Jim Morrison,</v>

8849
04:06:13.061 --> 04:06:14.160
<v Speaker 2>I think you,</v>

8850
04:06:14.180 --> 04:06:16.070
<v Speaker 2>you deal with the wrong,</v>

8851
04:06:16.160 --> 04:06:17.330
<v Speaker 2>you see the wrong thing.</v>

8852
04:06:17.330 --> 04:06:22.220
<v Speaker 2>You see a dad was an alcoholic or beats his mom and this fucking chaos in the</v>

8853
04:06:22.221 --> 04:06:27.020
<v Speaker 2>house gets repossessed and you see all the flaws of the people before you and</v>

8854
04:06:27.021 --> 04:06:30.260
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes the most together people are the people that grew up with parents</v>

8855
04:06:30.350 --> 04:06:32.030
<v Speaker 2>that were in together because they realize,</v>

8856
04:06:32.031 --> 04:06:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

8857
04:06:32.720 --> 04:06:35.660
<v Speaker 2>I got to realize what these people are doing wrong and I've got to get it right</v>

8858
04:06:35.661 --> 04:06:36.350
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

8859
04:06:36.350 --> 04:06:38.690
<v Speaker 2>So when you see a guy like Jim Morrison,</v>

8860
04:06:38.691 --> 04:06:43.370
<v Speaker 2>is this like fucking brilliant freak who came out of nowhere.</v>

8861
04:06:43.520 --> 04:06:45.590
<v Speaker 2>If you really look at musical history.</v>

8862
04:06:46.120 --> 04:06:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

8863
04:06:46.440 --> 04:06:47.300
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm saying.</v>

8864
04:06:47.480 --> 04:06:51.890
<v Speaker 2>If you look at musical history like the 1950s we're like the doorway to this</v>

8865
04:06:51.891 --> 04:06:52.970
<v Speaker 2>rock and roll thing.</v>

8866
04:06:53.210 --> 04:06:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Like Elvis came through and Cherry Lee Lewis and there's trust,</v>

8867
04:06:57.680 --> 04:07:00.680
<v Speaker 2>but there's all this weird music came through and then the Beatles and then</v>

8868
04:07:00.681 --> 04:07:04.610
<v Speaker 2>there was these rock motherfuckers and there was all these drugs that are</v>

8869
04:07:04.611 --> 04:07:08.360
<v Speaker 2>involved and there's also the war and everybody's trying to get the fuck in the</v>

8870
04:07:08.361 --> 04:07:12.260
<v Speaker 2>civil rights movement and the civil rights people that and be able to vote in</v>

8871
04:07:12.261 --> 04:07:14.780
<v Speaker 2>1964 was when they were given granted the right to vote.</v>

8872
04:07:14.800 --> 04:07:19.800
<v Speaker 2>So it has all 1964 it has all the elements of of classic suppression and</v>

8873
04:07:20.811 --> 04:07:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Response to the suppression creative outburst.</v>

8874
04:07:23.780 --> 04:07:28.780
<v Speaker 2>But isn't that creative outburst is one of the most beautiful in like artistic</v>

8875
04:07:29.120 --> 04:07:31.520
<v Speaker 2>accomplishments of the human race.</v>

8876
04:07:31.790 --> 04:07:34.280
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the 1960s look at the Beatles,</v>

8877
04:07:34.460 --> 04:07:35.990
<v Speaker 2>you look at the led Zepplin,</v>

8878
04:07:36.020 --> 04:07:36.771
<v Speaker 2>look at the doors,</v>

8879
04:07:36.771 --> 04:07:41.420
<v Speaker 2>look at the who look at the music of the 60s look at Jefferson star ship.</v>

8880
04:07:42.140 --> 04:07:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

8881
04:07:43.161 --> 04:07:43.580
<v Speaker 2>no one's,</v>

8882
04:07:43.580 --> 04:07:47.060
<v Speaker 2>no one's writing great music depressants and it's not happening.</v>

8883
04:07:47.300 --> 04:07:49.100
<v Speaker 2>All I'm saying is I don't know what the fuck's going on.</v>

8884
04:07:49.101 --> 04:07:50.690
<v Speaker 2>All I'm saying if it's true,</v>

8885
04:07:50.750 --> 04:07:52.070
<v Speaker 2>if it might not even be true,</v>

8886
04:07:52.220 --> 04:07:57.220
<v Speaker 2>if it's true that all those bands came from Laurel Canyon and they were all kids</v>

8887
04:07:57.530 --> 04:08:00.380
<v Speaker 2>of air force intelligence officers,</v>

8888
04:08:00.680 --> 04:08:01.700
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking weird.</v>

8889
04:08:01.760 --> 04:08:03.100
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what they related on,</v>

8890
04:08:03.680 --> 04:08:06.130
<v Speaker 2>but you do understand that they would ship,</v>

8891
04:08:06.160 --> 04:08:07.970
<v Speaker 2>the parents would be busy at work.</v>

8892
04:08:08.090 --> 04:08:10.400
<v Speaker 2>They don't even have time to spend time with their fucking kids.</v>

8893
04:08:10.690 --> 04:08:13.450
<v Speaker 2>The kids eventually wind up being drug out x.</v>

8894
04:08:13.460 --> 04:08:14.031
<v Speaker 2>They go to school,</v>

8895
04:08:14.031 --> 04:08:14.870
<v Speaker 2>they smoked cigarettes,</v>

8896
04:08:14.871 --> 04:08:18.440
<v Speaker 2>a hand with the cool kids and go hang out by the fucking the auto shop and they</v>

8897
04:08:18.441 --> 04:08:20.820
<v Speaker 2>learn how to fix tires and none of them,</v>

8898
04:08:22.880 --> 04:08:25.180
<v Speaker 2>none of them got drafted without a doubt.</v>

8899
04:08:25.400 --> 04:08:26.091
<v Speaker 2>Without a doubt.</v>

8900
04:08:26.091 --> 04:08:29.020
<v Speaker 2>The parents would use their influence to keep their children from being drafted.</v>

8901
04:08:29.030 --> 04:08:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Course,</v>

8902
04:08:29.300 --> 04:08:30.860
<v Speaker 2>it's happened throughout throughout history,</v>

8903
04:08:31.410 --> 04:08:32.420
<v Speaker 2>dig train.</v>

8904
04:08:32.440 --> 04:08:34.790
<v Speaker 2>They become rock stars and coincidentally,</v>

8905
04:08:35.000 --> 04:08:35.960
<v Speaker 2>but Eddie Cox,</v>

8906
04:08:36.740 --> 04:08:38.940
<v Speaker 2>it's a coincidence that you're assuming that,</v>

8907
04:08:39.040 --> 04:08:41.450
<v Speaker 2>but you're assuming you're assuming.</v>

8908
04:08:41.451 --> 04:08:41.721
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

8909
04:08:41.721 --> 04:08:42.381
<v Speaker 2>All the bands.</v>

8910
04:08:42.381 --> 04:08:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

8911
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:46.040
<v Speaker 2>You're assuming the Muller postures thing there all Friday,</v>

8912
04:08:46.340 --> 04:08:46.671
<v Speaker 2>Eddie.</v>

8913
04:08:46.671 --> 04:08:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Now you're assuming the most preposterous thing.</v>

8914
04:08:49.430 --> 04:08:54.430
<v Speaker 2>You're assuming that the most creative beautiful moment in music history,</v>

8915
04:08:55.640 --> 04:08:59.120
<v Speaker 2>arguably the 1960s that is what is traded by retards.</v>

8916
04:08:59.210 --> 04:09:00.530
<v Speaker 2>So fucking stupid.</v>

8917
04:09:00.531 --> 04:09:01.850
<v Speaker 2>That got a job with the government.</v>

8918
04:09:02.360 --> 04:09:03.193
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

8919
04:09:03.320 --> 04:09:04.153
<v Speaker 2>How dare you?</v>

8920
04:09:04.270 --> 04:09:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Shit so farfetched.</v>

8921
04:09:06.940 --> 04:09:07.800
<v Speaker 2>Weary Eddie.</v>

8922
04:09:07.820 --> 04:09:10.240
<v Speaker 2>It's obvious we're suppression and this.</v>

8923
04:09:10.290 --> 04:09:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you read but don't do not.</v>

8924
04:09:13.561 --> 04:09:14.394
<v Speaker 2>Do not,</v>

8925
04:09:15.720 --> 04:09:17.170
<v Speaker 1>do not recognize the pressure.</v>

8926
04:09:17.220 --> 04:09:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Air Force intelligence space making propaganda films in Laurel Canyon.</v>

8927
04:09:21.240 --> 04:09:22.110

8936
04:09:30.540 --> 04:09:33.130
<v Speaker 1>What would be the benefit the government would have?</v>

8937

8995
04:11:00.840 --> 04:11:05.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not ethical at this stage because we're talking about going out in August</v>

8996
04:11:05.551 --> 04:11:06.870
<v Speaker 1>and right now it's almost June.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the first wife killer where you don't eat them and they're intelligent.</v>

9002
04:11:23.070 --> 04:11:23.581
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to eat.</v>

9003
04:11:23.581 --> 04:11:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Scars are very smart.</v>

9004
04:11:24.900 --> 04:11:28.350
<v Speaker 1>They're smart compared to what they know to eat their babies because the baby's</v>

9005
04:11:28.351 --> 04:11:29.680
<v Speaker 1>going to come back to haunt them later.</v>

9006
04:11:29.890 --> 04:11:30.723
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

9007
04:11:32.750 --> 04:11:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence Bro.</v>

9008
04:11:36.440 --> 04:11:37.261
<v Speaker 1>That's a vision,</v>

9009
04:11:37.261 --> 04:11:39.960
<v Speaker 1>that argument that's like this motherfucker.</v>

9010
04:11:39.990 --> 04:11:41.550
<v Speaker 1>He's a little baby right now,</v>

9011
04:11:41.700 --> 04:11:42.533
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

9012
04:11:42.540 --> 04:11:43.830
<v Speaker 1>but he's going to grow up really quick.</v>

9013
04:11:44.150 --> 04:11:44.461
<v Speaker 1>Buck,</v>

9014
04:11:44.461 --> 04:11:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to fuck my shit up.</v>

9015
04:11:46.050 --> 04:11:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I better eating one of these,</v>

9016
04:11:46.951 --> 04:11:48.030
<v Speaker 1>a little baby after a,</v>

9017
04:11:48.130 --> 04:11:49.720
<v Speaker 1>you learn that in the wild.</v>

9018
04:11:49.770 --> 04:11:51.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the law of the fucking wilderness,</v>

9019
04:11:51.810 --> 04:11:53.010
<v Speaker 1>not why they kill each other.</v>

9020
04:11:53.160 --> 04:11:56.070
<v Speaker 1>They kill their babies because it brings the female back into heat so they could</v>

9021
04:11:56.071 --> 04:11:58.210
<v Speaker 1>fuck them like that.</v>

9022
04:11:58.520 --> 04:12:02.760
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is the female have a cub and then they'll go into their Dan and</v>

9023
04:12:02.761 --> 04:12:03.594
<v Speaker 1>they'll hibernate and their,</v>

9024
04:12:03.760 --> 04:12:06.360
<v Speaker 1>and they come out in the spring and the mail be horny.</v>

9025
04:12:06.361 --> 04:12:08.190
<v Speaker 1>But the females like I already have babies.</v>

9026
04:12:08.191 --> 04:12:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

9027
04:12:09.000 --> 04:12:10.760
<v Speaker 1>And then so the male eats the typical not,</v>

9028
04:12:11.180 --> 04:12:11.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

9029

<v Speaker 6>because I liked him too much.</v>

9082
04:13:43.480 --> 04:13:46.060
<v Speaker 6>I would love to believe that government and everything that I say to I would</v>

04:13:46.061 --> 04:13:46.450
<v Speaker 6>fucking,</v>

9084

<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

9085
04:13:47.970 --> 04:13:48.120
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

9086
04:13:48.120 --> 04:13:48.300
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

9087
04:13:48.300 --> 04:13:49.133
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about Brian.</v>

9088
04:13:49.150 --> 04:13:49.983
<v Speaker 6>He believes everything inside.</v>

9089
04:13:50.090 --> 04:13:50.801
<v Speaker 6>So no,</v>

9090
04:13:50.801 --> 04:13:51.634
<v Speaker 6>I don't think he does.</v>

9091
04:13:52.080 --> 04:13:54.730
<v Speaker 6>Why he doesn't believe everything the government says.</v>

9092
04:13:54.731 --> 04:13:56.760
<v Speaker 6>Tell me one big incident.</v>

9093
04:13:56.770 --> 04:13:58.030
<v Speaker 6>Once that he doesn't trust them.</v>

9094
04:13:58.210 --> 04:13:58.421
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

9095
04:13:58.421 --> 04:14:01.060
<v Speaker 6>he totally does because he trusts everything about nine 11 and there's holes</v>

9096
04:14:01.061 --> 04:14:01.690
<v Speaker 6>everywhere.</v>

9097
04:14:01.690 --> 04:14:05.350
<v Speaker 6>So if you trust watching tower seven completely free,</v>

9098
04:14:05.351 --> 04:14:08.920
<v Speaker 6>fall on video from five different angles and you believe the government,</v>

9099
04:14:08.921 --> 04:14:10.690
<v Speaker 6>eight years later when I finally came out and they said,</v>

9100
04:14:10.860 --> 04:14:11.210
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

9101
04:14:11.210 --> 04:14:12.070
<v Speaker 6>it got too hot,</v>

9102
04:14:12.740 --> 04:14:13.780
<v Speaker 6>you believe that Shit,</v>

9103
04:14:14.200 --> 04:14:15.040
<v Speaker 6>you're on that side.</v>

9104
04:14:15.041 --> 04:14:15.840
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing.</v>

9105
04:14:15.840 --> 04:14:16.240
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

9106
04:14:16.240 --> 04:14:17.620
<v Speaker 6>that's the litmus test.</v>

9107
04:14:17.650 --> 04:14:19.300
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing you could say to those guys.</v>

9108
04:14:19.450 --> 04:14:21.270
<v Speaker 6>Nothing I give up as soon as that's the,</v>

9109
04:14:21.340 --> 04:14:22.780
<v Speaker 6>that's why I go to tower seven I go,</v>

9110
04:14:22.781 --> 04:14:25.900
<v Speaker 6>do you believe tower seven collapse at free fall speed because it got hot.</v>

9111
04:14:26.350 --> 04:14:27.161
<v Speaker 6>If they say yes,</v>

9112
04:14:27.161 --> 04:14:27.994
<v Speaker 6>then I'm done.</v>

9113
04:14:28.060 --> 04:14:28.480
<v Speaker 6>I'm done.</v>

9114
04:14:28.480 --> 04:14:29.291
<v Speaker 6>Well does that to me?</v>

9115
04:14:29.291 --> 04:14:30.350
<v Speaker 6>He believes all gum.</v>

9116
04:14:30.370 --> 04:14:30.880
<v Speaker 6>No that,</v>

9117

<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

9119
04:14:31.321 --> 04:14:31.481
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

9120
04:14:31.481 --> 04:14:33.100
<v Speaker 6>If you believe that that's the worst one.</v>

9121
04:14:33.190 --> 04:14:34.030
<v Speaker 6>It's on video.</v>

9122
04:14:34.031 --> 04:14:35.230
<v Speaker 6>Five different angles.</v>

9123
04:14:35.410 --> 04:14:40.410
<v Speaker 6>There's many on video demolition experts looking at this and saying,</v>

9124
04:14:41.440 --> 04:14:42.273
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

9125
04:14:42.870 --> 04:14:44.160
<v Speaker 6>experts that don't agree with that.</v>

9126
04:14:44.710 --> 04:14:46.850
<v Speaker 6>You don't have any video American sizing.</v>

9127
04:14:47.470 --> 04:14:48.281
<v Speaker 6>Amazing.</v>

9128
04:14:48.281 --> 04:14:50.680
<v Speaker 6>There's no amazing debunking all of your theories.</v>

9129
04:14:50.930 --> 04:14:51.763
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

9130
04:14:51.870 --> 04:14:54.850
<v Speaker 6>so you believe tower southern collapsed at free fall speed because it got too</v>

9131
04:14:54.851 --> 04:14:55.150
<v Speaker 6>hot.</v>

9132
04:14:55.150 --> 04:14:56.140
<v Speaker 6>I don't know anything about,</v>

9133
04:14:56.410 --> 04:14:58.060
<v Speaker 6>I know nothing about that stuff.</v>

9134
04:14:59.150 --> 04:14:59.983
<v Speaker 6>When they ask,</v>

9135
04:15:00.130 --> 04:15:00.921
<v Speaker 6>when do you know what?</v>

9136
04:15:00.921 --> 04:15:01.270
<v Speaker 6>Let me,</v>

9137
04:15:01.270 --> 04:15:02.680
<v Speaker 6>let me educate you a little bit.</v>

9138
04:15:02.920 --> 04:15:04.840
<v Speaker 6>When they had a press conference,</v>

9139
04:15:05.270 --> 04:15:06.670
<v Speaker 6>a press conference with Nist,</v>

9140
04:15:06.790 --> 04:15:08.740
<v Speaker 6>the National Institute of Standards and technology,</v>

9141
04:15:08.890 --> 04:15:10.750
<v Speaker 6>they're the ones that came out and explained what happened.</v>

9142
04:15:10.780 --> 04:15:11.390
<v Speaker 6>Tower something.</v>

9143
04:15:11.390 --> 04:15:12.880
<v Speaker 6>When they asked them widened.</v>

9144
04:15:13.060 --> 04:15:14.450
<v Speaker 6>Did you guys check for explosive</v>

9145
04:15:16.000 --> 04:15:16.833
<v Speaker 6>exclusives?</v>

9146
04:15:17.030 --> 04:15:17.930
<v Speaker 6>It's really simple.</v>

9147
04:15:18.080 --> 04:15:19.010
<v Speaker 6>It's like kindergarten shit.</v>

9148
04:15:19.011 --> 04:15:20.570
<v Speaker 6>When they asked the head of kindergarten,</v>

9149
04:15:20.571 --> 04:15:22.910
<v Speaker 6>why didn't you check for explosives?</v>

9150
04:15:22.970 --> 04:15:25.280
<v Speaker 6>Why didn't you test for explosives on tower seven?</v>

9151
04:15:25.460 --> 04:15:27.160
<v Speaker 6>They said there was no reason to.</v>

9152
04:15:27.170 --> 04:15:28.560
<v Speaker 6>There was no ties to any hunches.</v>

9153
04:15:28.650 --> 04:15:29.750
<v Speaker 6>There was no witnesses.</v>

9154
04:15:29.780 --> 04:15:30.590
<v Speaker 6>Meanwhile,</v>

9155
04:15:30.590 --> 04:15:32.720
<v Speaker 6>there's about an hour of witnesses,</v>

9156
04:15:32.780 --> 04:15:33.321
<v Speaker 6>firemen,</v>

9157
04:15:33.321 --> 04:15:33.760
<v Speaker 6>policemen,</v>

9158
04:15:33.760 --> 04:15:35.030
<v Speaker 6>insane bombs went off.</v>

9159
04:15:35.180 --> 04:15:35.580
<v Speaker 6>Bumps.</v>

9160
04:15:35.580 --> 04:15:36.080
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

9161
04:15:36.080 --> 04:15:37.920
<v Speaker 6>there's video of Brian's going up.</v>

9162
04:15:38.060 --> 04:15:39.950
<v Speaker 6>Bombs went up and the guy said,</v>

9163
04:15:40.280 --> 04:15:44.990
<v Speaker 6>we didn't check for bombs because there was no witness.</v>

9164
04:15:45.020 --> 04:15:46.050
<v Speaker 6>What about that ceremony?</v>

9165
04:15:47.090 --> 04:15:47.923
<v Speaker 6>Who flew those planes?</v>

9166
04:15:50.990 --> 04:15:51.501
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.</v>

9167
04:15:51.501 --> 04:15:53.260
<v Speaker 6>Anybody can say it was remote control.</v>

9168
04:15:54.240 --> 04:15:55.520
<v Speaker 6>I can say to you,</v>

9169
04:15:55.780 --> 04:15:56.240
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

9170
04:15:56.240 --> 04:16:00.650
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing I can say I provide a complete video evidence for you.</v>

9171
04:16:00.800 --> 04:16:02.150
<v Speaker 6>I broke it down for you,</v>

9172
04:16:02.370 --> 04:16:04.310
<v Speaker 6>but you're still saying you're still,</v>

9173
04:16:04.480 --> 04:16:05.530
<v Speaker 6>it's still not enough.</v>

9174
04:16:05.531 --> 04:16:06.140
<v Speaker 6>How much?</v>

9175
04:16:06.140 --> 04:16:07.300
<v Speaker 6>Nothing I can say.</v>

9176
04:16:08.900 --> 04:16:09.860
<v Speaker 6>I haven't said anything.</v>

9177
04:16:11.550 --> 04:16:12.383
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

9178
04:16:13.150 --> 04:16:14.130
<v Speaker 6>let me play devil's advocate.</v>

9179
04:16:14.900 --> 04:16:15.733
<v Speaker 6>He's fucking</v>

9180
04:16:17.330 --> 04:16:18.163
<v Speaker 6>momentarily.</v>

9181
04:16:18.320 --> 04:16:18.920
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

9182
04:16:18.920 --> 04:16:22.670
<v Speaker 6>when you look at tower 70 clearly looks like you can control demolition,</v>

9183
04:16:22.700 --> 04:16:23.090
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

9184
04:16:23.090 --> 04:16:24.350
<v Speaker 6>It looks like the way it implodes,</v>

9185
04:16:24.360 --> 04:16:27.680
<v Speaker 6>and I seen it so long because it looks like a controlled demolition.</v>

9186
04:16:27.830 --> 04:16:32.830
<v Speaker 6>Is it possible that you could get a diesel fire in a building where the fuel</v>

9187
04:16:32.901 --> 04:16:37.901
<v Speaker 6>burns so hot that it fucks up all of the supporting beams to this building and</v>

9188
04:16:38.031 --> 04:16:40.370
<v Speaker 6>it all just gives out and impossible takes on each other.</v>

9189
04:16:40.400 --> 04:16:40.650
<v Speaker 6>That's an,</v>

9190
04:16:40.650 --> 04:16:41.980
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a structural engineer,</v>

9191
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:43.660
<v Speaker 6>so that's what I'm saying.</v>

9192
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:44.990
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand what happens.</v>

9193
04:16:44.991 --> 04:16:49.790
<v Speaker 6>There's 100,000 architects and engineers in the association and one by one it</v>

9194
04:16:49.791 --> 04:16:52.580
<v Speaker 6>was like 200 then it was 1,530 2000 that no,</v>

9195
04:16:52.581 --> 04:16:52.701
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

9196
04:16:52.701 --> 04:16:53.130
<v Speaker 6>it's true.</v>

9197
04:16:53.130 --> 04:16:54.890
<v Speaker 6>It's not that you're simply wrong.</v>

9198
04:16:55.180 --> 04:16:56.013
<v Speaker 6>Hold on.</v>

9199
04:16:58.040 --> 04:17:00.530
<v Speaker 6>Fires made the building do that fire.</v>

9200
04:17:00.531 --> 04:17:01.364
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

9201
04:17:03.910 --> 04:17:07.340
<v Speaker 6>but maybe you don't trust the government.</v>

9202
04:17:07.400 --> 04:17:09.220
<v Speaker 6>You think the government blame me,</v>

9203
04:17:09.320 --> 04:17:09.980
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

9204
04:17:09.980 --> 04:17:12.320
<v Speaker 6>but you don't think that's fucking fishy.</v>

9205
04:17:12.430 --> 04:17:13.850
<v Speaker 6>A detective would be all over that.</v>

9206
04:17:13.851 --> 04:17:16.440
<v Speaker 6>Like a fuck like flies on schematize something.</v>

9207
04:17:16.470 --> 04:17:17.600
<v Speaker 6>If that was my building,</v>

9208
04:17:17.601 --> 04:17:19.100
<v Speaker 6>I bought my fucking money back.</v>

9209
04:17:19.940 --> 04:17:20.220
<v Speaker 6>Shit,</v>

9210
04:17:20.220 --> 04:17:21.053
<v Speaker 6>crump,</v>

9211
04:17:21.720 --> 04:17:23.090
<v Speaker 6>there's some kind of hypnosis.</v>

9212
04:17:24.870 --> 04:17:25.710
<v Speaker 6>Who's fluid?</v>

9213
04:17:26.600 --> 04:17:26.880
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

9214
04:17:26.880 --> 04:17:27.030
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

9215
04:17:27.030 --> 04:17:27.863
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

9216
04:17:30.280 --> 04:17:31.390
<v Speaker 6>We're not talking about that.</v>

9217
04:17:31.620 --> 04:17:32.330
<v Speaker 6>Nope.</v>

9218
04:17:32.330 --> 04:17:33.770
<v Speaker 6>That was three that went down.</v>

9219
04:17:33.980 --> 04:17:37.640
<v Speaker 6>But the third one was reported on because they knew the majority of the people</v>

9220
04:17:37.880 --> 04:17:41.260
<v Speaker 6>like you real smart would not even let go.</v>

9221
04:17:41.270 --> 04:17:43.060
<v Speaker 6>He said real smart after you just shit on you.</v>

9222
04:17:43.070 --> 04:17:43.903
<v Speaker 6>This shit on you.</v>

9223
04:17:44.390 --> 04:17:46.010
<v Speaker 6>Eddie is swaying the fuck out of me.</v>

9224
04:17:48.230 --> 04:17:48.621
<v Speaker 6>Kissing.</v>

9225
04:17:48.621 --> 04:17:48.891
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>

9226
04:17:48.891 --> 04:17:50.300
<v Speaker 6>three buildings went down,</v>

9227
04:17:50.930 --> 04:17:52.550
<v Speaker 6>two of them got hit by a plane.</v>

9228
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:53.600
<v Speaker 6>One didn't.</v>

9229
04:17:53.960 --> 04:17:57.650
<v Speaker 6>I detective would be so all over at lawyers would be all over that shit.</v>

9230
04:17:58.400 --> 04:18:00.020
<v Speaker 6>And you don't trust the government.</v>

9231
04:18:00.080 --> 04:18:02.060
<v Speaker 6>You believe that government are criminals,</v>

9232
04:18:02.180 --> 04:18:03.920
<v Speaker 6>but yet you've got their back on this</v>

9233
04:18:05.940 --> 04:18:08.930
<v Speaker 6>than the tower dropping it.</v>

9234
04:18:09.070 --> 04:18:10.980
<v Speaker 6>Paul says there's a problem.</v>

9235
04:18:10.981 --> 04:18:11.371
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

9236
04:18:11.371 --> 04:18:12.091
<v Speaker 6>Is that possible?</v>

9237
04:18:12.091 --> 04:18:12.451
<v Speaker 6>But Eddie,</v>

9238
04:18:12.451 --> 04:18:12.961
<v Speaker 6>here's the problem.</v>

9239
04:18:12.961 --> 04:18:15.180
<v Speaker 6>None of us really understand structural engineering.</v>

9240
04:18:15.220 --> 04:18:18.000
<v Speaker 6>But understand what happened here.</v>

9241
04:18:18.060 --> 04:18:18.271
<v Speaker 6>None.</v>

9242
04:18:18.271 --> 04:18:18.781
<v Speaker 6>Exactly,</v>

9243
04:18:18.781 --> 04:18:21.150
<v Speaker 6>but when you hear guys that do one by one,</v>

9244
04:18:21.170 --> 04:18:22.003
<v Speaker 6>not all of them.</v>

9245
04:18:22.060 --> 04:18:27.060
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] scientific American was scientific American architect,</v>

9246
04:18:27.510 --> 04:18:28.343
<v Speaker 6>their own,</v>

9247
04:18:28.740 --> 04:18:29.700
<v Speaker 6>they're all bought off.</v>

9248
04:18:29.701 --> 04:18:30.031
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

9249
04:18:30.031 --> 04:18:31.720
<v Speaker 6>If you just look at scientific Americans,</v>

9250
04:18:31.740 --> 04:18:34.170
<v Speaker 6>but when you look at what's going on,</v>

9251
04:18:34.280 --> 04:18:36.220
<v Speaker 6>like when people look at what trends are going on,</v>

9252
04:18:36.240 --> 04:18:37.680
<v Speaker 6>this is the trend that's going on.</v>

9253
04:18:37.830 --> 04:18:42.830
<v Speaker 6>The trim is that there's 100,000 architects and engineers in the association and</v>

9254
04:18:42.991 --> 04:18:45.480
<v Speaker 6>bit by bit it's growing and growing because you know what?</v>

9255
04:18:45.630 --> 04:18:46.140
<v Speaker 6>The Guy,</v>

9256
04:18:46.140 --> 04:18:47.920
<v Speaker 6>that's the head of all that.</v>

9257
04:18:48.200 --> 04:18:52.340
<v Speaker 6>He's sitting down you saying there's 100,000 architects and engineers and died</v>

9258
04:18:52.360 --> 04:18:56.090
<v Speaker 6>11 in some some clubs,</v>

9259
04:18:56.091 --> 04:18:58.770
<v Speaker 6>association of architects and engineers.</v>

9260
04:18:59.310 --> 04:19:01.500
<v Speaker 6>There's a national association.</v>

9261
04:19:01.501 --> 04:19:05.690
<v Speaker 6>There's a 2,500 there's 100,000 of them will and 2,500 plus.</v>

9262
04:19:05.700 --> 04:19:05.810
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

9263
04:19:05.810 --> 04:19:05.990
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

9264
04:19:05.990 --> 04:19:06.170
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

9265
04:19:06.170 --> 04:19:07.360
<v Speaker 6>there's not.</v>

9266
04:19:07.440 --> 04:19:07.730
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

9267

<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

9268
04:19:07.890 --> 04:19:08.040
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

9269
04:19:08.040 --> 04:19:08.820
<v Speaker 6>That's different.</v>

9270
04:19:08.820 --> 04:19:11.100
<v Speaker 6>100,000 in the whole association,</v>

9271
04:19:11.190 --> 04:19:12.900
<v Speaker 6>not including that 11 they don't give a fuck.</v>

9272
04:19:12.901 --> 04:19:13.171
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

9273
04:19:13.171 --> 04:19:18.171
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying 2,500 think is because Joe and I take a piss and I was lost that</v>

9274
04:19:20.341 --> 04:19:21.174
<v Speaker 6>Brendan,</v>

9275
04:19:23.040 --> 04:19:23.873
<v Speaker 6>Brendan,</v>

9276
04:19:24.210 --> 04:19:25.950
<v Speaker 6>Brendan thing.</v>

9277
04:19:26.070 --> 04:19:27.870
<v Speaker 6>It's the same thing that we were talking about before.</v>

9278
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.800
<v Speaker 6>It's the same thing.</v>

9279
04:19:28.800 --> 04:19:29.940
<v Speaker 6>It's the same thing and everything.</v>

9280
04:19:29.941 --> 04:19:30.810
<v Speaker 6>It's exact same thing.</v>

9281
04:19:30.990 --> 04:19:32.280
<v Speaker 6>There's two ways you could look at it like,</v>

9282
04:19:32.400 --> 04:19:33.030
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

9283
04:19:33.030 --> 04:19:34.170
<v Speaker 6>let me ask some questions.</v>

9284
04:19:34.260 --> 04:19:39.000
<v Speaker 6>Out of the hundred thousand did these 2,500 km from the hundred thousand being</v>

9285
04:19:39.001 --> 04:19:44.001
<v Speaker 6>shown the evidence and only 2,500 believe it or we're only 2,500 shown.</v>

9286
04:19:45.180 --> 04:19:46.320
<v Speaker 6>Does that make a difference?</v>

9287
04:19:46.410 --> 04:19:47.470
<v Speaker 6>Does that make a difference in your,</v>

9288
04:19:47.560 --> 04:19:49.250
<v Speaker 6>in you whether you jumped?</v>

9289
04:19:49.350 --> 04:19:50.310
<v Speaker 6>Of course it does.</v>

9290
04:19:50.490 --> 04:19:53.520
<v Speaker 6>So the reality is the hundred thousand don't even know.</v>

9291
04:19:53.580 --> 04:19:55.710
<v Speaker 6>Most of them don't even know three towers went down.</v>

9292
04:19:55.890 --> 04:19:56.730
<v Speaker 6>These are architects,</v>

9293
04:19:56.731 --> 04:19:57.131
<v Speaker 6>engineers,</v>

9294
04:19:57.131 --> 04:19:58.080
<v Speaker 6>that tends to look into it.</v>

9295
04:19:58.240 --> 04:19:59.280
<v Speaker 6>So one by one,</v>

9296
04:19:59.420 --> 04:20:02.700
<v Speaker 6>one by one that it's growing and growing because 50 at a time,</v>

9297
04:20:02.701 --> 04:20:03.900
<v Speaker 6>they're getting 15 at a time.</v>

9298
04:20:04.080 --> 04:20:05.520
<v Speaker 6>They're showing them the evidence of it going,</v>

9299
04:20:05.690 --> 04:20:06.540
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

9300
04:20:06.870 --> 04:20:08.130
<v Speaker 6>Mother fuckers were brought down.</v>

9301
04:20:08.280 --> 04:20:09.210
<v Speaker 6>That's what's going on.</v>

9302
04:20:09.211 --> 04:20:10.550
<v Speaker 6>But it's like what we're talking about,</v>

9303
04:20:10.560 --> 04:20:12.000
<v Speaker 6>what going steady it shot,</v>

9304
04:20:12.001 --> 04:20:12.570
<v Speaker 6>what's going on.</v>

9305
04:20:12.570 --> 04:20:12.690
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

9306
04:20:12.690 --> 04:20:14.640
<v Speaker 6>anybody examining the evidence is gonna know.</v>

9307
04:20:14.641 --> 04:20:15.810
<v Speaker 6>Three towers went down.</v>

9308
04:20:15.840 --> 04:20:17.940
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows three times when people don't know.</v>

9309
04:20:17.941 --> 04:20:21.600
<v Speaker 6>Three towers went down now got talking about the do architects,</v>

9310
04:20:21.610 --> 04:20:22.440
<v Speaker 6>engineers,</v>

9311
04:20:22.440 --> 04:20:25.410
<v Speaker 6>you don't think the predominant group of art,</v>

9312
04:20:25.560 --> 04:20:27.690
<v Speaker 6>if you looked at a million architects and engineers,</v>

9313
04:20:27.691 --> 04:20:32.691
<v Speaker 6>you don't think that like 999,999 would fucking know that tower seven was</v>

9314
04:20:35.281 --> 04:20:36.840
<v Speaker 6>brought down with tower one and tower to,</v>

9315
04:20:36.870 --> 04:20:38.340
<v Speaker 6>can I talk just because</v>

9316
04:20:40.450 --> 04:20:43.710
<v Speaker 6>it's like I just cannot go.</v>

9317
04:20:43.860 --> 04:20:44.580
<v Speaker 6>Oh my gosh.</v>

9318
04:20:44.580 --> 04:20:45.413
<v Speaker 6>Just because,</v>

9319
04:20:46.630 --> 04:20:47.200
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

9320
04:20:47.200 --> 04:20:50.810
<v Speaker 6>just because you're an architect and an engineer and you're registered nothing</v>

9321
04:20:51.250 --> 04:20:53.190
<v Speaker 6>and you're registered in the association.</v>

9322
04:20:53.610 --> 04:20:57.930
<v Speaker 6>Just because you're an architect and an or an engineer and on and you're</v>

9323
04:20:57.931 --> 04:20:59.340
<v Speaker 6>registered in the association,</v>

9324
04:20:59.450 --> 04:21:02.370
<v Speaker 6>does it mean you have extra,</v>

9325
04:21:02.430 --> 04:21:05.100
<v Speaker 6>you're privy to extras knowledge,</v>

9326
04:21:05.130 --> 04:21:05.320
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

9327
04:21:05.320 --> 04:21:06.010
<v Speaker 6>On nine one</v>

9328
04:21:06.010 --> 04:21:07.780
<v Speaker 5>one because the overall,</v>

9329
04:21:07.840 --> 04:21:12.010
<v Speaker 5>the overall knowledge of nine 11 is most people don't know.</v>

9330
04:21:12.011 --> 04:21:13.660
<v Speaker 5>Three towers went down.</v>

9331
04:21:13.900 --> 04:21:14.980
<v Speaker 5>That's an actual effect.</v>

9332
04:21:15.010 --> 04:21:17.920
<v Speaker 5>So these agree at he's architects and engineers don't even know,</v>

9333
04:21:17.950 --> 04:21:19.060
<v Speaker 5>but when they get to sit down,</v>

9334
04:21:19.120 --> 04:21:20.830
<v Speaker 5>all of them 100% when it gets into,</v>

9335
04:21:20.831 --> 04:21:22.240
<v Speaker 5>I know the guy had them on my pocket.</v>

9336
04:21:22.390 --> 04:21:23.470
<v Speaker 5>He's the head of all this shit.</v>

9337
04:21:23.650 --> 04:21:24.610
<v Speaker 5>Every one of them goes,</v>

9338
04:21:24.820 --> 04:21:25.653
<v Speaker 5>oh shit.</v>

9339
04:21:25.840 --> 04:21:27.120
<v Speaker 5>We've been hunting edict.</v>

9340
04:21:27.280 --> 04:21:28.480
<v Speaker 5>That's what's going on.</v>

9341
04:21:28.780 --> 04:21:30.040
<v Speaker 5>11 not 11</v>

9342
04:21:31.960 --> 04:21:34.060
<v Speaker 5>you saw tower seven go down with that,</v>

9343
04:21:34.120 --> 04:21:34.960
<v Speaker 5>but hold on a second.</v>

9344
04:21:35.270 --> 04:21:40.270
<v Speaker 5>Architects and the engineers don't know about tower seven but you do know of</v>

9345
04:21:41.801 --> 04:21:42.251
<v Speaker 5>course,</v>

9346
04:21:42.251 --> 04:21:44.050
<v Speaker 5>because they didn't look into their normal people.</v>

9347
04:21:44.470 --> 04:21:46.240
<v Speaker 5>They do think just because you're an architect,</v>

9348
04:21:46.241 --> 04:21:46.661
<v Speaker 5>an engineer,</v>

9349
04:21:46.661 --> 04:21:47.220
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get,</v>

9350
04:21:47.220 --> 04:21:48.340
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get an email,</v>

9351
04:21:48.580 --> 04:21:50.050
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get an email.</v>

9352
04:21:50.110 --> 04:21:51.600
<v Speaker 5>Most people don't know.</v>

9353
04:21:51.640 --> 04:21:52.241
<v Speaker 5>Even today,</v>

9354
04:21:52.241 --> 04:21:53.380
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know about three times.</v>

9355
04:21:55.260 --> 04:21:56.650
<v Speaker 5>You're going to get an email.</v>

9356
04:21:56.710 --> 04:21:57.610
<v Speaker 5>They're not researching it.</v>

9357
04:21:57.611 --> 04:22:00.220
<v Speaker 5>The ones that did contact or an engineer,</v>

9358
04:22:00.221 --> 04:22:04.120
<v Speaker 5>and you've passed through some sort of architectural course and you assume,</v>

9359
04:22:04.150 --> 04:22:08.800
<v Speaker 5>I assume you got some sort of a master's degree in engineering and someone asks</v>

9360
04:22:08.801 --> 04:22:13.801
<v Speaker 5>you to commentate on one of the most historic attacks in human civilization.</v>

9361
04:22:14.590 --> 04:22:15.520
<v Speaker 5>After some research,</v>

9362
04:22:15.550 --> 04:22:16.480
<v Speaker 5>you're going to do some research,</v>

9363
04:22:16.840 --> 04:22:18.940
<v Speaker 5>but you're going to look at all the different buildings,</v>

9364
04:22:19.700 --> 04:22:24.700
<v Speaker 5>100% talking about Eddie 100% if you ask them to examine what happened at tower</v>

9365
04:22:25.271 --> 04:22:28.180
<v Speaker 5>seven they're going to look at tower seven if you think they're going to talk to</v>

9366
04:22:28.181 --> 04:22:31.720
<v Speaker 5>them about nine 11 and not bring up tower seven that's crazy.</v>

9367
04:22:31.990 --> 04:22:32.823
<v Speaker 5>That's like,</v>

9368
04:22:35.140 --> 04:22:37.810
<v Speaker 5>that's like covered is up any,</v>

9369
04:22:37.880 --> 04:22:38.770
<v Speaker 5>nobody's covering it up.</v>

9370
04:22:38.771 --> 04:22:40.820
<v Speaker 5>You don't get to that level eight without research,</v>

9371
04:22:41.230 --> 04:22:41.580
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

9372
04:22:41.580 --> 04:22:42.710
<v Speaker 5>Not any.</v>

9373
04:22:42.870 --> 04:22:43.630
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

9374
04:22:43.630 --> 04:22:44.740
<v Speaker 5>it's not covering up.</v>

9375
04:22:44.770 --> 04:22:46.660
<v Speaker 5>It's just there's so much going on that day.</v>

9376
04:22:46.661 --> 04:22:50.700
<v Speaker 5>The tower seven seemed less important and because of the media to tower one and</v>

9377
04:22:50.710 --> 04:22:51.543
<v Speaker 5>two,</v>

9378
04:22:51.550 --> 04:22:53.180
<v Speaker 5>which were both hit by plane,</v>

9379
04:22:53.890 --> 04:22:55.390
<v Speaker 5>but whatever it was,</v>

9380
04:22:55.420 --> 04:22:56.253
<v Speaker 5>it didn't.</v>

9381
04:22:56.290 --> 04:23:00.610
<v Speaker 5>Whether it was an intentional cover up tower seven or it was a cover up because</v>

9382
04:23:00.880 --> 04:23:02.020
<v Speaker 5>there was so much hoopla.</v>

9383
04:23:02.170 --> 04:23:04.900
<v Speaker 5>Most people don't know this is what's going on.</v>

9384
04:23:04.901 --> 04:23:07.060
<v Speaker 5>So what Richard Gauges,</v>

9385
04:23:07.720 --> 04:23:08.240
<v Speaker 5>Jed.</v>

9386
04:23:08.240 --> 04:23:08.471
<v Speaker 5>Eddie,</v>

9387
04:23:08.471 --> 04:23:10.060
<v Speaker 5>why don't you think that architects don't know?</v>

9388
04:23:11.470 --> 04:23:13.060
<v Speaker 5>Why would you think that engineers don't know that?</v>

9389
04:23:16.420 --> 04:23:16.871
<v Speaker 5>We don't know.</v>

9390
04:23:16.871 --> 04:23:17.321
<v Speaker 5>You don't know?</v>

9391
04:23:17.321 --> 04:23:17.651
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

9392
04:23:17.651 --> 04:23:19.630
<v Speaker 5>But what we do know is sit down.</v>

9393
04:23:19.720 --> 04:23:20.290
<v Speaker 5>They say,</v>

9394
04:23:20.290 --> 04:23:21.080
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit,</v>

9395
04:23:21.080 --> 04:23:21.913
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know.</v>

9396
04:23:22.240 --> 04:23:22.800
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

9397
04:23:22.800 --> 04:23:23.633
<v Speaker 5>Oh Eddie,</v>

9398
04:23:23.650 --> 04:23:24.483
<v Speaker 5>calm.</v>

9399
04:23:24.810 --> 04:23:25.511
<v Speaker 5>Come on man.</v>

9400
04:23:25.511 --> 04:23:26.141
<v Speaker 5>That's not true.</v>

9401
04:23:26.141 --> 04:23:26.651
<v Speaker 5>You don't know that.</v>

9402
04:23:26.651 --> 04:23:27.484
<v Speaker 5>That's</v>

9403
04:23:28.690 --> 04:23:29.800
<v Speaker 5>crazy about this.</v>

9404
04:23:29.801 --> 04:23:31.030
<v Speaker 5>You're getting so emotional.</v>

9405
04:23:31.320 --> 04:23:34.090
<v Speaker 5>We were not involved in this like it's not a part of our lives.</v>

9406
04:23:34.660 --> 04:23:36.850
<v Speaker 5>And you don't know what they knew before they look.</v>

9407
04:23:36.851 --> 04:23:37.240
<v Speaker 5>You want to,</v>

9408
04:23:37.240 --> 04:23:40.260
<v Speaker 5>you want to think the tower seven collapse because they got hot to you</v>

9409
04:23:43.030 --> 04:23:44.660
<v Speaker 5>want what I want.</v>

9410
04:23:44.760 --> 04:23:45.340

9414
04:23:55.960 --> 04:23:59.560

<v Speaker 5>You probably think that 11 was committed by motivated Islamic fundamentalist.</v>

9434
04:24:53.451 --> 04:24:55.850

9457
04:25:49.260 --> 04:25:52.160
<v Speaker 5>I want to thank Eddie for being who the fuck he is because he's a national</v>

9464
04:26:03.140 --> 04:26:04.070

<v Speaker 5>Please let me in this little petty you what?</v>

9466
04:26:08.360 --> 04:26:09.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't like the government.</v>

9467
04:26:09.261 --> 04:26:12.530
<v Speaker 5>You'll get them to stop talking over each year,</v>

9468
04:26:13.010 --> 04:26:16.910
<v Speaker 5>the Illuminati one of these days and I'm going to make a false flag directly for</v>

9469
04:26:16.911 --> 04:26:18.860
<v Speaker 5>Warner brothers and you're going to believe all that shit.</v>

9470
04:26:18.920 --> 04:26:19.753
<v Speaker 5>I want it.</v>

9471
04:26:21.310 --> 04:26:22.470
<v Speaker 5>That's definitely going to happen.</v>

9472
04:26:22.471 --> 04:26:23.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad we're talking about it.</v>

9473
04:26:24.410 --> 04:26:25.850
<v Speaker 5>That's totally not a waste of time.</v>

9474
04:26:25.851 --> 04:26:26.060
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

9475
04:26:26.060 --> 04:26:26.561
<v Speaker 5>not at all.</v>

9476
04:26:26.561 --> 04:26:27.261
<v Speaker 5>We make it happen.</v>

9477
04:26:27.261 --> 04:26:30.620
<v Speaker 5>Watch Eddie Bravo is a national treasure and they have it in my head.</v>

9478
04:26:30.680 --> 04:26:32.870
<v Speaker 5>I just want you to not give the government so much credit.</v>

9479
04:26:32.871 --> 04:26:34.830
<v Speaker 5>They're not that organized was also a real,</v>

9480
04:26:34.831 --> 04:26:35.664
<v Speaker 5>that one</v>

9481
04:26:37.440 --> 04:26:40.850
<v Speaker 5>they couldn't do as a real benefit to not getting emotional and yelling about</v>

9482
04:26:40.851 --> 04:26:42.350
<v Speaker 5>things that you're not exactly sure about.</v>

9483
04:26:42.440 --> 04:26:43.920
<v Speaker 5>And when we talk about some client,</v>

9484
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:47.510
<v Speaker 5>what's the better approach to step back and go,</v>

9485
04:26:47.690 --> 04:26:49.420
<v Speaker 5>what are the possibilities to the,</v>

9486
04:26:49.460 --> 04:26:54.460
<v Speaker 5>how much do I have invested in one particular argument that I've already like</v>

9487
04:26:54.651 --> 04:26:57.650
<v Speaker 5>the old chairs and I go to tower seven is cause that's the most obvious one.</v>

9488
04:26:57.730 --> 04:26:58.563
<v Speaker 5>That's the snap.</v>

9489
04:27:00.440 --> 04:27:02.250
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking curious for sure.</v>

9490
04:27:02.251 --> 04:27:04.400
<v Speaker 5>But it's not obvious you need a,</v>

9491
04:27:04.410 --> 04:27:08.130
<v Speaker 5>you need a new nor I as an architect or an engineer.</v>

9492
04:27:08.160 --> 04:27:12.450
<v Speaker 5>But it's obviously it looks like a controlled demolition is not obvious why it</v>

9493
04:27:12.451 --> 04:27:13.284
<v Speaker 5>fell a bar.</v>

9494
04:27:13.830 --> 04:27:15.180
<v Speaker 5>Shuri is not an expert.</v>

9495
04:27:15.181 --> 04:27:20.181
<v Speaker 5>So when a jury sits in and they listened to expert testimony research</v>

9496
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:25.480
<v Speaker 5>and I was talking to you,</v>

9497

<v Speaker 5>you know there's people out there to beat believe crazy shit,</v>

9498
04:27:28.950 --> 04:27:29.783

9499
04:27:32.060 --> 04:27:34.560
<v Speaker 5>Like lipstick converting and you know what I'm talking about.</v>

9500
04:27:34.590 --> 04:27:35.820
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever listened to people,</v>

9501
04:27:35.980 --> 04:27:37.290
<v Speaker 5>you don't need this shit.</v>

9502

9505
04:27:47.970 --> 04:27:48.803
<v Speaker 5>Is the earth flat?</v>

9506
04:27:49.950 --> 04:27:50.730

04:29:09.960 --> 04:29:10.620
<v Speaker 5>Of course you do.</v>

9552
04:29:10.620 --> 04:29:12.840
<v Speaker 5>Do you believe we went to the moon six times and back?</v>

9553
04:29:13.140 --> 04:29:13.471
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

9554
04:29:13.471 --> 04:29:14.910
<v Speaker 5>of course we did.</v>

9555
04:29:15.750 --> 04:29:16.160
<v Speaker 5>You don't know.</v>

9556
04:29:16.160 --> 04:29:16.993
<v Speaker 5>You're on the fence.</v>

9557
04:29:17.010 --> 04:29:17.910
<v Speaker 5>He's from Ohio.</v>

9558
04:29:18.030 --> 04:29:19.410
<v Speaker 5>You don't know for sure.</v>

9559
04:29:19.411 --> 04:29:20.610
<v Speaker 5>We went in for sure.</v>

9560
04:29:20.611 --> 04:29:23.370
<v Speaker 5>We for sure went to the moon was on the stage.</v>

9561
04:29:23.570 --> 04:29:24.860
<v Speaker 5>I am not going to debate it.</v>

9562
04:29:24.870 --> 04:29:27.390
<v Speaker 5>I just want to know what you guys got your research.</v>

9563
04:29:27.480 --> 04:29:28.210
<v Speaker 5>Listen man,</v>

9564
04:29:28.210 --> 04:29:28.620
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

9565
04:29:28.620 --> 04:29:32.880
<v Speaker 5>here's 100 that shit I don't believe for one motherfucking second we went to the</v>

9566
04:29:32.881 --> 04:29:33.714
<v Speaker 5>fucking moon.</v>

9567
04:29:33.800 --> 04:29:37.290
<v Speaker 5>Six God damn times and back and we can't do it now.</v>

9568
04:29:37.410 --> 04:29:38.091
<v Speaker 5>We can't do it.</v>

9569
04:29:38.091 --> 04:29:39.100
<v Speaker 5>We can do it now.</v>

9570
04:29:39.650 --> 04:29:40.350
<v Speaker 5>Says we can do.</v>

9571
04:29:40.350 --> 04:29:42.300
<v Speaker 5>We got to figure out how to get through the van.</v>

9572
04:29:42.301 --> 04:29:44.330
<v Speaker 5>Allen radiation now.</v>

9573
04:29:44.340 --> 04:29:45.060
<v Speaker 5>That's what they said.</v>

9574
04:29:45.060 --> 04:29:45.930
<v Speaker 5>They're on record.</v>

9575
04:29:45.931 --> 04:29:46.764
<v Speaker 5>There's videos of it.</v>

9576
04:29:46.800 --> 04:29:49.050
<v Speaker 5>They're on record saying that now they're going to get two videos.</v>

9577
04:29:49.051 --> 04:29:49.501
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>

9578
04:29:49.501 --> 04:29:50.580
<v Speaker 5>we're going to get to the moon.</v>

9579
04:29:50.910 --> 04:29:53.550
<v Speaker 5>As soon as I talked to her house around three things,</v>

9580
04:29:53.670 --> 04:29:54.181
<v Speaker 5>three things.</v>

9581
04:29:54.181 --> 04:29:54.750
<v Speaker 5>They've got to figure it out.</v>

9582
04:29:54.750 --> 04:29:55.710
<v Speaker 5>They've already said it.</v>

9583
04:29:55.711 --> 04:29:56.544
<v Speaker 5>They were already admitted.</v>

9584
04:29:56.590 --> 04:29:58.020
<v Speaker 5>They've got to figure out how to get to the van.</v>

9585
04:29:58.021 --> 04:29:59.130
<v Speaker 5>Allen radiation belts.</v>

9586
04:29:59.410 --> 04:30:01.210
<v Speaker 5>They admitted that once they figured that out,</v>

9587
04:30:01.270 --> 04:30:02.640
<v Speaker 5>then they can have a man mission to them.</v>

9588
04:30:02.680 --> 04:30:02.860
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

9589
04:30:02.860 --> 04:30:03.311
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute.</v>

9590
04:30:03.311 --> 04:30:06.940
<v Speaker 5>Do we go six times and conditions change conditions.</v>

9591
04:30:09.190 --> 04:30:09.521
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

9592
04:30:09.521 --> 04:30:10.090
<v Speaker 5>beautiful,</v>

9593
04:30:10.090 --> 04:30:10.540
<v Speaker 5>beautiful.</v>

9594
04:30:10.540 --> 04:30:11.260
<v Speaker 5>And then the next,</v>

9595
04:30:11.260 --> 04:30:12.430
<v Speaker 5>the next thing they said,</v>

9596
04:30:12.580 --> 04:30:16.990
<v Speaker 5>they got to figure out the right uniform took to handle that kind of radiation.</v>

9597
04:30:17.140 --> 04:30:19.360
<v Speaker 5>They haven't figured out the right space soon.</v>

9598
04:30:20.770 --> 04:30:21.640
<v Speaker 5>Right back today,</v>

9599
04:30:23.780 --> 04:30:26.690
<v Speaker 5>because I never said that from Brendan</v>

9600
04:30:29.950 --> 04:30:30.783

<v Speaker 5>Congratulations so smoothly.</v>

9606
04:30:42.370 --> 04:30:44.500
<v Speaker 5>Unlike every other government agency,</v>

9607
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:46.270
<v Speaker 5>you guys got this shit down.</v>

9608
04:30:46.400 --> 04:30:47.150
<v Speaker 5>You'll figure it out.</v>

9609
04:30:47.150 --> 04:30:49.180
<v Speaker 5>We had manipulated media.</v>

9610
04:30:49.750 --> 04:30:52.240
<v Speaker 5>You figured out a way how to create Jim Morrison,</v>

9611
04:30:52.241 --> 04:30:54.880
<v Speaker 5>who's obviously one of the greatest musicians of all time.</v>

9612
04:30:55.060 --> 04:30:58.790
<v Speaker 5>He's done an amazing job and congratulations on tower seven</v>

9613
04:31:00.670 --> 04:31:01.930
<v Speaker 5>fell like butter.</v>

9614

<v Speaker 5>You guys are wizards.</v>

9615
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:04.531
<v Speaker 5>That's not odd,</v>

9616

<v Speaker 5>motherfucker.</v>

9617
04:31:05.530 --> 04:31:06.670
<v Speaker 5>There's a way.</v>

9618
04:31:07.030 --> 04:31:08.530
<v Speaker 5>There's a way and whatever,</v>

9619
04:31:08.650 --> 04:31:09.670
<v Speaker 5>whatever way that is,</v>

9620
04:31:09.671 --> 04:31:10.504
<v Speaker 5>you guys,</v>

9621

9623
04:31:13.961 --> 04:31:15.280
