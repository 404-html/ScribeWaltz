00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.490
<v Speaker 1>obviously the Western world has plenty of problems,</v>

4
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 1>but one thing the western world has pretty clearly is the even exchange of</v>

5
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>information and ideas.</v>

6
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>You might not agree with these ideas and you might meet and then that's it.</v>

7
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a problem with that as well.</v>

8
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.760
<v Speaker 1>but you have access to them,</v>

10
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.660
<v Speaker 1>you have access to them.</v>

11
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>And this access is like,</v>

12
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:20.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

13
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that's going on with Twitter.</v>

14
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if you know about this,</v>

15
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:25.380
<v Speaker 1>but Milo Yiannopoulos,</v>

16
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:26.214
<v Speaker 1>you know what he is?</v>

17
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>He got banned from Twitter for writing a bad review about Ghostbusters,</v>

18
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>which essentially confirms what he said about the regressive left is that</v>

19
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to stifle ideas like w and then they're saying that he's</v>

20
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:42.490
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the harassment of Leslie Jones.</v>

21
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

22
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Which is horrible.</v>

23
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>You know what people did?</v>

24
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>She's a fucking comedian.</v>

25
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>She's awesome.</v>

26
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.821
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

27
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:48.421
<v Speaker 1>She's great.</v>

28
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>She's funny shit,</v>

29
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:50.274
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

30
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>but also this is just trolls.</v>

32
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.701
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

33
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>You're always going to have trolls.</v>

34
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>But he didn't do that.</v>

35
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.300
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>

36
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>he's not responsible for,</v>

37
00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>he didn't like sin.</v>

38
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't the catalyst to the,</v>

39
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

40
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.140
<v Speaker 1>but what he did was make an incredible amount of sense when he was describing</v>

41
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>that you cannot make fun of this movie.</v>

42
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>You cannot criticize this movie if you do,</v>

43
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Speaker 1>you're labeled a massage.</v>

44
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.550
<v Speaker 1>And he talked about how preposterous this movie is that these women are all out</v>

45
00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>kicking ass and every man,</v>

46
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>the movie's a buffoon and the women don't have any negative traits or qualities</v>

47
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:21.890
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

48
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.321
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

49
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 1>They're super powerful and super awesome and hilarious.</v>

50
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

51
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>the humor is nonexistent because they put them in this restrictive box.</v>

52
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>He got banned from Twitter for that band,</v>

53
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:31.141
<v Speaker 1>for Twitter,</v>

54
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>for this you what they are.</v>

55
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.230
<v Speaker 1>They're blaming him on the harassment that Leslie experience inside of the</v>

56
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>inside anything.</v>

57
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.200
<v Speaker 1>He made a provocative article about a piece of art and that's what that movie is</v>

58
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:45.211
<v Speaker 1>a piece of art.</v>

59
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>So they are,</v>

60
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>they are guilty of censorship in the,</v>

61
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:48.624
<v Speaker 1>in the worst way.</v>

62
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.931
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is they're stifling ideas they don't agree with and they've,</v>

64
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.740
<v Speaker 1>they've decided that Twitter establish some weird fucking thing called the trust</v>

65
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.810
<v Speaker 1>and Security Council or something like that.</v>

66
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 1>And they brought all these social dressed justice worse.</v>

67
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Jamie looked that up.</v>

68
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:07.020
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that call that they tried to do?</v>

69
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 1>But they brought on all these people for this.</v>

70
00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

71
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Mao's China,</v>

72
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>but Jesus Christ,</v>

73
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:12.420
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

74
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.030
<v Speaker 1>very bizarre troll.</v>

75
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>It is thought patrol.</v>

76
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

77
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.321
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

78
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm against harassment.</v>

79
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>If you could stop people from being shitty to people and you say,</v>

80
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:21.151
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

81
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>here's someone who's using Twitter and they're going after people in a very</v>

82
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>shitty way.</v>

83
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is look at how many fucking people have made shitty,</v>

84
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>

85
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>evil comments about police officers,</v>

86
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 1>all police officers,</v>

87
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>trust and safety council.</v>

88
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.630
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to safety,</v>

89
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>everyone plays a role.</v>

90
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Please make that larger so I can read it.</v>

91
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Which one are your powers?</v>

92
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Twitter empowers every voice to shape the world,</v>

93
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do that unless you feel safe and confident enough to express</v>

94
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>yourself freely and connect with the world around you to help give your voice</v>

95
00:02:57.061 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>more power.</v>

96
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Twitter does not behavior intended to harass,</v>

97
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.463
<v Speaker 1>intimidate,</v>

98
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>or use fear to silence another user's voice.</v>

99
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.041
<v Speaker 1>Very general,</v>

100
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:06.874
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

101
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>So now you have a council that is deciding whether or not you're good enough for</v>

102
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Twitter as well.</v>

103
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>You know what the first thing they did with him,</v>

104
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't figure out what to do with him.</v>

105
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>They took away his verification.</v>

106
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

107
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.351
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

108
00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:19.581
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

109
00:03:19.581 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>What does that have to do with,</v>

110
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

111
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 1>what does that,</v>

112
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>he's not verified anymore.</v>

113
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>They took away a little blue chat.</v>

114
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

115
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>it's very dangerous.</v>

116
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a very dangerous,</v>

117
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.110
<v Speaker 1>slippery slope.</v>

118
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>But we see the scenario universities,</v>

119
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>you do exactly the same thing.</v>

120
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>When they did that,</v>

121
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>he gained 20,000 new followers immediately because there was a massive backlash.</v>

122
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>So now they're in a place where there is even more backlash.</v>

123
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:45.211
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you look at the actual words that he typed versus what they're accusing</v>

124
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:47.410
<v Speaker 1>him of and it just doesn't stack up,</v>

125
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 1>it's clear that they don't like him because he's a Republican.</v>

126
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>He's a Trump supporter.</v>

127
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 1>He and he is a fucking troll.</v>

128
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>

129
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he's hilarious.</v>

130
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.033
<v Speaker 1>He's a troll.</v>

131
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>But in the marketplace of ideas,</v>

132
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to combat his trolling behavior,</v>

133
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.120
<v Speaker 1>gag without gagging,</v>

134
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>gagging and engage him,</v>

135
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>engage him.</v>

136
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 1>In a debate and a vigorous spirit.</v>

137
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.343
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

138
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Gag The guy.</v>

139
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

140
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.190
<v Speaker 1>If you really feel like he has done something egregious,</v>

141
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>if he's done something that can be criticized,</v>

142
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>criticized it.</v>

143
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

144
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 1>And if he's actually harassing people,</v>

145
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>if he's actually saying,</v>

146
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

147
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.670
<v Speaker 1>go find Leslie Jones and,</v>

148
00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>and throw dog shit out,</v>

149
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>or do something horrible to her or slash your tires or something like that,</v>

150
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.600
<v Speaker 1>he's actually doing something like that.</v>

151
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

152
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.341
<v Speaker 1>Then you know,</v>

153
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>then he's doing this.</v>

154
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 1>That's where that you don't get up in a crowded movie theater and scream fire</v>

155
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:42.900
<v Speaker 1>because you'll create a stampede.</v>

156
00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:43.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

157
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

158
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.811
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

159
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 1>You know my Angela talked about that when she said where the Ku Ku Klux Klan was</v>

160
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:48.101
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

161
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>we have a freedom of speech,</v>

162
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:50.260
<v Speaker 1>and my Angela said,</v>

163
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 1>you're a freedom ends.</v>

164
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Your freedom of speech can end when you're literally telling people to hang me</v>

165
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 1>and you're telling a mob and I'm standing right there that the inciting them,</v>

166
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

167
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>that's probably where you know,</v>

168
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 1>we should take a look at things and we all know,</v>

169
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 1>we all know the line.</v>

170
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 1>We don't know about what,</v>

171
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.381
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

172
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:08.801
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>

173
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that that there is something called common decency and you know,</v>

174
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>people like to jump to these extremes,</v>

175
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

176
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't inform the debate.</v>

177
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying is so important.</v>

178
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>And then the idea that you've got to create safe haven for those that you agree</v>

179
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 1>with and disagree with.</v>

180
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Disagree with Milo all the time.</v>

181
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

182
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean he and I are friends and I've had him on the podcast twice and when we</v>

183
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:30.950
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

184
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm mock them when we have fun.</v>

185
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

186
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 1>but he's a good guy,</v>

187
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>but he's just really right wing.</v>

188
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I also think his trolling is so fucking sophisticated and he's one of the ones</v>

189
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 1>that was saying that he believes that Melania,</v>

190
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:44.794
<v Speaker 1>how do you say her name?</v>

191
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Trump.</v>

192
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.971
<v Speaker 1>Melania.</v>

193
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Is that her name?</v>

194
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

195
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 1>he thinks that they did it on purpose.</v>

196
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>He thinks Trump is a master troll and he thinks that the plagiarism was on</v>

197
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>purpose because now more people are talking about it and then more people are,</v>

198
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true,</v>

199
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's hilarious that you did you know that his tweet,</v>

200
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Trump's tweet that he put out to congratulate his wife for speaking is exactly</v>

201
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.080
<v Speaker 1>verbatim the same tweet that Obama put out to congratulate his wife for</v>

202
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:19.290
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>

203
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

204
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

205
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Every single word in the exact same order.</v>

206
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

207
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

208
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.961
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

209
00:06:27.961 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty calculated.</v>

210
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.553
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

211
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he writes his own tweets.</v>

212
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.220
<v Speaker 1>That apparently wasn't true.</v>

213
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Is it fake like that was like photoshopped.</v>

214
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

215
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 1>this fuckers they got me.</v>

216
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 1>That was the other thing they did.</v>

217
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry about that folks.</v>

218
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that they did with the Leslie Jones,</v>

219
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>which she was really upset,</v>

220
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.970
<v Speaker 1>is that trolls were taking words and putting them like they were taking a</v>

221
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 1>Photoshop and making her like her name,</v>

222
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 1>like what she had heard her Twitter name and then writing horrible shit about</v>

223
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:57.650
<v Speaker 1>gay people and then putting it in there.</v>

224
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

225
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>But Leslie Jones and again,</v>

226
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I love her.</v>

227
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.420
<v Speaker 1>I think she's really funny.</v>

228
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 1>She said some kind of fucked up things on,</v>

229
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 1>on Twitter herself and you know,</v>

230
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 1>things that can be construed as racist.</v>

231
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>One of the things she said like about white people being shit fuck white people.</v>

232
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:15.351
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

233
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Like something like that.</v>

234
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 1>It was a on on Breitbart.</v>

235
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>See if you could,</v>

236
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 1>you'd find the actual,</v>

237
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:20.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

238
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.991
<v Speaker 1>things that they were,</v>

239
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 1>there were saying that like,</v>

240
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:24.620
<v Speaker 1>how could Leslie Jones get away with saying this?</v>

241
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.100
<v Speaker 1>But Milo gets banned for writing an article and I'm not you ma'am.</v>

242
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 1>But I think what Leslie said,</v>

243
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:33.471
<v Speaker 1>like white people,</v>

244
00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:34.304
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

245
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 1>it could've been that she was saying like,</v>

246
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.620
<v Speaker 1>someone did something and Goddamn white people,</v>

247
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 1>this is some white people.</v>

248
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

249
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

250
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:41.511
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

251
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

252
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 1>she's funny.</v>

253
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Like when people climb into a zoo and try to fucking hug a tiger,</v>

254
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.173
<v Speaker 1>that's why people,</v>

255
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.430
<v Speaker 1>that's why people shit.</v>

256
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.263
<v Speaker 1>That's funny though.</v>

257
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.580
<v Speaker 1>And Laissez anybody who knows me knows she's great.</v>

258
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.700
<v Speaker 1>She's just that fucking Dall Lord have mercy white people.</v>

259
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

260
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.380
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean though?</v>

261
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 1>It's white people shit.</v>

262
00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.840
<v Speaker 1>They crazy style.</v>

263
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:00.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

264
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:01.160
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

265
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Like why did she say that?</v>

266
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that about who imagine a white person,</v>

267
00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 1>but look at this,</v>

268
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.660
<v Speaker 1>imagine a white person saying that about black people.</v>

269
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:09.381
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>

270
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:10.370
<v Speaker 1>but I think I,</v>

271
00:08:10.371 --> 00:08:10.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 1>we've heard this before and we,</v>

273
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

274
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Leslie Jones is not a racist and Leslie Jones's,</v>

275
00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 1>it never been anything but really kind to people around her.</v>

276
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.981
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

277
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:22.160
<v Speaker 1>But hold on a second because sometimes people say things that are racist and</v>

278
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 1>they're not racist.</v>

279
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:23.960
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying to be funny.</v>

280
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

281
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.311
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

282
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:27.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean Hawaii 2 cents and if sometimes it,</v>

283
00:08:27.151 --> 00:08:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Ross is hilarious and he says a lot of racial stuff when he deserves</v>

284
00:08:31.421 --> 00:08:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Silberman Bowl,</v>

285
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.903
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Silverman.</v>

286
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 1>But if Jeff Ross in particular,</v>

287
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 1>because he's really good at roasting people and a lot of the stuff that he says,</v>

288
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

289
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

290
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 1>he crosses what some people would say is a line,</v>

291
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:41.871
<v Speaker 1>but what is he doing?</v>

292
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 1>He's being funny.</v>

293
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.490
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>

294
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:45.440
<v Speaker 1>there is a difference.</v>

295
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.050
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of times if you're Hispanic,</v>

296
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

297
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.393
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

298
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:50.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

299
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>you're from a marginalized group,</v>

300
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.910
<v Speaker 1>you can get away with it because you,</v>

301
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:59.090
<v Speaker 1>you all share in a common experience of repression.</v>

302
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

303
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 1>So like gay people can mock straight people guide,</v>

304
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:03.841
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

305
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Mock me for liking Posey.</v>

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

307
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.260
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>

308
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:06.871
<v Speaker 1>Cause we don't,</v>

309
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 1>we've never had to pay a price for that kind of oppression.</v>

310
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.590
<v Speaker 1>We haven't,</v>

311
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 1>not physically and not,</v>

312
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>not economically issue because we've been oppressed for being straight forever.</v>

313
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a constant thing.</v>

314
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:22.200
<v Speaker 1>People were just so mad that we're saying breeder fucking breeder,</v>

315
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 1>they're making babies.</v>

316
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
