<v Speaker 1>Represents self reflexivity or cyclicality,</v>

2
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>especially in the sense of something constantly recreating itself,</v>

3
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>the eternal return and other things perceived as cycles.</v>

84
00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:44.830
<v Speaker 1>His whole life he knew it.</v>

85
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Did he?</v>

86
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.390
<v Speaker 1>What was it they they adopt or they find a sperm donor?</v>

87
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it's his real mom and then she just married someone later.</v>

88
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it is.</v>

90
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.960
<v Speaker 1>And his,</v>

91
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>he has a real sister too.</v>

00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:56.151
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

95
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:59.390

96
00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>but essentially lesbian.</v>

97
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>What is your take on like this Chaz Bono situation?</v>

99
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that fascinating?</v>

100
00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Incoming?</v>

101
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

102
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:11.341
<v Speaker 1>Becoming a man when he was raised by a woman who was super duper famous and then</v>

103
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.380
<v Speaker 1>chooses somewhere along the line to to,</v>

104
00:03:15.381 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>to change sex and become a man.</v>

105
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:18.000
<v Speaker 1>When you think about that shit,</v>

106
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I think there are some people with their mind's fucked up in a way that we don't</v>

107
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:23.510
<v Speaker 1>understand and I think some things went wrong.</v>

108
00:03:23.511 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>It's the middle of war without thumbs,</v>

109
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>so maybe somebody is born with the wrong sex and you just know it.</v>

110
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Just know it.</v>

111
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

112
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a man.</v>

113
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a man.</v>

114
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 1>You're probably going to feel like I have vagina,</v>

115
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

116
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>

117
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:36.461
<v Speaker 1>I think it's awesome.</v>

118
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>We can fix that shit now,</v>

119
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

120
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.093
<v Speaker 1>Dog.</v>

121
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

122
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.183
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>

123
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.993
<v Speaker 1>I heard that sound.</v>

124
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree with you,</v>

125
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:53.351
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

126
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:53.681
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

127
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:53.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:54.840
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about before,</v>

129
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I have a thyroid problem.</v>

130
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>My thyroid doesn't work good.</v>

131
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.431
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

132
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:59.450
<v Speaker 1>some people's brains firing correctly.</v>

133
00:03:59.451 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Some people were really probably their chemical makeup.</v>

134
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 1>They should've been a boy or a girl.</v>

135
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.790
<v Speaker 1>There's no preconceived derogatory things that have to do with the fibroid.</v>

136
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Lucky for you to want to go.</v>

137
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:09.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

139
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

140
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.880
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want to go through a sex change,</v>

141
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:13.130
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I got to think you're really telling the truth.</v>

00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:21.731

00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>It's hacked off and they've got to grow me a cock.</v>

00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 1>They can't now think grow an ear on a mice though.</v>

150
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.731
<v Speaker 1>I worked for,</v>

151
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I worked for a transsexual,</v>

152
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.173
<v Speaker 1>preop transsexual,</v>

153
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.790
<v Speaker 1>but I was in a law firm.</v>

154
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.673
<v Speaker 1>You work the file room.</v>

155
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.550

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.530

157
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

158
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>What did it feel like?</v>

159
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

160
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>he said he would have to go to face them,</v>

161
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:50.410
<v Speaker 1>so we'd have to put his leg on top of them.</v>

162
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.083
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

163
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get a straight man to fuck you?</v>

164
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm a woman.</v>

165
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.223
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't they</v>

166
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 1>or they fuck him?</v>

167
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Fuck him in the ass and do they know they're fucking,</v>

168
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

169
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 1>They just like,</v>

171
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I know you're real.</v>

172
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>You're a woman or your heart or something.</v>

173
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

174
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who is gay and he says that gay guys suck his Dick.</v>

175
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 1>All the tar straight guys rather on silent.</v>

176
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

177
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 1>He says he gets straight guys to suck his dick.</v>

178
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>He says they,</v>

179
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 1>they act curious a bar somewhere and he'll tell them there that he's gay and</v>

180
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>then there'll be curious and before you know they're blowing him.</v>

181
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.721
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

182
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:26.640
<v Speaker 1>it happens all the time.</v>

183
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.921
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

184
00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 1>that's not a fucking straight guy man.</v>

185
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.150
<v Speaker 1>You're saying you've got a straight guy to suck your Dick.</v>

186
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.640
<v Speaker 1>You got a gay guy who was in the closet to blow you.</v>

187
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a straight guy.</v>

188
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>You met him at a gay bar</v>

189
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

190
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.540
<v Speaker 1>There's certain people have degrees of gay and um,</v>

191
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 1>you know how we talked about yesterday,</v>

192
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 1>this new girl that you're dating,</v>

193
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>it's got you so excited and you could fuck all the time.</v>

194
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like you connect to her and this,</v>

195
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 1>this straight sex.</v>

196
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a vibe between the two of units,</v>

197
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 1>like a powerful straight sex vibe.</v>

198
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I think some dudes can get dudes to be gay.</v>

199
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Like you might have been really happy with being straight and having a wife and</v>

200
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 1>children and you know,</v>

201
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 1>and having like some sort of a weird,</v>

202
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>none exciting sex life and less,</v>

203
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.400
<v Speaker 1>you met the right gay guy along the way.</v>

204
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>It turned your ass and made you be a super gay freakazoid,</v>

205
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>which is very possible.</v>

206
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

207
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 1>if you just,</v>

208
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the right person,</v>

209
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 1>the right stage of your life.</v>

210
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying you cause you couldn't and I'm not saying you can,</v>

211
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>but you can be on the offense.</v>

212
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I think those people are already like probably bisexual,</v>

213
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>but hiding it.</v>

214
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's</v>

215
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.780
<v Speaker 1>like that joke that I used to do about,</v>

216
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

217
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.280
<v Speaker 1>about people.</v>

218
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>There's somewhere out there,</v>

219
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.940
<v Speaker 1>there's someone who could talk some people into suck in the deck.</v>

220
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.640
<v Speaker 1>That is just the way it is.</v>

221
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.210
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

222
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

223
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.453
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

224
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a fact that some people can just be tricked and it doesn't necessarily mean</v>

225
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 1>they're gay.</v>

226
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's one of the reasons why so many people are afraid of gay</v>

227
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

228
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 1>What they're afraid of.</v>

229
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 1>It's being tricked by a superior intellect that happens to be homosexual.</v>

230
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.481
<v Speaker 1>And then actually,</v>

231
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:56.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

232
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 1>that guy is shooting loads and your asshole.</v>

233
00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

234
00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.960
<v Speaker 1>it's terrifying for,</v>

235
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.853
<v Speaker 1>for retards.</v>

236
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.660
<v Speaker 1>Whoops,</v>

237
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.493
<v Speaker 1>Don people,</v>

238
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.573
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

239
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.933

240
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.281

00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:14.150

244

<v Speaker 1>Giorgio pleasure.</v>

260
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.043
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>

261
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.190
<v Speaker 1>You're from ancient aliens.</v>

262
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.710
<v Speaker 1>He never seen the shootout with the crazy hair.</v>

264
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.200
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

265
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:51.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

266
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.240
<v Speaker 1>but I liked the hair</v>

267
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.050
<v Speaker 1>look so weird that</v>

268
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.570
<v Speaker 1>started rolling.</v>

269
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.680
<v Speaker 1>We got to get the fuck out of here.</v>

270
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm quite sure it gets weird.</v>

271
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.270
<v Speaker 2>The trick is to</v>

272
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.130
<v Speaker 2>build the city</v>

273
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.540
<v Speaker 2>that's going on right now,</v>

274
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:28.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

275
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Doug Benson,</v>

276
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.993
<v Speaker 2>am I correct?</v>

277
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I have a feeling it's all in our minds.</v>

278
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.790
<v Speaker 1>I have a feeling of the whole alien experience.</v>

279
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.050
<v Speaker 1>There's all psychedelic chemicals including all the shit that was created and</v>

280
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:45.760
<v Speaker 1>nobody could figure out what's the pyramids or all these other crazy structures.</v>

281
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that you guys were down on the money when you talk about ancient</v>

282
00:08:49.241 --> 00:08:51.730
<v Speaker 1>civilizations going to talk about like Graham Hancock can shit,</v>

283
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.890
<v Speaker 1>but there was some super advanced civilization,</v>

284
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.050
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they got it.</v>

285
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I think they got drugs and I think the drugs are the aliens.</v>

286
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And I think when you take those trucks,</v>

287
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:02.120
<v Speaker 1>you contact alien.</v>

288
00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.240
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not bullshitting you.</v>

289
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Take DMT,</v>

290
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

291
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I think you're contacting the elements.</v>

292
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:07.800
<v Speaker 1>I really fucking do.</v>

293
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I felt raped of mentally but in the best way ever.</v>

294
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 1>When I came back to that,</v>

295
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:18.081
<v Speaker 1>like someone just saw through me and sees me for this really insignificant like</v>

296
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>style of creature,</v>

297
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>really like mundane and really easy to solve and figure out.</v>

299
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.740
<v Speaker 1>It just exposed me and um,</v>

300
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 1>expose me to infinite wisdom that was impossible to grasp.</v>

301
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 1>But it did it all on some sort of a language.</v>

302
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I think that is the alien.</v>

303
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 1>I think the alien is psychedelic chemicals.</v>

304
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 1>And we know if there's a great history of human use of psychedelic chemicals</v>

305
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 1>dating back thousands and thousands of years,</v>

306
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms draw on cave walls,</v>

307
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:43.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

308
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:44.610
<v Speaker 1>all the evidence of,</v>

309
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 1>of ritualistic use of cannabis that takes thousands and thousands of years BC.</v>

310
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.910
<v Speaker 1>So if we know that they knew about all this shit,</v>

311
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.460
<v Speaker 1>we know that they knew about the avenue,</v>

312
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.740
<v Speaker 1>the miscarriage mushroom and,</v>

313
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

314
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:54.510
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

315
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.321
<v Speaker 1>and the Amazon,</v>

316
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:58.290
<v Speaker 1>they've been doing Iowasca for thousands and thousands of years.</v>

317
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.480
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know how long because they don't even write it down.</v>

318
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.710
<v Speaker 1>They just always have done it.</v>

319
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.151
<v Speaker 1>That's the alien,</v>

320
00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

321
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the alien.</v>

322
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 1>The alien is these compounds and the aliens are real because these top pounds,</v>

323
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll allow you to get to this other place.</v>

324
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.490
<v Speaker 1>They allow you to communicate with something and that's why all these people</v>

325
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.790
<v Speaker 1>were abducted in the middle of the night.</v>

326
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

327
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 1>they're abducted in the middle of the night because that's when your brain is</v>

328
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 1>producing DMT.</v>

329
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.960
<v Speaker 1>That's when your brain spruce and psychedelic chemicals and when your brain</v>

330
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:22.950
<v Speaker 1>produces those chemicals,</v>

331
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:25.620
<v Speaker 1>it opens that gateway and you communicate with these fucking things.</v>

332
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 1>We just want everything real to be,</v>

333
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:28.920
<v Speaker 1>someone said this,</v>

334
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Terence Mckenna,</v>

335
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.810
<v Speaker 1>that people have a problem with something that's real,</v>

336
00:10:32.811 --> 00:10:34.140
<v Speaker 1>that you can't hit with a hammer.</v>

337
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

338
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.600
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a real way of putting it.</v>

339
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:38.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a real issue cause farts are real as fuck dude,</v>

340
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.730
<v Speaker 1>you can't wrap your hands around them but you know they're real.</v>

341
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Sound is real.</v>

342
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.000
<v Speaker 1>But we accept it because we're so used to it.</v>

343
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.690
<v Speaker 1>The idea that this is an invisible thing can can transmit music and harmony and</v>

344
00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:52.480
<v Speaker 1>and beautiful feelings and make you fucking pumped up and you hear it,</v>

345
00:10:52.481 --> 00:10:54.070
<v Speaker 1>your car singing it and what the,</v>

346
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.170
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>

347
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 1>It's invisible shit and invisible shitting but it's coming for fucking</v>

348
00:10:58.261 --> 00:10:59.400
<v Speaker 1>satellites down to us.</v>

349
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.700
<v Speaker 1>We want to think that we've got the whole world figured out.</v>

350
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 1>We want to think that we know what's real and what's here and that all the</v>

351
00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:08.730
<v Speaker 1>weekends sense is all it is there.</v>

352
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:09.481
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>

353
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:10.171
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

354
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:11.400
<v Speaker 1>I said that's ridiculous.</v>

355
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.510
<v Speaker 1>And I say if you look at some shit that your own brain produces and this shift</v>

356
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:16.710
<v Speaker 1>that your own brain producers,</v>

357
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:17.760
<v Speaker 1>producers,</v>

358
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.660
<v Speaker 1>profound visions and clinical experiences,</v>

359
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I got to think that that shit is the alien.</v>

360
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

361
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not dudes and metal crafts are coming from outer space.</v>

362
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.660
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking fine that you mix with a leave and the boil it fire and the Amazon</v>

363
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:40.950
<v Speaker 1>for fucking 10 hours and then you drink the shit and go on a ride with the</v>

364
00:11:40.951 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 1>flying serpents fucking twist around you and they're all made out of light,</v>

365
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

366
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.260
<v Speaker 1>and they teach you about the spirit world and your ancestors and that everyone's</v>

367
00:11:49.261 --> 00:11:50.580
<v Speaker 1>around you all the time,</v>

368
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:51.540
<v Speaker 1>always and forever.</v>

369
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Speaker 1>They just move in and out at different.</v>

370
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>That's some fucking to the sticker thing under your ass.</v>

371
00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.280
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

372
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's crazy to all the people you're talking to you on your show are</v>

373
00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:03.394
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>

374
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Got To show that everyone's misunderstood and everyone's crazy and they both had</v>

375
00:12:08.381 --> 00:12:09.140
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

376
00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.560
<v Speaker 1>But what you need to do is get them high on DMT and they'd go,</v>

377
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.693
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

378
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.143
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

379
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:15.283
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

380
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you a video channel and just smoke some shit.</v>

381
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:21.820
<v Speaker 1>And when I'm bored,</v>

382
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 1>you understand what's happening here.</v>

383
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not here.</v>

384
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're never going to see them all that shit flying over London.</v>

385
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:29.044
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to see him.</v>

386
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.630
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I'm thinking about aliens.</v>

387
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.861
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

388
00:12:32.861 --> 00:12:34.090
<v Speaker 1>that kills the whole show.</v>

389
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.050
<v Speaker 1>That was that whole shot.</v>

390
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.560
<v Speaker 1>So let's keep speculating.</v>

391
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:47.430
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

392
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming out before I come up,</v>

393
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:50.090
<v Speaker 2>I got a bunch of new friends.</v>

394
00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I got Doug Benson in their house</v>

395
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.530
<v Speaker 2>and as far as going to bring up is in my opinion,</v>

396
00:12:58.531 --> 00:13:00.510
<v Speaker 2>the funniest human on the face of the earth.</v>

397
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.730
<v Speaker 2>You might know him from the longest yard.</v>

398
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.650
<v Speaker 2>You might know him from my podcast.</v>

399
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:05.623
<v Speaker 2>You might know.</v>

400
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Give it up for joing.</v>

401
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.203
<v Speaker 2>Kakoda</v>
