1
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Why were you looking at me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So slide Jamie,</v>

2
00:00:07.551 --> 00:00:10.480
<v Speaker 1>you made me nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made me nervous.</v>

3
00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:11.510
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is he doing?</v>

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Is he playing or we already live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fucking live.</v>

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.163
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted something today that somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted me or I read something that </v>

7
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:23.330
<v Speaker 1>somebody tweeted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I quoted it but it wasn't right.</v>

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.933
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is pretty close that Donald Trump </v>

9
00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:32.321
<v Speaker 1>will be 70 years old and six days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is seven months in,</v>

10
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>six days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven months.</v>

11
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Seven year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 years old.</v>

12
00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Seven months and six days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost seven year old years old.</v>

13
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Seven months and seven days when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes the president.</v>

14
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.880
<v Speaker 1>And he won by 77 electoral votes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven electors.</v>

15
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.533
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Happy seventh anniversary of the jre </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

17
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>This is basically it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mara.</v>

19
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that?</v>

20
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

21
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of sevens 97.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you obsessed with seven?</v>

22
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:08.154
<v Speaker 1>It's like why is your sure</v>

23
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.053
<v Speaker 2>came from the jre one time we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about how we were in a </v>

24
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 2>simulation theory and how everything's </v>
<v Speaker 2>made out of ones and Zeros.</v>

25
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 2>And I said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hack it.</v>

26
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to start saying sevens or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

27
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 2>I can't even remember what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's all from that.</v>

28
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 2>So this is your shirt that has all </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>

29
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.921
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

30
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a made from seventh.</v>

31
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it just a bunch of different colors?</v>

32
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:30.894
<v Speaker 1>Sevens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

33
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.720
<v Speaker 1>To make the artwork and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweatshirts,</v>

34
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.530
<v Speaker 1>the death squad seven 11 shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why seven though?</v>

35
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>And I know it came from the jre from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time ago.</v>

36
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno where,</v>

37
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine,</v>

38
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.283
<v Speaker 1>imagine if that's proof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If like people look back on this and </v>

39
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>they realize they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there really is a simulation.</v>

40
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>You tap into it by make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make things happen with your own</v>

41
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:53.904
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

42
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I think the older I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more crazy I get.</v>

43
00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Cause I've believe it more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

44
00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 2>like I start feeling like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go crazy sometimes.</v>

45
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.523
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's crazy to think that it's </v>

46
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>impossible that it's a simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

47
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>just think about what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

48
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Just think about the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just if no one was in his room,</v>

49
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>but us just for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously we're doing a podcast,</v>

50
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>but if no one was in this room other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than us,</v>

51
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.803
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at each other through our </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyeballs with thinking about it inside </v>

52
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:24.054
<v Speaker 1>of our brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're assuming that we're all operating </v>

53
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>in the same area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming you see what I see.</v>

54
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming like what I think of as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality around you is what you,</v>

55
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>but I have zero evidence other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>photos and again,</v>

56
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at those photos and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of those photos.</v>

57
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what you're saying.</v>

58
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.073
<v Speaker 1>Then we're dealing with language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to formulate words that match </v>

59
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts and they almost never do.</v>

60
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.573
<v Speaker 1>Like that's one of the number one </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that people have with </v>

61
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

62
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.653
<v Speaker 1>We know in some weird way that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>words and their thoughts are not in </v>

63
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:02.344
<v Speaker 1>sync.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we want your words and your </v>

64
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>thoughts to be in sync,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking hard to do man.</v>

65
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.673
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the unspoken things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about being a person is how fucking </v>

66
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.084
<v Speaker 1>difficult it is to get your thoughts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come out the way you're feeling them </v>

67
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>with your words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to do.</v>

68
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.513
<v Speaker 1>You can make something that's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so eloquent and with the UV articulate </v>

69
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:27.334
<v Speaker 1>and it would be amazing to read and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quote that people might have on their </v>

70
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>fucking instagram page for the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>decade,</v>

71
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.783
<v Speaker 1>but did it really represent what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were thinking or was it just a clever </v>

72
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>collection of words that strikes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect?</v>

73
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.233
<v Speaker 1>So when people are just talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not nothing like reading someone's </v>

74
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 1>writing or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just talking like,</v>

75
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking hard to get your brain like</v>

76
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>what's coming out of your brain to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented by your voice.</v>

77
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.140
<v Speaker 1>That alone is way weirder than the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is all fake.</v>

78
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>That's way weirder than a simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

79
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Just communicating just shit we totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>take for granted.</v>

80
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Then the fact that you could do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>

81
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.333
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many he's fucking dudes have </v>
<v Speaker 1>these youtube channels and gals have </v>

82
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:12.844
<v Speaker 1>these youtube channels with have fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people paying attention to </v>

83
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like for the most part,</v>

84
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>like Hollywood hasn't even figured it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out yet.</v>

85
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Like they've dabbled in MP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've given people shows like that.</v>

86
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Adam ruins everything guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

87
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 1>He was a youtube pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Great.</v>

88
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 1>He's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny fucking show too.</v>

89
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>He's really good at it and he's a Gamer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He twitches all the time.</v>

90
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>And he said he's on a marathon the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day watching it.</v>

91
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 1>But then there's other people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

92
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.633
<v Speaker 1>like the guy from yesterday that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a thrown off the delta airline and </v>

93
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:44.134
<v Speaker 1>it happened with that.</v>

94
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.890
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what happened.</v>

95
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 1>And then we found out that he's done </v>
<v Speaker 1>this before he goes,</v>

96
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.170
<v Speaker 1>he pretty much goes on airplanes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trolls and he,</v>

97
00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:57.790
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he counts in Arabic like 10,</v>

98
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

99
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 1>seven and does shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's done it before.</v>

100
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:03.064
<v Speaker 1>There's videos of him doing it before </v>
<v Speaker 1>say pretty much just freaks everybody </v>

101
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:05.861
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

102
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:07.980
<v Speaker 1>why is this guy counting down?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

103
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.823
<v Speaker 1>It's like if anyone was on an airplane </v>
<v Speaker 1>and counting down and would still be </v>

104
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:13.294
<v Speaker 1>We need to like for pranks we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out like what's a prank and what </v>

106
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 1>is fucking with people's lives for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>short amount of time.</v>

107
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the only,</v>

108
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:26.520
<v Speaker 1>the only way like it goes legit is if </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people of good nature and at the end</v>

109
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sign off on a release.</v>

110
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

111
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>They'll sign off on a release for </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube videos as well.</v>

112
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 1>If there's any money at attached to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say yes,</v>

113
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.110
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

114
00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how that works.</v>

115
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 1>But when you're scaring the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like that on a plane,</v>

116
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.010
<v Speaker 1>like you could really fuck with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

117
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

118
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know you're a young fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy guy who's fearless,</v>

119
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>who does those kinds of videos and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's funny,</v>

120
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>but you got to realize it might be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>some grandma behind you.</v>

121
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>There might be a five year old girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might be,</v>

122
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude who</v>

123
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 3>has like some serious tension issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not nice.</v>

124
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.351
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

125
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 3>it's not funny enough for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for us to accept that.</v>

126
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:07.904
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these boundaries get tested </v>

127
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 3>sometimes by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

128
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 3>really in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brave performers.</v>

129
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.140
<v Speaker 3>It's a brave thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not smart.</v>

130
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not thoughtful,</v>

131
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 3>but two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to do that.</v>

132
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.913
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to go on a fucking plane and </v>
<v Speaker 3>start counting down from 10 and Arabic </v>

133
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 3>and hope that nobody beats you to death </v>
<v Speaker 3>before you,</v>

134
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

261
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.740
<v Speaker 3>I F I have this vague memory of some </v>
<v Speaker 3>really weird twisted seduction scene.</v>

262
00:12:26.581 --> 00:12:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's sucking his finger.</v>

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

264
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:34.120
<v Speaker 3>Little cross eyed almost dude fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>bangs</v>

265
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.753
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old was she was supposed to be like </v>

266
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:43.780
<v Speaker 3>seven to 17 she was 17 when he did this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

267
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 3>So that's the locally when it says </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it says.</v>

268
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh Daily Mail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

269
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:48.814
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>17 year old even shared a kiss and a </v>

270
00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:54.370
<v Speaker 3>thumb sucking and the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What to know?</v>

271
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:55.204
<v Speaker 3>That's dark dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause Dinero had to be like deep in his </v>

272
00:12:57.881 --> 00:13:02.881
<v Speaker 3>forties then that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>17 that should be illegal.</v>

273
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.140
<v Speaker 3>That's a loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

274
00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:07.540
<v Speaker 3>that's a loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

275
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:10.180
<v Speaker 3>because it's in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can't fuck that kid.</v>

276
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.800
<v Speaker 3>Like probably say you probably shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a 17 year old sucking your thumb.</v>

277
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:15.933
<v Speaker 3>But my point was that like this was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time ago and we didn't look at </v>

278
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:22.050
<v Speaker 3>things the same way a long time ago as </v>
<v Speaker 3>we do today.</v>

279
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:22.993
<v Speaker 3>It's more evidence that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird gigantic shift in the way people </v>

280
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:31.411
<v Speaker 3>are recognizing and understanding the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of things like child abuse,</v>

281
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or things like that.</v>

282
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.430
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's weird.</v>

283
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.123
<v Speaker 3>I saw a creepy guy at the mall the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>day looking at the cub scouts or boy </v>

284
00:13:41.981 --> 00:13:44.140
<v Speaker 3>scouts did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were wrapping presence.</v>

285
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.420
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he just used to be a boy scout </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>

286
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.490
<v Speaker 3>Well the asked for the days it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>limber.</v>

287
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.400
<v Speaker 3>I would say the same thing if it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>rubbing his dick against the railing.</v>

288
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.220
<v Speaker 3>He sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

289
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.083
<v Speaker 3>Maybe just barely get stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How he was three stories up and just </v>

290
00:13:58.241 --> 00:14:00.350
<v Speaker 3>rubbing his dick left and right on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>railing,</v>

291
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.330
<v Speaker 3>staring straight down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear about the security guard at</v>

292
00:14:03.331 --> 00:14:04.920
<v Speaker 3>the NFL game the other day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

293
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.040

<v Speaker 3>cheerleader right in front of them.</v>

294

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

298
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.300
<v Speaker 3>See in his pants he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe it.</v>

299
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 3>I've seen too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen too much.</v>

300
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:21.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen too much.</v>

301
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.520
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ right in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone.</v>

302
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 3>There's people like so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must be just getting his rocks off in</v>

303
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:30.670
<v Speaker 3>the biggest way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm off the freak.</v>

304
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.870
<v Speaker 3>What a security guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking what a world dude.</v>

305
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.060
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's a real yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

306
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.700
<v Speaker 3>but it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my thought was that this,</v>

307
00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:41.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this bebe kid,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

309
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.730
<v Speaker 3>has anybody ever gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

310
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.040
<v Speaker 3>I guess people have gone through that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and become more friendly,</v>

311
00:14:48.041 --> 00:14:50.680
<v Speaker 3>but I had a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or just worked with another dude who was</v>

312
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:51.514

<v Speaker 3>did a television show together and it's </v>

313
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:55.154
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

315
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.890
<v Speaker 3>I think that someone who grows up </v>
<v Speaker 3>famous,</v>

316
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.410
<v Speaker 3>unless you're like some really cool </v>
<v Speaker 3>person that figures it out,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's almost impossible to break if </v>

<v Speaker 3>that's a big factor for sure.</v>

348
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.370
<v Speaker 3>Being a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

349
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:41.813
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing about being dudes </v>

350
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.950
<v Speaker 3>being the dude is a lot like having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>

351
00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:48.380
<v Speaker 3>a car that's just like a little too fast</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the road.</v>

352
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.060
<v Speaker 3>Like you're always pushing it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what being a dude is.</v>

353
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.953
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially guys growing up around a </v>

354
00:16:54.861 --> 00:16:58.550
<v Speaker 3>bunch of other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all competing wrestling and shit</v>

355
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.110
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude in each other.</v>

356
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.370
<v Speaker 3>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It becomes,</v>

357
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.600
<v Speaker 3>if they feed off of each other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

358
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.593
<v Speaker 3>people feed off each other and men don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have enough outlets for natural male </v>

359
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:11.630
<v Speaker 3>behavior you just told you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>think like that.</v>

360
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.950
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

361
00:17:12.951 --> 00:17:15.080
<v Speaker 3>You should be more aware,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be more kind.</v>

362
00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:16.453
<v Speaker 3>That's all nice and you're right 100% </v>
<v Speaker 3>but you got to deal with the fucking </v>

363
00:17:20.241 --> 00:17:21.074
<v Speaker 3>biology of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body wants to smash shit and fuck </v>

364
00:17:23.211 --> 00:17:25.040
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what it's built for.</v>

365
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.143
<v Speaker 3>And so if you don't feed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't give it some sort of </v>

366
00:17:28.341 --> 00:17:30.650
<v Speaker 3>exertion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to play tricks on you.</v>

367
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.100
<v Speaker 3>It's going to over ramp stressful </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations.</v>

368
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Gonna make you more upset at things more</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy.</v>

369
00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:39.170
<v Speaker 3>It's going to make you more prone to </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting pissed off in traffic.</v>

370
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.560
<v Speaker 3>All those things like that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>addressed.</v>

371
00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:43.394
<v Speaker 3>Like people have to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just ask boys to just be be </v>

372
00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:50.180
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

373
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to give them like some sort </v>

374
00:17:51.481 --> 00:17:53.820
<v Speaker 1>of biological tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

375
00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.370
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will obviously I wasn't there,</v>

376
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I was there,</v>

377
00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I probably would have had probably the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same problems with it that you did,</v>

378
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.220
<v Speaker 1>but I can't imagine being that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>

379
00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just like she's gone.</v>

385
00:18:20.401 --> 00:18:25.401
<v Speaker 1>She's a part of this giant machine of </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies and TV and publicity and fame and</v>

386
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.960

<v Speaker 1>She didn't know shit.</v>

388
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.590
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that formed her whole life.</v>

389
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.690
<v Speaker 1>And people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh boo hoo.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Life is hell and you're starving to </v>

398
00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

<v Speaker 1>your life is a hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris Hilton's holding it together.</v>

400
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.033
<v Speaker 1>She kind of pulled away from fame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might've been like a really smart </v>

401
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:07.890
<v Speaker 1>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She might've like felt the repercussions</v>

402
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.813
<v Speaker 1>of all that hate because nobody puts </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves out there in a position more </v>

403
00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:16.410
<v Speaker 1>so than someone who becomes a reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>star.</v>

404
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.960
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you become a reality star,</v>

405
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:23.990
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of admitting that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do anything right.</v>

406
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.630
<v Speaker 1>If you're just a reality star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

407
00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:26.850
<v Speaker 1>you don't do anything.</v>

408
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.020
<v Speaker 1>You're not singing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not reading books that you wrote.</v>

409
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.880
<v Speaker 1>You're not like doing public readings of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a book.</v>

410
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.180
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just being a person,</v>

411
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody can fucking be a person,</v>

412
00:19:38.551 --> 00:19:39.570
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

413
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.570
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing if you have a reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

414
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.253
<v Speaker 1>reality show about Kanye West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's Kinda interesting because </v>

415
00:19:45.511 --> 00:19:48.360
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck gets to be Kanye West?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only Kanye West.</v>

416
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.370
<v Speaker 1>So if it was them following Kanye round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would make more sense.</v>

417
00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:55.890
<v Speaker 1>But it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's them just live in their life.</v>

418
00:19:55.891 --> 00:20:00.480
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking genius and a lot of ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they figured out by just kind of</v>

419
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:05.340
<v Speaker 1>like being outrageously extravagant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>opulent with their money and uh,</v>

425
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible and no one wrote it like,</v>

426

<v Speaker 1>over television that nobody cares about.</v>

431
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.430

<v Speaker 1>people live in their life and we can all</v>

432

<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

543
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do it that come from,</v>

544
00:25:31.041 --> 00:25:33.050

<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

545
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came from the first time I did it for</v>

546
00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:39.170
<v Speaker 1>first time I went hunting and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful and I was like,</v>

547
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

548
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.840

<v Speaker 1>Like this is,</v>

549
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:42.920
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is nuts.</v>

00:25:42.921 --> 00:25:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Like what a crazy thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also in a weird,</v>

551
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:47.623
<v Speaker 1>odd way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a helplessness that you feel </v>

552
00:25:51.261 --> 00:25:52.094
<v Speaker 1>when you were in nature that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very almost psychedelic because like </v>

553
00:25:56.001 --> 00:25:59.180
<v Speaker 1>when you go and you not even now like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>

554
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.073
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just talking about go to a place </v>

555
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.190
<v Speaker 1>where there's no cell phone signal at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

556
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Go deep into the woods and you will feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable as fuck.</v>

557
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.210
<v Speaker 1>You feel vulnerable and then you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

558
00:26:11.211 --> 00:26:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's bears out here.</v>

561
00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:21.450
<v Speaker 1>This is where they live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't like a mountain lion in Santa</v>

562
00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Monica on some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

564
00:26:24.141 --> 00:26:27.440
<v Speaker 1>you're going to where they live and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't live.</v>

565
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.430
<v Speaker 1>What's your hunting tech game like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have like night vision goggles?</v>

566
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Like all the coolest stuff so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the bear?</v>

567
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't go out at night.</v>

568
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.550
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you do at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like stay around the camp,</v>

569
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.450
<v Speaker 1>stay around the campfire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this even nights,</v>

570
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.293
<v Speaker 1>weird man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a deer come into our camp once </v>

571
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

572
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.173
<v Speaker 5>in the middle of the night and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>realize it was around people and he </v>

573
00:26:46.711 --> 00:26:48.940
<v Speaker 5>starts stomping on the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 5>hoofing.</v>

574
00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.900
<v Speaker 5>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I barely heard it.</v>

575
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:52.763
<v Speaker 5>The other guys had to remind me of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just animals do come into </v>

576
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.480
<v Speaker 5>people's tents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bears do.</v>

577
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:01.380
<v Speaker 5>That's what gets scary is big bears,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially when they're starving.</v>

578
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.010
<v Speaker 5>Big bears that are starving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll take some fucking chances.</v>

579
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.180
<v Speaker 5>And one of [inaudible] friends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he his first hunt ever,</v>

580
00:27:09.181 --> 00:27:12.870
<v Speaker 5>he was attacked in his tent by a 500 </v>
<v Speaker 5>pound predatory black bear.</v>

581
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.273
<v Speaker 5>His friend shot the bear and hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So shot him in the wrist and then the </v>

582
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 5>bear ran out of that tent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ran into another tent.</v>

583
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:26.421
<v Speaker 5>He's shot at in the other tent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a 500 pound predatory black bear.</v>

584
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:31.590
<v Speaker 5>Just the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just the power that that thing possesses</v>

585
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:36.540
<v Speaker 5>is so beyond any of our comprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you see their bodies,</v>

586
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.630
<v Speaker 5>you see a bear's body and you think of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>500 pound bear.</v>

587
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.020
<v Speaker 5>What this thing would have 500 pound dog</v>
<v Speaker 5>could do to you,</v>

<v Speaker 5>madoff wrestling your grandmother.</v>

593
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:03.630
<v Speaker 5>This bear just throws this fuck dog </v>
<v Speaker 5>around like at eight shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That bail is,</v>

621
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.090
<v Speaker 5>that's like Daniel cormier that bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was his,</v>

622
00:29:05.091 --> 00:29:08.280
<v Speaker 5>his hips man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like instinctively uses his hips.</v>

623
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.170
<v Speaker 5>And now imagine one of those that's 500 </v>
<v Speaker 5>pounds and wants to eat.</v>

624
00:29:13.171 --> 00:29:16.500
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine what the fucking sheer terror of</v>

625
00:29:16.501 --> 00:29:19.710
<v Speaker 5>that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's not a good explanation for why</v>

626
00:29:19.711 --> 00:29:22.560
<v Speaker 5>I like to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I like to do it just cause it's um,</v>

627
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.210
<v Speaker 5>it's nature.</v>

628
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:27.960
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like a fucking vitamin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like a battery.</v>

629
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.310
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

630
00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.000
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an experience that once you tap into it,</v>

631
00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:33.834
<v Speaker 5>just being out there in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes you understand what life is </v>

632
00:29:38.521 --> 00:29:39.354
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes you understand the world </v>

633
00:29:40.171 --> 00:29:41.004
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

634
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:41.973
<v Speaker 5>you understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just the fact that this is just some </v>

635
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:49.651
<v Speaker 5>weird living patch that's on the surface</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a planet mean the all the,</v>

636
00:29:51.041 --> 00:29:51.874
<v Speaker 5>all those things like need to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>exposed to you and like chunks in order </v>

637
00:29:54.581 --> 00:29:59.170
<v Speaker 5>for you to really truly absorb it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you could see like Mount Everest or</v>

638
00:29:59.171 --> 00:30:00.004
<v Speaker 5>some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could see it in a video and you're </v>

639
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:02.351
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

640
00:30:02.351 --> 00:30:03.184
<v Speaker 5>pretty cool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think you're really seeing </v>

641
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:06.370
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's bullshit.</v>

642
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:10.450
<v Speaker 5>I think you're just seeing it all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>flat image,</v>

643
00:30:10.451 --> 00:30:14.740
<v Speaker 5>a lifeless flat image.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you were there and you could take</v>

644
00:30:14.741 --> 00:30:16.060
<v Speaker 5>it all in and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

645
00:30:16.061 --> 00:30:21.061
<v Speaker 5>I understand the perspective and you get</v>
<v Speaker 5>the immense nature of what you're,</v>

646
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:25.450
<v Speaker 5>you're in front of this fucking insanely</v>
<v Speaker 5>huge mountain,</v>

647
00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.270
<v Speaker 5>then I think you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll experience it until you,</v>

648
00:30:28.271 --> 00:30:30.220
<v Speaker 5>until you go there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet you don't feel it.</v>

649
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.370
<v Speaker 5>So I think that's the same with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

650
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.670
<v Speaker 2>it's like seeing a band that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is that awesome.</v>

651
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.350
<v Speaker 2>But then you see them live and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

652
00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:40.240
<v Speaker 2>holy shit man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fucking killed it.</v>

653
00:30:40.241 --> 00:30:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Like Chicago rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

654
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:46.920
<v Speaker 5>no data.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But one of my first nights when we,</v>

655
00:30:52.811 --> 00:30:54.100

<v Speaker 5>we first went camping,</v>

656
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.320
<v Speaker 5>I was almost immediately aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

657
00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:57.154
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a totally different feeling out </v>

659

<v Speaker 5>When you're in the woods,</v>

671
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.840
<v Speaker 5>when you're in the woods,</v>

00:32:20.531 --> 00:32:23.530
<v Speaker 5>But every now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every now and then it's snatches up.</v>

695
00:32:23.531 --> 00:32:24.364
<v Speaker 5>A school child just pulls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pulls it kid out of a fucking one of </v>

696
00:32:29.891 --> 00:32:30.724
<v Speaker 5>those little swing sets and hops over </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fence with it before anybody can do </v>

698
00:32:36.731 --> 00:32:37.564
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

699
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 2>There was this video I saw yesterday </v>
<v Speaker 2>where this girl found</v>

700
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.080
<v Speaker 3>this like baby bunny.</v>

00:32:43.431 --> 00:32:44.264
<v Speaker 3>And she's like petting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She put it down and the second she puts </v>

703
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:47.024
<v Speaker 3>it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this bird just comes out of nowhere and </v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

708
00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.540
<v Speaker 3>we think it's a hawk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what it is.</v>

709
00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Might be a pigeon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know shit about birth people.</v>

710
00:33:02.151 --> 00:33:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan.</v>

711
00:33:03.131 --> 00:33:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Todd Todd was a hawk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

712
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:09.100
<v Speaker 3>so it's a night vision and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take a security cam and as the,</v>

713
00:33:09.101 --> 00:33:09.934
<v Speaker 3>the owl flying in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see its eyes closer and closer and </v>

714
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:15.470
<v Speaker 3>closer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then check this out.</v>

715
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:18.440
<v Speaker 3>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look off in the distance.</v>

716
00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:19.700
<v Speaker 3>See that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the eyes.</v>

717
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:21.050
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch it.</v>

718
00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:22.520
<v Speaker 3>Call Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this dude.</v>

719
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:24.440
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch this.</v>

720
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.720
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

721
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Now what kind of bird is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at it liquid to look at its face.</v>

722
00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:32.000
<v Speaker 3>It kind of looks like a raptor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

723
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Might Be Falcon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

724
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.923
<v Speaker 3>You know what though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might just be because it's night </v>

725
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:39.020
<v Speaker 3>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have that big of a beak.</v>

726
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.190
<v Speaker 3>What do you think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

727
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.230
<v Speaker 3>Maybe some sort of or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

728
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.250
<v Speaker 3>It seems like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

729
00:33:46.251 --> 00:33:47.660
<v Speaker 3>it seems like a raptor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

730
00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:48.494
<v Speaker 3>Like right there that looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>murderous little bird so that he got </v>

731
00:33:51.771 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 3>murdered by another murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that his eyes are for each other.</v>

732
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.880
<v Speaker 3>But watch how he gets him to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he kicks him.</v>

733
00:33:56.881 --> 00:33:58.270
<v Speaker 3>He gets low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>

734
00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:59.223
<v Speaker 3>So crazy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The power that those things have and </v>

735
00:34:01.431 --> 00:34:04.160
<v Speaker 3>their jaws are in their claws rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean?</v>

736
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:05.023
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's a way you could </v>

737
00:34:07.731 --> 00:34:10.190
<v Speaker 3>ever understand what it would be like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a giant hand.</v>

738
00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:11.473
<v Speaker 3>Like it's probably as strong as like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person's hand and it's underneath the </v>

739
00:34:14.481 --> 00:34:18.740
<v Speaker 3>bird and it's got knives on the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and they just slots.</v>

740
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:22.940
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you had some Bass Freddy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kruger clause and that's what you do.</v>

741
00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:25.640
<v Speaker 3>Just grab things and squish him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Punched through him.</v>

742
00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean think about how fucking Bananas </v>
<v Speaker 3>Flying Raptors are.</v>

743
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.620
<v Speaker 3>They're just big enough where they can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill us.</v>

744
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.100
<v Speaker 3>Judge big enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a little too small.</v>

745
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.850
<v Speaker 3>She'll little too small to kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if eagles could kill us,</v>

746
00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.950
<v Speaker 3>like if eagles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the sides of buses,</v>

747
00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:49.820
<v Speaker 3>we'd be fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ville would've never invented the wheel.</v>

748
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.980
<v Speaker 3>They would just jacked us and </v>
<v Speaker 3>extinction.</v>

749
00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.340
<v Speaker 3>We'd be hiding in little holes in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking hills,</v>

750
00:34:56.390 --> 00:35:00.920
<v Speaker 3>would try to find anti eagle technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be our number one concern.</v>

751
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Kill the eagles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do.</v>

752
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:06.590
<v Speaker 3>That's a dragon is a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows,</v>

753
00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:08.870
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe there were bigger raptors and they</v>

754
00:35:08.871 --> 00:35:10.580
<v Speaker 3>killed him off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

755
00:35:10.581 --> 00:35:13.220
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was one from New Zealand,</v>

756
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:15.440
<v Speaker 3>there was that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about this.</v>

757
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.453
<v Speaker 3>I feel like fairly recently I read </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about this and I might have </v>

758
00:35:18.111 --> 00:35:19.670
<v Speaker 3>brought it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a rat.</v>

759
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah we did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an eagle in New Zealand,</v>

760
00:35:22.461 --> 00:35:24.860
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called the Haas Eagle or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

761
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:25.993
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was fucking enormous and people </v>

762
00:35:28.731 --> 00:35:30.950
<v Speaker 3>killed it off and it lived in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zealand.</v>

763
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.670
<v Speaker 3>I think it had something ridiculous like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 14 foot wingspan.</v>

764
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:35.930
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

765
00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 3>they do think that it's entirely</v>

766
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.290
<v Speaker 1>possible that think this thing killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

767
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.020
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zealand people killed it off.</v>

768
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Cause it was like in the 14 hundreds or </v>
<v Speaker 1>some shit.</v>

769
00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.610
<v Speaker 1>They killed it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find anything on it?</v>

770
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.063
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they think that there's a video of a </v>

771
00:35:50.691 --> 00:35:52.860
<v Speaker 6>Golden Eagle snatching a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

772
00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.253
<v Speaker 6>That's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But they were thinking it was one of </v>

773
00:35:55.281 --> 00:35:58.220
<v Speaker 6>those eagles black what people were and </v>
<v Speaker 6>weren't sure if it was fake or not.</v>

774
00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when people weren't sure it was fake,</v>

775
00:36:00.531 --> 00:36:03.110
<v Speaker 1>they thought maybe it was like a few of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things still left in the wild.</v>

776
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:05.780
<v Speaker 1>But it's in New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

777
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:09.260
<v Speaker 1>That was that video from New Zealand to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what this is like a debunking</v>

778
00:36:09.261 --> 00:36:09.980
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

779
00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.930
<v Speaker 1>geographic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it talks about those eagles.</v>

780
00:36:11.931 --> 00:36:14.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to find some stats on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of debunking,</v>

781
00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.630
<v Speaker 1>did you hear all the crazy shit that's </v>

<v Speaker 1>this democratic lean towards the truth,</v>

805
00:37:22.311 --> 00:37:25.220
<v Speaker 1>like editorializing the truth on some of</v>

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:36.860
<v Speaker 1>who's in charge and then you find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

810
00:37:36.861 --> 00:37:40.490
<v Speaker 1>this is the people in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are just freaks balling out</v>

811
00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:42.080
<v Speaker 1>of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marian hookers.</v>

812
00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.190
<v Speaker 6>Did they find this out?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The facebook fake news thing happened.</v>

813
00:37:46.191 --> 00:37:46.950
<v Speaker 6>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

814
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:47.783
<v Speaker 1>because those people were part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>team that was supposed to clean up the </v>

815
00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:51.534
<v Speaker 1>fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a new thing that was </v>

816
00:37:54.031 --> 00:37:54.864
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be out today as a new tool </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they think is going to be able to </v>

817
00:37:58.171 --> 00:37:59.490
<v Speaker 1>figure out fake news.</v>

818
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.920
<v Speaker 6>We're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's awful.</v>

819
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:05.340
<v Speaker 6>We're Fox folks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People could just make shit up.</v>

820
00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.430
<v Speaker 6>Did you see that crazy times?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

821
00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.830
<v Speaker 6>adobe released photoshop for sound.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if he saw this video and or</v>

822
00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.820
<v Speaker 6>shopping for sound,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what it can do is it can take,</v>

823
00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:16.410
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can just say one sentence,</v>

824
00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:18.120
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love Tacos.</v>

825
00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.111
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we showed that.</v>

826
00:38:19.111 --> 00:38:19.944
<v Speaker 6>We talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Didn't have a good clip to find it </v>

827
00:38:21.781 --> 00:38:23.100
<v Speaker 6>because it didn't come up at the right </v>
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>

828
00:38:23.101 --> 00:38:23.600
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

829
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.200
<v Speaker 6>we had a pretty decent clip.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was one,</v>

830
00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.840
<v Speaker 6>we showed a sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was pieced together from other stuff.</v>

831
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:28.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

832
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.753
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that's been available </v>
<v Speaker 6>before they've announced this to the </v>

833
00:38:31.891 --> 00:38:34.410
<v Speaker 6>public on this big giant announcement </v>
<v Speaker 6>party?</v>

834
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:35.530
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

835
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 6>I would</v>

836
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.650
<v Speaker 5>imagine that that's the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>technology that you would take.</v>

837
00:38:38.651 --> 00:38:41.980
<v Speaker 5>It would take a long time to work on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But are you saying like is it being used</v>

838
00:38:41.981 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 5>by nefarious sources?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't sit in a farrier,</v>

839
00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.073
<v Speaker 5>but I mean it's not there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I think about all that </v>

840
00:38:46.751 --> 00:38:47.281
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

841
00:38:47.281 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that kind of thinking.</v>

842
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:53.530
<v Speaker 5>I think that technology is improving so </v>
<v Speaker 5>quickly and I don't,</v>

843
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:54.364
<v Speaker 5>I don't necessarily think that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are working for the u s </v>

844
00:38:57.161 --> 00:38:57.994
<v Speaker 5>government are the ones that are 100% in</v>
<v Speaker 5>control of the information to get that </v>

845
00:39:01.481 --> 00:39:02.314
<v Speaker 5>gets released.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like these people that are constantly </v>

846
00:39:04.001 --> 00:39:07.240
<v Speaker 5>innovating and creating all these new </v>
<v Speaker 5>products and these new technologies,</v>

847
00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.160
<v Speaker 5>they're not all working for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>government.</v>

848
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:10.030
<v Speaker 5>They're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

849
00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:13.330
<v Speaker 5>So this idea that like the government </v>
<v Speaker 5>has some stuff way before we do.</v>

850
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.060
<v Speaker 5>Probably not today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

851
00:39:16.061 --> 00:39:16.894
<v Speaker 5>Today I think it's a fucking river </v>
<v Speaker 5>filled with salmon that are covered in </v>

852
00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 5>baby oil and you can't grab one of these</v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfuckers in there.</v>

853
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.570
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're flying by you.</v>

854
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:28.450
<v Speaker 5>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think shit's changing so quick,</v>

855
00:39:28.451 --> 00:39:29.284
<v Speaker 5>so fast that that's why all these leaks </v>
<v Speaker 5>and all these different things that </v>

856
00:39:32.201 --> 00:39:37.120
<v Speaker 5>pertain to elections and changing </v>
<v Speaker 5>people's ideas are happening so quickly.</v>

857
00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.513
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't even know if we understand </v>
<v Speaker 5>how nutty this is while it's happening </v>

858
00:39:41.981 --> 00:39:43.970
<v Speaker 5>to us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what that is.</v>

859
00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.830
<v Speaker 5>That's what the fake the new tool to </v>
<v Speaker 5>visualize how fake news is spread.</v>

860
00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.410
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tool to visualize how it's spread.</v>

861
00:39:50.411 --> 00:39:52.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's spread to Republicans.</v>

862
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:52.650
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

863
00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:54.580
<v Speaker 5>It's like South Park.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They retweet stuff.</v>

864
00:39:54.581 --> 00:39:57.400
<v Speaker 5>They don't vet the soda from Democrats </v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

865
00:39:57.401 --> 00:40:00.460
<v Speaker 5>Everybody does it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like there was a,</v>

866
00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:01.294
<v Speaker 5>there was an article recently that said </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people who are conservative are </v>

867
00:40:03.641 --> 00:40:05.680
<v Speaker 5>much more likely to be fooled by fake </v>
<v Speaker 5>news,</v>

868
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:10.090
<v Speaker 5>but it was probably written by liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so who the fuck knows?</v>

869
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:11.343
<v Speaker 5>Is it weird to you that Alex Jones seems</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he's blown the fuck up in the last </v>

870
00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:15.610
<v Speaker 5>couple of years?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not weird.</v>

871
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:20.560
<v Speaker 5>Like my mom knows who Alex Jones is now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

872
00:40:20.561 --> 00:40:21.394
<v Speaker 5>People think that I'm somehow ducking </v>
<v Speaker 5>him that I don't want to have him on my </v>

873
00:40:23.681 --> 00:40:24.514
<v Speaker 5>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would love to have Alex on my </v>

874
00:40:25.241 --> 00:40:26.440
<v Speaker 5>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People don't know.</v>

875
00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:28.960
<v Speaker 5>Like I have a very good relationship </v>
<v Speaker 5>with Alex Jones.</v>

876
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:30.790
<v Speaker 5>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's my friend.</v>

877
00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:33.550
<v Speaker 5>I hug him every time I see him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm happy to see him.</v>

878
00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:38.200
<v Speaker 5>I liked that guy a lot and he's crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's not all crazy,</v>

879
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:40.570
<v Speaker 5>but he's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he's a good guy telling you.</v>

880
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.970
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alex Jones is a great fucking guy.</v>

881
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.830
<v Speaker 5>He stresses though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

882
00:40:44.831 --> 00:40:46.210
<v Speaker 5>he's freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He freaks.</v>

883
00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:49.000
<v Speaker 5>You know he needs a guy like me right </v>
<v Speaker 5>next to him all the time.</v>

884
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:51.640
<v Speaker 5>That's what it needs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Alex Jones needs someone to go,</v>

885
00:40:51.641 --> 00:40:52.474
<v Speaker 5>Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>

886
00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.093
<v Speaker 5>Are you sure that the elites are going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to kill everybody off so they can live </v>

887
00:40:55.781 --> 00:40:57.070
<v Speaker 5>forever?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you fucking sure?</v>

888
00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:58.690
<v Speaker 5>Because if you not sure he got to stop </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying it.</v>

889
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.370
<v Speaker 5>You know he needs someone that's right </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

890
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:07.460
<v Speaker 5>Like I really think the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 5>like conspiracy theories is they feel so</v>

891
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.110
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They feel great.</v>

892
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.660
<v Speaker 5>Like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think you really have footage of the</v>

893
00:41:12.661 --> 00:41:14.250
<v Speaker 5>loch ness monster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

894
00:41:14.251 --> 00:41:15.084
<v Speaker 5>You feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter if nobody wants to </v>

895
00:41:17.161 --> 00:41:20.430
<v Speaker 5>blow me when I get to work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to rock the world.</v>

896
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:21.623
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people who a are constantly </v>

897
00:41:24.301 --> 00:41:27.870
<v Speaker 5>searching for conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everywhere you go like man,</v>

898
00:41:27.871 --> 00:41:31.290
<v Speaker 5>like talk about being like sucked into </v>
<v Speaker 5>the plot.</v>

899
00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 5>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all you're on is</v>

900
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.933
<v Speaker 1>people who are lying in conspiring to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make money or kill half the population </v>

901
00:41:39.111 --> 00:41:40.370
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the fuck it is they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

902
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.670
<v Speaker 1>What are you sure this is it an </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive thought pattern.</v>

903
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When these God conspiracies,</v>

904
00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:50.053
<v Speaker 1>they're attractive thought pro patterns </v>
<v Speaker 1>that mimic like real problem solving </v>

905
00:41:55.641 --> 00:41:56.474
<v Speaker 1>that could benefit you in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of like actually paying </v>

906
00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:01.574
<v Speaker 1>attention to your real life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get sucked into this idea of you </v>

907
00:42:04.761 --> 00:42:08.450
<v Speaker 1>being the one who's going to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>who killed JFK and you ride that fucking</v>

908
00:42:08.451 --> 00:42:09.284
<v Speaker 1>thing 12 hours a day all day long and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the and then after a while like are you </v>

909
00:42:13.401 --> 00:42:14.234
<v Speaker 1>a researcher or you just a dude has gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy paying attention to the JFK </v>

910
00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:19.580
<v Speaker 1>assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like which,</v>

911
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:23.240
<v Speaker 1>which one are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be careful because this,</v>

912
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:28.400
<v Speaker 1>this feeling that you get when you chase</v>
<v Speaker 1>down secrets and conspiracies,</v>

913
00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.620
<v Speaker 1>the government deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Illuminati,</v>

914
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:32.510
<v Speaker 1>we're going to expose this man.</v>

915
00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:33.410
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

916
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:34.243
<v Speaker 1>it gives extra and exaggerated meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>to your time and anything that gives </v>

917
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.633
<v Speaker 1>extra and exaggerated meaning to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>time should be closely considered as to </v>

918
00:42:44.331 --> 00:42:45.164
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if something gives you extra and </v>

919
00:42:48.591 --> 00:42:52.280
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go well is this love?</v>

920
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.980

<v Speaker 1>now I'm addicted to like what is it any,</v>

<v Speaker 1>how much of this is good and how much of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is chem trails?</v>

923
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:04.663
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of this is just you just </v>

924
00:43:06.261 --> 00:43:10.280
<v Speaker 1>spending a lot of time on something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out to be total nonsense.</v>

925
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.210
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like micro conspiracies way better.</v>

926
00:43:14.211 --> 00:43:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Like little things like you know like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

927
00:43:16.001 --> 00:43:18.440
<v Speaker 1>like if you could add a value meal at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's,</v>

928
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:19.753
<v Speaker 1>it's a more expensive than if you buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>all three things separately and stuff </v>

929
00:43:22.551 --> 00:43:23.384
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

930
00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true too.</v>

931
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.053
<v Speaker 1>If you get a value meal at Mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can add more expensive than if you </v>

932
00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.030
<v Speaker 1>put all the things together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

933
00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those kinds of conspiracies you just</v>

934
00:43:35.361 --> 00:43:37.570
<v Speaker 1>broke that broke that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

935
00:43:37.571 --> 00:43:38.404
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does kind of conspiracies to are to me </v>

936
00:43:40.461 --> 00:43:43.520
<v Speaker 1>are way funding it because you can prove</v>
<v Speaker 1>it easier.</v>

937
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a conspiracy.</v>

938
00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Conspiracy's like doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

939
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Why are they doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they know about it?</v>

940
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.293
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there must be some incentive to get </v>

941
00:43:53.661 --> 00:43:57.320
<v Speaker 1>people when you get it as a package,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>

942
00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.850
<v Speaker 1>what I would say is if there's a meal </v>
<v Speaker 1>package that's less money,</v>

943
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:03.163
<v Speaker 1>it might still be more money than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have spent if they didn't go for </v>

944
00:44:06.351 --> 00:44:09.710
<v Speaker 1>the meal package.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they might only get one thing.</v>

945
00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.590
<v Speaker 1>They might only get a burger and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>only get a drink.</v>

946
00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:15.170
<v Speaker 1>But if you offer some things in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>package of times,</v>

947
00:44:15.171 --> 00:44:17.120
<v Speaker 1>people are going to gravitate towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>that packet.</v>

948
00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:19.010
<v Speaker 1>You right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that it's a way to upsell.</v>

949
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

950
00:44:19.911 --> 00:44:22.880
<v Speaker 1>even though it might cost less to buy it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a package,</v>

951
00:44:22.881 --> 00:44:23.714
<v Speaker 1>they still might be spending more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would a split if they didn't buy </v>

952
00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:28.580
<v Speaker 1>the package because they might've just </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a cheeseburger by itself.</v>

953
00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's totally legit.</v>

954
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's 41 600</v>

955
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.610
<v Speaker 7>marketing x was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And they add the 41 sentence that's like</v>

956
00:44:35.611 --> 00:44:39.360
<v Speaker 7>buying the extended warranty.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think you need that.</v>

957
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:43.770
<v Speaker 7>Mcdonald's sued because extra value </v>
<v Speaker 7>meals,</v>

958
00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:47.190
<v Speaker 7>41 cents more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

959
00:44:47.191 --> 00:44:50.040
<v Speaker 7>I wonder how much I'm going to spend on </v>
<v Speaker 7>legal fees and that conundrum.</v>

960
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:52.860
<v Speaker 7>How could you get sued for that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You didn't mean unless you said,</v>

961
00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:56.280
<v Speaker 7>I mean the fucking price is on the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You dumb cunt.</v>

962
00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:58.900
<v Speaker 7>Cause it's called extra value meal </v>
<v Speaker 7>meaning values.</v>

963
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:01.010
<v Speaker 7>It's like kind of false advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A little,</v>

964
00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.220
<v Speaker 7>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is it?</v>

965
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.950
<v Speaker 7>I guess frog,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's just a lawsuit.</v>

966
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:09.680
<v Speaker 5>The lawsuit filled this month was a file</v>
<v Speaker 5>this month was about principle,</v>

967
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:10.603
<v Speaker 5>not 41 cents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He seeks a class action status for </v>

968
00:45:13.281 --> 00:45:14.114
<v Speaker 5>consumer fraud and deceptive practices.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lawsuit Against Mcdonald's operator </v>

969
00:45:17.211 --> 00:45:18.850
<v Speaker 5>Charisse management.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

970
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:24.620
<v Speaker 7>I love that Mcdonald's exists,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it should be illegal.</v>

971
00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:26.750
<v Speaker 7>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's fucking barely food,</v>

972
00:45:26.751 --> 00:45:27.800
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had it the other day.</v>

973
00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.060
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's fucking great.</v>

974
00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.090
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know two men.</v>

975
00:45:32.091 --> 00:45:34.670
<v Speaker 7>Every now and then I'll stop on the way </v>
<v Speaker 7>home and get a filet of fish.</v>

976
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:35.583
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the fries.</v>

977
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.490
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't fuck with fries.</v>

978
00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:40.470
<v Speaker 5>Not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A little bit here and there,</v>

979
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:45.270
<v Speaker 5>but they don't get me those filet a fish</v>
<v Speaker 5>has get me the fish fresh.</v>

980
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.580
<v Speaker 5>You have to have a fresh one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I made the mistake before eight,</v>

981
00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:52.560
<v Speaker 5>the last one watching a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>documentary on how they prepare those,</v>

982
00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:57.420
<v Speaker 5>those fish cakes that you buy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that fucking Jesus Christ.</v>

983
00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.850
<v Speaker 5>It's the other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They treat all the fish with chemicals.</v>

984
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:00.893
<v Speaker 5>They remove all the smell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why when you eat like filet of </v>

985
00:46:03.441 --> 00:46:05.490
<v Speaker 5>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they never fucking smell.</v>

986
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.790
<v Speaker 5>They don't smell right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You ever have dude,</v>

987
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:12.870
<v Speaker 5>I hate you ever catch a fish and cook it</v>
<v Speaker 5>like later in the day.</v>

988
00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:15.570
<v Speaker 5>But if you wait too long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it starts to stink.</v>

989
00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.550
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially if it's in the sun.</v>

990
00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:18.563
<v Speaker 5>Like you gotta be careful with fish </v>
<v Speaker 5>fishes awake way different than any </v>

991
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:21.474
<v Speaker 5>other like food in that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The closest proximity you have to that </v>

992
00:46:25.561 --> 00:46:28.500
<v Speaker 5>thing being caught and then killed and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then you eat it.</v>

993
00:46:28.501 --> 00:46:32.420
<v Speaker 5>The closer those are together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes us a giant impact on the way it</v>

994
00:46:32.421 --> 00:46:33.330
<v Speaker 5>felt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It tastes.</v>

995
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:34.853
<v Speaker 5>So they figured out some weird way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>treat all this stuff that was watching </v>

996
00:46:38.341 --> 00:46:42.060
<v Speaker 5>them do it there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They kill so many fish do.</v>

997
00:46:42.061 --> 00:46:42.894
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you watch like one of them filet a </v>

998
00:46:44.951 --> 00:46:48.690
<v Speaker 5>fish factory places and you see the fish</v>
<v Speaker 5>is being poured in,</v>

999
00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.420
<v Speaker 5>you just want to go stop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop,</v>

1000
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:52.680
<v Speaker 5>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop.</v>

1001
00:46:52.681 --> 00:46:53.280
<v Speaker 5>It</v>

1002
00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.720
<v Speaker 7>zig a mass murder.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can't take any more fish.</v>

1003
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:58.330
<v Speaker 7>There's not going to be any more fish.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God.</v>

1004
00:46:58.331 --> 00:47:00.160
<v Speaker 7>What are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's hilarious dude.</v>

1005
00:47:00.161 --> 00:47:01.930
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They just have trucks.</v>

1006
00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:02.793
<v Speaker 7>They're backing it up.</v>

1007
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:07.930
<v Speaker 5>Dumping gigantic piles of fish in there.</v>

1008
00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.530
<v Speaker 7>Well think about chickens man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You,</v>

1009
00:47:09.531 --> 00:47:12.460
<v Speaker 7>you got a Boston market.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've just got a half a chicken,</v>

1010
00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:13.683
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that.</v>

1011
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.100
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that's a half of life.</v>

1012
00:47:15.101 --> 00:47:18.310
<v Speaker 7>I just ate and it was alive probably </v>
<v Speaker 7>once a month ago.</v>

1013
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.190
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's so much chicken.</v>

1014
00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.053
<v Speaker 7>So much chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't make the people were there </v>

1015
00:47:23.111 --> 00:47:26.260
<v Speaker 7>before you relation theory thing makes </v>
<v Speaker 7>more sense.</v>

1016
00:47:26.261 --> 00:47:28.210
<v Speaker 7>Cause there's no way there was that much</v>
<v Speaker 7>chicken,</v>

1017
00:47:28.211 --> 00:47:29.420
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's,</v>

1018
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 7>here's what's</v>

1019
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.360
<v Speaker 5>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where we,</v>

1020
00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:35.560
<v Speaker 5>we have decided that we operate better </v>
<v Speaker 5>and calmer and gigantic groups.</v>

1021
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.110
<v Speaker 5>And even though like there's more </v>
<v Speaker 5>stress,</v>

1022
00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:40.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean by better and calmer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like as a civilization,</v>

1023
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.800
<v Speaker 5>like there's more bp punk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>honk fuck you,</v>

1024
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:45.663
<v Speaker 5>maybe more murder or maybe more crime </v>
<v Speaker 5>because everybody's jammed on top of </v>

1025
00:47:48.551 --> 00:47:49.384
<v Speaker 5>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're going to have a bunch of like </v>

1026
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:54.751
<v Speaker 5>errant behavior no matter what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the only way we can do that as if we</v>

1027
00:47:55.211 --> 00:47:58.990
<v Speaker 5>are not involved at all in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>production of food.</v>

1028
00:47:59.140 --> 00:47:59.973
<v Speaker 5>So the production of food is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>taken away from people because we all </v>

1029
00:48:02.051 --> 00:48:03.970
<v Speaker 5>together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we lived in a neighborhood,</v>

1030
00:48:03.971 --> 00:48:07.240
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Say if I lived near you and you know,</v>

1031
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:08.103
<v Speaker 5>Joey's up the street and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>burt's up the street and we all decide </v>

1032
00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:11.350
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a,</v>

1033
00:48:11.351 --> 00:48:12.430
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1034
00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.040
<v Speaker 5>like a co op and we're going to grow our</v>
<v Speaker 5>own food.</v>

1035
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:16.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people have done that before.</v>

1036
00:48:16.451 --> 00:48:18.280
<v Speaker 5>Hippies do that shit all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They love to do it.</v>

1037
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:19.623
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we had them all stacked on top of </v>

1038
00:48:21.041 --> 00:48:22.600
<v Speaker 5>each other and fucked up like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd be like,</v>

1039
00:48:22.601 --> 00:48:23.620
<v Speaker 5>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are we doing?</v>

1040
00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:26.470
<v Speaker 5>Like this is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like these chickens aren't even,</v>

1041
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.000
<v Speaker 5>they're not even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're never a lot.</v>

1042
00:48:28.001 --> 00:48:30.880
<v Speaker 5>They just were just treating them like </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit until we kill him.</v>

1043
00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:32.800
<v Speaker 5>Like that seems kind of fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1044
00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.630
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you we'd all agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't be like,</v>

1045
00:48:34.631 --> 00:48:35.890
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

1046
00:48:35.891 --> 00:48:37.150
<v Speaker 5>how do we do this better?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1047
00:48:37.151 --> 00:48:39.970
<v Speaker 5>what do we need more space?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need to treat it more humanely.</v>

1048
00:48:39.971 --> 00:48:40.804
<v Speaker 5>They needed an omnivorous diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They need to be able to free range and </v>

1049
00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:46.900
<v Speaker 5>roam around and be like a real chicken </v>
<v Speaker 5>until the end comes.</v>

1050
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:50.140
<v Speaker 5>So it's not like a life of torture and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then death.</v>

1051
00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:51.003
<v Speaker 5>It's just life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you'll eliminate by using your </v>

1052
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:56.080
<v Speaker 5>intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you eliminate that torture.</v>

1053
00:48:56.081 --> 00:48:57.850
<v Speaker 5>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't encounter it,</v>

1054
00:48:57.851 --> 00:48:59.530
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

<v Speaker 5>They grew the cow that killed the cow.</v>

1071
00:49:36.661 --> 00:49:38.310
<v Speaker 5>They chopped it up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they grounded up,</v>

1072
00:49:38.311 --> 00:49:39.810
<v Speaker 5>they cooked it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they put it on a bun,</v>

1073
00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:40.793
<v Speaker 5>they wrapped that Bun and paper that </v>
<v Speaker 5>gave it to you and it took a couple of </v>

1074
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:44.800
<v Speaker 5>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 5>mouth and three minutes.</v>

1079
00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:57.083
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is the only way that can happen is if </v>

1080
00:49:59.101 --> 00:50:02.190
<v Speaker 5>you're not involved in the process is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the only way it can happen.</v>

1081
00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.330
<v Speaker 5>Like we kind of kill a lot of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>cows to do that.</v>

1082
00:50:06.331 --> 00:50:07.164
<v Speaker 5>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can't all be like everybody who eats </v>

1083
00:50:08.701 --> 00:50:11.850
<v Speaker 5>cow be out there killing cows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We wouldn't get shit done.</v>

1084
00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:12.803
<v Speaker 5>There would be no insurance companies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There would be no video games that ever </v>

1085
00:50:15.511 --> 00:50:17.070
<v Speaker 5>get developed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We wouldn't have time.</v>

1086
00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:20.250
<v Speaker 5>We'd be out there fucking mowing fields </v>
<v Speaker 5>and shit.</v>

1087
00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:21.323
<v Speaker 5>We'd be out there shooting cows in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>head and hanging them up by their </v>

1088
00:50:23.371 --> 00:50:23.950
<v Speaker 5>ankles,</v>

1089
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:26.650
<v Speaker 2>fake foods on the way very soon I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1090
00:50:26.651 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 2>especially since recently they've</v>

1091
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:31.370
<v Speaker 7>had a lot of good breakthroughs from </v>
<v Speaker 7>like growing food,</v>

1092
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:31.911
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:50:31.911 --> 00:50:34.040
<v Speaker 7>That's 100% gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And once that happens,</v>

1094
00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:34.874
<v Speaker 7>it's going to be interesting to see if </v>
<v Speaker 7>they just like have like one year of </v>

1095
00:50:36.891 --> 00:50:37.724
<v Speaker 7>like last year to have real counts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>slaughter them all and just keep like </v>

1096
00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.310
<v Speaker 7>one cow per county or something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're doing this style.</v>

1097
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:44.803
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know how Peter Kills a lot of cats </v>

1098
00:50:45.621 --> 00:50:47.960

<v Speaker 7>I tell people that and they go,</v>

1099

<v Speaker 7>what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1100
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:49.873
<v Speaker 7>Peta euthanizes a lot of cats and dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Unfortunately they say they don't have </v>

1101
00:50:53.391 --> 00:50:57.470
<v Speaker 7>the money to keep them alive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just hi irony in a,</v>

1102
00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:00.920
<v Speaker 7>in a way that the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that the ethical treatment of animals</v>

1103
00:51:00.921 --> 00:51:02.000
<v Speaker 7>that kill him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1104
00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:03.780
<v Speaker 7>like there's no way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like they're,</v>

1105
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.950
<v Speaker 7>they have no kill animal shelters in la </v>
<v Speaker 7>where they don't kill the animals,</v>

1106
00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:08.963
<v Speaker 5>take them in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they try to find them a home like </v>

1107
00:51:09.811 --> 00:51:11.250
<v Speaker 5>squeaky member.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My Docs Wiki,</v>

1108
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.353
<v Speaker 5>she was in there for like six months or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something crazy and callen founder and </v>

1109
00:51:16.861 --> 00:51:20.040
<v Speaker 5>then I adopted her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

1110
00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.050
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know ma'am.</v>

1111
00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:24.203
<v Speaker 5>I think our relationship to life itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going back to what you were asking me </v>

1112
00:51:26.701 --> 00:51:27.534
<v Speaker 5>about the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our relationship to life itself is very </v>

1113
00:51:30.301 --> 00:51:32.070
<v Speaker 5>disjointed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

1114
00:51:32.071 --> 00:51:32.904
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were raised by people who were </v>

1115
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:36.833
<v Speaker 5>brainwashed by the 1960s [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 5>1970s media and movies and TV shows and </v>

1116
00:51:42.001 --> 00:51:43.260
<v Speaker 5>whatever they learned from their </v>
<v Speaker 5>parents.</v>

1117
00:51:43.261 --> 00:51:44.580
<v Speaker 5>You got to think of who their parents </v>
<v Speaker 5>were.</v>

1118
00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.980
<v Speaker 5>Their parents were fucking immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

1119
00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:48.443
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my grandparents came straight from the </v>

1120
00:51:50.131 --> 00:51:51.330
<v Speaker 5>boat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of them,</v>

1121
00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:52.650
<v Speaker 5>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My,</v>

1122
00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:54.480
<v Speaker 5>my mom's side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of them.</v>

1123
00:51:54.481 --> 00:51:57.030
<v Speaker 5>On my father's side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my father's side,</v>

1124
00:51:57.031 --> 00:52:00.030
<v Speaker 5>half from Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the grandfather was from Ireland,</v>

1125
00:52:00.031 --> 00:52:01.710
<v Speaker 5>grandmother was from Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody else,</v>

1126
00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:05.070
<v Speaker 5>Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they all came over here on a boat.</v>

1127
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:09.120
<v Speaker 5>They all just took a fucking Jan's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know shit dude.</v>

1128
00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.820
<v Speaker 5>And there's no way they would have </v>
<v Speaker 5>prepared you for the Internet.</v>

1129
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:13.223
<v Speaker 5>They just didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like with every passing </v>

1130
00:52:15.271 --> 00:52:19.170
<v Speaker 5>generation will become more and more </v>
<v Speaker 5>aware of how weird this thing is,</v>

1131
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.273
<v Speaker 5>which is why he can't have a movie with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Robert Deniro was sucking on Juliette </v>

1132
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:24.510

1134
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:28.230
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

1135
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:29.393
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Back then you could do it because they </v>

1136
00:52:30.301 --> 00:52:33.060
<v Speaker 5>didn't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean literally didn't know any better.</v>

1137
00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.193
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when people talk about like Roman </v>

1138
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:36.211
<v Speaker 5>Polanski,</v>

<v Speaker 5>he drugged her and all that said </v>

1141
00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:44.130

<v Speaker 5>there's never an excuse for that.</v>

1142
00:52:44.131 --> 00:52:44.964
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:27.810
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men always hit women.</v>

1159
00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.180
<v Speaker 1>The fucking hit them all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my favorite interviews </v>

00:53:33.721 --> 00:53:35.610
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We played that recent.</v>

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:38.943
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't heard it folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should go listen to it on youtube </v>

1166
00:53:41.731 --> 00:53:44.520
<v Speaker 1>cause it's Barbara Walters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She thinks she has him.</v>

1167
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:45.833
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the interesting things about it </v>

1168
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:48.233
<v Speaker 1>is that she brings up that he has said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes it's okay to hit a woman </v>

1169
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:53.970
<v Speaker 1>and she sticks it to him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1170
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.070
<v Speaker 1>get out of this one.</v>

1171
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:56.933
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe sometimes it's good to hit </v>

1172
00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:00.954
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just push it and push it and they </v>

1173
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:04.584
<v Speaker 1>don't know when to let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then some time shafter use the back </v>

1174
00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:09.840
<v Speaker 1>of your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did.</v>

1175
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And you can see the har it Barbara </v>
<v Speaker 1>Walters phase,</v>

1176
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:20.520
<v Speaker 1>last tango in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brando was 48 and she was 19 wow.</v>

1177
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:25.110
<v Speaker 1>And so they did that to her without her </v>
<v Speaker 1>having any idea that she was going to do</v>

1178
00:54:25.111 --> 00:54:26.550
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that was the scene.</v>

1179
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:28.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1180
00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have her consent.</v>

1181
00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.133
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that that he didn't </v>

1182
00:54:36.811 --> 00:54:39.720
<v Speaker 1>regret filming the scene without </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schneider's consent,</v>

1183
00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:42.450
<v Speaker 1>but admitted to feeling guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1184
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>48 Brando.</v>

1185
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:48.790

<v Speaker 1>Brenda was a free car.</v>

1186
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.090
<v Speaker 1>What a strange guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Company got giant.</v>

1187
00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:52.493
<v Speaker 1>He just got enormous and apparently that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was why they filmed them in apocalypse </v>

1188
00:54:55.891 --> 00:54:57.750
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the oldest film them in the dark.</v>

1189
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.040
<v Speaker 1>So big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1190
00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.450
<v Speaker 1>just crazy fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1191
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:07.950
<v Speaker 1>when you think about trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what life is about,</v>

1192
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.680
<v Speaker 1>like now as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1193
00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.520
<v Speaker 1>we're the poor fools that will be looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon by our grandchildren.</v>

1194
00:55:14.521 --> 00:55:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Like fools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>

1195
00:55:16.291 --> 00:55:19.440
<v Speaker 1>when our grandchildren are our age and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they talk about,</v>

1196
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:20.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how fucking goofy our world was that we </v>

1197
00:55:23.851 --> 00:55:26.280
<v Speaker 1>live in now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No wonder why we elected trump.</v>

1198
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.353
<v Speaker 1>No wonder why we still have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous electoral college system and </v>

1199
00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:33.870
<v Speaker 1>we still have representative democracy.</v>

1200
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:34.703
<v Speaker 1>You still can't vote online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wonder why pot is still illegal in </v>

1201
00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:41.820
<v Speaker 1>most of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No wonder why private prisons are filled</v>

1202
00:55:41.821 --> 00:55:46.050
<v Speaker 1>with people in jail for ridiculous shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are profiting off it.</v>

1203
00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:48.960
<v Speaker 1>No wonder why they didn't get it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were so close.</v>

1204
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:50.063
<v Speaker 1>We're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking back on like the people </v>

1205
00:55:51.451 --> 00:55:54.840
<v Speaker 1>that own slaves and were going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they do that?</v>

1206
00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:55.674
<v Speaker 1>How could that ever happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could the United States have been </v>

1207
00:55:57.841 --> 00:55:58.674
<v Speaker 1>founded by slave labor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could these people have brought </v>

1208
00:56:00.751 --> 00:56:01.584
<v Speaker 1>these people from Africa?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could they have beaten them and </v>

1209
00:56:03.331 --> 00:56:06.240
<v Speaker 1>tortured them and cut their feet off if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

1210
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:08.850
<v Speaker 1>if they tried to flee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they did.</v>

1211
00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:10.573
<v Speaker 1>And this is going to be the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people say of us when they look back on </v>

1212
00:56:13.321 --> 00:56:14.940
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got to go,</v>

1213
00:56:14.941 --> 00:56:15.774
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

1214
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:18.090
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to kill animals to get meat.</v>

1215
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.983
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even get meat from the meat </v>

1216
00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.740
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no meat science.</v>

1217
00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have a meat science company.</v>

1218
00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:26.200
<v Speaker 5>They just got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had a shoot.</v>

1219
00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:28.000
<v Speaker 5>Things with sticks.</v>

1220
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:31.730
<v Speaker 2>They haven't figured out Asians were </v>
<v Speaker 2>robots yet.</v>

1221
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:35.570
<v Speaker 2>I think there are aliens that microphone</v>
<v Speaker 2>is on.</v>

1222
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:36.940
<v Speaker 2>My girlfriend doesn't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1223
00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:38.173
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you pound on the knee and it </v>

1224
00:56:39.590 --> 00:56:40.423
<v Speaker 2>reflects reflex like three people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried it on her knees when she's </v>

1225
00:56:43.101 --> 00:56:44.240
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's numb.</v>

1226
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:51.200
<v Speaker 2>But three people have tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my thought was</v>

1227
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:55.460
<v Speaker 5>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like if you had to pick one,</v>

1228
00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.753
<v Speaker 5>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one ethnicity that excels in like </v>

1229
00:56:59.601 --> 00:57:02.720
<v Speaker 5>science and mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always go with Asian.</v>

1230
00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:03.733
<v Speaker 5>I just always feel like they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that is that racist in a positive </v>

1231
00:57:06.081 --> 00:57:07.100
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if it is,</v>

1232
00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm positively racist towards agents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think they have,</v>

1233
00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:14.270
<v Speaker 5>there's a great deal of them that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>really good at science and mathematics</v>

1234
00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:16.030
<v Speaker 2>and if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're aliens,</v>

1235
00:57:16.031 --> 00:57:18.640
<v Speaker 2>they probably just crashed here cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were driving their ufo.</v>

1236
00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:19.563
<v Speaker 5>My thought was that when the Annunaki </v>
<v Speaker 5>came down here and they kidnapped the </v>

1237
00:57:25.091 --> 00:57:26.710
<v Speaker 5>monkeys and they turned them into </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1238
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:30.670
<v Speaker 5>they had probably like varying doses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1239
00:57:30.671 --> 00:57:33.250
<v Speaker 5>like my people didn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the Italians didn't get a very good</v>

1240
00:57:33.251 --> 00:57:35.890
<v Speaker 5>dose of alien.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like mostly monkey,</v>

1241
00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.620
<v Speaker 5>some alien either just use one kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>monkey.</v>

1242
00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:40.810
<v Speaker 5>It's multiple kinds of monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>May Be.</v>

1243
00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:45.040
<v Speaker 5>It's possible to also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where were all the hominids?</v>

1244
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:49.180
<v Speaker 5>Were they all in one little forest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ones that became people or was it,</v>

1245
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.360
<v Speaker 5>was there similar things happening in </v>
<v Speaker 5>several spots all throughout the world?</v>

1246
00:57:52.361 --> 00:57:54.040
<v Speaker 5>Like a lot of other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like birds.</v>

1247
00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:55.083
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm on many different birds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are the different birds all over </v>

1248
00:57:57.911 --> 00:57:59.260
<v Speaker 5>the fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1249
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.560
<v Speaker 5>Why would we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why would we assume that the only places</v>

1250
00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:03.903
<v Speaker 5>that we didn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we actually kind of know where the </v>

1251
00:58:06.761 --> 00:58:07.594
<v Speaker 5>monkeys were from.</v>

1252
00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The uncontacted Amazon tribe.</v>

1253
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.000
<v Speaker 5>This is really recent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had these pictures of these people,</v>

1254
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:17.050
<v Speaker 5>these fucking people man are living </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>

1255
00:58:17.051 --> 00:58:17.884
<v Speaker 5>Like it just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something fucked up about going </v>

1256
00:58:20.771 --> 00:58:22.750
<v Speaker 5>in there and taking pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really,</v>

1257
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:25.060
<v Speaker 5>I get that everybody wants to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

1258
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.253
<v Speaker 5>you're going to ruin this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this is incredible and I know it's </v>

1259
00:58:30.881 --> 00:58:31.714
<v Speaker 5>important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a total catch 22 cause I know it's </v>

1260
00:58:33.701 --> 00:58:36.580
<v Speaker 5>important to document.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very important document,</v>

1261
00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:37.683
<v Speaker 5>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is an amazing thing that exists </v>

1262
00:58:41.531 --> 00:58:43.900
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could peer into the past.</v>

1263
00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.033
<v Speaker 5>These people are literally live in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy has a homemade bow and arrow </v>

1264

1307
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:58.220
<v Speaker 5>Their feet are like thick with calluses </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're,</v>

1308
01:00:58.221 --> 01:01:00.160
<v Speaker 5>they're splayed out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their toes are splayed out.</v>

1309
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:02.000
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their feet don't look anything like ours</v>

1310
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.530
<v Speaker 5>because they never wear shoes.</v>

1311
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.230
<v Speaker 5>And they gave these guys some shoes </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1313
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.450
<v Speaker 5>as a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they put them on and you're like,</v>

1314
01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.313
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't want them like their feet </v>

1315
01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.900
<v Speaker 5>have gotten so calloused dcs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have to use these.</v>

1316
01:01:14.901 --> 01:01:17.000
<v Speaker 5>Probably don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>

1317
01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:20.270
<v Speaker 5>Jamie didn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They gave in one of them.</v>

1318
01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:23.090
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they gave these people boots,</v>

1319
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.983
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you would wear if you lived in the </v>

1320
01:01:25.731 --> 01:01:26.564
<v Speaker 5>jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't want to have nothing to do </v>

1321
01:01:27.081 --> 01:01:27.914
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess if you just walk around all the </v>

1322
01:01:29.631 --> 01:01:30.464
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your feet would get so hard that you </v>

1323
01:01:33.141 --> 01:01:35.120
<v Speaker 5>could walk on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1324
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:37.820
<v Speaker 7>Have you seen that guy's feet that like </v>
<v Speaker 7>walked across the country?</v>

1325
01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.260
<v Speaker 7>Which country?</v>
<v Speaker 7>This country really barefoot.</v>

<v Speaker 7>America is doing it right now actually,</v>

1327
01:01:44.181 --> 01:01:45.680
<v Speaker 7>I think for the three barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1328
01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.380
<v Speaker 7>It sounds like a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1329
01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.293
<v Speaker 7>there was that one guy that was on that </v>
<v Speaker 7>dual survival show and that was his </v>

1330
01:01:50.601 --> 01:01:52.910
<v Speaker 7>shtick was that he walks barefoot </v>
<v Speaker 7>everywhere.</v>

1331
01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:53.691
<v Speaker 7>You never knew him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

1332
01:01:53.691 --> 01:01:55.820
<v Speaker 7>When the shoe store is going to run off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She was imagine though,</v>

1333
01:01:55.821 --> 01:01:56.654
<v Speaker 7>if you live your whole life like an </v>
<v Speaker 7>asshole walking outside barefoot and </v>

1334
01:01:58.851 --> 01:02:00.880

<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1341
01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:15.630
<v Speaker 7>it looks like that's a woman dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh God.</v>

1342
01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.800
<v Speaker 7>This is your personal collection.</v>

<v Speaker 3>his name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1345
01:02:21.121 --> 01:02:21.954
<v Speaker 3>I said mark bombers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does that look like a woman in that </v>

1346
01:02:23.161 --> 01:02:24.300
<v Speaker 3>photo along here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1347
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:26.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that a hippie thing?</v>

1348
01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:28.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did I just do,</v>

1349
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:32.850
<v Speaker 3>I do what grandpa does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>46th day of walking barefoot.</v>

1350
01:02:32.851 --> 01:02:34.680
<v Speaker 3>It's my 46 days though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1351
01:02:34.681 --> 01:02:36.570
<v Speaker 3>that's when they just started out doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1352
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:37.503
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't been doing it for years or </v>

1353
01:02:38.161 --> 01:02:41.070
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine more cuts and stuff.</v>

1354
01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.750
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem like a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1355
01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:43.584
<v Speaker 3>it seems like you definitely would get </v>
<v Speaker 3>some infections and shit in the </v>

1356
01:02:45.571 --> 01:02:49.050
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which seems like mental illness with the</v>

1357
01:02:49.051 --> 01:02:49.884
<v Speaker 3>guy has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's one of those things where </v>

1358
01:02:50.881 --> 01:02:53.010
<v Speaker 3>you just gotta do it over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>over again.</v>

1359
01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:54.163
<v Speaker 3>I'd do it slowly and then have it built </v>
<v Speaker 3>up to go to see if you find that dual </v>

1360
01:02:57.571 --> 01:02:59.470
<v Speaker 3>survivor his feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he,</v>

1361
01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:02.060
<v Speaker 3>he used to walk on the show everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the jungle,</v>

1362
01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:03.930
<v Speaker 3>stepping on twigs and shit barefoot.</v>

1363
01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:06.030
<v Speaker 3>His feet were way more discussing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

1364
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.150
<v Speaker 3>his feet will like Werewolf feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just look cool.</v>

1365
01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.010
<v Speaker 3>But if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1366
01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.073
<v Speaker 3>if you want to just have tough feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of that Jesus had a fucked up </v>

1367
01:03:16.801 --> 01:03:19.320
<v Speaker 3>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the dual survivor guy.</v>

1368
01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1369
01:03:20.671 --> 01:03:21.870
<v Speaker 3>His ridiculous feat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

1370
01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:23.850
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he walks.</v>

1371
01:03:23.851 --> 01:03:26.640
<v Speaker 3>Look at that barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disgusting.</v>

1372
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:29.430
<v Speaker 3>Imagine paying someone to suck your toes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they look like that.</v>

1373
01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:31.530
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to be a real piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1374
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:34.440
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't even feel it.</v>

1375
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.780
<v Speaker 3>You might as well be sucking on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom of a table,</v>

1376
01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.940
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't feel that like those,</v>

1377
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.280
<v Speaker 3>those things are numb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine.</v>

1378
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:43.410
<v Speaker 3>The only good thing about having cow's </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet though.</v>

1379
01:03:43.411 --> 01:03:46.290
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you start stepping on </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that would normally hurt you,</v>

1380
01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:47.124
<v Speaker 3>you won't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of like making your own </v>

1381
01:03:48.181 --> 01:03:49.350
<v Speaker 3>shoe out of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on foot with,</v>

1382
01:03:49.351 --> 01:03:50.184
<v Speaker 3>but that's just the bottom of the hill </v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks infected and that looks like </v>

1383
01:03:53.041 --> 01:03:55.170
<v Speaker 3>the homeless guy by my house with </v>
<v Speaker 3>gangrene.</v>

1384
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:58.110
<v Speaker 3>What does named Cody London.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's his name.</v>

1385
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.380
<v Speaker 3>Shout out to cody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

1386
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:01.223
<v Speaker 3>that's an interesting world man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That world of people that are preppers </v>

1387
01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:06.600
<v Speaker 3>and survivalists and they want to stay </v>
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>

1388
01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.370
<v Speaker 3>And I had another conversation with less</v>
<v Speaker 3>trout the other day.</v>

1389
01:04:09.371 --> 01:04:12.220
<v Speaker 3>He came to the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's doubling down on big foot.</v>

1390
01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:17.850
<v Speaker 3>Let me see the socks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish,</v>

1391
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:20.160
<v Speaker 3>I wish he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish you found them.</v>

1392
01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.750
<v Speaker 3>I would fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be so happy if less trout found big</v>

1393
01:04:24.751 --> 01:04:26.310
<v Speaker 3>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fuck.</v>

1394
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.640
<v Speaker 3>He goes looking for it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously.</v>

1395
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.460
<v Speaker 3>What if there's like five of them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's only five of them.</v>

1396
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:38.580
<v Speaker 3>Even talking about it as if there might </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a possibility.</v>

1397
01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:40.650
<v Speaker 3>Journeys you're angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile you,</v>

1398
01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:41.813
<v Speaker 3>you have no problem with a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous fantasies like movies and </v>

1399
01:04:46.111 --> 01:04:48.480
<v Speaker 3>video games and all kinds of fancy </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1400
01:04:48.481 --> 01:04:49.314
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no problem with rogue one boot </v>

1401
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.823
<v Speaker 3>one haven't seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen it to know it hurts code </v>

1402
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:56.583
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very good.</v>

1403
01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:58.890
<v Speaker 3>I liked the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So young.</v>

1404
01:04:58.891 --> 01:05:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Jamie says as much better than the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

1405
01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

1406
01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed it more cooler,</v>

1407
01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:07.140
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know what the fuck's going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on though is that's part of the problem.</v>

1408
01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:09.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like when does it happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a prelude to which one?</v>

1409
01:05:09.571 --> 01:05:11.220
<v Speaker 3>The original what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

1410
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.470
<v Speaker 3>So this is just before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1411
01:05:13.471 --> 01:05:16.740
<v Speaker 3>so the last one was way after the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

1412
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:20.080
<v Speaker 3>but this new one is going to way be way </v>
<v Speaker 3>before the first one.</v>

1413
01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:22.000
<v Speaker 3>The last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last one you saw?</v>

1414
01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:22.893
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1415
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.793
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's way after darth vader when get </v>

1416
01:05:24.951 --> 01:05:26.650
<v Speaker 3>out last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the first one.</v>

1417
01:05:26.651 --> 01:05:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Spoiler alert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1418
01:05:28.181 --> 01:05:29.014
<v Speaker 3>Han Solo was older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously this is like after the first </v>

1419
01:05:31.091 --> 01:05:31.570
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1420
01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:32.403
<v Speaker 3>But now this one's going to go before </v>
<v Speaker 3>the original one that introduced Han </v>

1421
01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:36.363
<v Speaker 3>Solo.</v>

1422
01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.380
<v Speaker 3>But you're never going to get a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>Han solo guy again.</v>

1423
01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:42.893
<v Speaker 3>I feel like like that the age of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of actor is pretty much over the </v>

1424
01:05:48.551 --> 01:05:53.551
<v Speaker 3>age of like the superstar movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like iconic Han Solo type characters.</v>

1425
01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:58.390
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking about that recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the problem is that it's because</v>

1426
01:05:58.391 --> 01:06:01.090
<v Speaker 3>those guys are still here doing those </v>
<v Speaker 3>movies.</v>

1428
01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:05.830

<v Speaker 3>but doe many outs.</v>

1429
01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:06.664
<v Speaker 3>I mean they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem like any new guys are </v>

1430
01:06:08.861 --> 01:06:12.040
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the new blade runners is a new blade</v>

<v Speaker 3>cause they kept the narrative is a real </v>

1452

<v Speaker 3>You don't want to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's expensive house.</v>

<v Speaker 3>which is like very expensive.</v>

1514
01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.100
<v Speaker 3>They sold it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1517
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:36.450
<v Speaker 3>That house has been for sale for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not exaggerating.</v>

1518
01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.700
<v Speaker 3>Maybe like nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years.</v>

1519
01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.720
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1520
01:09:39.721 --> 01:09:40.554
<v Speaker 3>and I think some people bought it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they redid it and they tried to change </v>

1521
01:09:43.411 --> 01:09:44.860
<v Speaker 3>the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's who this is.</v>

1522
01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:45.953
<v Speaker 3>They own the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that bought it right after </v>

1523
01:09:47.071 --> 01:09:49.440
<v Speaker 3>the randy's moved out in 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

1524
01:09:49.441 --> 01:09:51.540
<v Speaker 3>had been trying to sell it for 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1525
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:54.510
<v Speaker 3>So they just sold it and some new people</v>
<v Speaker 3>bought it.</v>

1526
01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.430
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it is haunted,</v>

1527
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:59.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's a um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>expiration date on ghost.</v>

1528
01:09:59.641 --> 01:10:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Dude Watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were having trouble selling it.</v>

1529
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they haven't sold it yet.</v>

1530
01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:04.681
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1531
01:10:04.681 --> 01:10:05.514
<v Speaker 3>So that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was the point is that these </v>

1532
01:10:06.781 --> 01:10:09.090
<v Speaker 3>people bought this house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fixed it up and they're like,</v>

1533
01:10:09.091 --> 01:10:10.080
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's beautiful house.</v>

1534
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:12.180
<v Speaker 3>It'll sell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants it.</v>

1535
01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:15.250

<v Speaker 7>and that's like,</v>

1536
01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:16.690

<v Speaker 7>times,</v>

1537

<v Speaker 7>There's a bunch of them.</v>

1539
01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.513

<v Speaker 7>but there's like four or five different </v>

1540
01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:28.900
<v Speaker 7>of those.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ghost shows.</v>

1564
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:30.343

<v Speaker 5>I remember that scene from American </v>

1565
01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:33.793
<v Speaker 5>Werewolf in London where there was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>businessman on the subway in London and </v>

1566
01:11:37.761 --> 01:11:38.594
<v Speaker 5>he's walking along and he looks behind </v>
<v Speaker 5>him and he sees the wolf and you know </v>

1567
01:11:43.281 --> 01:11:45.860
<v Speaker 5>that he sees the wolf and he starts </v>
<v Speaker 5>running and you,</v>

1568
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:49.070
<v Speaker 5>you barely see the wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see the wolf for like maybe a half,</v>

1569
01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:49.904
<v Speaker 5>a second like maybe and then he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>running and he keeps looking back and </v>

1570
01:11:53.871 --> 01:11:54.704
<v Speaker 5>he's terrified and he fucking runs up </v>
<v Speaker 5>this escalator and he trips and falls </v>

1571
01:11:59.181 --> 01:12:00.014
<v Speaker 5>and his briefcase falls apart and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to pick up the stop and he looks </v>

1572
01:12:02.121 --> 01:12:02.954
<v Speaker 5>down at the bottom of the escalator and </v>
<v Speaker 5>for like a split second you see the </v>

1573
01:12:05.691 --> 01:12:10.610
<v Speaker 5>Werewolf and it makes you shit your </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking pants.</v>

1574
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:11.623

<v Speaker 5>were that guy and this thing is running </v>

1575
01:12:15.381 --> 01:12:19.300
<v Speaker 5>through the airport chasing you and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just can't keep it together anymore.</v>

1576
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:21.470
<v Speaker 5>You're out of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get to the top of that escalator,</v>

1577
01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:23.000
<v Speaker 5>you fall down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you collapse.</v>

1578
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:24.650
<v Speaker 5>He looked down and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1579
01:12:24.651 --> 01:12:25.221
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1584
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:40.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't like being stressed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I couldn't,</v>

1585
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I never finished breaking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched the first episode and I was</v>

1586
01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:44.130
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1588
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.250
<v Speaker 1>that was stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to do any more.</v>

1589
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.560
<v Speaker 1>That gave up on the walking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1590
01:12:49.561 --> 01:12:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I heard it's just turned a corner now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was way too torturey.</v>

1591
01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a torture show.</v>

1592
01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:58.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of a sudden the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the zombies are pussies.</v>

1593
01:12:58.770 --> 01:13:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Like all of a sudden the zombies aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>any threat at all.</v>

1594
01:13:00.931 --> 01:13:02.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She finished the zombies coming here.</v>

1595
01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:04.980
<v Speaker 1>You just fucking pushed him to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get out of here.</v>

1596
01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:07.170
<v Speaker 1>These zombies used to be able to tear </v>
<v Speaker 1>open a horse.</v>

1597
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:08.423
<v Speaker 1>They used to take down a fucking full </v>
<v Speaker 1>grown horse or rip it apart and eat it </v>

1598
01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:11.873
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

1599
01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how quick a fucking horse </v>
<v Speaker 1>would run over 30 40 people,</v>

1600
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:20.940
<v Speaker 1>like a 30 40 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just regular strength.</v>

1601
01:13:20.941 --> 01:13:21.774
<v Speaker 1>People went and had a horse cornered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a stable and tried to eat the horse </v>

1602
01:13:26.791 --> 01:13:27.624
<v Speaker 1>while it's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That horse would kick the fuck out of </v>

1603
01:13:29.551 --> 01:13:31.470
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would go flying.</v>

1604
01:13:31.471 --> 01:13:34.410
<v Speaker 1>You would take maybe 15 seconds and we'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>all be dead.</v>

1605
01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.580
<v Speaker 1>The horse would just kick you and kick </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1606
01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.480
<v Speaker 1>You would never bite through his fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin and eat him.</v>

1607
01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.780
<v Speaker 1>But in this stupid show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point in time,</v>

1608
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:44.880
<v Speaker 1>the zombies could just tear open a </v>
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>

1609
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:46.223
<v Speaker 1>So what are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they super powerful or are they </v>

1610
01:13:47.731 --> 01:13:50.700
<v Speaker 1>pussies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walk like two miles an hour or that</v>

1611
01:13:50.701 --> 01:13:54.090
<v Speaker 1>could they corner a fucking giant horse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what's going on here.</v>

1612
01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:57.210
<v Speaker 1>What if one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it's just like if the person was</v>

1613
01:13:57.211 --> 01:13:59.700
<v Speaker 1>super strong before they came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>became a Zombie.</v>

1614
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:03.660
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work on the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even a bunch of strong men get 50 strong</v>

1615
01:14:03.661 --> 01:14:05.910
<v Speaker 1>men to try to take out a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's going to get kicked.</v>

1616
01:14:05.911 --> 01:14:07.590
<v Speaker 1>This is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see this,</v>

1617
01:14:07.591 --> 01:14:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't let me see this.</v>

1618
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to Kod.</v>

1619
01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:14.770

<v Speaker 5>I got k the fuck.</v>

1620
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.840
<v Speaker 5>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got a whole sequence of them,</v>

1621
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:19.340
<v Speaker 5>like a collaboration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do not want to watch a play in the PAC</v>

1622
01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:21.910
<v Speaker 5>dudes getting checked by horses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But let me tell you something.</v>

1623
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:25.780
<v Speaker 5>You could have a hundred people tried to</v>
<v Speaker 5>corral horse and rip it apart.</v>

1624
01:14:25.781 --> 01:14:28.600
<v Speaker 5>That horse will send people fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>flying.</v>

1625
01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:30.430
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

1626
01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:33.820
<v Speaker 5>if I was in a room with a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 5>Chihuahuas,</v>

1627
01:14:33.821 --> 01:14:36.940
<v Speaker 5>it we're trying to kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guess who's getting out of the room?</v>

1628
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.253
<v Speaker 5>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be a hundred dead </v>

1629
01:14:39.581 --> 01:14:41.770
<v Speaker 5>fucking two hours and me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know why?</v>

1630
01:14:41.771 --> 01:14:44.950
<v Speaker 5>Cause I'm a person and I'm bigger than a</v>
<v Speaker 5>goddamned Chihuahua.</v>

1631
01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:45.933
<v Speaker 5>That's like a better I have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have less good odds than a hundred </v>

1632
01:14:49.631 --> 01:14:51.780
<v Speaker 5>people trying to eat a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1633
01:14:51.781 --> 01:14:52.614
<v Speaker 5>horses will kick the fuck out of you </v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you have a gun or a spear or </v>

1634
01:14:55.721 --> 01:14:56.554
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to penetrate that </v>

1635
01:14:57.671 --> 01:14:58.750
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Vital organs.</v>

1636
01:14:58.751 --> 01:15:00.700
<v Speaker 5>He's going to beat the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>

1637
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:02.170
<v Speaker 5>You can't just eat the horse.</v>

1638
01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:03.650
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1639
01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:07.580
<v Speaker 5>fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your rules don't fit.</v>

1640
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:08.740
<v Speaker 5>They did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

1641
01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:10.163
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you haven't made a coherent universe </v>

1642
01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:13.843
<v Speaker 5>where things are consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like sometimes these zombies can tear </v>

1643
01:15:16.491 --> 01:15:20.480
<v Speaker 5>through things and eat a living horse </v>
<v Speaker 5>and sometimes he's fucking things.</v>

1644
01:15:20.481 --> 01:15:22.730
<v Speaker 5>You just push him to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't even bite you.</v>

1645
01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.250
<v Speaker 5>Like they're not as frantic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They move slower.</v>

1646
01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:28.370
<v Speaker 5>They're not a consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This word we're doing,</v>

1647
01:15:28.371 --> 01:15:32.270
<v Speaker 5>we're breaking down the zombies and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Zombie psychology here,</v>

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:33.171
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>

1651
01:15:42.861 --> 01:15:47.360
<v Speaker 5>contributions coming up next.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Zombie physics,</v>

1652
01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:51.110
<v Speaker 5>bite physics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how they bite through things.</v>

1653
01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:52.123
<v Speaker 5>How do you buy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>All you need is like a thick jacket and </v>

1654
01:15:53.301 --> 01:15:54.970
<v Speaker 5>just stab them on the head here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pipe my arm.</v>

1655
01:15:54.971 --> 01:15:57.890
<v Speaker 5>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stabbing the fucking head there.</v>

1656
01:15:57.891 --> 01:15:59.000
<v Speaker 5>It's super power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Strength.</v>

1657
01:15:59.090 --> 01:16:00.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes.</v>

1658
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:03.050
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes like the first episode of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>new season,</v>

1659
01:16:03.051 --> 01:16:07.170
<v Speaker 5>Rick's just shucking them to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he's some goddamn super linemen.</v>

1660
01:16:07.190 --> 01:16:09.380
<v Speaker 5>They're a bunch of high school players.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just chucking them,</v>

1661
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:12.110
<v Speaker 5>moving them around like they're nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody bites him.</v>

1662
01:16:12.111 --> 01:16:15.260
<v Speaker 5>30 40 of them at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not one of them gets a hold of them,</v>

1663
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:16.820
<v Speaker 5>bites him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>

1664
01:16:16.890 --> 01:16:20.070
<v Speaker 7>It should be somebody's job to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>make sure that is a thing.</v>

1665
01:16:20.071 --> 01:16:21.260
<v Speaker 7>You know where the wood,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

1666
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.193
<v Speaker 7>Consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They can't do that with a storyline </v>

1667
01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.420
<v Speaker 7>because the storyline is too weird,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

1668
01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:27.690
<v Speaker 7>The storyline is like now you know</v>

1669
01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:28.643
<v Speaker 5>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the zombies are still around but the </v>

1670
01:16:29.761 --> 01:16:30.594
<v Speaker 5>people become a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The zombies are still around but they </v>

1671
01:16:32.971 --> 01:16:36.630
<v Speaker 5>don't eat and it's been years and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess they're just around.</v>

1672
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:39.060
<v Speaker 5>And a unlike anything we've ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>observed,</v>

1673
01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:41.610
<v Speaker 5>they don't deteriorate and fall away </v>
<v Speaker 5>from not eating.</v>

1674
01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:42.683
<v Speaker 5>Like what the fuck are these stupid slow</v>
<v Speaker 5>comments going to feed themselves every </v>

1675
01:16:45.661 --> 01:16:47.280
<v Speaker 5>day?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did they have a digestive system?</v>

1676
01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:48.850
<v Speaker 7>They can just write into this story </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1677
01:16:48.851 --> 01:16:49.720
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we figured it out.</v>

1678
01:16:49.721 --> 01:16:52.030
<v Speaker 7>Why some are stronger than the others.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So some have eaten,</v>

1679
01:16:52.031 --> 01:16:52.864
<v Speaker 7>they hate</v>

1680
01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.050
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like an ABC after school.</v>

1681
01:16:56.051 --> 01:16:57.340
<v Speaker 5>Special finish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Westworld.</v>

1682
01:16:57.850 --> 01:16:59.380
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good show.</v>

1683
01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:01.300
<v Speaker 5>I fucking love that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's great show.</v>

1684
01:17:01.690 --> 01:17:02.523
<v Speaker 5>That's a show that has so much weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>room to move around cause they jumped </v>

1685
01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:06.533
<v Speaker 5>timelines and you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you never know who's a robot and who's </v>

1686
01:17:09.741 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 5>not</v>

1687
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.880
<v Speaker 3>a robot and it's just getting slippery </v>
<v Speaker 3>or and slippery or,</v>

1688
01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.050
<v Speaker 3>and it's Anthony fucking hopkins and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the other guy,</v>

1689
01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:18.960
<v Speaker 3>ed,</v>

1693
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:32.750

<v Speaker 3>Like a girl,</v>

1694
01:17:32.751 --> 01:17:33.584
<v Speaker 3>like that is the type of girl that could</v>
<v Speaker 3>just act like that and like get you to </v>

1695
01:17:40.131 --> 01:17:40.964
<v Speaker 3>fall in love with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if a girl can act that good and a </v>

1696
01:17:43.071 --> 01:17:45.200
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if she wanted to use it for evil,</v>

1697
01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.360
<v Speaker 3>she could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like if data,</v>

1698
01:17:47.361 --> 01:17:50.150
<v Speaker 3>if you have these local girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these actresses,</v>

1699
01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:52.100
<v Speaker 3>Rachel Wood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not fair.</v>

1700
01:17:53.050 --> 01:17:54.560
<v Speaker 3>If you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can use it for evil.</v>

1701
01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:55.453
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can date you pretty like hide the </v>

1702
01:17:56.781 --> 01:18:00.170
<v Speaker 3>crazy way easier because they can just </v>
<v Speaker 3>act like they're nice and normal.</v>

1703
01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Well also most people who are crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even know that they're crazy.</v>

1704
01:18:03.141 --> 01:18:04.790
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm crazy,</v>

1705
01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:05.624
<v Speaker 3>but I can't let Brian know I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to </v>

1706
01:18:07.821 --> 01:18:11.900
<v Speaker 3>pretend even with facebook though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everyone calling them crazy for like</v>

1707
01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.070
<v Speaker 3>a couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they got to figure it out.</v>

1708
01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.360
<v Speaker 3>Ego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1709
01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:16.970
<v Speaker 3>those people on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ain't paying him no mind cause I ain't</v>

1710
01:18:16.971 --> 01:18:20.300
<v Speaker 3>about haters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ain't about haters.</v>

1711
01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.193
<v Speaker 3>Preach seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a way that we can all </v>

1712
01:18:23.271 --> 01:18:26.930
<v Speaker 3>justify who we are and how we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think crazy people have some</v>

1713
01:18:26.931 --> 01:18:29.600
<v Speaker 3>sort of clarity that we don't possess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's ridiculous.</v>

1714
01:18:29.601 --> 01:18:31.370
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably quite the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite.</v>

1715
01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:34.130
<v Speaker 3>I bet they have way less clarity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have no idea.</v>

1716
01:18:34.131 --> 01:18:35.750
<v Speaker 3>They're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think the world sucks.</v>

1717
01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:37.693
<v Speaker 3>World's full of retards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Justin bieber went to bed and probably </v>

1718
01:18:40.281 --> 01:18:41.330
<v Speaker 3>got up that morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1725
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:57.020

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.080
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these nutty people,</v>

1727
01:19:00.081 --> 01:19:00.914
<v Speaker 3>they probably didn't even know that that</v>
<v Speaker 3>nunny they think they're a little nutty </v>

1728
01:19:02.361 --> 01:19:03.920
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the big deal?</v>

1729
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:05.720
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1730
01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:09.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have video of him saying,</v>

1731
01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:11.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh yeah,</v>

1732
01:19:11.721 --> 01:19:15.890
<v Speaker 3>but have you ever slept with 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>supermodels to this black guy?</v>

1733
01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.660
<v Speaker 3>And when the black guy came up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

1734
01:19:17.661 --> 01:19:19.730
<v Speaker 3>what's up man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And word like he said,</v>

1735
01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:21.890
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no to this black guy.</v>

1736
01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:24.430
<v Speaker 3>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he yelled something to this black guy,</v>

1737
01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:27.920
<v Speaker 3>said this black guy comes up and puts </v>
<v Speaker 3>down his food and he goes,</v>

1738
01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:29.390
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mind inward.</v>

1739
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:31.430
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared of saying that word.</v>

1740
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:33.620
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like saying it man.</v>

1741
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:36.830
<v Speaker 3>Because then nowadays people make it </v>
<v Speaker 3>bring tones and shit.</v>

1742
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Well it's a fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Magic words are never good folks.</v>

1743
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:46.400
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good because it makes them more</v>

1744
01:19:46.401 --> 01:19:47.234
<v Speaker 3>valuable when you say it now it has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it holds more power becomes a more </v>

1745
01:19:51.111 --> 01:19:55.970
<v Speaker 3>loaded word that lenny bruce argued </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that and like 1950s he,</v>

1746
01:19:55.971 --> 01:19:56.804
<v Speaker 3>it was one of his bits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like one of his most </v>

1747
01:19:57.981 --> 01:19:58.814
<v Speaker 3>controversial bits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would point people out in the </v>

1748
01:20:00.561 --> 01:20:03.620
<v Speaker 3>audience and call there's a nigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a SPEC share the kike.</v>

1749
01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah dude.</v>

1750
01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:07.200
<v Speaker 3>It was a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy bit.</v>

1751
01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 3>And at the</v>

1752
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:08.813
<v Speaker 5>time like people had no idea where he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was going with it because nobody had </v>

1753
01:20:12.661 --> 01:20:13.494
<v Speaker 5>ever done that kind of comedy before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he was essentially saying that if </v>

1754
01:20:17.241 --> 01:20:18.930
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more you use those words,</v>

1755
01:20:18.931 --> 01:20:19.764
<v Speaker 5>the more they lose their power and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>more they'll never have the ability to </v>

1756
01:20:24.001 --> 01:20:27.090
<v Speaker 5>hurt some child's feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was pretty profound,</v>

1757
01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:29.910
<v Speaker 5>especially considering that he had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1758
01:20:29.911 --> 01:20:33.850
<v Speaker 5>had to realize like what happens when </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's censor things and censor people and</v>

1759
01:20:33.851 --> 01:20:36.180
<v Speaker 5>ain't figured that out in the 1960 </v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow,</v>

1760
01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he figured out like this is,</v>

1761
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:42.180
<v Speaker 5>this is cakes counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't,</v>

1762
01:20:42.210 --> 01:20:46.380
<v Speaker 5>you can't demonize a word where it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>just conveying tent like we were talking</v>

1763
01:20:46.381 --> 01:20:47.214
<v Speaker 5>about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the hardest thing in the world is </v>

1764
01:20:49.501 --> 01:20:50.334
<v Speaker 5>to convey your thoughts through your </v>
<v Speaker 5>words and to make certain words </v>

1765
01:20:54.061 --> 01:20:54.894
<v Speaker 5>supercharged and decide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Certain words have like magic fucking </v>

1766
01:20:57.691 --> 01:20:59.970
<v Speaker 5>powers in the game and they can jump </v>
<v Speaker 5>three steps.</v>

1767
01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:01.170
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1768
01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:02.830
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just fucking words matter.</v>

1769
01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:04.003
<v Speaker 5>And words are supposed to be flexible </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're supposed to all contribute </v>

1770
01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:12.480
<v Speaker 5>to the best possible job you can do of </v>
<v Speaker 5>conveying your intent.</v>

1771
01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:13.913
<v Speaker 5>And as soon as you have like </v>
<v Speaker 5>supercharged war z you can't use </v>

1772
01:21:15.781 --> 01:21:17.580
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well then I can't,</v>

1773
01:21:17.610 --> 01:21:20.040
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have less tools to convey my intent.</v>

1774
01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:20.963
<v Speaker 5>I have less.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have less of an ability to </v>

1775
01:21:22.921 --> 01:21:25.310
<v Speaker 5>understand what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're,</v>

1776
01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:26.193
<v Speaker 5>you're assuming that the exact same word</v>
<v Speaker 5>from one sentence to the next as the </v>

1777
01:21:31.621 --> 01:21:35.370
<v Speaker 5>same con is the same content as the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>ability?</v>

1778

<v Speaker 5>The same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It means the same thing cause it doesn't</v>

1779
01:21:37.561 --> 01:21:38.394
<v Speaker 5>always mean the same thing.</v>

1795
01:22:12.421 --> 01:22:13.254

1796
01:22:15.151 --> 01:22:15.984
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A word just conveys intent and it's not </v>

1797
01:22:19.141 --> 01:22:22.770
<v Speaker 5>that fucking good me and we're really </v>

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you could repeat the same shit over</v>

1807
01:22:48.571 --> 01:22:49.404
<v Speaker 5>those words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they convey an intent that we can all </v>

1808
01:22:51.511 --> 01:22:56.511
<v Speaker 5>support and the music backs it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1838
01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:54.050
<v Speaker 3>It's just repeating it over and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1839
01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:58.400
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds incredible.</v>

01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:00.380
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ducked just dat.</v>

1841
01:25:00.381 --> 01:25:01.214
<v Speaker 3>Sound alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just completely changed the way I think </v>

1842
01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:03.764
<v Speaker 3>about Wales.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that sound like crying to you or </v>

1843
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:07.310
<v Speaker 3>no?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Positive or negative?</v>

1844
01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:08.293
<v Speaker 3>They're communicating didn't sound </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative sounding like they're </v>

1845
01:25:10.731 --> 01:25:11.564
<v Speaker 3>communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it makes you realize how fucking </v>

1846
01:25:13.371 --> 01:25:15.680
<v Speaker 3>smart they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they're saying,</v>

1847
01:25:15.681 --> 01:25:19.220
<v Speaker 3>but I can tell that that's a language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were,</v>

1848
01:25:19.290 --> 01:25:22.870
<v Speaker 3>there were repeating certain sounds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it in a way that's,</v>

1849
01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:26.130
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's clear the differences in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sounds.</v>

1850
01:25:26.131 --> 01:25:28.420
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like a fucking language man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1851
01:25:29.370 --> 01:25:31.050
<v Speaker 3>And also you got to think like what up</v>

1852
01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:33.643
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you stop and think about how we've </v>

1853
01:25:34.491 --> 01:25:35.324
<v Speaker 3>all chosen certain languages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Chinese or Spanish or </v>

1854
01:25:38.151 --> 01:25:38.850
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1855
01:25:38.850 --> 01:25:40.910
<v Speaker 3>the region that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world that we live in,</v>

1856
01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:41.923
<v Speaker 3>we've chosen certain languages that </v>
<v Speaker 3>become like our standard way of making </v>

1857
01:25:44.631 --> 01:25:48.110
<v Speaker 3>sounds that convey our ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these things have,</v>

1858
01:25:48.170 --> 01:25:52.160
<v Speaker 3>they've gone a totally different path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's Kinda the same thing.</v>

1859
01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.250
<v Speaker 3>They're like those Amazon tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that they discovered,</v>

1860
01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:56.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their people,</v>

1861
01:25:56.810 --> 01:26:00.050
<v Speaker 3>their brains are probably just like our </v>
<v Speaker 3>brains exactly the same,</v>

1862
01:26:00.051 --> 01:26:02.990
<v Speaker 3>but they never encountered all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>metals,</v>

1863
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 3>plastics and</v>

1864
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:08.010
<v Speaker 5>all the innovations that came with the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1865
01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:09.043
<v Speaker 5>industrial era.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they just live like people have </v>

1866
01:26:10.761 --> 01:26:13.280
<v Speaker 5>thousands and thousands of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's the same.</v>

1867
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:14.510
<v Speaker 5>It's the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1868
01:26:14.511 --> 01:26:15.344
<v Speaker 5>They're just people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They probably have some crazy language </v>

1869
01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.510
<v Speaker 5>that we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but go down there and try to figure it.</v>

1870
01:26:19.511 --> 01:26:22.100
<v Speaker 5>You'll hear them talking and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what in the fuck are they saying?</v>

1871
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:24.620
<v Speaker 5>Like what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what kind of language is this?</v>

1872
01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:26.750
<v Speaker 5>That's what it was going on with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Dolphin.</v>

1873
01:26:26.751 --> 01:26:29.210
<v Speaker 5>I was listening to that think talk and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

1874
01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.460
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can't kill these.</v>

1875
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:34.700
<v Speaker 5>How are they killing these?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've got to stop killing me.</v>

1876
01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:38.600
<v Speaker 5>Like whoever it is with this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a sea shepherd bus,</v>

1877
01:26:38.601 --> 01:26:40.760
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people all the time sea </v>
<v Speaker 5>shepherd,</v>

1878
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:44.630
<v Speaker 5>they catch these people cause there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an embargo or not an embargo.</v>

1879
01:26:44.631 --> 01:26:45.870
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1880
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:49.130
<v Speaker 5>it's illegal in most places to kill </v>
<v Speaker 5>whales.</v>

1881
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:50.203
<v Speaker 5>But what what they do is they say they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a research vessel and they kill </v>

1882
01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:55.460
<v Speaker 5>them for research,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not research vessels.</v>

1883
01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:57.170
<v Speaker 5>They take them to chop them up and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>sell them.</v>

1884
01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.680
<v Speaker 5>But they're still doing it like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1885
01:26:59.681 --> 01:27:02.690
<v Speaker 5>it's a big deal in Japan apparently to </v>
<v Speaker 5>dolphin.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well dolphins is different animal,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like they have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they figured out some loophole or the </v>

<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2067
01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.313
<v Speaker 3>We pulled up like how did this evolve?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That way they get to a spot and the </v>

2068
01:35:12.501 --> 01:35:13.334
<v Speaker 3>ocean they lay down on the sand and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they shake themselves and they become </v>

2069
01:35:16.371 --> 01:35:17.204
<v Speaker 3>one with the sand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they put sand all over their body </v>

2070
01:35:19.221 --> 01:35:21.710
<v Speaker 3>and only their eyeballs poke up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever see that?</v>

2071
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:25.130
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how the Fuck Whoa,</v>

01:35:30.690 --> 01:35:33.480
<v Speaker 3>How bit in the sense see watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see how it does it.</v>

2076
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:34.343
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy when you watch them do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause they just swimming along and they </v>

2077
01:35:37.201 --> 01:35:41.450
<v Speaker 3>find a spot and they pound on the sand </v>
<v Speaker 3>until it covers them.</v>

2078
01:35:41.451 --> 01:35:42.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's great</v>

2079
01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:47.390
<v Speaker 3>and that's how he hides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a weird creature.</v>

2080
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:51.260
<v Speaker 3>When they have the two eyeballs on one </v>
<v Speaker 3>side and the other side,</v>

2081
01:35:51.261 --> 01:35:55.760
<v Speaker 3>no eyeballs and they're flat like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a weird looking animal dude.</v>

2082
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:56.623
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's eyeballs or poking up and it's a </v>

2083
01:35:59.571 --> 01:36:01.460
<v Speaker 3>Predator too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is even weirder.</v>

2084
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:03.163
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not something that's like eating </v>

2085
01:36:03.771 --> 01:36:04.604
<v Speaker 3>plants and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's waiting for something to fuck up </v>

2086
01:36:05.931 --> 01:36:08.640
<v Speaker 3>and get near it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at Jack them like this.</v>

2087
01:36:08.641 --> 01:36:13.010
<v Speaker 3>This is a weird camouflage method and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're delicious.</v>

2088
01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:15.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a fish guy at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2089
01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:16.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2090
01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:18.620
<v Speaker 3>I think I need to get that something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to get into it older.</v>

2091
01:36:18.621 --> 01:36:23.060
<v Speaker 3>I get the type thing because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate fish and I just hate the taste of</v>

2092
01:36:23.061 --> 01:36:24.620
<v Speaker 3>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like hard shell,</v>

2093
01:36:24.650 --> 01:36:26.070
<v Speaker 3>like lobster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2094
01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But fish,</v>

2095
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:29.860
<v Speaker 3>unless it's cooked delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee,</v>

2096
01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.790
<v Speaker 3>which most of the time it's just fish.</v>

2097
01:36:32.210 --> 01:36:33.043
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't get into it at all if it's just </v>

2098
01:36:34.671 --> 01:36:38.180
<v Speaker 3>something that like if you go to like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Chili's or something like that,</v>

2099
01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:39.380
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you order fish,</v>

2100
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:40.970
<v Speaker 3>it's probably not going to be so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2101
01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:41.813
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you go to like a fish place in </v>

2102
01:36:43.821 --> 01:36:44.654
<v Speaker 3>order to fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2103
01:36:44.690 --> 01:36:46.760
<v Speaker 3>what do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Chile's are the best fish ever.</v>

2104
01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:49.250
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm just a Snob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>

2105
01:36:49.251 --> 01:36:51.160
<v Speaker 3>they can't fuck up chicken breasts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2106
01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:53.570
<v Speaker 3>chicken breasts are pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>simple,</v>

2107
01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:57.710
<v Speaker 3>but if your fish is old at all or weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>at all,</v>

2108
01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:00.560
<v Speaker 3>no Sushi on Sundays because they can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>ship it.</v>

2109
01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:02.780
<v Speaker 3>Never go get fish on Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2110
01:37:02.781 --> 01:37:04.990
<v Speaker 3>they say even is a bit of a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2111
01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:07.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like an old rule.</v>

2112
01:37:07.701 --> 01:37:11.030
<v Speaker 3>They probably can ship stuff on Sundays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I get deliveries on Amazon prime.</v>

2113
01:37:11.031 --> 01:37:15.290

<v Speaker 3>They're going to come to a time and it's</v>

2116
01:37:21.801 --> 01:37:24.740
<v Speaker 3>not that far in the future where there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>no more truck drivers.</v>

2117
01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:27.440
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been reading a lot about this man.</v>

2118
01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:30.950

2124
01:37:41.471 --> 01:37:42.304

<v Speaker 3>drivers,</v>

2151
01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:54.541
<v Speaker 3>percentage of,</v>

<v Speaker 3>living topped out at 20% are women of </v>

2153
01:39:00.061 --> 01:39:00.894
<v Speaker 3>all trucks hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When this article he expects about 10% </v>

2154
01:39:04.051 --> 01:39:06.390
<v Speaker 3>of the freights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>9,000</v>

2155
01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:07.493
<v Speaker 3>haulers to be women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is almost twice the national </v>

2156
01:39:09.091 --> 01:39:10.530
<v Speaker 3>average.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's double.</v>

2157
01:39:10.531 --> 01:39:12.930
<v Speaker 3>The national average is about 20% are </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2158
01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:16.380
<v Speaker 3>But is that the NAF national average for</v>
<v Speaker 3>any job or for truck driving?</v>

2159
01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.330
<v Speaker 3>For truck driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2160
01:39:18.630 --> 01:39:22.470
<v Speaker 3>So let's find out what the percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that drive trucks are.</v>

2161
01:39:23.050 --> 01:39:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Because I think for men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2162
01:39:24.210 --> 01:39:27.430
<v Speaker 3>just google what percentage of men drive</v>
<v Speaker 3>trucks right here?</v>

2163
01:39:27.450 --> 01:39:29.490
<v Speaker 3>A 5.8%</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the 3.4</v>

2164
01:39:29.491 --> 01:39:31.140
<v Speaker 3>million truck drivers last year were </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

2165
01:39:32.190 --> 01:39:33.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So 3.4</v>

2166
01:39:33.781 --> 01:39:38.781
<v Speaker 3>million truck drivers and that's from </v>
<v Speaker 3>2010 or 2011 compared to 4.6%</v>

2167
01:39:40.681 --> 01:39:41.880
<v Speaker 3>in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

2168
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:45.540
<v Speaker 3>So that's saying it's declining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>2% are fuckable as this,</v>

2169
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:47.333
<v Speaker 3>I think it's one to 5.8%</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the 34 million truck drivers last </v>

2170
01:39:52.690 --> 01:39:55.470
<v Speaker 3>year as compared to the 4.6%.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2171
01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:59.460
<v Speaker 3>So there's more female truck drivers now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not 4.6</v>

2172
01:39:59.461 --> 01:40:00.090
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm reading,</v>

2173
01:40:00.090 --> 01:40:00.923
<v Speaker 3>I'm reading it wrong that most female </v>
<v Speaker 3>checkers working two person driving </v>

2174
01:40:03.121 --> 01:40:06.240

<v Speaker 3>Good move mother daughter pairings.</v>

2175
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:06.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2176
01:40:06.711 --> 01:40:08.370
<v Speaker 3>that's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stay safe.</v>

2177

<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2189
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:35.783
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird time when it comes to those</v>
<v Speaker 3>people because those jobs are gonna go </v>

2190
01:40:37.711 --> 01:40:39.810
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have automated trucks.</v>

2193
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:44.663
<v Speaker 3>trucker's cashiers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the cashiers are going to go </v>

2194
01:40:47.131 --> 01:40:47.610
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to,</v>

2196
01:40:49.651 --> 01:40:51.870
<v Speaker 3>I think the trucker thing's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen sooner than you think.</v>

2197
01:40:51.871 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 3>They already started using these drone </v>
<v Speaker 3>trucks,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they've already started using </v>

2200
01:40:56.811 --> 01:40:58.530
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In some places it's a,</v>

2201
01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:01.660
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have to figure out a way</v>
<v Speaker 5>to employ those people.</v>

2202
01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:04.930
<v Speaker 5>You've got millions of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>millions of people that don't have a job</v>

2203
01:41:04.931 --> 01:41:08.390
<v Speaker 5>anymore because I'm,</v>

2204
01:41:09.130 --> 01:41:13.180

<v Speaker 7>of things like twitchers youtubers,</v>

2207
01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:19.570
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not everybody figures out how to do it.</v>

2208
01:41:19.571 --> 01:41:22.390
<v Speaker 5>That even does it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many people figure out how to make a</v>

2209
01:41:22.391 --> 01:41:23.710
<v Speaker 5>living off of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

01:41:23.770 --> 01:41:25.870
<v Speaker 5>doing anything on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2211
01:41:25.871 --> 01:41:26.704
<v Speaker 5>even people that do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many people that are on like </v>

2212
01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:29.950

<v Speaker 5>They do it all day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many people are making nothing?</v>

2214
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:34.330
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>zero lot.</v>

2215
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:35.223
<v Speaker 5>They just do it because it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They haven't figured out how to profit </v>

2216
01:41:37.151 --> 01:41:37.984
<v Speaker 5>off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't just expect these truck </v>

2217
01:41:39.611 --> 01:41:42.580
<v Speaker 5>drivers to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like they're going to be,</v>

2218
01:41:42.581 --> 01:41:43.750
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2219
01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:47.620
<v Speaker 5>there's no jobs left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a legitimate job,</v>

2220
01:41:47.650 --> 01:41:48.483
<v Speaker 5>but get out of school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was always these commercials for </v>

2221
01:41:49.691 --> 01:41:52.420

<v Speaker 5>You know all those commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are going away.</v>

2227
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:03.100
<v Speaker 5>The job that doesn't exist,</v>

2228
01:42:03.330 --> 01:42:05.320
<v Speaker 7>probably drone drivers now or something </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>

2229
01:42:06.190 --> 01:42:07.840
<v Speaker 5>Even though those are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>automated too,</v>

2230
01:42:07.841 --> 01:42:11.480
<v Speaker 5>you're going to send those things like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>navigation signal for awhile.</v>

2231
01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:15.730
<v Speaker 5>You'll need people to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a fixed PCR repair till robots know</v>

2232
01:42:15.731 --> 01:42:17.860
<v Speaker 5>how to do it better than you can for </v>
<v Speaker 5>awhile.</v>

2233
01:42:17.890 --> 01:42:19.270
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's too many of us.</v>

2234
01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:23.290
<v Speaker 5>We out fucked our resources.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's what's going on.</v>

2235
01:42:23.291 --> 01:42:23.940
<v Speaker 5>We've got to back off.</v>

2236
01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:24.773
<v Speaker 7>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wonder if it's going to get to the </v>

2237
01:42:25.801 --> 01:42:26.634
<v Speaker 7>point where like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know like chain restaurants like </v>

2238
01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:30.570
<v Speaker 7>Chili's or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like in the back they have,</v>

2239
01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:32.580
<v Speaker 7>they're going to need just like not even</v>
<v Speaker 7>have cooks.</v>

2240
01:42:32.581 --> 01:42:35.580
<v Speaker 7>It's just going to be like plate comps,</v>
<v Speaker 7>squirt the Alfredo,</v>

2241
01:42:35.581 --> 01:42:37.840
<v Speaker 7>squirt the noodle,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know it's going to be longer.</v>

2242
01:42:38.150 --> 01:42:41.570
<v Speaker 5>We're going to use that meat material </v>
<v Speaker 5>and make it with a three d printer,</v>

2243
01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:45.130
<v Speaker 5>like westworld style when they're making</v>
<v Speaker 5>the body,</v>

2244
01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.310
<v Speaker 5>put your fucking New York Strip together</v>
<v Speaker 5>that way.</v>

2245
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:51.163
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if it's going to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if you like you make meat in a </v>

2246
01:42:53.331 --> 01:42:56.720
<v Speaker 5>factory and it's never been worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like super attend.</v>

2247
01:42:56.730 --> 01:42:59.030
<v Speaker 5>Are you biting through here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like oh my God.</v>

2248
01:42:59.330 --> 01:43:00.163
<v Speaker 5>And they figured out how manipulated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was like double the protein 15 </v>

2249
01:43:03.111 --> 01:43:03.944
<v Speaker 5>times the iron.</v>

2250
01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:04.900
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the Matrix,</v>

2251
01:43:04.901 --> 01:43:06.490
<v Speaker 7>that guy had left the matrix and he's </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2252
01:43:06.491 --> 01:43:08.440
<v Speaker 7>I don't give a fuck if the steak tastes </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2253
01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:10.850
<v Speaker 7>I know it's fake,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I want it to,</v>

2254
01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:14.110
<v Speaker 7>I want that fucking fake taste of butter</v>
<v Speaker 7>right now.</v>

2255
01:43:14.250 --> 01:43:15.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knew it was fake,</v>

2256
01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:17.220
<v Speaker 5>but he didn't care cause it tasted </v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>

2257
01:43:17.221 --> 01:43:19.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's might be going on right now.</v>

2258
01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:22.170
<v Speaker 5>Might be going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's entirely possible.</v>

2259
01:43:22.171 --> 01:43:24.090
<v Speaker 5>We're in the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

2260
01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:25.343
<v Speaker 5>I know you do.</v>

2261
01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:30.470
<v Speaker 7>Finally I finally killed my other rat or</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got the,</v>

2262
01:43:30.530 --> 01:43:32.010
<v Speaker 7>I got no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't kill it back.</v>

2263
01:43:32.011 --> 01:43:33.540
<v Speaker 7>Got it out of my house.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't get it out.</v>

2264
01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:36.320
<v Speaker 7>It got trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The first rap,</v>

2265
01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:37.500
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>broke his neck,</v>

2266
01:43:37.530 --> 01:43:38.850
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>second wrap.</v>

2267
01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:40.600
<v Speaker 7>Got his leg trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2268
01:43:40.630 --> 01:43:42.560
<v Speaker 7>You saw that and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and yeah,</v>

2269
01:43:42.690 --> 01:43:44.580
<v Speaker 7>it hasn't been back since the back.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He might be dead.</v>

2270
01:43:44.610 --> 01:43:48.660
<v Speaker 7>My Dad said that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if a rat sees another rat get hurt or it</v>

2271
01:43:48.661 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 7>gets hurting a rat cage,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they automatically know never to go back</v>

2272
01:43:52.161 --> 01:43:53.660
<v Speaker 7>there again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like never date.</v>

2273
01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:54.913
<v Speaker 7>That's why they're so hard to catch </v>
<v Speaker 7>because if they see another wrap in a </v>

2274
01:43:56.631 --> 01:43:57.830
<v Speaker 7>trap,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right in a trap,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I saw that video that you put off </v>
<v Speaker 7>though.</v>

<v Speaker 7>doesn't it sound like a monkey?</v>

2281

<v Speaker 7>Crank that volume up.</v>

2283

01:44:43.390 --> 01:44:44.223
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so that's all contained inside the some </v>

2294
01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:46.073
<v Speaker 7>little box.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So he was getting in there and eating </v>

2295
01:44:46.891 --> 01:44:49.410
<v Speaker 7>your food.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He didn't get to eat any of my food.</v>

2296
01:44:49.411 --> 01:44:51.360
<v Speaker 7>He could only get underneath my kitchen </v>
<v Speaker 7>sink.</v>

2297
01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:54.480
<v Speaker 7>But when we opened up the kitchen sink </v>
<v Speaker 7>after we found out we had rats,</v>

2298
01:44:54.510 --> 01:44:57.510
<v Speaker 7>all our cleaning supplies have been </v>
<v Speaker 7>drank and ate.</v>

2299
01:44:57.550 --> 01:44:58.383
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why are you showing me different things </v>

2300
01:44:58.891 --> 01:44:59.790
<v Speaker 7>back and forth?</v>

<v Speaker 7>this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a different camera angle,</v>

2303
01:45:02.010 --> 01:45:03.640

<v Speaker 7>what is this one?</v>

2305
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:07.320
<v Speaker 7>I was just getting back to that cause I </v>
<v Speaker 7>was him talking in the middle.</v>

2306
01:45:07.321 --> 01:45:08.154
<v Speaker 7>I was getting off of that.</v>

2307
01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:11.040
<v Speaker 7>So this is another rat now this is that </v>
<v Speaker 7>same one different camera.</v>

2308
01:45:11.490 --> 01:45:12.001
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

2309
01:45:12.001 --> 01:45:13.980
<v Speaker 7>So did you get a camera with the rat?</v>
<v Speaker 7>We killed it.</v>

2310
01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:15.373
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we have photos of that and yeah we have </v>

2311
01:45:17.190 --> 01:45:20.370
<v Speaker 7>the video wasn't as good though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the photos are pretty cool.</v>

2312
01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:23.070
<v Speaker 7>So when he jumps through he's heard it </v>
<v Speaker 7>all.</v>

2313
01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:24.750
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he hasn't been back.</v>

2314
01:45:25.770 --> 01:45:30.770
<v Speaker 7>But what's weird is that day they drank </v>
<v Speaker 7>and ate all my cleaning supplies.</v>

2315
01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.153
<v Speaker 7>And so like there was a thing of bleach </v>
<v Speaker 7>that had been eaten through and drank </v>

2316
01:45:35.150 --> 01:45:35.983
<v Speaker 7>watts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they had been living off my cleaning </v>

2317

<v Speaker 7>supplies.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The eight bleach?</v>

<v Speaker 7>Floors.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's all gone.</v>

2321
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:49.440
<v Speaker 7>And there's just a hole in it where they</v>
<v Speaker 7>had drank at all.</v>

2322
01:45:49.450 --> 01:45:51.540
<v Speaker 7>And what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>you can't kill a rat.</v>

2328
01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:03.330
<v Speaker 7>And watching them the last three weeks </v>
<v Speaker 7>was just amazing,</v>

2329
01:46:03.331 --> 01:46:04.164
<v Speaker 7>seeing how smart they are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And have you seen that Morgan spurlock </v>

2334
01:46:11.671 --> 01:46:13.710
<v Speaker 7>smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're about to overtake us.</v>

2335
01:46:13.770 --> 01:46:16.290
<v Speaker 7>And I believe it though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just watching my rack,</v>

2336
01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.870
<v Speaker 7>I always obsessed with them.</v>

2339
01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:23.670
<v Speaker 7>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a horrible feeling.</v>

2340
01:46:23.671 --> 01:46:26.580
<v Speaker 7>Having rats in your house.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I've had it before.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So he could tell that he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like it was all gone.</v>

2377
01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:51.883
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many rats were in </v>

2378
01:47:53.011 --> 01:47:55.290
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a fat ass rat.</v>

2379
01:47:55.410 --> 01:47:56.243
<v Speaker 1>Think about if you had to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and Jamie had to eat a whole person </v>

2380
01:47:58.431 --> 01:48:00.160
<v Speaker 1>at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you eat them?</v>

2382
01:48:02.490 --> 01:48:04.140
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much meat is that?</v>

2383
01:48:04.141 --> 01:48:04.974
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how many rats are there that they </v>

2384
01:48:07.021 --> 01:48:11.040
<v Speaker 1>ate my whole rat in one night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you'd have to like,</v>

2385
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:12.810
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had to eat a person,</v>

2386
01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:15.120
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if the three of us,</v>

2387
01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:16.513
<v Speaker 1>you know how to recruit a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to help us eat someone the size </v>

2388
01:48:19.381 --> 01:48:21.720
<v Speaker 1>of Tony Hinchcliffe not a big person.</v>

2389
01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Take an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No take fucking weeks to do it.</v>

2390
01:48:26.851 --> 01:48:27.684
<v Speaker 1>The bones were throw away the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would have to get like a hundred </v>

2391
01:48:29.731 --> 01:48:31.530
<v Speaker 1>dudes to help us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2392
01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.930
<v Speaker 1>you throw away the bumps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ate through those fucking bones.</v>

2393
01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:36.180
<v Speaker 1>They ate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ate most of the bones.</v>

2394
01:48:36.181 --> 01:48:40.180
<v Speaker 1>How much meat can you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A dinner like two pounds maybe may,</v>

2395
01:48:40.181 --> 01:48:42.780
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to force three pounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your face,</v>

2396
01:48:42.930 --> 01:48:43.763
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to feel like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the equivalent for a rat is like you </v>

2397
01:48:47.641 --> 01:48:50.760
<v Speaker 1>eating 50 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know they jumped so high.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>your counters and like that was fucked </v>

<v Speaker 1>make out into my wall heater and fuck my</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2405
01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:18.060

<v Speaker 1>having a rat and the size of a dog.</v>

2406
01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that like a rat the size of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>German shepard living in your house.</v>

2407
01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:26.640
<v Speaker 1>I think that rats documentary started </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were a rat terrier thing.</v>

2408
01:49:26.641 --> 01:49:27.474
<v Speaker 1>There was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a group of people that take </v>

2409
01:49:28.141 --> 01:49:31.110
<v Speaker 1>their little dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Olson and they fuck up rats.</v>

2410
01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

2411
01:49:31.770 --> 01:49:33.410
<v Speaker 1>It looks fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2412
01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:34.770

<v Speaker 1>Don't even eat them.</v>

2413
01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.510
<v Speaker 1>They just fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it like for fun.</v>

2414
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what those dogs are designed</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

2415
01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:41.760
<v Speaker 1>They made those dogs in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe I might've made that up.</v>

2416
01:49:42.150 --> 01:49:42.983
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made those dogs just to go after </v>

2417
01:49:44.821 --> 01:49:45.990
<v Speaker 1>rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>trucks?</v>

2420
01:49:50.530 --> 01:49:51.850
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was driving me crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was not going to kill the cat.</v>

2430
01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Richard Gere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Gere,</v>

2431
01:50:16.770 --> 01:50:20.590
<v Speaker 1>like the rat would go in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nevermind boy though is bad.</v>

2432
01:50:21.690 --> 01:50:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Jesus tried everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got rid of your rides.</v>

2433
01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:29.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2434
01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:32.020
<v Speaker 1>you got up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to do it right.</v>

2435
01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:34.000
<v Speaker 1>You got to kill him with fucking traps.</v>

2436
01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:37.030
<v Speaker 1>You gotta and you got to set out poison </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to have someone to do the</v>

2437
01:50:37.031 --> 01:50:39.130
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they'll take over your fucking</v>

2438
01:50:39.131 --> 01:50:39.964
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think luckily for the last week and a </v>

2439
01:50:43.090 --> 01:50:44.230
<v Speaker 1>half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there hasn't been one rat.</v>

2440
01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:46.930
<v Speaker 1>So what's one reason why I'm pro coyote?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2441
01:50:46.931 --> 01:50:48.790
<v Speaker 1>even though coyotes have eaten my </v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens,</v>

2442
01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:51.790
<v Speaker 1>they've killed at least one that I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that might've killed too.</v>

2443
01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.193
<v Speaker 1>I think that coyotes are super important</v>
<v Speaker 1>for keeping the rat population in check </v>

2444
01:50:56.111 --> 01:50:56.944
<v Speaker 1>and the mouse population in check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody told me if we just had more </v>

2445
01:50:59.861 --> 01:51:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Guinea pigs like live like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would take care of all that.</v>

2446
01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:04.553
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Guinea pigs hate rats and mice and </v>

2447
01:51:07.150 --> 01:51:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Guinea pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This are kind of cool.</v>

2448
01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:10.100
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't mind seeing those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2449
01:51:10.101 --> 01:51:13.090
<v Speaker 1>there was a show one anthony Bourdain's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a old show.</v>

2450
01:51:13.091 --> 01:51:18.091
<v Speaker 1>He did an episode about this family that</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived in South America and apparently in</v>

2451
01:51:19.001 --> 01:51:19.834
<v Speaker 1>a lot of places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guinea pigs are eating on a regular </v>

2452
01:51:21.731 --> 01:51:23.620
<v Speaker 1>basis and they keep them as pets.</v>

2453
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:26.530
<v Speaker 1>So the entire floor of these people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

2454
01:51:26.531 --> 01:51:27.364
<v Speaker 1>like where the kitchen is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just Guinea pigs running all over the </v>

2455
01:51:29.561 --> 01:51:31.210
<v Speaker 1>place since you grab one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed them,</v>

2456
01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Cook them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

2457
01:51:32.650 --> 01:51:34.420
<v Speaker 1>They're so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know their friend died.</v>

2458
01:51:35.290 --> 01:51:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Mikey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not like rats.</v>

2459
01:51:37.630 --> 01:51:40.180
<v Speaker 1>They're just like their pets in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2460
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Even if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's me,</v>

2461
01:51:41.541 --> 01:51:42.730
<v Speaker 1>it kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of what you're doing.</v>

2462
01:51:42.731 --> 01:51:44.660
<v Speaker 1>If you kill chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2463
01:51:44.661 --> 01:51:45.494
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these early is wandering around with </v>

2464
01:51:46.631 --> 01:51:47.464
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're well fed and then when the </v>

2465
01:51:50.051 --> 01:51:51.700
<v Speaker 1>time is common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the family needs to eat.</v>

2466
01:51:51.701 --> 01:51:53.220
<v Speaker 1>They just grabbed one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers.</v>

2467
01:51:53.330 --> 01:51:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I pick any pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2468
01:51:54.910 --> 01:51:55.743
<v Speaker 1>They look good the way they were cooking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it looked like they've done it </v>

2469
01:51:57.311 --> 01:51:58.180
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2470
01:51:58.270 --> 01:52:00.280
<v Speaker 1>It's probably super lean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2471
01:52:00.281 --> 01:52:03.220
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a lot like rabbit or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2472
01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't like rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2473
01:52:07.090 --> 01:52:10.390
<v Speaker 1>there's Mites that grow on rabbits that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can kill you.</v>

2474
01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2475
01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:16.750
<v Speaker 1>That if you get bitten by these Mites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they carry diseases especially um,</v>

2476
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:20.440
<v Speaker 1>like got jack rabbits like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>jackrabbits have them.</v>

2477
01:52:20.890 --> 01:52:21.940
<v Speaker 1>And if these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2478
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a really important to be careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't,</v>

2479
01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:25.653
<v Speaker 1>if you don't handle them with gloves or </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get them on your body and if you </v>

2480
01:52:27.941 --> 01:52:29.410
<v Speaker 1>get the wrong kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2481
01:52:29.411 --> 01:52:31.930
<v Speaker 1>like ticks carry lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ticks do,</v>

2482
01:52:32.230 --> 01:52:36.280
<v Speaker 1>some mites carry this horrible fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease that kills people.</v>

2483
01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:39.760
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't get antibiotics in you </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the right time,</v>

2484
01:52:39.761 --> 01:52:40.594
<v Speaker 1>people have died from like killing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rabbit and eating it from the mites </v>

2485
01:52:43.871 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 1>biting you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what in the</v>

2486
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:46.813

2487
01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:53.350
<v Speaker 3>like this rat jumped on Janice and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend is like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>well we didn't,</v>

2489
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:55.903
<v Speaker 3>we thought there was only one rat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then so we were like cleaning something </v>

2490
01:52:58.431 --> 01:52:59.264

<v Speaker 3>like the Styrofoam thing and it was </v>

<v Speaker 3>Like when she picked it up,</v>

2493
01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:10.610
<v Speaker 3>looked over at her and it just jumped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2494
01:53:10.611 --> 01:53:12.710
<v Speaker 3>luckily it didn't bite her or anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2495
01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:16.910
<v Speaker 3>What if it got caught in her hair and </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just fucking chewing its way out?</v>

01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:11.480
<v Speaker 3>and you know the cool thing is is you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could just carry it around like this.</v>

2521
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:14.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have to have the keyboard and</v>

2522
01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:14.953
<v Speaker 3>the stewardess doesn't give you a hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>time when you're watching a movie like </v>

2523
01:54:17.211 --> 01:54:18.770
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you use the keyboard,</v>

2524
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:20.240
<v Speaker 3>you're a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2525
01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:22.520
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is that about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes no sense.</v>

2526
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:25.130
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to close your laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you'll have to open up your tablet.</v>

2527
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:26.383
<v Speaker 3>Explain how come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how come I can hold onto a tablet and </v>

2528
01:54:29.710 --> 01:54:30.543
<v Speaker 3>it's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I'm messing around with the </v>

2529
01:54:32.481 --> 01:54:33.314
<v Speaker 3>keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might blow this fucker right out of </v>

2530
01:54:34.491 --> 01:54:36.260
<v Speaker 3>the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes zero sense.</v>

2531
01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:39.350
<v Speaker 3>You have to put away your laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can hold onto your ipad.</v>

2532
01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:41.000
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to white,</v>

2533
01:54:41.001 --> 01:54:41.834
<v Speaker 3>this laptop has such a huge brick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's cause it's a really good </v>

2534
01:54:44.721 --> 01:54:45.650
<v Speaker 3>laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2535
01:54:45.651 --> 01:54:47.930
<v Speaker 3>But I mean if you get the lay windows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2536
01:54:47.931 --> 01:54:51.710
<v Speaker 3>but if you get the latest Mac book pro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the highest specs ever,</v>

2537
01:54:51.711 --> 01:54:52.544
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have a break like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a little power thing but well I </v>

2538
01:54:55.371 --> 01:54:58.220
<v Speaker 3>have a backup brick that's a smaller </v>
<v Speaker 3>brick than that.</v>

2539
01:54:58.490 --> 01:55:00.710
<v Speaker 3>That's a big brick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

2540
01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:04.730
<v Speaker 3>that's a brick I bought online because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a Lenovo brick.</v>

2541
01:55:04.731 --> 01:55:05.564
<v Speaker 3>I think it just works on a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different laptops and they make a giant </v>

2542
01:55:07.761 --> 01:55:09.320
<v Speaker 3>one too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like a 17 inch one.</v>

2543
01:55:09.321 --> 01:55:12.230
<v Speaker 3>They still make a 17 inch one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy burke.</v>

2544
01:55:12.590 --> 01:55:14.750
<v Speaker 3>This is a for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when I switched,</v>

2545
01:55:14.751 --> 01:55:15.584
<v Speaker 3>people keep asking me because like most </v>
<v Speaker 3>people just use apple stuff and they </v>

2546
01:55:17.961 --> 01:55:18.980
<v Speaker 3>stay on apple stuff.</v>

2547
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:21.800
<v Speaker 3>The hardest thing was trying to use an </v>
<v Speaker 3>android phone.</v>

2548
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:23.950
<v Speaker 3>I abandoned that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why I abandoned that,</v>

2549
01:55:23.951 --> 01:55:27.890
<v Speaker 3>it's just too many fucking people send </v>
<v Speaker 3>me messages and it's,</v>

2550
01:55:27.891 --> 01:55:28.724
<v Speaker 3>there's no real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I contacted a lot like a contact of </v>

2551
01:55:31.611 --> 01:55:33.530
<v Speaker 3>you and a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I called them up and I said,</v>

2552
01:55:33.531 --> 01:55:35.120
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do me a favor.</v>

2553
01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:38.330
<v Speaker 3>Change the thing on your phone that says</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an iphone,</v>

2554
01:55:38.331 --> 01:55:41.090
<v Speaker 3>change it to just mobile and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 3>send me a text message.</v>

2555
01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:42.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to send you a text message to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell me if you get it.</v>

2556
01:55:42.930 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 3>And nobody was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they</v>

2557
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.660
<v Speaker 1>were getting my messages but nobody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>messages.</v>

2558
01:55:45.661 --> 01:55:47.930
<v Speaker 1>We're getting back to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going Osi messages.</v>

2559
01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does go both ways but I never got the</v>

2560
01:55:51.751 --> 01:55:52.584
<v Speaker 1>messages back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I even contacted apple and I said </v>

2561
01:55:54.571 --> 01:55:55.404
<v Speaker 1>pull my email off the I message server.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The email that I used to have connected </v>

2562
01:55:59.911 --> 01:56:03.840
<v Speaker 1>to it and they pulled it and I see it </v>
<v Speaker 1>still wasn't going through.</v>

2563
01:56:04.770 --> 01:56:08.060
<v Speaker 1>So I waited a day and then after a day I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was thinking,</v>

2564
01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:10.470
<v Speaker 1>I was saying like 50% of the texts I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>sending,</v>

2565
01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:14.550
<v Speaker 1>we're going through his tax and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>replying as techs 50% the rest of it was</v>

2566
01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:16.710
<v Speaker 1>like a big struggle side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay fuck this.</v>

2567
01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Like they make it really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the Greens that I know,</v>

2568
01:56:20.430 --> 01:56:23.390
<v Speaker 1>like a constantly we're having problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>like why didn't you text me back and go,</v>

2569
01:56:23.391 --> 01:56:24.300
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

2570
01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:25.133
<v Speaker 1>And then I look at their phone and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>sent me something or I sent in </v>

2571
01:56:27.181 --> 01:56:28.014
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the communication between android </v>

2572
01:56:29.611 --> 01:56:32.700
<v Speaker 1>and apple operating systems is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still like,</v>

2573
01:56:32.701 --> 01:56:35.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not 100% because I've never </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced that.</v>

2574
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:36.623
<v Speaker 1>I've never experienced anybody sending </v>
<v Speaker 1>me a green message and I mean not </v>

2575
01:56:38.971 --> 01:56:41.280
<v Speaker 1>getting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fucking for sure.</v>

2576
01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:42.173
<v Speaker 1>Once I switched over to Android,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a disaster for a solid day and a </v>

2577
01:56:45.571 --> 01:56:46.404
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2578
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:48.570
<v Speaker 1>and I was in the middle of doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>business stuff.</v>

2579
01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this.</v>

2580
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:52.470
<v Speaker 1>I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to be able to answer questions.</v>

2581
01:56:52.471 --> 01:56:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I need to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2582
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:57.810
<v Speaker 1>So when you try to switch over to </v>
<v Speaker 1>windows,</v>

2583
01:56:57.811 --> 01:56:59.700
<v Speaker 1>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Windows is easy.</v>

2584
01:56:59.910 --> 01:57:01.980
<v Speaker 1>There's windows 10 is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works good.</v>

2585
01:57:01.981 --> 01:57:03.010
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain,</v>

2586
01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:04.260
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>

2587
01:57:04.261 --> 01:57:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Weird shows me different pictures on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>desktop.</v>

2588
01:57:06.930 --> 01:57:07.763
<v Speaker 1>If I decide to every day it shows me </v>
<v Speaker 1>like new cities and new nature settings </v>

2589
01:57:10.591 --> 01:57:12.690
<v Speaker 1>and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can open it with my fingerprint.</v>

2590
01:57:13.010 --> 01:57:14.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of like,</v>

2591
01:57:14.110 --> 01:57:15.600
<v Speaker 1>like the password works with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>fingerprint,</v>

2592
01:57:15.601 --> 01:57:16.800
<v Speaker 1>the keyboards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

2593
01:57:16.890 --> 01:57:21.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a way more comfortable experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>typing because I was,</v>

2594
01:57:21.090 --> 01:57:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I used Mac books for so fucking long and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

2595
01:57:23.791 --> 01:57:24.624
<v Speaker 1>they're still great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Mac books are metal and metal </v>

2596
01:57:26.761 --> 01:57:29.510
<v Speaker 1>doesn't feel as good in your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this plastic,</v>

2597
01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I haven't kicked me sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2598
01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:32.101
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2599
01:57:32.101 --> 01:57:34.110
<v Speaker 1>look at this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you want to start this bitch up,</v>

2600
01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:37.720
<v Speaker 1>you put your fingerprint in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new Mac books have the thumbprint,</v>

2601
01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:39.180
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the new keyboards.</v>

2602
01:57:39.210 --> 01:57:39.871
<v Speaker 1>Awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2603
01:57:39.871 --> 01:57:42.600
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't click anymore.</v>

2604
01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:43.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2605
01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:44.813
<v Speaker 1>it's like spongy or that's the thing I </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked the most about this is that the </v>

2606
01:57:48.781 --> 01:57:50.150
<v Speaker 1>keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you hear,</v>

2607
01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:51.010
<v Speaker 1>when you timelessness.</v>

2608
01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

2609
01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:58.560
<v Speaker 1>it's like you have like some travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have traveled to the keys,</v>

2610
01:57:58.770 --> 01:58:01.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think for someone who writes,</v>

2611
01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:01.913
<v Speaker 1>like from me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my fingers have to be comfortable so I </v>

2612
01:58:05.581 --> 01:58:07.650
<v Speaker 1>can just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know where the letters are.</v>

2613
01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:09.030
<v Speaker 1>They've got to be comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

2614
01:58:09.031 --> 01:58:09.521
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2615
01:58:09.521 --> 01:58:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I get this and when I don't get any </v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback,</v>

2616
01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:15.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same loop of information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't feel as good.</v>

2617
01:58:15.541 --> 01:58:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Like if I tried to type something on </v>
<v Speaker 1>those virtual keyboards,</v>

2618
01:58:18.391 --> 01:58:20.460
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to type things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just feels so weird.</v>

2619
01:58:20.461 --> 01:58:21.294
<v Speaker 1>I never know where am I putting my </v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers in the right place in the wrong </v>

2620
01:58:23.491 --> 01:58:24.324
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not as good as what apple </v>

2621
01:58:25.741 --> 01:58:27.930
<v Speaker 1>changed their keyboard too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it feels a little different.</v>

2622
01:58:27.931 --> 01:58:30.510
<v Speaker 1>They called butterfly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it or some shit.</v>

2623
01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:32.670
<v Speaker 1>And what's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2624
01:58:32.671 --> 01:58:36.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just a little softer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the old style scissor mechanism.</v>

2625
01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:38.430
<v Speaker 1>So the old style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel more of a click?</v>

2626
01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See I want more.</v>

2627
01:58:39.751 --> 01:58:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Click me to this new one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Felt mushy.</v>

2628
01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:44.200
<v Speaker 5>That's what it felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It mushy.</v>

2629
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:45.303
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to click like what I like about </v>

2630
01:58:47.801 --> 01:58:49.480
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like feel this tap,</v>

2631
01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:50.560
<v Speaker 5>tap those keys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2632
01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:51.940
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's perfect.</v>

2633
01:58:51.970 --> 01:58:52.803
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like shaped like a little half </v>

2634
01:58:54.850 --> 01:58:55.240
<v Speaker 5>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2635
01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:57.130
<v Speaker 5>You know like the bottom of it has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2636
01:58:57.170 --> 01:58:58.003
<v Speaker 5>it's got like a little dividend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your fingers sit in there and you know </v>

2637
01:59:00.791 --> 01:59:03.670
<v Speaker 5>when you start moving your keys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the apple ones are really flat.</v>

2638
01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:04.953
<v Speaker 5>Flat on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2639
01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:07.000
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the things that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that much.</v>

2640
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:08.103
<v Speaker 5>What I like about this Lenovo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this thinkpad is that there's like a </v>

2641
01:59:10.991 --> 01:59:12.920
<v Speaker 5>contour,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a uh,</v>

2642
01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:17.170
<v Speaker 5>a pool in the middle of these keys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's,</v>

2643
01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:18.033
<v Speaker 5>there are lower in the middle and higher</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ends and your fingers float right </v>

2644
01:59:20.981 --> 01:59:24.130
<v Speaker 5>into that spot and they feel like it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>giving you feedback.</v>

2645
01:59:24.330 --> 01:59:25.163
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can even tell by this photo that </v>

2646
01:59:26.051 --> 01:59:27.130
<v Speaker 5>Jamie has a look.</v>

2647
01:59:27.130 --> 01:59:27.963
<v Speaker 5>There's barely any difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 5>non push button and a push button and </v>

2648
01:59:30.610 --> 01:59:33.550
<v Speaker 5>the kind of like depth there is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's barely anything I need more.</v>

2649
01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:34.310
<v Speaker 5>Me Too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2650
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:35.450
<v Speaker 5>like I need more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2651
01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:36.453
<v Speaker 5>they're trying too hard to be like slick</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking and futuristic and minimalistic </v>

2652
01:59:41.381 --> 01:59:45.010
<v Speaker 5>and the experience of using something is</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2653
01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:47.080
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a big issue with the car world,</v>

2654
01:59:47.081 --> 01:59:47.860
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2655
01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:48.693
<v Speaker 5>Because w with new cars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cars are becoming more and more numb to </v>

2656
01:59:52.331 --> 01:59:53.164
<v Speaker 5>the experience of driving like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>steering's now electric instead of </v>

2657
01:59:56.261 --> 01:59:59.210
<v Speaker 5>hydraulic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're,</v>

2658
01:59:59.211 --> 02:00:01.110
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're power steering feels weirder.</v>

2659
02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:03.100
<v Speaker 5>You don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't feel it all,</v>

2660
02:00:03.101 --> 02:00:04.840
<v Speaker 5>it feels very universal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No matter what you do,</v>

2661
02:00:04.841 --> 02:00:09.700
<v Speaker 5>it's easy to turn the wheel and then the</v>
<v Speaker 5>body doesn't give as much feedback.</v>

2662
02:00:09.701 --> 02:00:13.330
<v Speaker 5>The suspension is more improved because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it absorbs the ground better so it feels</v>

2663
02:00:13.331 --> 02:00:14.410
<v Speaker 5>kind of like you're floating.</v>

2664
02:00:14.770 --> 02:00:18.160
<v Speaker 5>You don't feel like when the tires are </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to break as much as you used to in</v>

2665
02:00:18.161 --> 02:00:19.810
<v Speaker 5>the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in the old days,</v>

2666
02:00:19.811 --> 02:00:23.050
<v Speaker 5>if you had an old car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you had like um,</v>

2667
02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:26.620
<v Speaker 5>like a old nine 11 like that's a perfect</v>
<v Speaker 5>example.</v>

2668
02:00:26.621 --> 02:00:31.420
<v Speaker 5>Like a Porsche nine 11 those cars were </v>
<v Speaker 5>super light and it didn't have that much</v>

2669
02:00:31.421 --> 02:00:32.890
<v Speaker 5>power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the things that people don't</v>

2670
02:00:32.891 --> 02:00:37.891
<v Speaker 5>realize like an old porsche has probably</v>
<v Speaker 5>less power for sure than your truck.</v>

2671
02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:42.300
<v Speaker 5>Like what do you think your truck has?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What kind of truck do you have that that</v>

2672
02:00:42.301 --> 02:00:46.210
<v Speaker 5>Ford Edge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a four by four v six yeah.</v>

2673
02:00:46.211 --> 02:00:51.160
<v Speaker 5>So your [inaudible] probably has like </v>
<v Speaker 5>260 horsepower and let me guess,</v>

2674
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:54.850
<v Speaker 5>pull,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pull up Ford edge horsepower,</v>

2675
02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:59.020
<v Speaker 5>2008 let's take a guess now thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about this.</v>

2676
02:00:59.021 --> 02:01:00.250
<v Speaker 5>This is a truck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2677
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:04.090
<v Speaker 5>It's a big ass truck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got a lot of body to it.</v>

2678
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:06.250
<v Speaker 5>They were go bangle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I nailed.</v>

2679
02:01:06.251 --> 02:01:07.084
<v Speaker 5>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2680
02:01:07.180 --> 02:01:08.013
<v Speaker 5>Now a porsche nine 11 from like 1973 I </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to say maybe as 140 or 150 </v>

2681
02:01:17.771 --> 02:01:20.290
<v Speaker 5>horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's find out.</v>

2682
02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:24.790
<v Speaker 5>Sutton nine 11 porsche nine 11 1973 </v>
<v Speaker 5>horsepower.</v>

2683
02:01:25.330 --> 02:01:26.950
<v Speaker 5>Not popping right up or would it be the </v>
<v Speaker 5>best place?</v>

2684
02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:28.013
<v Speaker 5>Just Google horsepower portion?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not In 1973 Porsche nine 11 stock </v>

2685
02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:37.100
<v Speaker 5>horsepower should have it on Wiki said </v>
<v Speaker 5>it increased from 190 to something.</v>

2686
02:01:37.961 --> 02:01:40.310
<v Speaker 5>Does that sound right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it was a turbo.</v>

2687
02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:42.950
<v Speaker 5>Do they have a turbine 73 I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 5>they did.</v>

2688
02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:44.450
<v Speaker 5>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

2689
02:01:45.190 --> 02:01:46.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2701
02:02:17.621 --> 02:02:18.454
<v Speaker 5>porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like a super sports car and at </v>

2712
02:02:43.841 --> 02:02:46.720
<v Speaker 5>electronic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I have a mechanical keyboard on my,</v>

2713
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:49.870
<v Speaker 5>on my home computer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a real clickety click,</v>

<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

2719
02:02:57.220 --> 02:02:59.770
<v Speaker 5>but I would use a pc for home computer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no problem.</v>

2720
02:02:59.771 --> 02:03:00.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2721
02:03:00.910 --> 02:03:02.290
<v Speaker 5>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I write,</v>

2722
02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:03.690
<v Speaker 5>I write on this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2723
02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:06.040
<v Speaker 5>and then also there's a program,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the big issues,</v>

2724
02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:09.460
<v Speaker 5>like I've talked about that right room </v>
<v Speaker 5>program that I use all the time.</v>

2725
02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:14.050
<v Speaker 5>There's one that they make this even </v>
<v Speaker 5>better for a windows,</v>

2726
02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:16.750
<v Speaker 5>it's called the focus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called focus.</v>

2727
02:03:16.751 --> 02:03:18.070
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or something like that.</v>

2728
02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:19.533
<v Speaker 5>Let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it called?</v>

2729
02:03:19.950 --> 02:03:23.170
<v Speaker 5>Career is race and Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

2730
02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:24.820
<v Speaker 5>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was named after a race.</v>

2731
02:03:26.290 --> 02:03:27.123
<v Speaker 10>The car was,</v>

2732
02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:31.560
<v Speaker 5>I've been looking at pcs just because I </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to get the one of the,</v>

2733
02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:34.390
<v Speaker 5>either the Oculus or the HTC vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2734
02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:36.960
<v Speaker 5>Focus writers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The name of this program that I use,</v>

2735
02:03:36.961 --> 02:03:38.290
<v Speaker 5>but it's the same thing as the right </v>
<v Speaker 5>room,</v>

2736
02:03:38.291 --> 02:03:41.500
<v Speaker 5>which just gives you that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah.</v>

2737
02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:44.070
<v Speaker 5>Green Font with a black background.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like dos.</v>

2738
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:47.040
<v Speaker 5>That to me is like the most important </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing about writing.</v>

2739
02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:49.260
<v Speaker 5>If I can get a program like that on my </v>
<v Speaker 5>computer,</v>

2740
02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:51.480
<v Speaker 5>what else does it need to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as it doesn't fuck me,</v>

2741
02:03:51.650 --> 02:03:52.483
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't let just crash all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And thinking about these think pants is </v>

2742
02:03:54.990 --> 02:03:55.823
<v Speaker 5>they use these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are military spec and they use </v>

2743
02:03:58.021 --> 02:04:01.260
<v Speaker 5>these in a lot of like big businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't want these things to fuck up.</v>

2744
02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:02.490
<v Speaker 5>So these are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are like a,</v>

2745
02:04:02.491 --> 02:04:05.910
<v Speaker 5>it's a very durable computer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so durable that a lot like a lot of</v>

2746
02:04:05.911 --> 02:04:06.501
<v Speaker 5>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't,</v>

2747
02:04:06.501 --> 02:04:07.334
<v Speaker 5>they don't even recommend wicked windows</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 they want windows seven it's like </v>

2748
02:04:10.590 --> 02:04:11.423
<v Speaker 5>they sell it with windows seven as an </v>
<v Speaker 5>option and I've seen windows seven it's </v>

2749
02:04:14.011 --> 02:04:15.720
<v Speaker 5>like Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean the nineties here?</v>

<v Speaker 5>stable.</v>

2752
02:04:19.501 --> 02:04:22.890
<v Speaker 5>Like it's been worked out and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't need Mac anymore.</v>

2753
02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:24.713
<v Speaker 5>It's nice that they innovate and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep coming up with cool shit and their </v>

2754
02:04:27.301 --> 02:04:31.890
<v Speaker 5>phones are still awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the experience on a windows computer</v>

2755
02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:36.050
<v Speaker 5>is in Miami is snuck not much different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It took me like how long Jamie?</v>

2758
02:04:38.821 --> 02:04:40.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't miss it at all.</v>

2759
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Is that a gaming at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can is,</v>

2760
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:45.540
<v Speaker 1>this is not the best one for gaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a work computer,</v>

2761
02:04:45.630 --> 02:04:50.220
<v Speaker 1>but the battery life is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it has a great dad.</v>

2762
02:04:50.270 --> 02:04:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like the laptop.</v>

2763
02:04:51.931 --> 02:04:52.764
<v Speaker 1>I sewed you when I lived in Ohio that I </v>

<v Speaker 1>but it gets 17 fucking hours.</v>

2767
02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:11.760
<v Speaker 1>17 hours of use online with no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with not being plugged in.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2780
02:05:41.921 --> 02:05:44.290
<v Speaker 6>I didn't get the best,</v>
<v Speaker 6>highest end thing you could get.</v>

<v Speaker 6>didn't.</v>

2784
02:05:52.450 --> 02:05:56.080
<v Speaker 6>The actual computer I found I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 6>get wasn't available at the store at the</v>

2785
02:05:56.081 --> 02:05:58.060
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was back ordered on different places.</v>

2786
02:05:58.061 --> 02:06:00.100
<v Speaker 6>I've found it somewhere in California.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could go get one.</v>

2787
02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:01.453
<v Speaker 6>I got at my hands that day cause I had </v>
<v Speaker 6>ordered a five and I didn't want it </v>

2788
02:06:03.161 --> 02:06:05.800

<v Speaker 6>couldn't use it.</v>

2789
02:06:05.801 --> 02:06:07.180
<v Speaker 6>So I went and got something I can play </v>
<v Speaker 6>with.</v>

2790
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I do almost nothing on this computer </v>

2801
02:06:35.230 --> 02:06:40.230

<v Speaker 1>less and less convenient and no options.</v>

2807
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:55.510

<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

2810
02:06:58.520 --> 02:06:59.950
<v Speaker 6>Had,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh my God.</v>

2811
02:06:59.980 --> 02:07:02.730
<v Speaker 6>What a special hotkeys set up to </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever you want them to be.</v>

2812
02:07:02.810 --> 02:07:07.180
<v Speaker 6>Some hot keys can be a male.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some hot keys could be youtube.</v>

2813
02:07:07.181 --> 02:07:09.250
<v Speaker 6>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's dope.</v>

2814
02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:12.040
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Blast off and it's super thin.</v>

2815
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:14.200
<v Speaker 6>Know how much do they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2816
02:07:14.230 --> 02:07:17.470
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just exactly echo this stealth.</v>

2817
02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:18.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure if this is actually this </v>
<v Speaker 6>stealth,</v>

2818
02:07:18.951 --> 02:07:21.220
<v Speaker 6>this with this keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might be a little more specked out,</v>

2819
02:07:21.221 --> 02:07:24.220
<v Speaker 6>but the tell starts like 1400 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which isn't very bad at all.</v>

2820
02:07:24.221 --> 02:07:26.500
<v Speaker 6>Especially if you went over on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>baddest ass games,</v>

2821
02:07:26.501 --> 02:07:27.334
<v Speaker 6>you can and it can run really bad ass </v>
<v Speaker 6>games and stuff on ultra settings with </v>

2822
02:07:30.731 --> 02:07:33.160
<v Speaker 6>these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is fantastic.</v>

2823
02:07:33.250 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 6>So that's the way more physical </v>
<v Speaker 6>capability than</v>

2824
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:39.760
<v Speaker 1>a Mac keyboard or a Mac laptop would </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather right now.</v>

2825
02:07:39.761 --> 02:07:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how big did they make them?</v>

2826
02:07:41.111 --> 02:07:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's another thing that annoyed </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2827
02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:44.700
<v Speaker 1>So when apple stopped doing the 17 inch </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2828
02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:49.800
<v Speaker 1>I know they make a 17 mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what APP would apple's done?</v>

2829
02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:52.921
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>

2830
02:07:52.921 --> 02:07:54.200
<v Speaker 1>see if they make a 17 inch one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2831
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:56.850
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2832
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:58.330
<v Speaker 1>17 inches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the size of that thing,</v>

2833
02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:00.873
<v Speaker 1>let me see a big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that fucking science and that </v>

2834
02:08:02.711 --> 02:08:04.360
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the blade pro.</v>

2835
02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:07.330
<v Speaker 1>The blade pros looks better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

2836
02:08:07.390 --> 02:08:07.991
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2837
02:08:07.991 --> 02:08:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure those are bad ass and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably better than this for,</v>

2838
02:08:10.901 --> 02:08:11.734
<v Speaker 1>I'm running games on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I wanted to run games I'd be all </v>

2839
02:08:14.771 --> 02:08:15.604
<v Speaker 1>over that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you don't want to get virtual </v>

2840
02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:18.093
<v Speaker 1>reality too busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That playstation virtual reality really </v>

2841
02:08:22.301 --> 02:08:24.160
<v Speaker 1>got me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a pool table game.</v>

2842
02:08:24.270 --> 02:08:26.470
<v Speaker 1>You can play pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have a pool table right out there.</v>

2843
02:08:27.450 --> 02:08:28.283
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's play.</v>

2844
02:08:28.810 --> 02:08:30.160
<v Speaker 1>But it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2845
02:08:30.190 --> 02:08:32.300
<v Speaker 1>it's got me addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm addicted to it now,</v>

2846
02:08:32.710 --> 02:08:36.700
<v Speaker 1>but I really want to play like the HTC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know which one to get though.</v>

2847
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Do the vive that Dunkin has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking insane.</v>

2848
02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:42.100
<v Speaker 1>And there's a boxing game that you play </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

2849
02:08:42.101 --> 02:08:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird because you too,</v>

2850
02:08:44.770 --> 02:08:46.900
<v Speaker 1>for the knuckles to come out like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they would,</v>

2851
02:08:46.901 --> 02:08:47.734
<v Speaker 1>if you're punching somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to hold your hand upright so </v>

2852
02:08:50.231 --> 02:08:53.860
<v Speaker 1>that the bottom of your hand is facing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground and your thumb is facing up.</v>

2853
02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:56.410
<v Speaker 1>So that's the only way you get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves to look right.</v>

2854
02:08:56.770 --> 02:08:59.590
<v Speaker 1>So it feels weird because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>punching them like this Kinda,</v>

2855
02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:00.473
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not turning your knuckles </v>

2856
02:09:01.271 --> 02:09:02.920
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just in your head.</v>

2857
02:09:03.070 --> 02:09:03.903
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could get over the fact that the </v>

2858
02:09:04.901 --> 02:09:05.734
<v Speaker 1>knuckles look different on screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just turn your hands in and </v>

2859
02:09:08.381 --> 02:09:11.350
<v Speaker 1>punch like you normally would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get a workout doing it,</v>

2860
02:09:11.351 --> 02:09:12.760
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a real workout.</v>

2861
02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're boxing against the dude.</v>

2862
02:09:14.621 --> 02:09:16.430
<v Speaker 1>You're moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's throwing punches at you.</v>

2863
02:09:16.431 --> 02:09:17.264
<v Speaker 1>You're just trying to get out of the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he hits you like everything lights </v>

2864
02:09:19.451 --> 02:09:20.231
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets white.</v>

2865
02:09:20.231 --> 02:09:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Like you just get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2866
02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:23.253
<v Speaker 1>I want to do it</v>

2867
02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:25.730
<v Speaker 6>can get all the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure of this too.</v>

2868
02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:27.800
<v Speaker 6>You can get all the oculus games on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>vive.</v>

2869
02:09:27.890 --> 02:09:29.400
<v Speaker 6>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can do it the other way around.</v>

2870
02:09:30.370 --> 02:09:34.580
<v Speaker 6>Does a program something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>does it the vibe have more cameras?</v>

2871
02:09:34.581 --> 02:09:36.050
<v Speaker 6>So it has,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh the larger,</v>

2872
02:09:36.110 --> 02:09:38.240
<v Speaker 6>it uses something called room scale.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's two,</v>

2873
02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:40.760
<v Speaker 6>you can buy more if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure really why he would want to</v>

2874
02:09:40.761 --> 02:09:43.140
<v Speaker 6>buy more yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it comes with two uh,</v>

2875
02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:44.690
<v Speaker 6>lighthouses,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what they're called.</v>

2876
02:09:44.691 --> 02:09:45.524
<v Speaker 6>You play six and a half feet off the </v>
<v Speaker 6>ground and they figure out like where </v>

2877
02:09:49.101 --> 02:09:50.900
<v Speaker 6>you are and track,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you track the headset,</v>

2878
02:09:50.901 --> 02:09:53.110
<v Speaker 6>check your hands in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they always kind of know what's right</v>

2879
02:09:53.111 --> 02:09:53.751
<v Speaker 6>low,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's left.</v>

2880
02:09:53.751 --> 02:09:55.690
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to keep switching your </v>
<v Speaker 6>hands around.</v>

2881
02:09:55.950 --> 02:09:56.783
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another game that Duncan had </v>

2882
02:09:57.931 --> 02:10:00.390
<v Speaker 1>that's an archery game that's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

2883
02:10:00.910 --> 02:10:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you draw back and they're,</v>

2884
02:10:02.851 --> 02:10:04.580
<v Speaker 1>they're raiding the castle and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2885
02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:05.910
<v Speaker 1>they're coming out and you need to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>at him.</v>

2886
02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:09.320
<v Speaker 1>They're like circles with like shields </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of them and spears on go.</v>

2887
02:10:09.321 --> 02:10:10.154
<v Speaker 1>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you say you did that with Dunkin </v>

2888
02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:13.321
<v Speaker 1>timber?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe?</v>

2889
02:10:13.321 --> 02:10:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably around then.</v>

2890
02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:17.310
<v Speaker 6>Just in that amount of time from now til</v>
<v Speaker 6>then.</v>

2891
02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:21.300
<v Speaker 6>There's three cooler archery games that </v>
<v Speaker 6>have come out.</v>

2892
02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:22.553
<v Speaker 6>There's like a hunting experience game </v>
<v Speaker 6>where you're like walking around the </v>

2893
02:10:24.301 --> 02:10:24.850
<v Speaker 6>woods.</v>

2894
02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:25.683
<v Speaker 1>You know what I would really like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would really like if they made one </v>

2895
02:10:29.051 --> 02:10:31.900
<v Speaker 1>where I can use my real bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh that'd be cool.</v>

2896
02:10:32.070 --> 02:10:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Cause if I could use my real bow and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could draw it back,</v>

2897
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:36.470
<v Speaker 1>it would have to be in some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>secured room.</v>

2898
02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:38.880
<v Speaker 1>You take off the headset and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of dead people everywhere.</v>

2899
02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:40.933
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would actually help you because </v>

2900
02:10:42.991 --> 02:10:44.660
<v Speaker 1>of the weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight of the bow.</v>

2901
02:10:44.690 --> 02:10:48.350
<v Speaker 1>You want to feel the exact weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest issue right now with that is</v>

2902
02:10:48.351 --> 02:10:50.480
<v Speaker 1>that that headset gets in the way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying,</v>

2903
02:10:50.481 --> 02:10:52.840
<v Speaker 1>like you draw the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put next to your head that yeah,</v>

2904
02:10:53.010 --> 02:10:55.430
<v Speaker 1>it would hit your thing because as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it now,</v>

2905
02:10:55.431 --> 02:10:58.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm just pulling it back like this on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dunkin's,</v>

2906
02:10:58.310 --> 02:11:00.950
<v Speaker 1>but I know there's a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look this up.</v>

2907
02:11:01.190 --> 02:11:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this will be a new thing for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2908
02:11:02.690 --> 02:11:03.523
<v Speaker 1>the new studio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an archery game where you </v>

2909
02:11:05.931 --> 02:11:06.764
<v Speaker 1>actually shoot at a screen and animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk in front and you shoot a real bow </v>

2910
02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:16.360
<v Speaker 1>at the screen and where it hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lights up like yes you are.</v>

2911
02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:17.773
<v Speaker 1>Oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're shooting a real fucking Arrow at </v>

2912
02:11:19.971 --> 02:11:22.190
<v Speaker 1>a real screen down with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2913
02:11:22.410 --> 02:11:25.400
<v Speaker 1>like we'll get this real tree whitetail </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

2914
02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2915
02:11:27.321 --> 02:11:28.154
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2916
02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Techno Hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2917
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:35.050
<v Speaker 1>so watch this guys got a video and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing in front of the screen.</v>

2918
02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:38.690
<v Speaker 1>He's going to shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2919
02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:39.441
<v Speaker 1>Can we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2920
02:11:39.441 --> 02:11:40.274
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like it's about 40 yards </v>

2921
02:11:41.811 --> 02:11:43.370
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even,</v>

2922
02:11:43.610 --> 02:11:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I should say 40 feet away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch.</v>

2923
02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:48.970
<v Speaker 1>This is going to shoot at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect shot right there.</v>

2924
02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:50.973
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would shoot through your screen </v>

2925
02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:54.470
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

2926
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:55.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what he just did.</v>

2927
02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:58.670
<v Speaker 1>He that that stuck into the screen now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a,</v>

2928
02:11:58.671 --> 02:12:00.320
<v Speaker 1>that was a picture of an era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is it?</v>

2929
02:12:00.321 --> 02:12:02.540
<v Speaker 1>A fake error right away you see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrow bounce off?</v>

2930
02:12:02.541 --> 02:12:03.374
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me say it.</v>

2931
02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Let me just do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it again.</v>

2932
02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:06.650
<v Speaker 1>It's just like from 1982 I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2933
02:12:06.651 --> 02:12:07.460
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2934
02:12:07.460 --> 02:12:08.293
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he hit it and it shows where you hit </v>

2935
02:12:12.170 --> 02:12:14.960
<v Speaker 1>a big fake arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fake cow.</v>

2936
02:12:14.961 --> 02:12:18.470
<v Speaker 1>But he actually did hit it where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fake Arrow points to pick out.</v>

2937
02:12:18.510 --> 02:12:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Just indicating what spot on the screen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's out hit the wall to,</v>

2938
02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:22.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2939
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I hear it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just slip one in there.</v>

2940
02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:27.320
<v Speaker 1>But you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're super powerful.</v>

2941
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Bo would shoot some shit through a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2942
02:12:29.631 --> 02:12:30.464
<v Speaker 1>You would want to use a less powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you actually have to like Cam </v>

2943
02:12:33.110 --> 02:12:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Haynes was playing this game and he told</v>
<v Speaker 1>me they had a de tune,</v>

2944
02:12:35.571 --> 02:12:40.190
<v Speaker 1>his bow and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at the time he was shooting with</v>

2945
02:12:40.191 --> 02:12:41.660
<v Speaker 1>a 70 pound bow.</v>

2946
02:12:42.110 --> 02:12:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he was shooting with a carbon </v>
<v Speaker 1>spider turbo,</v>

2947
02:12:45.171 --> 02:12:47.450
<v Speaker 1>but I might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the carbon spider turbo,</v>

2948
02:12:47.451 --> 02:12:49.880
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't make that any faster than 70</v>

2949
02:12:49.881 --> 02:12:53.900
<v Speaker 1>pounds or any more weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably a feet per second.</v>

2950
02:12:54.110 --> 02:12:55.790
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinetic energy thing,</v>

2951
02:12:55.791 --> 02:12:58.130
<v Speaker 1>like the hour we'll probably has to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain weight too,</v>

2952
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:59.143
<v Speaker 1>but it would just be more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or what'd you actually getting benefit </v>

2953
02:13:01.221 --> 02:13:04.820
<v Speaker 1>out of practicing with something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>less powerful than what you usually use?</v>

2954
02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:06.073
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a different feel to a less </v>

2955
02:13:07.401 --> 02:13:08.234
<v Speaker 1>powerful bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the principles of archery or the </v>

2956
02:13:10.161 --> 02:13:13.940
<v Speaker 1>same as long as you hold right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled through the shot,</v>

2957
02:13:14.330 --> 02:13:18.140
<v Speaker 1>anchor in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use the correct body positioning.</v>

2958
02:13:18.370 --> 02:13:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do archery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2959
02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Archery is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love doing it.</v>

2960
02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:24.350
<v Speaker 1>It's so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2961
02:13:24.351 --> 02:13:26.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't for my friend Cameron Hanes</v>

2962
02:13:26.661 --> 02:13:29.450
<v Speaker 1>and my friend John Dudley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know shit about it.</v>

2963
02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:31.890
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2964
02:13:31.891 --> 02:13:34.890
<v Speaker 1>This is a different one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy is doing it here.</v>

2965
02:13:34.891 --> 02:13:35.910
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2966
02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:38.970
<v Speaker 1>that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see that again.</v>

2967
02:13:39.390 --> 02:13:40.223
<v Speaker 1>Backed that up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he shoots and where does his Arrow </v>

2968
02:13:42.841 --> 02:13:44.550
<v Speaker 1>go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it does bounce off the wall.</v>

2969
02:13:44.610 --> 02:13:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you have to use a bitch ass bro.</v>

2970
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:49.800
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just kind of a rubber point at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end.</v>

2971
02:13:50.250 --> 02:13:52.250
<v Speaker 1>They can make better wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2972
02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Well it's good practice for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2973
02:13:54.691 --> 02:13:56.730
<v Speaker 1>see like he's hitting perfect every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2974
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:59.910
<v Speaker 1>So it's good practice for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for aiming the vitals and all that.</v>

2975
02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2976
02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:03.810
<v Speaker 1>But it can't be more than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like 20,</v>

2977
02:14:03.811 --> 02:14:06.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 yards away.</v>

2978
02:14:06.271 --> 02:14:08.400
<v Speaker 1>It looks like big bucks on game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2979
02:14:08.401 --> 02:14:10.050
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting any hunting value out</v>

2980
02:14:10.051 --> 02:14:11.420
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just no shoot,</v>

2981
02:14:11.430 --> 02:14:12.810
<v Speaker 1>fix shit with a fictional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is,</v>

2982
02:14:12.811 --> 02:14:14.310
<v Speaker 1>they're shooting a real bow.</v>

2983
02:14:14.430 --> 02:14:15.263
<v Speaker 1>So to answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between shooting like a </v>

2984
02:14:17.731 --> 02:14:18.564
<v Speaker 1>50 pound bow with these light arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it bounced off the screaming like what </v>

2985
02:14:21.691 --> 02:14:23.790
<v Speaker 1>benefit you would get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd get a lot of benefit.</v>

2986
02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't need a big heavy bow to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the benefit of being accurate.</v>

2987
02:14:29.281 --> 02:14:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Like people are accurate with like </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2988
02:14:30.751 --> 02:14:34.530
<v Speaker 1>really light bows and that's really all </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd worry about as long as you had the</v>

2989
02:14:34.531 --> 02:14:35.364
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how rude they gonna shoot a rabbit as </v>

2990
02:14:37.141 --> 02:14:38.930
<v Speaker 1>long as you have the strap right in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyeball.</v>

2991
02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Bullseye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2992
02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:41.573
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is the name of this company that's </v>

2993
02:14:44.041 --> 02:14:46.350
<v Speaker 1>rude and shot it in the eyeball and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>says Bullseye.</v>

2994
02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I could design a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of that.</v>

2995
02:14:48.930 --> 02:14:49.763
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably super hard to make </v>

2996
02:14:50.731 --> 02:14:51.564
<v Speaker 1>something where you can actually shoot </v>
<v Speaker 1>something on a screen and it registers </v>

2997
02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:57.930
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like find out.</v>

2998
02:14:58.020 --> 02:14:58.853
<v Speaker 1>I bet that's expensive as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably same technology that </v>

2999
02:15:00.721 --> 02:15:02.890
<v Speaker 1>does the golf course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3000
02:15:02.910 --> 02:15:03.743
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the difference in the golf thing is </v>

3001
02:15:04.711 --> 02:15:07.620
<v Speaker 1>a golf is a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're knocking it into a screen.</v>

3002
02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Fastest Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as fast as a bow,</v>

3003
02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:13.080
<v Speaker 1>but you could probably have something </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's just going in a different way</v>

3004
02:15:13.081 --> 02:15:13.914
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a point in the end of a bow or </v>

3005
02:15:15.421 --> 02:15:16.560
<v Speaker 1>an arrow rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3006
02:15:17.250 --> 02:15:19.140
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A golf club,</v>

3007
02:15:19.141 --> 02:15:19.974
<v Speaker 1>when you hit a golf ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it does go faster if you really </v>

3008
02:15:22.831 --> 02:15:25.020
<v Speaker 1>drive it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>

3009
02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:26.033
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many feet per second do you think </v>

3010
02:15:26.671 --> 02:15:29.250
<v Speaker 1>someone drives a golf ball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feet per second.</v>

3011
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3012
02:15:30.090 --> 02:15:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Jeez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many feet per second is tiger woods?</v>

3013
02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:34.201
<v Speaker 1>Knock a golf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3014
02:15:34.201 --> 02:15:34.910
<v Speaker 1>John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

3015
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Who Hits it harder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Daly.</v>

3016
02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:38.070
<v Speaker 1>John Daly hit it harder than tiger </v>
<v Speaker 1>woods.</v>

3017
02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:40.230
<v Speaker 1>You See Tigers Nipples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his nipples.</v>

3018
02:15:40.290 --> 02:15:42.150

<v Speaker 1>You see at Jamie,</v>

3019
02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:43.613
<v Speaker 1>he released a naked or not ne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shirtless photo and his nipples had </v>

3020
02:15:46.441 --> 02:15:49.130
<v Speaker 1>been the talk of the town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got nipple.</v>

3021
02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:53.010
<v Speaker 1>It's time to move to a new town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You live in the wrong fucking town.</v>

3022
02:15:53.011 --> 02:15:54.400
<v Speaker 1>If all they're talking about is tiger </v>
<v Speaker 1>woods,</v>

3023
02:15:54.450 --> 02:15:55.283
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3024
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:59.760
<v Speaker 1>open up man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard about tiger samples?</v>

3025
02:16:00.630 --> 02:16:02.700
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at what's going on with his goatee?</v>

3026
02:16:02.701 --> 02:16:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something somebody said he does for</v>

3027
02:16:04.411 --> 02:16:07.180
<v Speaker 1>his kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like bad ass answer some shots.</v>

3028
02:16:07.890 --> 02:16:08.723
<v Speaker 1>It's a loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was Brendan Schaub I would say for </v>

3029
02:16:11.251 --> 02:16:14.350
<v Speaker 1>sure don't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3030
02:16:15.570 --> 02:16:16.403
<v Speaker 1>what is the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet per second of the golf ball </v>

3031
02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:21.390
<v Speaker 1>hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to take me on a nipple detour.</v>

3032
02:16:21.391 --> 02:16:22.224
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many feet per second does a golf </v>

3033
02:16:25.381 --> 02:16:28.020
<v Speaker 1>ball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 travel 150.</v>

3034
02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:30.970
<v Speaker 1>How many per second does a golf ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel?</v>

3035
02:16:33.130 --> 02:16:33.963
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

3036
02:16:34.460 --> 02:16:34.730
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3037
02:16:34.730 --> 02:16:37.940
<v Speaker 1>You say 5,950</v>
<v Speaker 1>150 probably more than that.</v>

3038
02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:41.180
<v Speaker 1>That's probably about as fast as a bow </v>
<v Speaker 1>and arrow.</v>

3039
02:16:41.450 --> 02:16:43.030
<v Speaker 1>250 feet per second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3040
02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:45.890
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terminal speed for a,</v>

3041
02:16:45.891 --> 02:16:46.960
<v Speaker 1>an arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3042
02:16:47.130 --> 02:16:47.963
<v Speaker 1>like that's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rule is that you can't hit a ball </v>

3043
02:16:49.491 --> 02:16:51.170
<v Speaker 1>faster than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Oh,</v>

3044
02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Sga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3045
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:55.010
<v Speaker 1>You can tell someone they can't hit it </v>
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>

3046
02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Maximum tolerance of 2% will be allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3047
02:16:58.850 --> 02:17:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't get like a what if you get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude who's like,</v>

3048
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:02.540
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about this?</v>

3049
02:17:02.630 --> 02:17:07.550
<v Speaker 1>What if like coby bryant goes into golf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like think a super athlete,</v>

3050
02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:10.340
<v Speaker 1>driving a golf ball perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like,</v>

3051
02:17:10.341 --> 02:17:13.340
<v Speaker 1>so a hundred you can calculate with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>swing and the,</v>

3052
02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:16.910
<v Speaker 1>the weight and the speed of your driver </v>
<v Speaker 1>clubface and all that.</v>

3053
02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then balls way different amounts to,</v>

3054
02:17:19.350 --> 02:17:20.183
<v Speaker 1>it's maybe because there's people </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing around and you could fuck </v>

3055
02:17:21.891 --> 02:17:23.960
<v Speaker 1>somebody up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking a mock no matter what,</v>

3056
02:17:23.961 --> 02:17:24.794
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hit him 200 miles an hour in the </v>

3057
02:17:25.611 --> 02:17:26.870
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking a month.</v>

3058
02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:28.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

3059
02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:29.853
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 72 is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but imagine if you did have a guy like </v>

3060
02:17:32.841 --> 02:17:35.930
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Koby Bryant or like our Lebron James.</v>

3061
02:17:35.931 --> 02:17:36.764
<v Speaker 1>It gets an a cough like Leblanc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lebron James gets a cough and it can </v>

3062
02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:42.530
<v Speaker 1>knock a fucking golf ball to the moon.</v>

3063
02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:45.153
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about the same speed an arrow </v>

3064
02:17:46.211 --> 02:17:48.440
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a good heavy air,</v>

3065
02:17:48.441 --> 02:17:52.630
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of people like to try to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>their arrows actually under 280 feet per</v>

3066
02:17:52.631 --> 02:17:53.464
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pursue between 280 and some people </v>

3067
02:17:55.271 --> 02:17:56.104
<v Speaker 1>get up to like two 90 ish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they feel like when the arrows go </v>

3068
02:17:58.931 --> 02:18:00.850
<v Speaker 1>faster than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually,</v>

3069
02:18:00.851 --> 02:18:04.090
<v Speaker 1>the flight gets compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's so much.</v>

3070
02:18:04.330 --> 02:18:05.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's almost like too much </v>

3071
02:18:06.521 --> 02:18:08.740
<v Speaker 1>wind resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too much a,</v>

3072
02:18:08.741 --> 02:18:12.880
<v Speaker 1>there's like the wind impacts the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing spins.</v>

3073
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.863
<v Speaker 1>What does this long drives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's guy hitting about 200 mile an </v>

3074
02:18:16.691 --> 02:18:17.680
<v Speaker 1>hour ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3075
02:18:17.681 --> 02:18:20.430
<v Speaker 1>but what does that in feet per second?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

3076
02:18:20.460 --> 02:18:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Cause just google t 206 miles an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>equals feet per second.</v>

3077
02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Find out what the fuck that means in </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet per second.</v>

3078
02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:32.373
<v Speaker 1>We think it is 302 okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's about what you would expect </v>

3079
02:18:36.550 --> 02:18:40.720
<v Speaker 1>from like a top and bow with a fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>light arrow.</v>

3080
02:18:40.750 --> 02:18:41.583
<v Speaker 1>But like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people try to keep their Arrow's a </v>

3081
02:18:43.781 --> 02:18:45.760
<v Speaker 1>little slower than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not.</v>

3082
02:18:45.761 --> 02:18:47.650
<v Speaker 1>So what they would do is they'd make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavier arrow.</v>

3083
02:18:47.651 --> 02:18:48.484
<v Speaker 1>So like if you had a 400 green Arrow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were coming in at 302 feet per </v>

3084
02:18:51.851 --> 02:18:52.684
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people would tell you you </v>

3085
02:18:54.461 --> 02:18:55.294
<v Speaker 1>probably better off with a 450 green </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arrow that comes in around to 70 </v>

3086
02:18:59.651 --> 02:19:00.970
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3087
02:19:00.971 --> 02:19:03.220
<v Speaker 1>to 70 to 80 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want more control?</v>

3088
02:19:03.430 --> 02:19:06.190
<v Speaker 1>It's more forgiving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also it has more impact,</v>

3089
02:19:06.220 --> 02:19:10.120
<v Speaker 1>like a light Arrow going really fast as </v>
<v Speaker 1>undo the damage that a heavy Arrow going</v>

3090
02:19:10.121 --> 02:19:10.954
<v Speaker 1>fast does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I same difference in golf than so </v>

3091
02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:14.740
<v Speaker 1>they get more control over their boss so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can sell.</v>

3092
02:19:14.980 --> 02:19:17.620
<v Speaker 1>So it lands somewhere they want it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>land as opposed to just go on.</v>

3093
02:19:17.740 --> 02:19:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3094
02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:21.550
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing with pool to the break </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot and pool.</v>

3095
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:22.743
<v Speaker 1>Like there's arguments that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a guy named Shane van </v>

3096
02:19:24.671 --> 02:19:28.340
<v Speaker 1>boning who's probably one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakers in the history of pool.</v>

3097
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:29.323
<v Speaker 5>He breaks so good but he doesn't put </v>
<v Speaker 5>near the effort into it that all these </v>

3098
02:19:32.421 --> 02:19:34.790
<v Speaker 5>other guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some other guys throw their body into it</v>

3099
02:19:34.791 --> 02:19:35.624
<v Speaker 5>like karate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they're fucking trying to kick </v>

3100
02:19:36.981 --> 02:19:40.340
<v Speaker 5>through a wall and [inaudible] and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have this crazy impact on the balls.</v>

3101
02:19:40.730 --> 02:19:41.563
<v Speaker 5>But Shane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what he does is he stays flat on the </v>

3102
02:19:43.731 --> 02:19:46.700
<v Speaker 5>ball and he just strokes through it </v>
<v Speaker 5>perfectly.</v>

3103
02:19:46.701 --> 02:19:49.300
<v Speaker 5>So the ball is almost never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3104
02:19:49.430 --> 02:19:52.070
<v Speaker 5>in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem with hitting pool ball,</v>

3105
02:19:52.730 --> 02:19:56.420
<v Speaker 5>like this guy is ridiculous break shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't tell from that picture,</v>

3106
02:19:56.450 --> 02:19:58.820
<v Speaker 5>but I've seen him do it live a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>times of,</v>

3107
02:19:58.821 --> 02:20:01.910
<v Speaker 5>of actually watched him play in person </v>
<v Speaker 5>several times.</v>

3108
02:20:01.911 --> 02:20:02.744
<v Speaker 5>He's fucking amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he doesn't hit it as hard as other </v>

3109
02:20:05.241 --> 02:20:07.280
<v Speaker 5>guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just hits it more perfect.</v>

3110
02:20:07.281 --> 02:20:09.980
<v Speaker 5>When you look at like high speed </v>
<v Speaker 5>photography of a pool cue,</v>

3111
02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:13.730
<v Speaker 5>when a guy hits it really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ball is actually in the air,</v>

3112
02:20:14.330 --> 02:20:15.920
<v Speaker 5>like when it's in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it impacts,</v>

3113
02:20:16.460 --> 02:20:18.050
<v Speaker 5>like see how it hops like that too.</v>

3114
02:20:18.050 --> 02:20:18.883
<v Speaker 5>That's also just from the force of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But look at all these balls fucking </v>

3115
02:20:20.721 --> 02:20:23.060
<v Speaker 5>flying all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

3116
02:20:23.061 --> 02:20:25.010
<v Speaker 5>Like he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a freak in that regard,</v>

3117
02:20:25.011 --> 02:20:28.160
<v Speaker 5>but it's just perfect accuracy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>precision.</v>

3118
02:20:28.161 --> 02:20:28.994
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a matter of like the perfect </v>

3119
02:20:30.231 --> 02:20:31.064
<v Speaker 5>mechanics and the like this loose like </v>
<v Speaker 5>fluid motion fluid and efficient motion </v>

3120
02:20:36.940 --> 02:20:39.020
<v Speaker 5>and that's what they say is the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing as about golf.</v>

3121
02:20:39.390 --> 02:20:42.470
<v Speaker 5>That driving and the ball that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>about muscling it right.</v>

3122
02:20:42.471 --> 02:20:44.410
<v Speaker 5>It's about like driving through it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3123
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:47.450
<v Speaker 5>Like when I play pool and I'm playing </v>
<v Speaker 5>good,</v>

3124
02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:48.343
<v Speaker 5>like I'm never really good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when I'm better what happens is I </v>

3125
02:20:52.071 --> 02:20:55.490
<v Speaker 5>get to a point where I'm just like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the q's doing all the work.</v>

3126
02:20:55.730 --> 02:20:59.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm just like letting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like moving into the spot and I just</v>

3127
02:20:59.421 --> 02:21:00.254
<v Speaker 5>like let it just sorta like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't ever tighten my hand up on it </v>

3128
02:21:03.231 --> 02:21:05.510
<v Speaker 5>and I don't punch it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just flows.</v>

3129
02:21:05.511 --> 02:21:07.490
<v Speaker 5>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy.</v>

3130
02:21:07.491 --> 02:21:10.070
<v Speaker 5>Like you see the ball moving way more </v>
<v Speaker 5>than it normally does.</v>

3131
02:21:10.250 --> 02:21:11.083
<v Speaker 5>It's weird and it's just like this fluid</v>
<v Speaker 5>and efficient impact that it has with </v>

3132
02:21:15.891 --> 02:21:16.724
<v Speaker 5>the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I guess that's the same with golf </v>

3133
02:21:18.021 --> 02:21:19.550
<v Speaker 5>and with probably with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3134
02:21:21.790 --> 02:21:23.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about everything but golf </v>
<v Speaker 5>is definitely that you need,</v>

3135
02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:25.670
<v Speaker 5>it's like don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't grip and rip.</v>

3136
02:21:25.730 --> 02:21:27.650
<v Speaker 5>Somebody will say grip and rip it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's how they do it.</v>

3137
02:21:27.651 --> 02:21:29.570
<v Speaker 5>But like you shouldn't be swinging like </v>
<v Speaker 5>a baseball bat,</v>

3138
02:21:29.571 --> 02:21:32.150
<v Speaker 5>like swinging for home runs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to succeed necessarily.</v>

3139
02:21:32.151 --> 02:21:32.984
<v Speaker 5>That's the same as fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But in finding the other way works to </v>

3140
02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:37.100
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

3141
02:21:37.101 --> 02:21:40.040
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's no hard fast rule.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like someone can come down,</v>

3142
02:21:40.041 --> 02:21:40.874
<v Speaker 5>bite down their mouthpiece and real </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking haymakers and catch you in the </v>

3143
02:21:43.401 --> 02:21:46.010
<v Speaker 5>Chin and knock you out cold or someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>can.</v>

3144
02:21:46.011 --> 02:21:46.844
<v Speaker 5>Conor mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you like the way conor Mcgregor Aldo </v>

3145
02:21:48.891 --> 02:21:53.270
<v Speaker 5>mode when he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he knocked out Aldo with one punch,</v>

3146
02:21:53.271 --> 02:21:55.910
<v Speaker 5>13 seconds into the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way he did it was just precision.</v>

3147
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.983
<v Speaker 5>He just slid back on a back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just dropped it in there and all those </v>

3148
02:21:59.721 --> 02:22:02.450
<v Speaker 5>face went squirrely and his brain went </v>
<v Speaker 5>off.</v>

3149
02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:07.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's like the perfect example </v>
<v Speaker 5>of precision versus power cause with,</v>

3150
02:22:08.210 --> 02:22:10.400
<v Speaker 5>although does he bites down on his </v>
<v Speaker 5>mouthpiece,</v>

3151
02:22:10.401 --> 02:22:12.320
<v Speaker 5>any wings is vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Left Hook.</v>

3152
02:22:12.740 --> 02:22:13.573
<v Speaker 5>He throws us right hand like this and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>throws his vicious left hook behind it </v>

3153
02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:18.920
<v Speaker 5>and it's all to try to set up the left </v>
<v Speaker 5>Tuck.</v>

3154
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:24.070
<v Speaker 5>Connor slides out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drops his left hand in on Aldo while all</v>

3155
02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:28.170
<v Speaker 5>those throw in the left hook and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>left hook kinda makes impact on Connor's</v>

3156
02:22:28.171 --> 02:22:29.004
<v Speaker 5>face but probably didn't have much more </v>
<v Speaker 5>than momentum behind it because all it </v>

3157
02:22:32.921 --> 02:22:35.370
<v Speaker 5>was already out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the punch was perfect.</v>

3158
02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:40.370
<v Speaker 5>That's got to haunt you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the way he did it,</v>

3159
02:22:40.371 --> 02:22:42.860
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just all precision like watch.</v>

3160
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:44.130
<v Speaker 5>We'll play it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>play it back again.</v>

3161
02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:45.530
<v Speaker 5>Watch this now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll play it from the beginning.</v>

3162
02:22:45.531 --> 02:22:46.221
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch it.</v>

3163
02:22:46.221 --> 02:22:48.350
<v Speaker 5>Slide blank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

3164
02:22:48.351 --> 02:22:49.184
<v Speaker 5>he got tagged like right on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cheekbone and that could have been a </v>

3165
02:22:51.531 --> 02:22:52.364
<v Speaker 5>double knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if he got tagged on the Chin on </v>

3166
02:22:54.621 --> 02:22:57.800
<v Speaker 5>the point of the chin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy is a savage.</v>

3167
02:22:58.280 --> 02:23:00.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm so glad people like conor mcgregor </v>
<v Speaker 5>exists.</v>

3168
02:23:00.321 --> 02:23:01.790
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>

3169
02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:04.370
<v Speaker 5>Just flattened him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One shot.</v>

3170
02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:06.350
<v Speaker 5>Blam Bam.</v>

3171
02:23:08.050 --> 02:23:11.380
<v Speaker 5>That's some strong mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Power their baby.</v>

3172
02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:12.513
<v Speaker 5>To be able to stay that calm in the heat</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a firefight and just slide out and </v>

3173
02:23:15.971 --> 02:23:17.980
<v Speaker 5>just precision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Drop a punch in a box.</v>

3174
02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:20.413
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

3175
02:23:22.010 --> 02:23:22.691
<v Speaker 5>Foamy Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3176
02:23:22.691 --> 02:23:23.720

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3177
02:23:23.800 --> 02:23:26.620
<v Speaker 5>guys gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened to you either?</v>

3178
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:28.270
<v Speaker 5>You know I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm on tod.</v>

3179
02:23:28.420 --> 02:23:29.253
<v Speaker 5>TMD.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So at the snapchat talking about conor </v>

3180
02:23:31.630 --> 02:23:32.463
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] you don't have character,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that the comparisons to snatch to </v>

3181
02:23:35.860 --> 02:23:37.310
<v Speaker 5>connor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the character of that,</v>

3182
02:23:37.311 --> 02:23:38.360
<v Speaker 5>whatever Brad Pitt was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3183
02:23:38.361 --> 02:23:40.370
<v Speaker 5>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy couldn't talk.</v>

3184
02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:43.070
<v Speaker 5>That's the character.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking terrible.</v>

3185
02:23:43.170 --> 02:23:44.990
<v Speaker 5>Who compared them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see stuff online.</v>

3186
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:47.840
<v Speaker 5>People are so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people should.</v>

3187
02:23:47.990 --> 02:23:50.390
<v Speaker 5>You should have a license to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh it's the worst.</v>

3188
02:23:50.391 --> 02:23:52.880
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to go through in order to use</v>

3189
02:23:52.881 --> 02:23:55.580
<v Speaker 5>social media you should have to like go </v>
<v Speaker 5>through an extensive test.</v>

3190
02:23:55.970 --> 02:23:56.803
<v Speaker 5>You're like people are so addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter and instagram and all that </v>

3191
02:23:58.881 --> 02:23:59.714
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should go through an extensive like </v>

3192
02:24:01.341 --> 02:24:02.750
<v Speaker 5>spelling tests.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should.</v>

3193
02:24:02.930 --> 02:24:03.763
<v Speaker 5>Well how do you say you are?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you say while you are or did you say </v>

3194

<v Speaker 5>Remember when he used to do it long time</v>

3197
02:24:18.081 --> 02:24:21.080
<v Speaker 5>ago he was going hard with the texting </v>
<v Speaker 5>early on.</v>

3198
02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:24.140
<v Speaker 5>A lot girls do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Getting rid of comment sections.</v>

3199
02:24:24.450 --> 02:24:28.150
<v Speaker 5>What like that for places for people to </v>
<v Speaker 5>comment way?</v>

3200
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:29.463
<v Speaker 5>Well like vice is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not a bad idea in some serve </v>

3201
02:24:32.690 --> 02:24:33.523
<v Speaker 5>certain circles cause some things it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting like I love reading science </v>

3202
02:24:37.341 --> 02:24:39.650
<v Speaker 5>articles where people start debating </v>
<v Speaker 5>like uh,</v>

3203
02:24:39.700 --> 02:24:42.110
<v Speaker 5>the legitimacy at certain points or you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3204
02:24:42.111 --> 02:24:44.240
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the options for considering the</v>

3205
02:24:44.241 --> 02:24:46.010
<v Speaker 5>evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there anything else that made,</v>

3206
02:24:46.340 --> 02:24:47.173
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's being overlooked and you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>some really interesting responses from </v>

3207
02:24:49.821 --> 02:24:51.290
<v Speaker 5>people that actually understand the </v>
<v Speaker 5>subject.</v>

3208
02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:52.783
<v Speaker 5>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as soon as it says anything to do with </v>

3209
02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:58.730
<v Speaker 5>politics or gender,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those two fucking things,</v>

3210
02:24:58.731 --> 02:25:00.500
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those two things,</v>

3211
02:25:00.770 --> 02:25:04.550
<v Speaker 5>everybody gets nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a video that MTV put out.</v>

3212
02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:05.833
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a new year's resolutions for </v>

3213
02:25:08.241 --> 02:25:11.180
<v Speaker 5>white guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was one of the worst fucking,</v>

3214
02:25:11.181 --> 02:25:14.660
<v Speaker 5>most racist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sexist videos of every tweet that it was</v>

3215
02:25:14.661 --> 02:25:15.494
<v Speaker 5>so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I imagine if anybody had ever made </v>

3216
02:25:18.291 --> 02:25:21.110
<v Speaker 5>a video like that about any </v>
<v Speaker 5>generalization,</v>

3217
02:25:21.180 --> 02:25:23.770
<v Speaker 5>about a hundred million people and what </v>
<v Speaker 5>it is,</v>

3218
02:25:23.771 --> 02:25:25.210
<v Speaker 5>it's a general,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you say,</v>

3219
02:25:25.450 --> 02:25:28.630
<v Speaker 5>how many white guys are in America?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>

3220
02:25:28.631 --> 02:25:31.660
<v Speaker 5>let's just guess how many white males </v>
<v Speaker 5>are in America.</v>

3221
02:25:31.661 --> 02:25:36.090
<v Speaker 5>Not Enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Princess Leia is dot.</v>

3222
02:25:36.190 --> 02:25:37.860
<v Speaker 5>Had a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's okay right now though.</v>

3223
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:39.220
<v Speaker 5>She's stable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3224
02:25:39.221 --> 02:25:43.030
<v Speaker 5>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 5>62% of the US population is white.</v>

3225
02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:46.570
<v Speaker 5>62% of us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What percentage of white males?</v>

3226
02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:48.370
<v Speaker 5>White,</v>
<v Speaker 5>white males,</v>

3227
02:25:48.460 --> 02:25:51.180
<v Speaker 5>the majority,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is about 77%.</v>

3228
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:54.360
<v Speaker 5>That's how many white males and males </v>
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>

3229
02:25:54.370 --> 02:25:56.470
<v Speaker 5>white men or 31% of the population </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

3230
02:25:56.650 --> 02:25:57.483
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we're 31% of the population is 350 </v>

3231
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:01.623
<v Speaker 5>million people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somewhere around a hundred million </v>

3232
02:26:03.971 --> 02:26:04.750
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3233
02:26:04.750 --> 02:26:07.300
<v Speaker 5>It's in that neighborhood between 80 and</v>
<v Speaker 5>a hundred million.</v>

3234
02:26:07.300 --> 02:26:10.810
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what a crazy thing to generalize,</v>

3235
02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:14.650
<v Speaker 5>like just to make a video about white </v>
<v Speaker 5>men.</v>

3236
02:26:15.370 --> 02:26:16.960
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey white guys.</v>

3237
02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:19.690
<v Speaker 5>How about you get your shit together?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like just white guys?</v>

3238
02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:22.210
<v Speaker 5>Just white guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

3239
02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:24.370
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to do this about black guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>too?</v>

3240
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:26.680
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you see what happens when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>do it about black guys?</v>

3241
02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:27.633
<v Speaker 5>How about you do it about black women?</v>
<v Speaker 5>See how quick somebody beats the fuck </v>

3242
02:26:29.501 --> 02:26:30.334
<v Speaker 5>out of you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How come you can do that about white </v>

3243
02:26:32.291 --> 02:26:33.124
<v Speaker 5>guys like this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea is that white men are the </v>

3244
02:26:36.041 --> 02:26:39.010
<v Speaker 5>privileged and that white men have this </v>
<v Speaker 5>advantage,</v>

3245
02:26:39.011 --> 02:26:41.880
<v Speaker 5>so you should attack that advantage by </v>
<v Speaker 5>being racist towards them.</v>

3246
02:26:41.970 --> 02:26:42.803
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the best way to stop racism is to be </v>

3247
02:26:44.171 --> 02:26:46.120
<v Speaker 5>racist towards people who you think are </v>
<v Speaker 5>racist.</v>

3248
02:26:46.450 --> 02:26:49.600
<v Speaker 5>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so stupid.</v>

3249
02:26:50.770 --> 02:26:51.780
<v Speaker 5>It's so like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3250
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:53.360
<v Speaker 5>it's unbelievable that MTV news stuff,</v>

3251
02:26:53.530 --> 02:26:55.810
<v Speaker 2>they should do a video like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's really bad?</v>

3252
02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Mtvs the worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3253
02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:00.070
<v Speaker 2>have you watched it on TV recently?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry?</v>

3254
02:27:00.071 --> 02:27:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you like MTV?</v>

3255
02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:02.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try,</v>

3256
02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:05.140
<v Speaker 2>I to watch TV anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have cable anymore,</v>

3257
02:27:05.141 --> 02:27:06.040
<v Speaker 2>so I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3258
02:27:06.041 --> 02:27:09.150
<v Speaker 2>a psv or whatever or a sling and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3259
02:27:09.370 --> 02:27:12.910
<v Speaker 2>so I have certain channels I normally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not as many as I used to have.</v>

3260
02:27:12.911 --> 02:27:13.744
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll watch mtv more just because I have </v>

3261
02:27:15.731 --> 02:27:17.470
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of 30 channels,</v>

3262
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:18.663
<v Speaker 2>but MTV is just garbage channel now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that we're too old for </v>

3263
02:27:22.451 --> 02:27:23.021
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

3264
02:27:23.021 --> 02:27:26.210
<v Speaker 2>you have to be 18 to 22 to have any </v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

3265
02:27:26.211 --> 02:27:27.180
<v Speaker 2>They have that show.</v>

3266
02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:29.610
<v Speaker 5>What does it ridiculous is that on MTV?</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

3267
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.903
<v Speaker 5>that shows just saw a bunch of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>videos of people getting jacked on the </v>

3268
02:27:33.251 --> 02:27:34.084
<v Speaker 5>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3269
02:27:34.510 --> 02:27:35.620
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3270
02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:37.780
<v Speaker 5>everything else is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't have videos anymore.</v>

3271
02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:38.673
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

3272
02:27:38.720 --> 02:27:39.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>videos on Youtube.</v>

3273
02:27:39.941 --> 02:27:43.180
<v Speaker 5>Every videos on Sunday one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a weird time.</v>

3274
02:27:43.350 --> 02:27:43.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3275
02:27:43.951 --> 02:27:44.784
<v Speaker 2>it was cool and they had videos as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned about new bands because you saw </v>

3276
02:27:47.371 --> 02:27:48.120
<v Speaker 2>their video.</v>

3277
02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:49.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but nobody wants to watch those anymore.</v>

3278
02:27:49.570 --> 02:27:52.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess they played videos versus people</v>

3279
02:27:52.501 --> 02:27:53.334
<v Speaker 5>falling on their head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People go to fall on their head every </v>

3280
02:27:54.750 --> 02:27:56.820
<v Speaker 5>day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they just went where the money is.</v>

3281
02:27:57.150 --> 02:27:57.983
<v Speaker 5>So this is the idea is that like they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>just trying to appeal to social justice </v>

3282
02:28:00.121 --> 02:28:03.630
<v Speaker 5>warriors by making this video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's one girl in the video,</v>

3283
02:28:03.631 --> 02:28:07.080
<v Speaker 5>she goes find out what mansplaining is </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then don't do it.</v>

3284
02:28:07.530 --> 02:28:08.363
<v Speaker 5>Hell like find out what like what a </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous idea that you can be </v>

3285
02:28:13.351 --> 02:28:14.184
<v Speaker 5>condescending about someone being </v>
<v Speaker 5>condescending and that that somehow or </v>

3286
02:28:18.361 --> 02:28:21.030
<v Speaker 5>another is going to work like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the thought,</v>

3287
02:28:21.350 --> 02:28:24.170
<v Speaker 5>making a video like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's exactly how trump got elected.</v>

3288
02:28:24.260 --> 02:28:25.093
<v Speaker 5>When you tell people what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they automatically want to do the other </v>

3289
02:28:27.771 --> 02:28:28.604
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if they wouldn't want to do the </v>

3290
02:28:29.901 --> 02:28:31.310
<v Speaker 5>other thing if you hadn't said Shit.</v>

3291
02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:32.473
<v Speaker 5>But when you push people and you tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>people just if you make up ridiculous </v>

3292
02:28:36.141 --> 02:28:36.974
<v Speaker 5>standards the way people are supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 5>behave because you think they should </v>

3293
02:28:38.931 --> 02:28:39.764
<v Speaker 5>behave like that and that you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>allowed to make gigantic gross </v>

3294
02:28:42.441 --> 02:28:43.274
<v Speaker 5>generalizations about an entire group of</v>
<v Speaker 5>100 million people just because you </v>

3295
02:28:47.091 --> 02:28:47.924
<v Speaker 5>think it's open season on white guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that is how people like trump get </v>

3296
02:28:51.351 --> 02:28:52.184
<v Speaker 5>elected because people push back against</v>
<v Speaker 5>your ridiculous political correctness </v>

3297
02:28:55.610 --> 02:28:56.443
<v Speaker 5>and go towards what's the enemy of that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the enemy up political </v>

3298
02:28:58.941 --> 02:28:59.774
<v Speaker 5>correctness that pussy grabbing guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's fucking vote them in and that's </v>

3299
02:29:01.701 --> 02:29:03.950
<v Speaker 5>what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what happens.</v>

3300
02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:07.730
<v Speaker 5>These people are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that are so mad that trump is</v>

3301
02:29:07.731 --> 02:29:08.564
<v Speaker 5>in office are directly responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 5>it hordes of people voting for trump </v>

3302
02:29:12.980 --> 02:29:16.730
<v Speaker 5>because they are sick of where the the </v>
<v Speaker 5>PC generation is pointing.</v>

3303
02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:19.700
<v Speaker 5>It's an irrational point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not objective.</v>

3304
02:29:19.701 --> 02:29:20.534
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if anything has to do with gender or </v>

3305
02:29:22.311 --> 02:29:23.144
<v Speaker 5>homosexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoever has to do with any of those </v>

3306
02:29:24.741 --> 02:29:27.470
<v Speaker 5>things is no longer considered as an </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual.</v>

3307
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:28.423
<v Speaker 5>Then you're considered as a part of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>untouchable group that is almost always </v>

3308
02:29:31.281 --> 02:29:33.110
<v Speaker 5>exonerated of anything they've done </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>

3309
02:29:33.530 --> 02:29:34.363
<v Speaker 5>It cheats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get to this weird fake world where </v>

3310
02:29:36.441 --> 02:29:40.010
<v Speaker 5>people aren't people anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're figureheads for ideologies.</v>

3311
02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:41.333
<v Speaker 5>That's a problem with political </v>
<v Speaker 5>correctness as much as it's a problem </v>

3312
02:29:43.431 --> 02:29:46.390
<v Speaker 5>with people that are super right wing or</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are born again Christians.</v>

3313
02:29:46.391 --> 02:29:46.670
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3314
02:29:46.670 --> 02:29:47.503
<v Speaker 7>It's fucking up comedy like so many </v>
<v Speaker 7>comedians have been talking about </v>

3315
02:29:50.691 --> 02:29:51.524
<v Speaker 7>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How like they've had to stop themselves </v>

3316
02:29:53.451 --> 02:29:55.340
<v Speaker 7>on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3317
02:29:55.370 --> 02:29:56.203
<v Speaker 7>and not go down a route.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They normally would always go down </v>

3318
02:29:58.520 --> 02:29:59.870
<v Speaker 7>because of the recent,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3319
02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:02.720
<v Speaker 7>racist shit and a pc shit sewed much </v>
<v Speaker 7>different,</v>

3320
02:30:02.780 --> 02:30:04.730
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the last even six months.</v>

3321
02:30:05.180 --> 02:30:07.910
<v Speaker 7>Well there's definitely more pushback </v>
<v Speaker 7>but there's always been pushed back.</v>

3322
02:30:08.330 --> 02:30:09.440
<v Speaker 7>Have you noticed a change?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have you,</v>

3323
02:30:09.441 --> 02:30:12.590
<v Speaker 7>have you noticed like certain things you</v>
<v Speaker 7>won't say now or do now or,</v>

3324
02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:15.080
<v Speaker 5>well it makes you just back up what you </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to say better.</v>

3325
02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:17.420
<v Speaker 5>It makes you reinforce your arguments </v>
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>

3326
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:19.280
<v Speaker 5>It makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to have something to say</v>

3327
02:30:19.281 --> 02:30:20.900
<v Speaker 5>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to have,</v>

3328
02:30:22.830 --> 02:30:23.663
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to have a real point and you'd </v>

3329
02:30:25.201 --> 02:30:26.970
<v Speaker 5>have to be able to back up what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying.</v>

3330
02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:28.530
<v Speaker 5>You have to be able explain what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying.</v>

3331
02:30:28.930 --> 02:30:32.640
<v Speaker 5>It's why I did that whole bit about am I</v>
<v Speaker 5>not my last,</v>

3332
02:30:32.670 --> 02:30:34.850
<v Speaker 5>not in triggered the Netflix special,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the one before that,</v>

3333
02:30:34.860 --> 02:30:39.360
<v Speaker 5>the comedy central special about words </v>
<v Speaker 5>about how like you can't,</v>

3334
02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:44.510
<v Speaker 5>you can't just decide that jokes aren't </v>
<v Speaker 5>real</v>

3335
02:30:45.180 --> 02:30:45.410
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3336
02:30:45.410 --> 02:30:46.243
<v Speaker 5>Or rather the jokes are real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when someone's telling a joke on </v>

3337
02:30:48.091 --> 02:30:48.531
<v Speaker 5>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3338
02:30:48.531 --> 02:30:50.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy doesn't mean what he's saying.</v>

3339
02:30:50.900 --> 02:30:53.540
<v Speaker 5>So that's why when I'm in that special,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

3340
02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:55.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say some things that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>true,</v>

3341
02:30:56.510 --> 02:30:58.850
<v Speaker 5>but I'm gonna say a lot of shit that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>funnier than the truth.</v>

3342
02:30:58.970 --> 02:31:02.000
<v Speaker 5>So I'm going to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if it's Funnier to lie,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like you got to know.</v>

3344
02:31:03.270 --> 02:31:05.720
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I'm gonna tell you the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3345
02:31:06.310 --> 02:31:08.090
<v Speaker 5>and I go and sometimes I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>

3346
02:31:08.091 --> 02:31:10.610
<v Speaker 5>that's not true at all because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>funnier than the truth.</v>

3347
02:31:10.850 --> 02:31:11.720
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's some truth.</v>

3348
02:31:11.960 --> 02:31:16.640
<v Speaker 5>My wife is tired of fucking me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then people say that quite a bit.</v>

3349
02:31:16.940 --> 02:31:18.420
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3350
02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 5>but she never says no</v>

3351
02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:23.190
<v Speaker 1>because if she did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd raper and I'm like,</v>

3352
02:31:23.191 --> 02:31:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never rape her.</v>

3353
02:31:24.601 --> 02:31:25.590
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

3354
02:31:25.591 --> 02:31:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst I would do is hold it down and</v>

3355
02:31:27.061 --> 02:31:29.430
<v Speaker 1>titty fucker butt cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do that either.</v>

<v Speaker 1>These is not true statements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never do that thing.</v>

3357
02:31:31.621 --> 02:31:34.590
<v Speaker 1>She's the mother of my children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do that.</v>

3358
02:31:34.650 --> 02:31:36.960
<v Speaker 1>But you could say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3359
02:31:36.961 --> 02:31:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that's not true.</v>

3360
02:31:39.180 --> 02:31:40.020

3361
02:31:40.140 --> 02:31:41.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3362
02:31:41.581 --> 02:31:44.130
<v Speaker 1>when someone says something fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous like that,</v>

3363
02:31:44.540 --> 02:31:48.660
<v Speaker 1>that they don't mean it to joke like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when Brian Holt's,</v>

3364
02:31:48.661 --> 02:31:51.420
<v Speaker 1>when used to have that joke about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman who drowned her kids,</v>

3365
02:31:52.110 --> 02:31:53.400
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard those were bad kids.</v>

3366
02:31:53.690 --> 02:31:56.430
<v Speaker 1>I heard they sat that close to the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never put away their blocks.</v>

3367
02:31:56.700 --> 02:31:59.580
<v Speaker 1>The kids would not be missed though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is spelt their milk.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3370
02:32:04.620 --> 02:32:05.453
<v Speaker 1>which was the whole point of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem with today is people </v>

3371
02:32:08.220 --> 02:32:09.053
<v Speaker 1>just looking to call people out for shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't think people should say </v>

<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3432
02:34:22.330 --> 02:34:24.790
<v Speaker 7>don't remember about what would you want</v>
<v Speaker 7>to talk about?</v>

3433
02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:27.310
<v Speaker 7>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jesus Christ wasn't sure.</v>

3434
02:34:28.270 --> 02:34:30.280
<v Speaker 7>What was it that you thought you were </v>
<v Speaker 7>just talking about?</v>

3435
02:34:30.281 --> 02:34:31.114
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You weren't at a point about what you </v>

3436
02:34:33.231 --> 02:34:35.590
<v Speaker 7>were talking about now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't remember what it was about.</v>

3437
02:34:35.620 --> 02:34:36.453
<v Speaker 7>You were just talking about Donald Trump</v>
<v Speaker 7>and Billy Bush on the bus talking about </v>

3438
02:34:39.701 --> 02:34:41.500

<v Speaker 7>doing it.</v>

3440
02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:44.373
<v Speaker 7>But the thing with Joey is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that he says ridiculous things mixed </v>

3441
02:34:46.571 --> 02:34:47.404
<v Speaker 7>with things that are true,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you don't know which they're real </v>

<v Speaker 7>He tried to sucker punch this guy and </v>
<v Speaker 7>the guy was gay and the guy knew how to </v>

3448
02:35:03.101 --> 02:35:06.290

<v Speaker 7>him and he's beating the shit out of him</v>

3449

<v Speaker 7>he went to jail.</v>

3453
02:35:14.010 --> 02:35:15.060
<v Speaker 7>Joey's a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

<v Speaker 7>That he has stories like those mixed in </v>

3459

3466
02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:37.070
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cause it,</v>

3467

<v Speaker 7>Well the problem with Julie's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his life has been so crazy and so </v>

3470
02:35:47.621 --> 02:35:48.454

<v Speaker 7>I hope Joey's thinks does well,</v>

3490
02:36:29.651 --> 02:36:30.484
<v Speaker 7>but I hope also the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they put port their stuff to other </v>

3491
02:36:31.991 --> 02:36:34.630
<v Speaker 7>places once they get their money back.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So a lot of times they'll do that.</v>

3492
02:36:34.631 --> 02:36:35.464
<v Speaker 7>They'll sell them again somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If somebody special just was released </v>

3493
02:36:38.020 --> 02:36:38.853
<v Speaker 7>like on Seeso,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like Nick Thune or something like </v>

3494
02:36:40.001 --> 02:36:43.300
<v Speaker 7>yesterday and it says available on </v>
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] and Amazon.</v>

3495
02:36:43.570 --> 02:36:45.100
<v Speaker 7>Hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a good deal.</v>

3496
02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:47.800
<v Speaker 7>That's you're going to get the dorks on </v>
<v Speaker 7>Amazon.</v>

3497
02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:51.550
<v Speaker 7>But how many people are really using </v>
<v Speaker 7>Amazon to watch movies?</v>

3498
02:36:51.551 --> 02:36:54.290
<v Speaker 7>Like netflix would probably be like way </v>
<v Speaker 7>ahead of Amazon.</v>

3499
02:36:54.630 --> 02:36:56.830
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people don't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If they have Amazon prime,</v>

3500
02:36:56.900 --> 02:36:58.670
<v Speaker 7>do you get access to that APP?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's also,</v>

3501
02:36:58.690 --> 02:36:59.523
<v Speaker 7>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't get everything because they </v>

3502
02:37:00.161 --> 02:37:00.994
<v Speaker 7>try to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3503
02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:01.873
<v Speaker 7>they work in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're like rental movies and stuff in </v>

3504
02:37:04.241 --> 02:37:05.310
<v Speaker 7>that APP too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

3505
02:37:05.311 --> 02:37:07.390
<v Speaker 7>You get a decent amount of content for </v>
<v Speaker 7>free.</v>

3506
02:37:08.290 --> 02:37:09.850
<v Speaker 7>There's a whole music app you get to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3507
02:37:09.851 --> 02:37:10.780
<v Speaker 7>it's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3508
02:37:11.050 --> 02:37:11.883
<v Speaker 7>they also have that top gear show,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which they said is the most illegally </v>

3509
02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:16.520
<v Speaker 7>show in history.</v>

3510
02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new one,</v>

3511
02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:18.193
<v Speaker 1>the new one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said the first episode in </v>

3512
02:37:19.191 --> 02:37:23.420
<v Speaker 1>particular is the most illegally </v>
<v Speaker 1>downloaded episode of a show ever.</v>

3513
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:27.050
<v Speaker 1>So I'm way more people download it </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegally than watch it on Amazon.</v>

3514
02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is crazy because they,</v>

3515
02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:32.930
<v Speaker 1>they paid a shit load of money for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that,</v>

3516
02:37:32.931 --> 02:37:34.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once it gets on Amazon,</v>

3517
02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:35.713
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people jump over to Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that was the number one TV show </v>

3518
02:37:37.791 --> 02:37:38.624
<v Speaker 1>in the world that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that show top gear with Richard Hammond </v>

3519
02:37:41.721 --> 02:37:46.721
<v Speaker 1>and James May and those guys that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>there a giant team.</v>

3520
02:37:47.300 --> 02:37:48.133
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to like the whole world </v>

3521
02:37:49.641 --> 02:37:53.330
<v Speaker 1>watching a show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the most watched show in</v>

3522
02:37:53.331 --> 02:37:56.990
<v Speaker 1>the world and it's on Amazon in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just them driving around mostly and</v>

3523
02:37:56.991 --> 02:37:59.750
<v Speaker 1>just like talking shit to each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking shit.</v>

3524
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.823
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're funny to fire somebody recently </v>

3525
02:38:02.661 --> 02:38:03.650
<v Speaker 1>that was on that show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Clarkson's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really funny.</v>

3536
02:38:21.350 --> 02:38:24.380
<v Speaker 1>He says a lot of fucking hilarious shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he talks shit about companies too.</v>

3537
02:38:24.620 --> 02:38:25.453
<v Speaker 1>He talks about he reviews cars in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like no other no American show </v>

3538
02:38:29.031 --> 02:38:30.790
<v Speaker 1>would ever be able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never be able to get away with it.</v>

3539
02:38:30.810 --> 02:38:33.460
<v Speaker 1>He shits on them like he shits on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Porsche's.</v>

3540
02:38:33.470 --> 02:38:34.303
<v Speaker 1>He hates Porsche is it calls them like </v>
<v Speaker 1>vw bugs and Bionics in four k which is </v>

3541
02:38:37.671 --> 02:38:38.610
<v Speaker 1>one of the things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that good?</v>

3542
02:38:38.690 --> 02:38:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same with Netflix originals.</v>

3543
02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:41.353
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the only things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a four k content for your new four </v>

3544
02:38:43.731 --> 02:38:44.480
<v Speaker 1>K tv.</v>

3545
02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:47.000
<v Speaker 1>If people are looking for shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is hard.</v>

3546
02:38:47.180 --> 02:38:48.440
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

3547
02:38:48.470 --> 02:38:49.303
<v Speaker 1>people take and then they upload it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just uploaded like crazy all over </v>

3548
02:38:52.461 --> 02:38:53.294
<v Speaker 1>those bit torrents and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>different sites and just millions and </v>

3549
02:38:56.240 --> 02:38:57.140
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions of people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>downloading it.</v>

3550
02:38:57.141 --> 02:38:57.974
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to think of how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon paid for it and then how few </v>

3551
02:39:00.021 --> 02:39:00.854
<v Speaker 1>people are actually using their service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you had to guess like how many </v>

3552
02:39:05.841 --> 02:39:10.410
<v Speaker 1>more people use netflix than anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else as far as like Amazon or Hulu or,</v>

3553
02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I use Hulu more than I use netflix now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I barely use netflix anymore.</v>

3554
02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I use Hulu all the time now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you get on Hulu?</v>

3555
02:39:16.740 --> 02:39:17.573
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all the,</v>

3556
02:39:17.650 --> 02:39:18.483
<v Speaker 1>like the local channel is like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>like stuff like that you get local TV </v>

3557
02:39:22.420 --> 02:39:23.870
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like the,</v>

3558
02:39:23.871 --> 02:39:24.704
<v Speaker 1>like the NBC shows that CBS shows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox shows the news and all those other </v>

3559
02:39:29.391 --> 02:39:30.560
<v Speaker 1>things like NBC News.</v>

3560
02:39:30.590 --> 02:39:31.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that on sling.</v>

3561
02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Psu.</v>

3562
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:37.170
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Playstation you sling is like,</v>

3563

<v Speaker 1>like live TV.</v>

3564
02:39:39.290 --> 02:39:40.123
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can pick and choose which way </v>

3565
02:39:41.031 --> 02:39:42.710
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just like NBC,</v>

3566
02:39:42.711 --> 02:39:43.940
<v Speaker 1>ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CBS.</v>

3567
02:39:43.941 --> 02:39:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I have like a food network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3568
02:39:47.570 --> 02:39:49.430
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like 40 channels,</v>

3569
02:39:49.431 --> 02:39:51.380
<v Speaker 1>you can get the best one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's playstation now.</v>

3570
02:39:51.570 --> 02:39:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Well there was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend had Alexa,</v>

3571
02:39:54.110 --> 02:39:58.040
<v Speaker 1>he has Amazon and that you talk to Alexa</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shuts the lights out and it does all</v>

3572
02:39:58.041 --> 02:40:00.050
<v Speaker 1>that weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But [inaudible] and uh,</v>

3573
02:40:00.051 --> 02:40:02.450
<v Speaker 1>he had a bunch of channels when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at his stuff,</v>

3574
02:40:02.451 --> 02:40:03.284
<v Speaker 1>I had never been seen before and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them was like all Montreal comedy </v>

3575
02:40:05.211 --> 02:40:06.044
<v Speaker 1>festival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like all people that I knew </v>

3576
02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.890
<v Speaker 1>performing in the Montreal comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>festival,</v>

3577
02:40:09.891 --> 02:40:11.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like this is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3578
02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:12.433
<v Speaker 1>not Alexa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about Amazon fire like </v>

3579
02:40:14.221 --> 02:40:14.490
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3580
02:40:14.490 --> 02:40:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the box.</v>

3581
02:40:15.300 --> 02:40:17.010
<v Speaker 1>But he has Alexa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you talked to her.</v>

3582
02:40:17.070 --> 02:40:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say Amazon.</v>

3583
02:40:18.090 --> 02:40:19.890
<v Speaker 1>You say Alexa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please turn on the TV.</v>

3584
02:40:19.891 --> 02:40:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Alexa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn on channel five.</v>

3585
02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:24.240
<v Speaker 1>I have the Alexa that looks like a Mug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that Alexa.</v>

3586
02:40:25.290 --> 02:40:26.123
<v Speaker 1>But my point being is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of channels and I never even knew </v>

3587
02:40:27.961 --> 02:40:30.690
<v Speaker 1>existed that are on this essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>live TV.</v>

3588
02:40:30.691 --> 02:40:31.524
<v Speaker 1>They have programming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're watching it just like you </v>

3589
02:40:33.511 --> 02:40:35.880
<v Speaker 1>would watch direct TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were to watch directv now,</v>

3590
02:40:36.090 --> 02:40:36.923
<v Speaker 1>one channel becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one show becomes the next show becomes </v>

3591
02:40:38.971 --> 02:40:41.030
<v Speaker 1>the next show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just watched them in a series.</v>

3592
02:40:41.060 --> 02:40:41.893
<v Speaker 1>They play out in route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had this on these weird little </v>

3593
02:40:44.701 --> 02:40:45.421
<v Speaker 1>channels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3594
02:40:45.421 --> 02:40:46.680
<v Speaker 1>how many of these channels are there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

3595
02:40:46.681 --> 02:40:48.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing.</v>

3596
02:40:48.570 --> 02:40:48.991
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is television.</v>

3598
02:40:51.690 --> 02:40:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Like this isn't just like a Netflix show</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you tune in and then when you plus</v>

<v Speaker 1>these things have a schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is on from seven to eight.</v>

3601
02:41:01.051 --> 02:41:03.600

<v Speaker 1>It's fucking tv,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like it's in terms of like entertainment</v>

3615
02:41:30.380 --> 02:41:31.520
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3616
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:32.743
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been doing this too for like about </v>

3617
02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:34.600
<v Speaker 6>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been,</v>

3618
02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:36.980
<v Speaker 6>I cut my cut my cable channel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most of these,</v>

3619
02:41:36.981 --> 02:41:37.814
<v Speaker 6>cause I still want to watch live sports.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I still watch NBA Basketball Games are </v>

02:41:39.811 --> 02:41:40.644
<v Speaker 6>still a couple of football games.</v>

3621
02:41:42.941 --> 02:41:43.774
<v Speaker 6>though it'll freeze and at the worst </v>
<v Speaker 6>time possible when the quarter's about </v>

3622
02:41:48.171 --> 02:41:49.910
<v Speaker 6>to end or some really important so it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to happen.</v>

3623
02:41:49.911 --> 02:41:50.744
<v Speaker 6>Or if you're watching the UFC fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you lose out minute of around in the </v>

3624
02:41:54.470 --> 02:41:56.840
<v Speaker 6>middle of the third round of the last </v>
<v Speaker 6>fight or something.</v>

3625
02:41:56.841 --> 02:42:00.020
<v Speaker 6>Like there's definitely bullshit or </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the difference on your directv or</v>

<v Speaker 6>at and t or time warner.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just a,</v>

3627
02:42:02.900 --> 02:42:04.400
<v Speaker 6>what we're used to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It always comes in,</v>

3628
02:42:04.401 --> 02:42:05.234
<v Speaker 6>unless there's like a giant storm that </v>
<v Speaker 6>cut everything out for the entire </v>

3629
02:42:07.730 --> 02:42:09.430
<v Speaker 6>country or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's all,</v>

3630
02:42:09.540 --> 02:42:10.373
<v Speaker 6>well always works</v>

3631
02:42:10.420 --> 02:42:12.460
<v Speaker 1>for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get better.</v>

3632
02:42:12.490 --> 02:42:14.230
<v Speaker 1>It's way better now than it was 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

3633
02:42:14.260 --> 02:42:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about how bad it was when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>first got online.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Anytime you watched a youtube video,</v>

3636
02:42:21.881 --> 02:42:22.714
<v Speaker 1>you had a pause and wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were living in an era when it comes </v>

3637
02:42:25.841 --> 02:42:26.674
<v Speaker 1>to the accessibility of stuff and as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet gets stronger and stronger to </v>

3638
02:42:29.651 --> 02:42:31.510
<v Speaker 1>signals are getting better and better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3639
02:42:31.511 --> 02:42:34.300
<v Speaker 1>we're on four g l t e now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3640
02:42:34.301 --> 02:42:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Like what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's five going to be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in terms of download speeds?</v>

3644
02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:44.820
<v Speaker 6>So when they get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when you hear like a 97% work,</v>

3645
02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:45.713
<v Speaker 6>everything works 97% of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to be in that 3% of the </v>

3646
02:42:47.820 --> 02:42:48.720
<v Speaker 6>time when it doesn't work.</v>

<v Speaker 1>when those new ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to the builtin Internet </v>

3654
02:43:05.741 --> 02:43:07.890

<v Speaker 1>hub.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We should be driving around like you </v>

3657
02:43:13.031 --> 02:43:18.031

<v Speaker 1>fucking truck and I mean this is just,</v>

3658

<v Speaker 1>step one of a million step process our </v>

3659

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>

3661
02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost.</v>

3662
02:43:26.470 --> 02:43:28.300
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's Jamie's fighting for it.</v>

3663
02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:29.193
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have that chip in your </v>

3664
02:43:30.191 --> 02:43:32.470
<v Speaker 1>head just like that Black Mirror show </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

3665
02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:35.890
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how close that Black Mirror</v>

3666
02:43:35.891 --> 02:43:36.724
<v Speaker 1>episode was to all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>versions of recording your memory that </v>

3667
02:43:40.721 --> 02:43:42.040
<v Speaker 1>we had come up with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3668
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:43.300
<v Speaker 1>that's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>

3669
02:43:43.340 --> 02:43:46.420
<v Speaker 1>So funny you said that because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely what I thought.</v>

3670
02:43:46.450 --> 02:43:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I thought every single episodes like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3671
02:43:48.310 --> 02:43:50.530
<v Speaker 1>they're listening to jre no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3672
02:43:50.531 --> 02:43:50.891
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3673
02:43:50.891 --> 02:43:51.724
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3674
02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:52.593
<v Speaker 1>I think way more likely is that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects are being repeated by a bunch </v>

3675
02:43:56.951 --> 02:44:00.310
<v Speaker 1>of curious people all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the ability to record memory.</v>

3676
02:44:00.311 --> 02:44:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows that's comment and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>take on it was really pretty unique.</v>

3677
02:44:03.490 --> 02:44:04.323
<v Speaker 1>But like all the different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different possibilities that </v>

3678
02:44:07.121 --> 02:44:07.954
<v Speaker 1>we've ever discussed on this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of other people talking </v>

3679
02:44:10.601 --> 02:44:12.040
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just us.</v>

3680
02:44:12.220 --> 02:44:15.970
<v Speaker 1>There's a million different people </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculating as to where the fuck is this</v>

3681
02:44:15.971 --> 02:44:16.804
<v Speaker 1>all going and virtual reality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly like there's not a single </v>

3682
02:44:19.811 --> 02:44:24.380
<v Speaker 1>person that could say I'm the only one </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's predicted the,</v>

3683
02:44:24.381 --> 02:44:24.821
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3684
02:44:24.821 --> 02:44:26.290
<v Speaker 1>the future of virtual reality.</v>

3685
02:44:26.290 --> 02:44:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were talking about virtual </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality for sure you got it from me,</v>

3686
02:44:29.710 --> 02:44:32.680
<v Speaker 1>that's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's millions of people that have had</v>

3687
02:44:32.681 --> 02:44:35.950
<v Speaker 1>like pretty profound thoughts about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for virtual reality.</v>

3688
02:44:36.060 --> 02:44:37.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that if you,</v>

3689
02:44:37.460 --> 02:44:38.293
<v Speaker 1>the watch the whole season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like every episode is like a </v>

3690
02:44:39.851 --> 02:44:41.320
<v Speaker 1>different thing that you've talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

3691
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Like remember when we said a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

3692
02:44:43.260 --> 02:44:46.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I thought like likes are going to be</v>

3693
02:44:46.030 --> 02:44:48.010
<v Speaker 1>currency and stuff like that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

3694
02:44:48.220 --> 02:44:49.820
<v Speaker 1>They have a whole episode about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets,</v>

3695
02:44:49.930 --> 02:44:51.820
<v Speaker 1>so when other people have thought that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure,</v>

3696
02:44:52.450 --> 02:44:53.283
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about a yelp review for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like a long fucking time ago </v>

3697
02:44:57.761 --> 02:45:00.340
<v Speaker 1>about like people having floating stars </v>
<v Speaker 1>above their head.</v>

3698
02:45:00.341 --> 02:45:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Like when you walk into them you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3699
02:45:01.601 --> 02:45:03.310
<v Speaker 1>this guy's got four stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Must be a cool dude.</v>

3700
02:45:03.580 --> 02:45:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he bought his fucking stars.</v>

3701
02:45:05.210 --> 02:45:07.120
<v Speaker 1>And you find out people are buying their</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars like you.</v>

3702
02:45:07.630 --> 02:45:08.463
<v Speaker 1>Like if you find that if you go to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>yelp review and it's like a Vietnam </v>

3703
02:45:10.661 --> 02:45:13.660
<v Speaker 1>restaurant and all the fucking reviews </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in broken English,</v>

3704
02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:17.860
<v Speaker 1>best noodle ever have you and no for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my place.</v>

3705
02:45:17.890 --> 02:45:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Exclamation point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exclamation point.</v>

3706
02:45:19.580 --> 02:45:22.660
<v Speaker 1>In the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the same like shitty broken English</v>

3707
02:45:22.661 --> 02:45:23.494
<v Speaker 1>and every review you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think these motherfuckers are writing </v>

3708
02:45:25.180 --> 02:45:26.560
<v Speaker 1>their own reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3709
02:45:26.860 --> 02:45:27.693
<v Speaker 1>But if you've ever gone like a yelp </v>
<v Speaker 1>review or any kind of review for </v>

3710
02:45:30.611 --> 02:45:33.310
<v Speaker 1>something and you know the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably bought those reviews.</v>

3711
02:45:33.430 --> 02:45:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell he grossed out,</v>

3712
02:45:35.380 --> 02:45:35.861
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3713
02:45:35.861 --> 02:45:36.694
<v Speaker 1>They have no other review.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No other reviews except that the people </v>

3714
02:45:40.871 --> 02:45:41.704
<v Speaker 1>that if you go to their instagram page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got a million followers and like </v>

3715
02:45:44.111 --> 02:45:47.590
<v Speaker 1>last week they had 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 30,000</v>

3716
02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:48.593
<v Speaker 1>like what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you involved in a national scandal </v>

3717
02:45:50.230 --> 02:45:54.070
<v Speaker 1>or he could buy instagram followers </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily and twitter followers.</v>

3718
02:45:54.100 --> 02:45:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Instagram is a big one though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3719
02:45:55.270 --> 02:45:56.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of instagram girls who </v>

3720
02:45:58.030 --> 02:46:01.090
<v Speaker 1>bought followers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're public about it though.</v>

3721
02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:01.721
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3722
02:46:01.721 --> 02:46:02.554
<v Speaker 1>it's just so I can get more stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sports commentator got caught </v>

3723
02:46:05.530 --> 02:46:10.530
<v Speaker 1>leaving a comment on his own page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

<v Speaker 7>because it could've been someone working</v>

<v Speaker 5>watching that going,</v>

3776
02:48:26.460 --> 02:48:28.920
<v Speaker 5>this guy should shut the fuck up.</v>

3777
02:48:29.790 --> 02:48:32.720
<v Speaker 7>Just trying to say anything you can to </v>
<v Speaker 7>get attention on a day to day basis.</v>

3778
02:48:33.330 --> 02:48:33.600
<v Speaker 7>Not</v>

3779
02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:34.680
<v Speaker 5>really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They should shut the fuck up.</v>

3780
02:48:34.681 --> 02:48:35.880
<v Speaker 5>He's talking if he wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

3781
02:48:35.890 --> 02:48:36.723
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt like you didn't know what he's </v>

3782
02:48:37.531 --> 02:48:40.830
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I felt it come through.</v>

3783
02:48:41.250 --> 02:48:42.083
<v Speaker 5>I was like listening to him talk about </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and kind of made it kind of good </v>

3784
02:48:44.731 --> 02:48:47.250
<v Speaker 5>point about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he was talking about her.</v>

3785
02:48:47.251 --> 02:48:52.251
<v Speaker 5>I'm taking the time off and all this </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff and I don't think he knows a sport</v>

3786
02:48:53.131 --> 02:48:54.840
<v Speaker 5>that well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might be wrong.</v>

3787
02:48:54.970 --> 02:48:56.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might,</v>

3788
02:48:56.260 --> 02:48:57.780
<v Speaker 5>I might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might be wrong,</v>

3789
02:48:57.781 --> 02:48:58.614
<v Speaker 5>but it just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seemed to me like one of those clear </v>

3790
02:49:01.411 --> 02:49:06.411
<v Speaker 5>examples of the main stream adopting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I take</v>

3791
02:49:08.130 --> 02:49:10.590
<v Speaker 1>on something that they don't follow all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that closely.</v>

3792
02:49:10.591 --> 02:49:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people love to be right </v>
<v Speaker 1>about fighting.</v>

3793
02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:14.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3794
02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:16.350
<v Speaker 1>They love to be right about who's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>

3795
02:49:16.351 --> 02:49:18.270
<v Speaker 1>who's gonna lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why I don't,</v>

3796
02:49:18.271 --> 02:49:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I hardly ever give predictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't know shit.</v>

3797
02:49:21.870 --> 02:49:23.430
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the fuck's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

3798
02:49:23.670 --> 02:49:25.770
<v Speaker 1>You could tell me you think you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen.</v>

3799
02:49:25.771 --> 02:49:29.790
<v Speaker 1>But until those people go in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking throw punches at each other,</v>

3800
02:49:29.791 --> 02:49:34.510
<v Speaker 1>anything can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything come on mayweather that,</v>

3801
02:49:34.620 --> 02:49:38.280
<v Speaker 1>that highly unlikely to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it did happen,</v>

3802
02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:39.233
<v Speaker 1>if they would just boxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably like the biggest boxing match </v>

3803
02:49:41.431 --> 02:49:42.620
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3804
02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Nate said he wants 20 million or he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not talking or something like that.</v>

3805
02:49:46.681 --> 02:49:47.514
<v Speaker 1>He might've been high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might have been high as fuck when he </v>

3806
02:49:49.951 --> 02:49:50.784
<v Speaker 1>said that.</v>

3807
02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:53.073
<v Speaker 1>Great Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been hanging out with that like he </v>

3808
02:49:54.471 --> 02:49:57.000
<v Speaker 1>could put into coming to the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>store in a regular basis.</v>

3809
02:49:57.001 --> 02:49:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Now I've been hanging out with him late </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

3810
02:49:58.700 --> 02:50:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was hanging out with him and Nixon.</v>

3811
02:50:00.650 --> 02:50:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Nick's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3812
02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Funny dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would never know.</v>

3813
02:50:03.571 --> 02:50:05.380
<v Speaker 1>They could beat the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just meet them.</v>

3814
02:50:05.381 --> 02:50:07.160
<v Speaker 1>You think they're so friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3815
02:50:07.210 --> 02:50:09.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just normal dudes,</v>

3816
02:50:09.820 --> 02:50:14.160
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking brutal sport man.</v>

3817
02:50:14.190 --> 02:50:16.110
<v Speaker 1>He deserves 20 million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all do.</v>

3818
02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:18.840
<v Speaker 1>You just did Tony's podcast too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard her.</v>

3819
02:50:18.841 --> 02:50:19.750
<v Speaker 1>It was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3820
02:50:20.100 --> 02:50:21.510
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3821
02:50:21.511 --> 02:50:24.270
<v Speaker 1>When people who start chiming in about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sport,</v>

3822
02:50:24.271 --> 02:50:26.190
<v Speaker 1>they do it like they talk about other </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>

3823
02:50:26.850 --> 02:50:29.700
<v Speaker 1>To me it seems so much more personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3824
02:50:30.660 --> 02:50:33.610
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been following it forever and I,</v>

3825
02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:34.473
<v Speaker 1>I barely have the confidence to say what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is going to happen when people </v>

3826
02:50:36.901 --> 02:50:37.734
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

3827
02:50:37.920 --> 02:50:38.753
<v Speaker 1>So when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I see people just jump in and have </v>

3828
02:50:41.221 --> 02:50:42.450
<v Speaker 1>an opinion of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3829
02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:43.433
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

3830
02:50:43.690 --> 02:50:44.171
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>

3831
02:50:44.171 --> 02:50:45.004
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to get all controversial </v>

3832
02:50:46.381 --> 02:50:48.330
<v Speaker 1>about stuff he's trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

3833
02:50:48.390 --> 02:50:50.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played basketball in high school,</v>

3834
02:50:50.011 --> 02:50:50.844
<v Speaker 1>but I still like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched it for my whole life and I </v>

3835
02:50:52.321 --> 02:50:54.510
<v Speaker 1>hear someone say something stupid like </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the gym,</v>

3836
02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:57.210
<v Speaker 1>just about like Lebron or the warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3837
02:50:57.220 --> 02:50:58.053
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what you're talking </v>

3838
02:51:00.511 --> 02:51:01.680
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My basketball.</v>

3839
02:51:01.710 --> 02:51:02.543
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

3840
02:51:02.550 --> 02:51:03.383
<v Speaker 1>here's another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about mma is that the </v>

3841
02:51:05.881 --> 02:51:07.920
<v Speaker 1>sport is as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3842
02:51:07.921 --> 02:51:08.754
<v Speaker 1>I hate that fucking Cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've got to use it as real as it </v>

3843
02:51:10.471 --> 02:51:12.720
<v Speaker 1>gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get any more real in terms of</v>

3844
02:51:12.721 --> 02:51:17.721
<v Speaker 1>like raw emotion and consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as a show,</v>

3845
02:51:20.820 --> 02:51:25.680
<v Speaker 1>when you're watching it on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're getting a 100% of</v>

3846
02:51:25.681 --> 02:51:26.880
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're there,</v>

3847
02:51:26.881 --> 02:51:28.050
<v Speaker 1>I think you get more of it.</v>

3848
02:51:28.650 --> 02:51:31.370
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>

3849
02:51:31.371 --> 02:51:32.204
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's so raw and so real that if </v>

3850
02:51:34.771 --> 02:51:37.200
<v Speaker 1>someone's not real and they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

3851
02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:39.870
<v Speaker 1>it becomes real obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3852
02:51:39.871 --> 02:51:42.570
<v Speaker 1>if you don't really care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're talking about a fight and</v>

3853
02:51:42.571 --> 02:51:47.571
<v Speaker 1>you're getting all jazzed up about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

3854
02:51:48.091 --> 02:51:48.924
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking about a fight and you </v>

3855
02:51:50.941 --> 02:51:52.920
<v Speaker 1>get jack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you actually are jazzed up about it,</v>

3856
02:51:52.921 --> 02:51:54.840
<v Speaker 1>people can feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're faking it,</v>

3857
02:51:55.230 --> 02:51:58.830
<v Speaker 1>they feel that too man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in this sport,</v>

3858
02:51:58.831 --> 02:52:02.220
<v Speaker 1>because the sport is so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's so intensely real,</v>

3859
02:52:02.221 --> 02:52:06.070
<v Speaker 1>it's so intensely raw and naked that</v>

3860
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:06.903
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3861
02:52:07.210 --> 02:52:09.850
<v Speaker 5>your la people are way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way less tolerant to bull.</v>

3862
02:52:09.851 --> 02:52:12.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Way less tolerant of bullshit,</v>

3863
02:52:13.540 --> 02:52:15.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or things they disagree with.</v>

3864
02:52:15.251 --> 02:52:16.084
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot riding on every aspect of </v>

3865
02:52:20.561 --> 02:52:21.394
<v Speaker 5>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you see the Bernard Hopkins Fight </v>

3866
02:52:23.740 --> 02:52:24.573
<v Speaker 5>Sad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3867
02:52:24.730 --> 02:52:26.890
<v Speaker 5>That was sad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bernard Hopkins,</v>

3868
02:52:26.891 --> 02:52:31.060
<v Speaker 5>if 51 years old fought this kid named </v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe Smith Jr if you're,</v>

3869
02:52:31.370 --> 02:52:33.700
<v Speaker 5>if nobody's seen Joe Smith junior before</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's fucking,</v>

3870
02:52:33.730 --> 02:52:37.240
<v Speaker 5>he's a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Bernard Hopkins picked a killer and</v>

3871
02:52:37.241 --> 02:52:40.360
<v Speaker 5>this kid fucked him up and his kid has </v>
<v Speaker 5>extra long arms.</v>

3872
02:52:40.420 --> 02:52:43.540
<v Speaker 5>He's got weird arms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like his arms go below his waist.</v>

3873
02:52:44.560 --> 02:52:45.730
<v Speaker 5>I was watching him fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

3874
02:52:45.731 --> 02:52:48.880
<v Speaker 5>look at the length of his fucking arms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he just,</v>

3875
02:52:49.060 --> 02:52:49.893
<v Speaker 5>he beat the shit out of Bernard and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>knocked him out of the ring and Bernard </v>

3876
02:52:52.121 --> 02:52:54.970
<v Speaker 5>caught him with some good shots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was timing him and he caught him with</v>

3877
02:52:54.971 --> 02:52:57.670
<v Speaker 5>a few right hands with the kid was just </v>
<v Speaker 5>eating them and moving forward.</v>

3878
02:52:57.670 --> 02:53:00.460
<v Speaker 5>And you know what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like when people have fake hands,</v>

3879
02:53:00.490 --> 02:53:03.480
<v Speaker 5>like the fake hand is like sticking </v>
<v Speaker 5>through the shirt sleeve.</v>

3880
02:53:04.120 --> 02:53:06.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He almost looked like a cartoon guy with</v>

3881
02:53:06.101 --> 02:53:08.450
<v Speaker 5>his extra long arms but he's a bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker.</v>

3882
02:53:08.480 --> 02:53:12.460
<v Speaker 5>That guy and Bernard got knocked through</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ropes and fell on his head.</v>

3883
02:53:12.820 --> 02:53:16.000
<v Speaker 5>It was crazy to watch and he got up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was all disoriented,</v>

3884
02:53:16.030 --> 02:53:18.310
<v Speaker 5>didn't know what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thought he was pushed through the ropes,</v>

3885
02:53:18.311 --> 02:53:19.144
<v Speaker 5>but he was punched through the ropes </v>
<v Speaker 5>that got connected with like four or </v>

3886
02:53:22.241 --> 02:53:23.074
<v Speaker 5>five big shots and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the last one was a left hook on the </v>

3887
02:53:26.651 --> 02:53:27.484
<v Speaker 5>face as Bernard was going through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ropes and it knocked him all the way </v>

3888
02:53:30.821 --> 02:53:33.430
<v Speaker 5>through,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was 100% legal.</v>

3889
02:53:33.580 --> 02:53:35.800
<v Speaker 5>He didn't do anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did everything with punches.</v>

3890
02:53:35.830 --> 02:53:37.000
<v Speaker 5>It would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>none of it was a push.</v>

3891
02:53:37.210 --> 02:53:40.240
<v Speaker 5>He was just bombing on them and it just </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a freak incident.</v>

3892
02:53:40.240 --> 02:53:42.870
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the reasons why cages are so</v>
<v Speaker 5>much better than a ring.</v>

3893
02:53:43.450 --> 02:53:46.000
<v Speaker 5>A cage is so superior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a ring.</v>

3894
02:53:46.001 --> 02:53:46.960
<v Speaker 5>It's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3895
02:53:46.990 --> 02:53:49.300
<v Speaker 5>that possibility that you could fall </v>
<v Speaker 5>through like that.</v>

3896
02:53:49.330 --> 02:53:51.250
<v Speaker 5>That's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That should,</v>

3897
02:53:51.251 --> 02:53:54.550
<v Speaker 5>they should stop using rings and if they</v>
<v Speaker 5>do use rings,</v>

3898
02:53:54.670 --> 02:53:56.860
<v Speaker 5>they should pad the shit out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>outside area.</v>

3899
02:53:56.861 --> 02:53:57.694
<v Speaker 5>The fact that someone like Bernard </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hopkins who's been boxing for forever </v>

3900
02:54:00.940 --> 02:54:01.773
<v Speaker 5>can still get knocked through a rope </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that and land on his head that </v>

3901
02:54:04.961 --> 02:54:08.110
<v Speaker 5>that's a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a stupid way of containing people</v>

3902
02:54:08.770 --> 02:54:11.650
<v Speaker 5>they should have instead of ropes like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that would,</v>

3903
02:54:11.651 --> 02:54:12.484
<v Speaker 5>they should have is something that has a</v>
<v Speaker 5>criss cross pattern where you can't go </v>

3904
02:54:15.101 --> 02:54:18.940
<v Speaker 5>through it and you should have to just </v>
<v Speaker 5>climb over it to get in it.</v>

3905
02:54:18.941 --> 02:54:22.120
<v Speaker 5>It should be real simple and it should </v>
<v Speaker 5>be a way that they could release the,</v>

3906
02:54:22.121 --> 02:54:23.050
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ropes.</v>

3907
02:54:23.140 --> 02:54:25.150
<v Speaker 5>Like if there was a medical emergency at</v>
<v Speaker 5>the end of the fight,</v>

3908
02:54:25.151 --> 02:54:25.984
<v Speaker 5>it should be like a latch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could pull and drop the ribs down </v>

3909
02:54:27.761 --> 02:54:30.310
<v Speaker 5>and get somebody out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the ropes,</v>

3910
02:54:30.311 --> 02:54:32.140
<v Speaker 5>the way they use them now in boxing </v>
<v Speaker 5>matches,</v>

3911
02:54:32.141 --> 02:54:32.974
<v Speaker 5>they should fucking outlaw those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fact that Bernard Hopkins can get </v>

3912
02:54:36.191 --> 02:54:38.330
<v Speaker 5>knocked through one like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

3913
02:54:38.380 --> 02:54:40.840
<v Speaker 5>Or the very least.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to protect the outside area.</v>

3914
02:54:41.050 --> 02:54:43.210
<v Speaker 5>You got to pad the shit out of it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you had to have,</v>

3915
02:54:43.300 --> 02:54:47.740
<v Speaker 5>he should have people around and most of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time a thousand fights in a row.</v>

3916
02:54:47.741 --> 02:54:49.780
<v Speaker 5>It's probably never going to come into </v>
<v Speaker 5>play,</v>

3917
02:54:49.930 --> 02:54:50.763
<v Speaker 5>but the onetime it does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're responsible for that guy falling </v>

3918
02:54:53.111 --> 02:54:54.790
<v Speaker 5>through the ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking stupid.</v>

3919
02:54:55.150 --> 02:54:55.983
<v Speaker 5>Like look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes flying through men look a </v>

3920
02:54:58.031 --> 02:54:58.864
<v Speaker 5>little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lengthen that kids' arms so it doesn't </v>

3921
02:55:00.281 --> 02:55:01.114
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks photoshop like his head is not </v>

3922
02:55:02.081 --> 02:55:03.200
<v Speaker 5>the right size or something.</v>

3923
02:55:03.260 --> 02:55:04.490
<v Speaker 5>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's built for it.</v>

3924
02:55:04.491 --> 02:55:07.550
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got great genetics and works hard.</v>

3925
02:55:07.551 --> 02:55:09.050
<v Speaker 5>Tough kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really good fighter.</v>

3926
02:55:09.080 --> 02:55:11.300
<v Speaker 5>Had Chin line if you like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>huh?</v>

3927
02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:12.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's an animal.</v>

3928
02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:14.153
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was super impressed with his poise to </v>

3929
02:55:15.681 --> 02:55:17.490
<v Speaker 5>in fighting a guy like Bernard Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3930
02:55:17.500 --> 02:55:18.333
<v Speaker 5>that guy stepped up in a big way and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a two to one underdog leaning into </v>

3931
02:55:22.191 --> 02:55:23.780
<v Speaker 5>that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is really crazy.</v>

3932
02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:26.810
<v Speaker 5>What's APP?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3933
02:55:27.070 --> 02:55:28.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was pretty convinced that,</v>

3934
02:55:28.641 --> 02:55:29.474
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bernard was going to be able to stifle </v>

3935
02:55:31.581 --> 02:55:35.450
<v Speaker 5>him and turn it into like the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight that Bernard likes,</v>

3936
02:55:35.690 --> 02:55:37.370
<v Speaker 5>but I wasn't sure if Bernard could win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3937
02:55:37.371 --> 02:55:40.370
<v Speaker 5>it's a long time off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two years when you're 51 years old.</v>

3938
02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:43.190
<v Speaker 5>It's a long time off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He still fought amazing.</v>

3939
02:55:43.820 --> 02:55:45.440
<v Speaker 5>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that kid marked him.</v>

3940
02:55:46.220 --> 02:55:48.590
<v Speaker 5>He just was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was just too much and he was,</v>

3941
02:55:48.620 --> 02:55:49.453
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a guy that would have been a real </v>

3942
02:55:50.901 --> 02:55:54.230
<v Speaker 5>threat at any time in anyone's career.</v>

3943
02:55:54.500 --> 02:55:55.333
<v Speaker 5>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kid has real talent and right now </v>

3944
02:55:57.621 --> 02:55:58.454
<v Speaker 5>he's not thought of as being the best </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighter in the world or anything even </v>

3945
02:56:00.261 --> 02:56:03.260
<v Speaker 5>close to like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But Bernard was at one point in time,</v>

3946
02:56:03.261 --> 02:56:05.150
<v Speaker 5>Bernard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when he beat Felix Trinidad,</v>

3947
02:56:05.540 --> 02:56:06.373
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people were saying that might </v>
<v Speaker 5>be the best pound for pound box or the </v>

3948
02:56:08.721 --> 02:56:09.554
<v Speaker 5>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a lot of people thought Trinidad </v>

3949
02:56:10.491 --> 02:56:13.580
<v Speaker 5>was going to beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He fucked Trinidad up and then he fought</v>

3950
02:56:13.581 --> 02:56:17.000
<v Speaker 5>Kelly pavlick and a lot of people wrote </v>
<v Speaker 5>him off against Kelly Pavlik.</v>

3951
02:56:17.270 --> 02:56:22.070
<v Speaker 5>He box the shit out of Kelly Pavlick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so you look at like Bernard's legacy</v>

3952
02:56:22.071 --> 02:56:22.521
<v Speaker 5>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3953
02:56:22.521 --> 02:56:27.521
<v Speaker 5>this is an unbelievably skillful guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But at any point in that career that Joe</v>

3954
02:56:28.010 --> 02:56:30.110
<v Speaker 5>Kelly kid would have been a handful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just scary.</v>

3955
02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:31.233
<v Speaker 5>He's or Joe Smith rather that Joe Smith </v>
<v Speaker 5>junior kid would have been a handful </v>

3956
02:56:34.401 --> 02:56:35.960
<v Speaker 5>because he's just fucking scary.</v>

3957
02:56:36.630 --> 02:56:41.090
<v Speaker 5>He hits hard and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's super accurate and he's got awesome</v>

3958
02:56:41.091 --> 02:56:41.924
<v Speaker 5>endurance and a great work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's fucking dangerous no matter what </v>

3959
02:56:44.780 --> 02:56:46.520
<v Speaker 5>era it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Bernard,</v>

3960
02:56:46.850 --> 02:56:47.683
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe Bernard would have been able to </v>

3961
02:56:48.351 --> 02:56:50.510
<v Speaker 5>beat him in his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in his prime.</v>

3962
02:56:50.690 --> 02:56:52.460
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's totally possible.</v>

3963
02:56:53.120 --> 02:56:56.000
<v Speaker 5>It's 100% likely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean Bernard's and all time.</v>

3964
02:56:56.001 --> 02:56:56.834
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it would have been able to land </v>

3965
02:56:57.801 --> 02:56:59.570
<v Speaker 5>more of the punches that he landed in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that fight.</v>

3966
02:56:59.870 --> 02:57:03.620
<v Speaker 5>But you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that kids dangerous boxing such a</v>

3967
02:57:03.621 --> 02:57:06.650
<v Speaker 5>crazy sport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3968
02:57:06.830 --> 02:57:07.663
<v Speaker 5>it's weird that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we all know now that it's so bad for </v>

3969
02:57:11.421 --> 02:57:13.760
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so bad for your brain.</v>

3970
02:57:14.210 --> 02:57:15.980
<v Speaker 5>Like the practice of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3971
02:57:16.130 --> 02:57:18.770
<v Speaker 5>the doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know it's terrible for you,</v>

3972
02:57:18.771 --> 02:57:22.430
<v Speaker 5>but we still watch just like football,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like I'm in May.</v>

3973
02:57:23.660 --> 02:57:25.660
<v Speaker 5>We know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3974
02:57:25.740 --> 02:57:26.573
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's going to make training </v>

3975
02:57:27.411 --> 02:57:29.360
<v Speaker 5>smarter because I don't think the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting is going ever end.</v>

3976
02:57:30.470 --> 02:57:33.500
<v Speaker 5>Cause we like p some people don't train </v>
<v Speaker 5>smarter though.</v>

3977
02:57:33.710 --> 02:57:36.590
<v Speaker 5>You could train anyway you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem.</v>

3978
02:57:36.591 --> 02:57:37.424
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knows who's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Eddie Alvarez sparred like a </v>

3979
02:57:39.231 --> 02:57:41.430
<v Speaker 5>hundred rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3980
02:57:41.510 --> 02:57:42.343
<v Speaker 5>in preparation for his fight against </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hofeld Osan Joseph sparred like a shit </v>

3981
02:57:45.361 --> 02:57:48.020
<v Speaker 5>load and came out looking like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>monster.</v>

3982
02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:49.670
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just stormed.</v>

3983
02:57:49.671 --> 02:57:51.170
<v Speaker 5>Dosantos knocked him out in the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>round.</v>

3984
02:57:51.890 --> 02:57:54.200
<v Speaker 5>But then connor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3985
02:57:54.260 --> 02:57:57.680
<v Speaker 5>connor doesn't his bar that much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't spoil like that.</v>

3986
02:57:57.681 --> 02:57:58.514
<v Speaker 5>Like the way Alvarez was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And some guys aren't like Donald's </v>

3987
02:58:00.341 --> 02:58:01.800
<v Speaker 5>Sarone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not sparring at all.</v>

3988
02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:06.180
<v Speaker 5>Donald cerrone's just doing drills and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he looks better than ever.</v>

3989
02:58:06.690 --> 02:58:08.280
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just fucking head kicked.</v>

3990
02:58:08.281 --> 02:58:09.114
<v Speaker 5>Mack Mack Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's ever knocked out Matt Brown </v>

3991
02:58:11.461 --> 02:58:12.360
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3992
02:58:12.361 --> 02:58:14.300
<v Speaker 5>people have stopped him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3993
02:58:14.310 --> 02:58:15.143
<v Speaker 5>Jake Ellenberger is the only one that </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever stopped him and he stopped him in </v>

3994
02:58:16.521 --> 02:58:19.660
<v Speaker 5>the shot to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How the anybody else before that?</v>

3995
02:58:19.661 --> 02:58:22.470
<v Speaker 5>It's stopped him with body shots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've heard them.</v>

3996
02:58:23.580 --> 02:58:25.620
<v Speaker 5>But this is like a beating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3997
02:58:25.621 --> 02:58:28.080
<v Speaker 5>and Donald Donald Head kicked him </v>
<v Speaker 5>unconscious.</v>

3998
02:58:28.081 --> 02:58:28.531
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was,</v>

3999
02:58:28.531 --> 02:58:33.150
<v Speaker 5>that's like as final of victory as it </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets.</v>

4000
02:58:33.540 --> 02:58:36.120
<v Speaker 5>And he's not even sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says he feels way better now,</v>

4001
02:58:36.120 --> 02:58:36.260
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

4002
02:58:36.260 --> 02:58:37.310
<v Speaker 1>as a veteran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

4003
02:58:37.311 --> 02:58:39.470
<v Speaker 1>as veteran as it comes to like a new guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in,</v>

4004
02:58:39.620 --> 02:58:41.660
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't sound like you shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>sparring.</v>

4005
02:58:41.661 --> 02:58:42.494
<v Speaker 1>You should probably be sparring a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit to the whole key is to get somebody </v>

4006
02:58:45.021 --> 02:58:47.210
<v Speaker 1>who spars with you that's not trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt you,</v>

4007
02:58:47.390 --> 02:58:49.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's just trying to grow with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and learn.</v>

4008
02:58:49.490 --> 02:58:51.950
<v Speaker 1>That's so hard because egos get involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>late.</v>

4009
02:58:51.951 --> 02:58:55.040
<v Speaker 1>George would never hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4010
02:58:55.580 --> 02:58:56.091
<v Speaker 1>Boy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>George.</v>

4011
02:58:56.091 --> 02:58:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Who would never heard you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4012
02:59:00.100 --> 02:59:01.010
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

4013
02:59:02.050 --> 02:59:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else are we going to go?</v>

4014
02:59:04.760 --> 02:59:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know we were that deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it's four 30 oh it's almost tried</v>

4015
02:59:09.471 --> 02:59:11.230

<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

4016
02:59:11.250 --> 02:59:13.020
<v Speaker 1>It's going to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4017
02:59:13.021 --> 02:59:15.170
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only time you can drive,</v>

4018
02:59:15.171 --> 02:59:16.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have a seven o'clock show.</v>

4019
02:59:16.461 --> 02:59:19.170
<v Speaker 1>You literally have to leave now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is there?</v>

4020
02:59:19.700 --> 02:59:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you take 'em you know you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>

4021
02:59:21.350 --> 02:59:23.640
<v Speaker 1>you should take the two 10 to go.</v>

4022
02:59:23.640 --> 02:59:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I went 34 to 10 and then go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4023
02:59:25.430 --> 02:59:27.440
<v Speaker 1>well you can go up to one 18 you can go </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot,</v>

<v Speaker 1>go down to Topanga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took the Panga to the one 18 tick the </v>

4025
02:59:31.461 --> 02:59:34.310
<v Speaker 1>one 18 to the to 10 you'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will take you more miles.</v>

4026
02:59:34.670 --> 02:59:37.520
<v Speaker 1>But then you dropped down instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>going through this shit.</v>

4027
02:59:37.580 --> 02:59:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go through that four or five</v>

4028
02:59:39.530 --> 02:59:41.450
<v Speaker 1>like this time of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do that.</v>

4029
02:59:41.990 --> 02:59:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Or the five either one of those can suck</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fat one.</v>

4030
02:59:44.590 --> 02:59:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the five just ridiculous.</v>

4031
02:59:46.631 --> 02:59:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Five is always under construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny how we have people in the</v>

4032
02:59:49.551 --> 02:59:53.070
<v Speaker 1>La talk talk like this though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like about highways and yeah.</v>

4033
02:59:53.240 --> 02:59:56.870
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen like that in Ohio or </v>
<v Speaker 1>well they don't have as many people.</v>

4034
02:59:56.890 --> 02:59:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've fucked up.</v>

4035
02:59:58.520 --> 02:59:59.353
<v Speaker 1>This is a great spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many people found out and they all </v>

4036
03:00:01.461 --> 03:00:02.294
<v Speaker 1>just moved here.</v>

4037
03:00:02.450 --> 03:00:03.283
<v Speaker 1>There's way too many people here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of looked us up one day to the </v>

4038
03:00:05.780 --> 03:00:08.120
<v Speaker 1>freeways here where all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't always called numbers.</v>

4039
03:00:08.121 --> 03:00:11.150
<v Speaker 1>They were called like this was like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ventura freeway in the Hollywood highway</v>

4040
03:00:11.151 --> 03:00:11.984
<v Speaker 1>and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so they changed the names and </v>

4041
03:00:13.131 --> 03:00:13.964
<v Speaker 1>people just drop what they used to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and just call the one on one de </v>

4042
03:00:16.501 --> 03:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>four oh five no one 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's only out here,</v>

4043
03:00:18.741 --> 03:00:19.574
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's not that many different </v>

4044
03:00:20.511 --> 03:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>freeways and other places really either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

4045
03:00:23.030 --> 03:00:27.640
<v Speaker 1>even if you go somewhere you would like </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Massachusetts you'd say you a,</v>

4046
03:00:27.650 --> 03:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>you get on four or five south,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4047
03:00:30.051 --> 03:00:31.790
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't say it's about four or </v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

4048
03:00:31.791 --> 03:00:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean by the was only added</v>

4049
03:00:33.741 --> 03:00:36.080
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't refer the freeways </v>
<v Speaker 1>here as number.</v>

4050
03:00:36.081 --> 03:00:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Is this the one that one was only the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ventura freeway or a highway or whatever</v>

4051
03:00:40.431 --> 03:00:40.840
<v Speaker 1>the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4052
03:00:40.840 --> 03:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>that was the case in Boston with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass turnpike.</v>

4053
03:00:43.310 --> 03:00:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Like the mass turnpike was called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass turnpike,</v>

4054
03:00:45.591 --> 03:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>but it also had a number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you look on a map.</v>

4055
03:00:48.260 --> 03:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>It would be the number and then the mass</v>
<v Speaker 1>turnpike,</v>

4056
03:00:50.241 --> 03:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>like what does this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's got a royal distinction.</v>

4057
03:00:53.840 --> 03:00:56.780
<v Speaker 1>The Mass Turnpike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does is this route 90 wait,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to spoil it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4135
03:04:01.220 --> 03:04:03.440
<v Speaker 1>I got away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got away with it for like a week and a</v>

4136
03:04:03.441 --> 03:04:04.100
<v Speaker 1>half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

4139
03:04:10.521 --> 03:04:13.670
<v Speaker 1>But like people get mad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the deal.</v>

4140
03:04:14.150 --> 03:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>There's so much to talk about today that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we support,</v>

4141
03:04:17.300 --> 03:04:18.133
<v Speaker 1>if we didn't talk about like certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>television shows and certain movies </v>

4142
03:04:20.751 --> 03:04:23.300
<v Speaker 1>because of spoiler alerts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4143
03:04:23.301 --> 03:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

4144
03:04:24.010 --> 03:04:26.270
<v Speaker 1>you've got to take your chances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want things to be secret,</v>

4145
03:04:26.271 --> 03:04:28.010
<v Speaker 1>you've got to stay offline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4146
03:04:28.040 --> 03:04:29.930
<v Speaker 1>If it means something to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay offline.</v>

4147
03:04:30.950 --> 03:04:31.783
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise people are going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and don't get mad at people for </v>

4148
03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:37.760
<v Speaker 1>deferred using information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4149
03:04:37.880 --> 03:04:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Amen,</v>

03:04:38.990 --> 03:04:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that important to make time or just</v>

4151
03:04:42.801 --> 03:04:43.634
<v Speaker 1>deal with the fact that if you dip your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking nose into the information </v>

4152
03:04:46.131 --> 03:04:46.964
<v Speaker 1>highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get some information up </v>

<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

4154
03:04:49.610 --> 03:04:50.443
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe westworld and lost this </v>

4155

<v Speaker 1>He just made that up.</v>

4157
03:04:57.681 --> 03:04:59.510
<v Speaker 1>But it is sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same guy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be the same world.</v>

4159
03:05:02.240 --> 03:05:03.950
<v Speaker 1>We never know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>What is that about?</v>

4180
03:05:46.580 --> 03:05:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Is it science?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fictiony?</v>

4181
03:05:47.710 --> 03:05:48.980
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it,</v>

4182
03:05:48.981 --> 03:05:50.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she was blind and she came back and</v>

4183
03:05:50.871 --> 03:05:51.704
<v Speaker 1>she could see and she disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not knowing what something's about and </v>

4184
03:05:53.601 --> 03:05:54.980
<v Speaker 1>then just watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sucks.</v>

4185
03:05:54.981 --> 03:05:57.500
<v Speaker 1>It sucks if whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wasted your time,</v>

4186
03:05:57.501 --> 03:05:59.900
<v Speaker 1>but if you find something cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the coolest way to find something.</v>

4187
03:06:00.140 --> 03:06:01.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm really getting in the house of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cards.</v>

4188
03:06:02.180 --> 03:06:03.560

4189
03:06:03.561 --> 03:06:04.394

<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of that is actually </v>

4190
03:06:05.961 --> 03:06:09.590
<v Speaker 1>how things go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% it seems like it,</v>

4191
03:06:09.591 --> 03:06:12.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know so much right now about what's</v>

4192
03:06:12.411 --> 03:06:14.570

<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

<v Speaker 1>craziness like good fucking chat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of west wing when it was out,</v>

4196
03:06:24.081 --> 03:06:26.450

<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
