1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.803
<v Speaker 1>Huh</v>

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.450
<v Speaker 2>that quickly to one.</v>

3
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're alive.</v>

4
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Mr Polin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you?</v>

5
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Pay Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good to be here this two way.</v>

6
00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:11.900
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.130
<v Speaker 2>What's happening man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you?</v>

8
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good to be in la.</v>

9
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good to have you here.</v>

10
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.350
<v Speaker 2>I've been a fan of your work for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time man.</v>

11
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.213
<v Speaker 2>And I got really excited when I found </v>
<v Speaker 2>out that you were writing a book on </v>

12
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.710
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

13
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

14
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an amazing subject and I'm,</v>

15
00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad someone who's respected </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself is getting it.</v>

16
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.210
<v Speaker 2>It's a crackpot subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

17
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:33.950
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those subjects you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

18
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Michael Pollan found drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's he doing?</v>

19
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 2>He's having a crisis and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing mushrooms,</v>

20
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:41.084
<v Speaker 2>it is a bit of a departure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there are people who are </v>

21
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 2>expecting another book on food or </v>
<v Speaker 2>agriculture.</v>

22
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Speaker 2>We're a little surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

23
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.250
<v Speaker 2>but so far people have been following </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

24
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cared about food and ag and there,</v>

25
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.870
<v Speaker 2>there's more overlap than I ever would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have guessed.</v>

26
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.763
<v Speaker 2>I think you caught the perfect wave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think your book is coming out right </v>

27
00:00:58.071 --> 00:00:58.904
<v Speaker 2>when John Hopkins research centers </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to put out these studies on it </v>

28
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:03.604
<v Speaker 2>and people are starting to recognize it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>MTMA has amazing results for </v>

29
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.640
<v Speaker 2>posttraumatic stress disorder from </v>
<v Speaker 2>veterans and marijuana is becoming legal</v>

30
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:13.460
<v Speaker 2>in more and more states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're catching this wave.</v>

31
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

32
00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:16.034
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never know where the culture is </v>

33
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:18.830
<v Speaker 2>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause you started book years before.</v>

34
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.600
<v Speaker 2>How long did you start it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

35
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I started the research in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

36
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.293
<v Speaker 2>2014.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a piece for the New Yorker </v>

37
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 2>called the trip treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

38
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 2>which is online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

39
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.440
<v Speaker 2>and it was my first foray into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

40
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:33.890
<v Speaker 2>I went down to Hopkins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been a lot of time at Nyu.</v>

41
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.910
<v Speaker 2>And at the time they were doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting trial where they were</v>

42
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 2>giving psilocybin to people with cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnoses,</v>

43
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.713
<v Speaker 2>many of whom were terminal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that seemed like such a weird idea </v>

44
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 2>to me that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was curious to explore it.</v>

45
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 2>And I spent a lot of time talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>patients,</v>

46
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.750
<v Speaker 2>many of whom were dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:51.584
<v Speaker 2>about how this single high dose silicide</v>
<v Speaker 2>been experience a guided silicide and </v>

48
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.923
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we should talk a little bit about </v>

49
00:01:58.311 --> 00:02:00.580
<v Speaker 2>how the guided changes things for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

50
00:02:00.581 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Speaker 2>it's not the image people have is </v>
<v Speaker 2>popping some mushrooms in your mouth and</v>

51
00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:05.360
<v Speaker 2>maybe go to a concert or going to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beach.</v>

52
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:08.870
<v Speaker 2>But this is a very controlled internal </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

53
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely reset these people's attitude</v>

54
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:15.680
<v Speaker 2>toward death and it allowed them to die </v>
<v Speaker 2>with equanimity.</v>

55
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.550
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

56
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when these results were published,</v>

57
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just last year,</v>

58
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 2>they found that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

59
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.390
<v Speaker 2>that in 80% of the people who had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>session,</v>

60
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.593
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had statistically significant </v>

61
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 2>reductions in standard measures of </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression and anxiety.</v>

62
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.133
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the most effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric interventions that the </v>

63
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:38.810
<v Speaker 2>psychiatrist had ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

64
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:40.760
<v Speaker 2>which is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a single experience.</v>

65
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 2>And then a molecule could change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>contents of your head to the,</v>

66
00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:47.810
<v Speaker 2>to the extent that you would rethink </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mortality.</v>

67
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.753
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so as I began talking to these </v>

68
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:54.320
<v Speaker 2>people and hearing their stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of which were just remarkable,</v>

69
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.790
<v Speaker 2>I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

70
00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:58.700
<v Speaker 2>this is not just an article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a book here and there's,</v>

71
00:02:58.701 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 2>there are two kinds of articles you </v>
<v Speaker 2>write as a journalist.</v>

73
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 2>One is you f you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sick of the topic by the time you</v>

74
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 2>finished and you can't wait to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other is,</v>

75
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just scratched the surface.</v>

76
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.583
<v Speaker 2>And this was one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have any experiences personally </v>

77
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 2>with psychedelics before you wrote this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very Limited,</v>

78
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

79
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 2>for some peculiar reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never did psychedelics in college.</v>

80
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 2>They just weren't around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went into the round,</v>

81
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.823
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the wrong school and I was </v>

82
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 2>like a very kind of progressive hippie </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

83
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I went to Bennington college in Vermont </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there were,</v>

84
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>there was lsd there before me and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was lsd after me.</v>

85
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 2>But I was in this little wrinkle in time</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there was only alcohol.</v>

86
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.460
<v Speaker 2>I need a cut there guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks Jamie.</v>

87
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Crazy only alcohol in college and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't,</v>

88
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 2>so I had no experience of psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

89
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 2>until I was in my late twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it was,</v>

90
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty mild.</v>

91
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 2>I had a couple of mushroom experiences </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would,</v>

92
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 2>I now describe as the aesthetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

93
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once small doses,</v>

94
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.720
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

95
00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:01.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never measured,</v>

96
00:04:01.801 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 2>it was probably one gram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd never had a big trip.</v>

97
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

98
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.963
<v Speaker 2>and there was another reason I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel psychologically sturdy </v>

99
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 2>enough and I came of age just when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

100
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 2>the scare stories about psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 2>were everywhere in the culture.</v>

101
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would scramble your chromosomes,</v>

102
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 2>you'd stare at the sun until you went </v>
<v Speaker 2>blind.</v>

103
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:23.644
<v Speaker 2>the person who took all the orange </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunshine and thought he was an orange </v>

105
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 2>for the rest of his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 2>these stories are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was afraid to,</v>

107
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 2>I was just afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

108
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.530
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

109
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 2>it's not an unfounded fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

110
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:38.051
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

111
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 2>people can really get into psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>

112
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really important that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people understand that a,</v>

113
00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a profound,</v>

114
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>destabilizing experience.</v>

115
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.593
<v Speaker 2>And depending on your mindset and your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the situation in which you take it </v>

116
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 2>set and setting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be I'm ecstatic or horrific.</v>

117
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

118
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:00.724
<v Speaker 2>there are many people who had a series </v>
<v Speaker 2>of very good trips and then they have </v>

119
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:04.930
<v Speaker 2>that one bad trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

120
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.183
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I and I had heard enough stories about </v>

121
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:09.670
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

122
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stay away.</v>

123
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

124
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 2>so discovering this kind of later in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

125
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

126
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 2>I was certainly not something I planned </v>
<v Speaker 2>on or expected.</v>

127
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a</v>

128
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.093
<v Speaker 3>great tragedy and in my opinion that our</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture has demonized these substances </v>

129
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:30.330
<v Speaker 3>and put them in this category of </v>
<v Speaker 3>forbidden fruit to the point where you,</v>

130
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're so nervous about doing them,</v>

131
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.323
<v Speaker 3>you have to get him from some shady </v>
<v Speaker 3>character and you don't know where </v>

132
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:37.121
<v Speaker 3>you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

133
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 3>You have to do them in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

134
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.200
<v Speaker 3>in secrecy you have to be really </v>
<v Speaker 3>careful.</v>

135
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.483
<v Speaker 3>But we also at the same time are aware </v>
<v Speaker 3>of all these incredibly positive </v>

136
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:46.534
<v Speaker 3>benefits from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if we just had professional </v>

137
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:49.774
<v Speaker 3>places where we could go to and when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have these rehab facilities that are </v>

138
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:53.794
<v Speaker 3>available for people trying to kick </v>
<v Speaker 3>opiates and people trying to get their </v>

139
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:56.734
<v Speaker 3>life together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we had something similar like a </v>

140
00:05:58.911 --> 00:05:59.744
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic facility with registered </v>
<v Speaker 3>professionals who understand this and </v>

141
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:05.444
<v Speaker 3>who could evaluate you psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand if you're perhaps taking </v>

142
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:12.010
<v Speaker 3>medication that would adversely affect </v>
<v Speaker 3>your trip,</v>

143
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.890
<v Speaker 3>try to find out who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where,</v>

144
00:06:13.891 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 3>what state you're at in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you had any experiences before?</v>

145
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.530
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you should put you on a low dose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

146
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.843
<v Speaker 3>Hold up slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's try something small and see how </v>

147
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 3>you react to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I think,</v>

148
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.603
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people like myself or pot </v>
<v Speaker 3>smokers or people who've done </v>

149
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we do it any favors either</v>

150
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:34.904
<v Speaker 3>because we're always trying to pretend </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is no adverse effects and </v>

151
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 3>that there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

152
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they get into something,</v>

153
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:41.624
<v Speaker 3>they want everybody to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've been guilty of this myself and </v>

154
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:44.374
<v Speaker 3>people tell us</v>

155
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a occupational hazard of a,</v>

156
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:49.570
<v Speaker 2>of a irrational exuberance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

157
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.220
<v Speaker 2>this is what happened to Timothy Leary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

158
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.103
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have an amazing experience and </v>

159
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 2>the first thing they think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's got to do this.</v>

160
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 2>But it isn't for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you're absolutely right.</v>

161
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

162
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 2>there are risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these are not drugs of abuse,</v>

163
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're nonaddictive,</v>

164
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.463
<v Speaker 2>they're anti addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thought after having a big </v>

165
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic trip is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when can I do this again?</v>

166
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.063
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

167
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

168
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 3>The last one I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

169
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:15.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I could do that again.</v>

170
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just felt that way every time it's </v>

171
00:07:17.431 --> 00:07:20.780
<v Speaker 2>like childbirth or how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we here try childbirth is you'd,</v>

172
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.010
<v Speaker 2>you can't imagine doing it again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually you do.</v>

173
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.810
<v Speaker 2>You do do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

174
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.580
<v Speaker 2>so I do think that we have to find the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper context in which to do it.</v>

175
00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:31.680
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think your point is really important.</v>

176
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.320
<v Speaker 2>We need trained guides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

177
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.800
<v Speaker 2>the experience is completely different </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's guided.</v>

178
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have a sense of safety.</v>

179
00:07:41.581 --> 00:07:44.430
<v Speaker 2>There's someone looking out for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body while your mind is traveling.</v>

180
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.690
<v Speaker 2>And this allows you to essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrender to the experience.</v>

181
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.553
<v Speaker 2>And most bad trips in my experience are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the result of people resisting what is </v>

182
00:07:53.761 --> 00:07:57.690
<v Speaker 2>happening there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ego is dissolving and it's scary.</v>

183
00:07:57.691 --> 00:07:58.524
<v Speaker 2>It feels like a death and they try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop it and that can make you very </v>

184
00:08:01.531 --> 00:08:02.364
<v Speaker 2>anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so all the guides I worked with and </v>

185
00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:06.660
<v Speaker 2>interviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were all like,</v>

186
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.790
<v Speaker 2>relax your mind and float downstream.</v>

187
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.240
<v Speaker 2>If you see a door open it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you see a staircase go down.</v>

188
00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:13.320
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

189
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrender trust and let go.</v>

190
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.620
<v Speaker 2>And this kind of advice changes </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

191
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.513
<v Speaker 2>And the chances of a bad trip I think in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guided situation are substantially </v>

192
00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:25.404
<v Speaker 2>less because they know how to help you </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with it and what to tell you when </v>

193
00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:30.030
<v Speaker 2>it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

194
00:08:30.031 --> 00:08:32.460
<v Speaker 2>so I do think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

195
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.533
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by forcing these drugs underground and </v>

196
00:08:36.091 --> 00:08:40.000
<v Speaker 2>into this very kind of unregulated use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

197
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.153
<v Speaker 2>there were not reports of bad trips were</v>
<v Speaker 2>much fewer before the moral panic about </v>

198
00:08:46.171 --> 00:08:50.400
<v Speaker 2>lsd in 1965 and when it was still legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

199
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.500
<v Speaker 2>you didn't hear about bad trips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

200
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:53.363
<v Speaker 2>you started hearing about it when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture did this one and turned against </v>

201
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:57.803
<v Speaker 2>a psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think you can create situations </v>

202
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 2>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

203
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 2>the risks are really mitigated.</v>

204
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.573
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think also the fear like you were </v>

205
00:09:05.201 --> 00:09:06.430
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

206
00:09:06.431 --> 00:09:09.400
<v Speaker 3>but for the podcast or right as we </v>
<v Speaker 3>started,</v>

207
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.333
<v Speaker 3>what some people worried that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to turn into an orange or think </v>

208
00:09:12.701 --> 00:09:13.534
<v Speaker 3>they're an orange or all those fears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take something and those things </v>

209
00:09:16.361 --> 00:09:17.194
<v Speaker 3>are in the back of your head and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can literally manifest extreme </v>

210
00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:21.934
<v Speaker 3>anxiety that might not have been there </v>
<v Speaker 3>if he just relaxed and just had the </v>

211
00:09:25.391 --> 00:09:27.520
<v Speaker 3>experience alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

212
00:09:27.521 --> 00:09:30.310
<v Speaker 3>a on its own without all the cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>hysteria</v>

213
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.830
<v Speaker 2>attached to it or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or episodes of paranoia.</v>

214
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.540
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's common too.</v>

215
00:09:34.541 --> 00:09:35.374
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a good guide can work you through </v>

216
00:09:36.821 --> 00:09:37.654
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually they don't even like the </v>

217
00:09:38.921 --> 00:09:39.754
<v Speaker 2>term bad trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call it a challenging trip because </v>

218
00:09:41.291 --> 00:09:45.040
<v Speaker 2>often very interesting material comes up</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you then can work on later.</v>

219
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.293
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like having a nightmare and you </v>

220
00:09:47.141 --> 00:09:48.730
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>analyzing it with your shrink,</v>

221
00:09:48.731 --> 00:09:50.890
<v Speaker 2>it actually may be very productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

222
00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:52.720
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

223
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

224
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.273
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of a nervous nelly going into</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and I really looked at the whole </v>

225
00:09:57.161 --> 00:10:00.400
<v Speaker 2>risk profile and on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the physiological side,</v>

226
00:10:00.401 --> 00:10:03.820
<v Speaker 2>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the risks are remarkably low.</v>

227
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.980
<v Speaker 2>And I'm speaking here of the classic </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics.</v>

228
00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about Mtma or even pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really,</v>

229
00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:13.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about LSD silicide man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is magic mushrooms.</v>

230
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>DMT Mescalin.</v>

231
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.753
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are much less toxic than many of </v>

232
00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:23.710
<v Speaker 2>the over the counter drugs you have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your medicine cabinet.</v>

233
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.230
<v Speaker 2>There's no lethal dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is remarkable.</v>

234
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.800
<v Speaker 2>There's one elephant that was killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with LSD once.</v>

235
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.290
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to see what it would take </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was this,</v>

236
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:33.363
<v Speaker 2>they gave it a massive dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to get it to the point where they </v>

237
00:10:36.431 --> 00:10:37.264
<v Speaker 2>could administer it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to give it a massive dose of </v>

238
00:10:38.321 --> 00:10:39.154
<v Speaker 2>tranquilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it isn't actually clear that the LSD </v>

239
00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:43.540
<v Speaker 2>killed it may have been the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Benzos or whatever they were given.</v>

240
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.310
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a horrible thing,</v>

241
00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:46.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go online and look up,</v>

242
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the elephant who died from LSD.</v>

243
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Crazy idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

244
00:10:51.371 --> 00:10:54.370
<v Speaker 2>and when Quincy was going through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>elephants mind before it,</v>

245
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.950
<v Speaker 2>animals don't like psychedelics that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

246
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that if you,</v>

247
00:10:58.151 --> 00:10:58.984
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that classic set up that drug abuse </v>

248
00:11:00.401 --> 00:11:03.380
<v Speaker 2>researchers use where they put a rat in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a cage and they had,</v>

249
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.040
<v Speaker 2>there's a lever and they could </v>
<v Speaker 2>administer cocaine or heroin,</v>

250
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they can have lunch and they'll press</v>

251
00:11:09.131 --> 00:11:12.980
<v Speaker 2>the cocaine lever till they die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put Lsd in that setup,</v>

252
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:17.650
<v Speaker 2>they press it once and never again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

253
00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 3>set up is always screwy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

254
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:23.300
<v Speaker 3>because they really shouldn't be in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation and it's not a natural setup.</v>

255
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Like that's been critical.</v>

256
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.230
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there somebody in Vancouver,</v>

257
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.690
<v Speaker 2>these really cool rat park experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

258
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.930
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're referencing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

259
00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.930
<v Speaker 2>basically they thought that this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitably what happens.</v>

260
00:11:34.931 --> 00:11:35.764
<v Speaker 2>But in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you give a rat a beautiful cage with </v>

261
00:11:38.231 --> 00:11:42.490
<v Speaker 2>some things to play with some other rats</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hang out with some nature,</v>

262
00:11:42.491 --> 00:11:44.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some shrubs and things,</v>

263
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.750
<v Speaker 2>it will not take the cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that interesting.</v>

264
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.110
<v Speaker 2>It tells us that environment has a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with drug addiction.</v>

265
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.550
<v Speaker 2>I think for sure with human beings too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

266
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.433
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings in these really fruitless </v>

267
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 2>lives that are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very frustrating.</v>

268
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.470
<v Speaker 2>I think about the people who came back </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Vietnam.</v>

269
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

270
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I should say most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a very high percentage of,</v>

271
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.580
<v Speaker 2>of the troops in Vietnam were on heroin </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were there.</v>

272
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 2>They were seemingly addicted.</v>

273
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.680
<v Speaker 2>They were using an all the time and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>got back and only 10% had a problem.</v>

274
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.723
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the others were able to kick it really </v>

275
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:15.850
<v Speaker 2>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very contextual.</v>

276
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:19.420
<v Speaker 2>It's not all biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about environment.</v>

277
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.750
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were researching this book,</v>

278
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you,</v>

279
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.650
<v Speaker 2>did you start doing your own personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>experimentation?</v>

280
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

281
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.830
<v Speaker 2>I had a series of trips for the book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

282
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:34.893
<v Speaker 2>I had become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a couple of reasons I'd become very </v>

283
00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:38.170
<v Speaker 2>curious about the people I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviewing,</v>

284
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:39.423
<v Speaker 2>trying to make sense of how they could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have these transformative trips on a </v>

285
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:45.280
<v Speaker 2>drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which seemed implausible to me.</v>

286
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

287
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.673
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also kind of got jealous of the </v>

288
00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:50.014
<v Speaker 2>experiences they were having.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were having these big spiritual </v>

289
00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:52.780
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I swear,</v>

290
00:12:52.781 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever had a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

291
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:56.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of spiritually retarded </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

292
00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 2>or was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

293
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.693
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized at a certain point I had to </v>

294
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.680
<v Speaker 2>see the experience from inside to </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe it in a book.</v>

295
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.030
<v Speaker 2>It's also kind of my brand as a writer </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I wrote about the cattle industry,</v>

296
00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I bought a steer when I wrote about </v>
<v Speaker 2>architecture,</v>

297
00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:13.414
<v Speaker 2>I built a house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to get my hands dirty and see </v>

298
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:16.174
<v Speaker 2>things from inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a quality of wonder you can </v>

299
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 2>capture doing something for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

300
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.830
<v Speaker 2>So in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact I was psychedelically naive,</v>

301
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.470
<v Speaker 2>I saw as a positive because people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who've,</v>

302
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.423
<v Speaker 2>who really know the territory are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have quite the same first </v>

303
00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:32.470
<v Speaker 2>experience that was going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was really helpful.</v>

304
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.120
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

305
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.310
<v Speaker 2>I did a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

306
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

307
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:42.100
<v Speaker 2>mushroom hunting with Paul stamets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has he been on the show out there?</v>

308
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:43.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a very cool guy.</v>

309
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 2>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's totally crazy.</v>

310
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.353
<v Speaker 2>And he took me to a spot where you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>find the strongest silicide been known </v>

311
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:52.630
<v Speaker 2>to man that he civic northwest.</v>

312
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 2>It's near the mouth of the Columbia </v>
<v Speaker 2>River.</v>

313
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be more specific than that.</v>

314
00:13:57.291 --> 00:13:59.680
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

315
00:13:59.681 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 2>people would their mushroom spots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

316
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.493
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

317
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.220
<v Speaker 2>we went hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like this,</v>

318
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

319
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:10.350
<v Speaker 2>for Lauren December weather and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took me to this place and uh,</v>

320
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:15.400
<v Speaker 2>we spent a couple days outside looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>for these mushrooms and we found a salon</v>

321
00:14:15.401 --> 00:14:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Ossipee as your essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he,</v>

322
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:20.610
<v Speaker 2>he found for the first time and named </v>
<v Speaker 2>after his son is serious.</v>

323
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.633
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who in turn is named after the color of </v>

324
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:24.424
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms when they're bruised as your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's kind of an institute is </v>

325
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:29.050
<v Speaker 2>committed to fungus.</v>

326
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.880
<v Speaker 2>He's all in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is all in wood fungus.</v>

327
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.030
<v Speaker 2>And I was very excited when we found a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple and they're hard.</v>

328
00:14:37.031 --> 00:14:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would not recommend do,</v>

329
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.473
<v Speaker 2>do it yourself with psilocybin just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not like looking for </v>

330
00:14:43.631 --> 00:14:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Chanterelles and morels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

331
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.580
<v Speaker 2>There are mushrooms that look exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>like silicide been that can give you a,</v>

332
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 2>just an agonizing death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

333
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 2>But when you're with Paul stamets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel pretty confident.</v>

334
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

335
00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:57.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we found these and,</v>

336
00:14:57.501 --> 00:14:59.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said to me after we'd found them,</v>

337
00:14:59.271 --> 00:15:00.104
<v Speaker 2>we were sitting around the campfire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were cooking some dinner outside our </v>

338
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Yurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

339
00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:04.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

340
00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:05.310
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

341
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.190
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are almost too strong for me.</v>

342
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:08.331
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

343
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:09.141
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

344
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:09.974
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a side effect that bothers </v>

345
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:11.980
<v Speaker 2>some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

346
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.390
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Temporary paralysis.</v>

347
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know why that would bother anybody.</v>

348
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 2>So weird.</v>

349
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

350
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.780
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Piki Piki Oh my God.</v>

351
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.800
<v Speaker 2>I was a little reluctant to take them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

352
00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I did,</v>

353
00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:26.834
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

354
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.200
<v Speaker 2>my first deals I had been experienced </v>
<v Speaker 2>since my twenties was a,</v>

355
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:33.140
<v Speaker 2>and at the time I was like 60 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>approaching 60.</v>

356
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.393
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to be very vague on where all </v>

357
00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:36.650
<v Speaker 2>these things happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when all these things happen.</v>

358
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

359
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.750
<v Speaker 2>and I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of a wonder,</v>

360
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:44.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a tea and I had a really powerful</v>

361
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:47.450
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very much about being in nature.</v>

362
00:15:47.451 --> 00:15:48.284
<v Speaker 2>I was at our house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a house in New England that </v>

363
00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:53.600
<v Speaker 2>we've had for many years and I was in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>garden and you know,</v>

364
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:54.434
<v Speaker 2>I've written a lot about plants and I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>written about plant intelligence and </v>

365
00:15:56.661 --> 00:15:58.520
<v Speaker 2>planet consciousness and things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

366
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:03.140
<v Speaker 2>And I've always believed intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 2>that plants,</v>

367
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 2>domesticated plants are acting on us.</v>

368
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just,</v>

369
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.790
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a two way street.</v>

370
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.860
<v Speaker 2>We change plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they change us.</v>

371
00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.450
<v Speaker 2>We have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

372
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:13.123
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same way that say the apple tree </v>

373
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:21.290
<v Speaker 2>or the flower is manipulating the B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making it come,</v>

374
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.650
<v Speaker 2>pay attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>offering it nectar and exchange for it,</v>

375
00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:25.484
<v Speaker 2>picking up pollen on its legs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't even realize what it's really </v>

376
00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:29.054
<v Speaker 2>doing is being tricked by the plant into</v>
<v Speaker 2>pollinating it and caring it's genes </v>

377
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.110
<v Speaker 2>down the street or around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's happening to us too.</v>

378
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 2>And plants work on us and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a slightly trippy idea,</v>

379
00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:43.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's just co evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how co evolution works.</v>

380
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Speaker 2>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during this experience,</v>

381
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.380
<v Speaker 2>I felt that in a way I never had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea became flesh.</v>

382
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 2>And I felt that these plants were kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of looking back at me.</v>

383
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they were very benign.</v>

384
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.853
<v Speaker 2>They had only good intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that there were more subjectivities </v>

385
00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.160
<v Speaker 2>in my garden than I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

386
00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:09.620
<v Speaker 2>we go through the world thinking we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thinking subject.</v>

387
00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:10.454
<v Speaker 2>Everything else is an object.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that happens on </v>

388
00:17:12.411 --> 00:17:14.900
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics is everything becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>

389
00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:17.030
<v Speaker 2>has life in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has consciousness in it.</v>

390
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:20.090
<v Speaker 2>And that was a powerful and beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

391
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.943
<v Speaker 2>And so that was my dipping my toes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then after that I sought a guide </v>

392
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.433
<v Speaker 2>because I was trying to simulate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience I was hearing about at </v>

393
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Hopkins and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

394
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Nyu where they were doing these studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

395
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.513
<v Speaker 2>not just with the dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were doing it with smokers and </v>

396
00:17:35.691 --> 00:17:38.270
<v Speaker 2>alcoholics and meditators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different groups.</v>

397
00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:40.400
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't qualify to enter into </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

398
00:17:40.401 --> 00:17:41.234
<v Speaker 2>So I had to go underground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I learned is that </v>

399
00:17:43.971 --> 00:17:48.710
<v Speaker 2>there's this thriving network of </v>
<v Speaker 2>underground guides all over the country.</v>

400
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

401
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.410
<v Speaker 2>but they're very professional people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not drug dealers.</v>

402
00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:00.150
<v Speaker 2>There are therapists and some of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>are trained psychologists or mds in some</v>

403
00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:00.984
<v Speaker 2>cases actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're so convinced of the healing </v>

404
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.410
<v Speaker 2>value of these medicines that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to risk their freedom,</v>

405
00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.353
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their livelihood to work </v>

406
00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:10.854
<v Speaker 2>underground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I found my way into this community </v>

407
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.600
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

408
00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:16.434
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and interviewed a bunch of people and </v>

409
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 2>some of them were not the kind of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to trust your mind to.</v>

410
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:21.983
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no doubt there are lots of </v>

411
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:23.694
<v Speaker 2>charlatans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone I I interview is pretty </v>

412
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:26.543
<v Speaker 2>professional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of them were just a little too </v>

413
00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:31.920
<v Speaker 2>casual about something I was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

414
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worried about.</v>

415
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was one guy,</v>

416
00:18:34.471 --> 00:18:39.471
<v Speaker 2>I remember this Romanian Psycho naut </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapist in his seventies,</v>

417
00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:41.310
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

418
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:41.971
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

419
00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:43.890
<v Speaker 2>what happens if something bad happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

420
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Speaker 2>what if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if somebody dies,</v>

421
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.003
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while they're with you getting this </v>

422
00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:48.480
<v Speaker 2>trip?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

423
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.900
<v Speaker 2>you bury them with all the other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

424
00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:54.420
<v Speaker 2>that kind of casualness really troubled </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

425
00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:56.250
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't work with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

426
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 2>but eventually I found people that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

427
00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:02.970
<v Speaker 2>I trusted and I had a bond with and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had some very powerful,</v>

428
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:06.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences with them and uh,</v>

429
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:07.880
<v Speaker 2>that did change me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

430
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 2>in ways that I'm still kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

431
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.093
<v Speaker 2>digesting</v>

432
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.163
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see you back to the </v>

433
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:17.120
<v Speaker 3>garden thing when you're having this </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience with these plants.</v>

434
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:22.270
<v Speaker 3>I had a experience once on very high </v>
<v Speaker 3>dose of marijuana edibles.</v>

435
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:26.330
<v Speaker 3>I went into a grow room that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

436
00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:28.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>local dispensary had set up.</v>

437
00:19:28.911 --> 00:19:29.744
<v Speaker 3>It's just big room filled with plants </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was the first time I like when I </v>

438
00:19:35.631 --> 00:19:36.464
<v Speaker 3>walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the first time I've ever been </v>

439
00:19:37.221 --> 00:19:40.100
<v Speaker 3>around pot plants where I felt like they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are aware that I was there.</v>

440
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.250
<v Speaker 3>It was very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It you,</v>

441
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:44.143
<v Speaker 3>you had this weird feeling of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>having much more sensitivity than you </v>

442
00:19:49.611 --> 00:19:53.360
<v Speaker 3>imagined that they are aware of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as you said,</v>

443
00:19:53.361 --> 00:19:55.700
<v Speaker 3>they're benign and they just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting there.</v>

444
00:19:55.701 --> 00:19:56.534
<v Speaker 3>But it was almost like they were saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>hello to me or that they recognize that </v>

445
00:19:59.091 --> 00:20:02.300
<v Speaker 3>I could tune into them because I was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>barbecue that I was,</v>

446
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:03.163
<v Speaker 3>I was on their wavelength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're out there with those plants </v>

447
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:10.760
<v Speaker 3>and you said that you felt consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 3>from them now as an intelligent,</v>

448
00:20:10.761 --> 00:20:11.594
<v Speaker 3>rational person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you start pondering whether or not </v>

449
00:20:14.301 --> 00:20:15.134
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just perceiving this because it </v>

450
00:20:16.611 --> 00:20:17.444
<v Speaker 3>was convenient and you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>hallucinating and adding all this </v>

451
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.560
<v Speaker 3>contextual weirdness to this situation?</v>

452
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.141
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

453
00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure I was projecting things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to them,</v>

454
00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:30.210
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've looked at this question and the</v>

455
00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:31.820
<v Speaker 2>science of it pretty closely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

456
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:36.090
<v Speaker 2>And how you define consciousness matters</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

457
00:20:36.091 --> 00:20:40.440
<v Speaker 2>but plants are conscious in the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're aware of their environment.</v>

458
00:20:40.441 --> 00:20:42.780
<v Speaker 2>They have senses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not like our senses,</v>

459
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.853
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're picking up on chemicals in the </v>

460
00:20:45.271 --> 00:20:49.090
<v Speaker 2>air and in the soil and light in very </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific ways.</v>

461
00:20:49.091 --> 00:20:52.030
<v Speaker 2>And they're reacting not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>instinctually,</v>

462
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:52.953
<v Speaker 2>but appropriately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are experiments that show the </v>

463
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:55.534
<v Speaker 2>plants can learn in some primitive way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have to understand that we have </v>

464
00:20:58.931 --> 00:20:59.764
<v Speaker 2>one kind of consciousness and other </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and even plants have another </v>

465
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:05.500
<v Speaker 2>kind of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's real.</v>

466
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:06.334
<v Speaker 2>It's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that they're looking back at </v>

467
00:21:08.741 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm being metaphorical,</v>

468
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.230
<v Speaker 2>but I that they're aware of me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

469
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 2>in the way that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

470
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:17.403
<v Speaker 2>plan is aware of that the bee is nearby </v>
<v Speaker 2>and does certain things sometimes to </v>

471
00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:25.510
<v Speaker 2>trap the be and hold it there for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer amount of time to load it up with</v>

472
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:26.020
<v Speaker 2>pollen.</v>

473
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:31.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are the world as we perceive it is</v>

474
00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Speaker 2>dependent on the particular senses we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

475
00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:37.510
<v Speaker 2>We've got the big five senses that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>always hear about and there's some other</v>

476
00:21:37.511 --> 00:21:38.740
<v Speaker 2>littler ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

477
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we locate ourselves in space.</v>

478
00:21:40.721 --> 00:21:43.030
<v Speaker 2>We're pretty good at that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

479
00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.750
<v Speaker 2>but other creatures have a different set</v>
<v Speaker 2>of senses and,</v>

480
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.580
<v Speaker 2>and therefore they live in a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

481
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.240
<v Speaker 2>So the beef for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can see ultraviolet light.</v>

482
00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:56.350
<v Speaker 2>We can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you could get inside of bees head,</v>

483
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.663
<v Speaker 2>the world would look very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'd see patterns like landing </v>

484
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.610
<v Speaker 2>markings on flowers in ultraviolet </v>
<v Speaker 2>colors that they can see that you,</v>

485
00:22:05.611 --> 00:22:07.620
<v Speaker 2>you've never seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ditto.</v>

486
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.960
<v Speaker 2>They also can experience electromagnetic</v>
<v Speaker 2>radiation.</v>

487
00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:11.830
<v Speaker 2>We can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

488
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:13.330
<v Speaker 2>it's all around us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't feel it.</v>

489
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.313
<v Speaker 2>They feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason they do is a plant that </v>

490
00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:18.483
<v Speaker 2>has a strong electromagnetic field </v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't been visited recently by another </v>

491
00:22:22.061 --> 00:22:22.370
<v Speaker 2>b.</v>

492
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.203
<v Speaker 2>So they know this is a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get a lot of nectar </v>

493
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:25.990
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

494
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas if you,</v>

495
00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:28.510
<v Speaker 2>if you're going by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

496
00:22:28.511 --> 00:22:31.270
<v Speaker 2>you're flying by a flower and it's got a</v>
<v Speaker 2>soft field,</v>

497
00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:32.104
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have a big field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably just been visited by </v>

498
00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Speaker 2>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So skip it.</v>

499
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.063
<v Speaker 2>So they're living in a world where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're perceiving cell phone radiation </v>

500
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:41.710
<v Speaker 2>and all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the kinds of crap we're putting into</v>

501
00:22:41.711 --> 00:22:43.870
<v Speaker 2>the electromagnetic spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

502
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.153
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have to realize that this is a </v>

503
00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:51.850
<v Speaker 2>very specific world that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceiving in our normal consciousness.</v>

504
00:22:51.851 --> 00:22:54.640
<v Speaker 2>That is the one that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive.</v>

505
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:55.503
<v Speaker 2>It's good for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] we were designed for </v>

506
00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 2>reflecting our bodies and our upright </v>
<v Speaker 2>stance,</v>

507
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:00.364
<v Speaker 2>everything about us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other creatures are seeing a </v>

508
00:23:02.321 --> 00:23:03.154
<v Speaker 2>different world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the interesting things about </v>

509
00:23:04.811 --> 00:23:08.110
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics is you get some insight </v>
<v Speaker 2>into that.</v>

510
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.530
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sort of feel it and uh,</v>

511
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.060
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>

512
00:23:13.061 --> 00:23:13.894
<v Speaker 2>I think in the sense of sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were imagining there's still a leap </v>

513
00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:20.230
<v Speaker 2>of imagination to understand the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>or octopus world.</v>

514
00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:21.064
<v Speaker 2>That's a really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where their brains are distributed over </v>

515
00:23:23.891 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 2>eight arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

516
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.530
<v Speaker 2>And seeing that recent paper that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just put out,</v>

517
00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:33.340
<v Speaker 2>see if you could find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hypothesizing that octopus,</v>

518
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:35.920
<v Speaker 2>they might've come here from another </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet,</v>

519
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.420
<v Speaker 2>literally not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might've been seeded by another planets.</v>

520
00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Very controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's from legit scientist.</v>

521
00:23:40.811 --> 00:23:45.440
<v Speaker 2>And what they're trying to think of is </v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's possible that the eggs of things</v>

522
00:23:45.441 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>traveled and</v>

523
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.850
<v Speaker 4>comments and somehow that came here </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of millions of years ago.</v>

524
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:50.803
<v Speaker 4>And the reason being is that they can </v>
<v Speaker 4>alter their rna and that this is very </v>

525
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:59.180
<v Speaker 4>specific to a Octopi are octopuses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

526
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:01.540
<v Speaker 4>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Octopus's came to earth from space,</v>

527
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.413
<v Speaker 4>frozen eggs billions of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they would put it that </v>

528
00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:05.594
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

529
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:06.503
<v Speaker 4>it's just a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a theory that's being bandied </v>

530
00:24:09.051 --> 00:24:11.530
<v Speaker 4>about by legitimate scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

531
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.030
<v Speaker 4>You can do so many things that no other </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal can do.</v>

532
00:24:14.031 --> 00:24:16.370
<v Speaker 4>Like instantaneously changed their </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside.</v>

533
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.980
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To blend into their area.</v>

534
00:24:18.981 --> 00:24:19.814
<v Speaker 4>Also each arm we can make its own </v>
<v Speaker 4>decisions without referring to </v>

535
00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:23.480
<v Speaker 4>headquarters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

536
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:25.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have this distributed intelligence.</v>

537
00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And regenerate as well.</v>

538
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:29.570
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they are.</v>

539
00:24:29.571 --> 00:24:31.460
<v Speaker 4>They're really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're really crazy.</v>

540
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.413
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this idea that there's something </v>

541
00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:35.054
<v Speaker 4>relative about our everyday normal </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness that there are other ways </v>

542
00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:39.464
<v Speaker 4>to experience the world is something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that psychedelics puts you in touch </v>

543
00:24:43.131 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

544
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.330
<v Speaker 4>It was just reading this interview with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this physicist named Carlo Ravelli.</v>

545
00:24:47.331 --> 00:24:50.660
<v Speaker 4>He's a theoretical physicist from Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote this book a couple of years ago</v>

546
00:24:50.661 --> 00:24:53.510
<v Speaker 4>called seven brief lessons on physics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very prominent guy.</v>

547
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.943
<v Speaker 4>And he was telling this interview or in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Guardian that he got turned on to </v>

548
00:24:59.271 --> 00:25:00.104
<v Speaker 4>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

549
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.300
<v Speaker 4>during an lsd trip he had when he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>15.</v>

550
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.780
<v Speaker 4>And the interviewer asked him why was </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

551
00:25:05.781 --> 00:25:06.614
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

552
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:11.420
<v Speaker 4>I saw for the first time that there </v>
<v Speaker 4>could be another way to think about time</v>

553
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.820
<v Speaker 4>in instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

554
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.671
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>past,</v>

555
00:25:13.671 --> 00:25:16.550
<v Speaker 4>present and future that it might all be </v>
<v Speaker 4>simultaneous.</v>

556
00:25:16.551 --> 00:25:19.370
<v Speaker 4>And that's how it appeared to him during</v>
<v Speaker 4>this lsd trip.</v>

557
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.960
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he,</v>

558
00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.840
<v Speaker 4>when he was back to baseline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

559
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:24.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

560
00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was asking myself,</v>

561
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:27.044
<v Speaker 4>why am I so sure this is the real world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that wasn't the real world and it </v>

562
00:25:32.481 --> 00:25:33.800
<v Speaker 4>was just an hallucination.</v>

563
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:34.933
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world as it presents itself to us </v>

564
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:42.550
<v Speaker 4>right now here actually physics tells us</v>
<v Speaker 4>is not the real world that there are,</v>

565
00:25:43.051 --> 00:25:45.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that space and time are curved.</v>

566
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:49.100
<v Speaker 4>That particles don't exist until they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>perceived by a consciousness.</v>

567
00:25:49.101 --> 00:25:49.934
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these crazy ideas of theoretical </v>

568
00:25:51.351 --> 00:25:52.460
<v Speaker 4>physics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

569
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:53.323
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it suddenly seemed like worth exploring </v>

570
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.693
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the world as it presents itself to </v>

571
00:25:57.291 --> 00:26:00.890
<v Speaker 4>us is not the only world and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or necessarily the accurate world.</v>

572
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.083
<v Speaker 4>And I was very interested that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientist could develop that idea of a </v>

573
00:26:05.841 --> 00:26:06.674
<v Speaker 4>beyond in the way you would think of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>religious person developing the idea of </v>

574
00:26:10.601 --> 00:26:11.434
<v Speaker 4>a beyond that there's a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 4>beyond and there's a religious beyond </v>

575
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.710
<v Speaker 4>and psychedelics at least gives us a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hint that,</v>

576
00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.290
<v Speaker 4>that those worlds exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was,</v>

577
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was very powerful,</v>

578
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.163
<v Speaker 4>powerful idea for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you looked into any of the </v>

579
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:30.440
<v Speaker 4>connections between ancient religions </v>
<v Speaker 4>and psychedelics?</v>

580
00:26:30.441 --> 00:26:30.920
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

581
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.470
<v Speaker 4>any of the John Marco Allegro stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

582
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:35.420
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't go that deep into it.</v>

583
00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:39.230
<v Speaker 4>I went in deep enough to know that there</v>
<v Speaker 4>are a lot of very serious scholars.</v>

584
00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.550
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

585
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.710
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allegro is one and Carl ruck another.</v>

586
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Gordon Wasson,</v>

587
00:26:45.781 --> 00:26:46.614
<v Speaker 2>the guy who kind of brought silicide </v>
<v Speaker 2>been to the west who I write about at </v>

588
00:26:48.871 --> 00:26:49.704
<v Speaker 2>some length in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really believe that it was a experience </v>

589
00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:54.594
<v Speaker 2>of psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has been in culture for thousands </v>

590
00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:58.403
<v Speaker 2>of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

591
00:26:58.650 --> 00:26:59.560
<v Speaker 2>we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

592
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.240
<v Speaker 2>whether you're talking about the Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 2>or Africa or,</v>

593
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:09.120
<v Speaker 2>and that these experiences may have </v>
<v Speaker 2>nurtured the religious impulse,</v>

594
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do you get the idea of,</v>

595
00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.450
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

596
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.460
<v Speaker 2>beyond where do you get the idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>heaven or a hell,</v>

597
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:17.250
<v Speaker 2>if not from some altered state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness?</v>

598
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:18.323
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people talked about visiting the </v>

599
00:27:19.141 --> 00:27:21.870
<v Speaker 2>underworld in homer's time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

600
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.170
<v Speaker 2>so how did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it dreams?</v>

601
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.153
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams don't have the authority that </v>

602
00:27:27.511 --> 00:27:29.670
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experience has?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

603
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.920
<v Speaker 2>there's something about psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that,</v>

604
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.990
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

605
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.450
<v Speaker 2>has this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just an opinion,</v>

606
00:27:36.451 --> 00:27:37.740
<v Speaker 2>it's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a fantasy.</v>

607
00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:38.640
<v Speaker 2>It's something real.</v>

608
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.473
<v Speaker 2>It's objective truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is William James called the noetic </v>

609
00:27:42.511 --> 00:27:45.390
<v Speaker 2>quality of the mystical experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

610
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.150
<v Speaker 2>and that's certitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

611
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.043
<v Speaker 2>comes from psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it seems totally plausible to me </v>

612
00:27:52.321 --> 00:27:55.850
<v Speaker 2>that at the very earliest stages of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

613
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.023
<v Speaker 2>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people were indeed taking </v>

614
00:27:58.741 --> 00:28:01.770
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this might explain how they came up with</v>

615
00:28:01.771 --> 00:28:03.510
<v Speaker 2>these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

616
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.110
<v Speaker 2>there are other alternative theories and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not provable.</v>

617
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.480
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know how we would begin to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prove it,</v>

618
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.250
<v Speaker 2>but it seems plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

619
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:12.563
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ancient Greeks had a psychedelic </v>

620
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.890
<v Speaker 2>that they used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think called the,</v>

621
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.730
<v Speaker 2>they called it the Kiki on k,</v>
<v Speaker 2>y,</v>

622
00:28:17.731 --> 00:28:18.271
<v Speaker 2>k,</v>
<v Speaker 2>e,</v>

623
00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:19.104
<v Speaker 2>O,</v>
<v Speaker 2>n.</v>

624
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.213
<v Speaker 2>And they had an annual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ritual ceremony and it was the only </v>

625
00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:25.410
<v Speaker 2>time in the year where you could use </v>
<v Speaker 2>this drug.</v>

626
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:30.770
<v Speaker 2>And it was a ritual to for diameter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>harvest or planting time.</v>

627
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:35.190
<v Speaker 2>And everybody in Greek society did this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people,</v>

628
00:28:35.191 --> 00:28:35.911
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had,</v>

629
00:28:35.911 --> 00:28:37.650
<v Speaker 2>it was secret,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was called the mysteries,</v>

630
00:28:37.651 --> 00:28:41.190
<v Speaker 2>the Eleusinian mysteries and you weren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to talk about it,</v>

631
00:28:41.191 --> 00:28:42.024
<v Speaker 2>but there's a few accounts around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people talked about visiting the </v>

632
00:28:43.831 --> 00:28:48.120
<v Speaker 2>underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making contact with the dead and um,</v>

633
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.910
<v Speaker 2>call ruck who's a classicist to be use </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

634
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:51.743
<v Speaker 2>That was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a psychedelic potion and we </v>

635
00:28:53.221 --> 00:28:54.054
<v Speaker 2>don't know what they were using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was mushrooms or something </v>

636
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:56.820
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

637
00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:01.850
<v Speaker 2>the Greek use of drugs is very obscure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only talked about wine,</v>

638
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.430
<v Speaker 2>but the way they describe what wine did </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you,</v>

639
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.473
<v Speaker 2>there was clearly something added to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were adding other plant drugs </v>

640
00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:12.420
<v Speaker 2>to their wine because they would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these tiny little glasses.</v>

641
00:29:12.421 --> 00:29:14.850
<v Speaker 2>And they'd take these big trips so we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what it was.</v>

642
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tiny glasses of one tiny glasses.</v>

643
00:29:17.401 --> 00:29:19.860
<v Speaker 2>And they were very careful about when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you used it and,</v>

644
00:29:19.861 --> 00:29:22.950
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would completely lose control and</v>

645
00:29:22.951 --> 00:29:24.090
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

646
00:29:24.091 --> 00:29:25.860
<v Speaker 2>this isn't wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something else.</v>

647
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:26.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is some sort of a psychic delicate </v>

648
00:29:28.011 --> 00:29:30.660
<v Speaker 2>from grapes or know it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

649
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know some people,</v>

650
00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Albert Hofmann who discovered lsd or </v>
<v Speaker 2>invented Lsd,</v>

651
00:29:36.451 --> 00:29:38.100
<v Speaker 2>he thought it was air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got that.</v>

652
00:29:38.101 --> 00:29:40.290
<v Speaker 2>They'd figured out a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Air God is a,</v>

653
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 2>is a fungus grows on grain.</v>

654
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.250
<v Speaker 4>And it was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

655
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:50.251
<v Speaker 4>the precursor chemical to lsd comes from</v>
<v Speaker 4>Aragon and uh,</v>

656
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.143
<v Speaker 4>air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God is responsible for episodes of mass </v>

657
00:29:53.711 --> 00:29:56.500
<v Speaker 4>delirium and European history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get a really wet year.</v>

658
00:29:56.501 --> 00:29:57.334
<v Speaker 4>The air got grows on the Rye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People eat bread made from it and they </v>

659
00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 4>go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people think the Salem witch trials</v>

660
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:05.620
<v Speaker 4>was came after a wet year and people had</v>
<v Speaker 4>absorbed,</v>

661
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.020
<v Speaker 4>these women had eaten air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gotten,</v>

662
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:09.820
<v Speaker 4>we're having visions and things like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

663
00:30:09.821 --> 00:30:10.654
<v Speaker 4>which was interpreted as witchcraft,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which to them was a very thought there </v>

664
00:30:13.421 --> 00:30:17.020
<v Speaker 4>were saying that the men had absorbed </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and thought they were under spells.</v>

665
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.193
<v Speaker 4>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>

666
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.420
<v Speaker 4>maybe that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just trip everybody's,</v>

667
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:22.360
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

668
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

669
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:26.530
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they just eat air.</v>

670
00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:27.610
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to be,</v>

671
00:30:27.611 --> 00:30:29.330
<v Speaker 4>you could get gang green.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a myth.</v>

672
00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.330
<v Speaker 4>It's not a clean chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

673
00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.600
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thinking of,</v>

674
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:35.463
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gordon Wasson and call rock and they </v>

675
00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:39.240
<v Speaker 4>were collaborators on this theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

676
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:44.910
<v Speaker 4>was that the Greeks perhaps had figured </v>
<v Speaker 4>out a way to derive a pure chemical from</v>

677
00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.240
<v Speaker 4>Aragon that could be made into something</v>
<v Speaker 4>very much like lsd.</v>

678
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:50.283
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody has succeeded and they've tried </v>

679
00:30:52.601 --> 00:30:56.080
<v Speaker 4>for the last 20 or 30 years to take air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got and make something,</v>

680
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through simple processes that the Greeks</v>

681
00:30:58.271 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 4>could have mastered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it may have been a mushroom.</v>

682
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.110
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

683
00:31:02.111 --> 00:31:03.850
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of psychedelic plants out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

684
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:06.010
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the mysteries of evolution </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

685
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:06.863
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dmt is like coursing through the plant </v>

686
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:10.660
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of plants.</v>

687
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.290
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>

688
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:16.750
<v Speaker 4>I do find it plausible that there is </v>
<v Speaker 4>some links between psychedelics.</v>

689
00:31:16.751 --> 00:31:17.584
<v Speaker 4>I think psychedelics have have </v>
<v Speaker 4>influenced cultural history at various </v>

690
00:31:22.301 --> 00:31:23.134
<v Speaker 4>points along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of those may have been to kind </v>

691
00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:28.660
<v Speaker 4>of nurture this religious impulse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

692
00:31:28.661 --> 00:31:30.910
<v Speaker 4>it can't prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Greeks spent,</v>

693
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:31.833
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the great Greek scholar spent a </v>

694
00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:36.190
<v Speaker 4>lot of time in Egypt as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't know anything about that really.</v>

695
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:37.900
<v Speaker 4>I was wanting to try and figure it.</v>

696
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:38.733
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

697
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.550
<v Speaker 4>they were trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics,</v>

698
00:31:42.551 --> 00:31:43.630
<v Speaker 4>if any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

699
00:31:43.631 --> 00:31:46.030
<v Speaker 4>the Egyptians took and they'd never </v>
<v Speaker 4>really figured it out.</v>

700
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:46.864
<v Speaker 4>They made some connections to dmt that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is sort of loosely connected to their </v>

701
00:31:49.811 --> 00:31:51.950
<v Speaker 4>worship of the pineal gland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

702
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.900
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where we've found DMT and rats.</v>

703
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:55.991
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

704
00:31:55.991 --> 00:31:57.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Cottonwood Research Foundation.</v>

705
00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you did that film about DMT,</v>

706
00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:00.351
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

707
00:32:00.351 --> 00:32:01.184
<v Speaker 4>That's really interesting stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's been very little follow up on </v>

708
00:32:04.331 --> 00:32:05.164
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this idea that there might be an </v>

709
00:32:06.101 --> 00:32:09.910
<v Speaker 4>endogenous psychedelic like dmt I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as I know,</v>

710
00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:13.660
<v Speaker 4>we've only found it in the rat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to look for it and the amounts</v>

711
00:32:13.661 --> 00:32:14.740
<v Speaker 4>are really tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

712
00:32:14.741 --> 00:32:15.574
<v Speaker 4>they found dmt in people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they haven't found it in the pineal </v>

713
00:32:17.501 --> 00:32:18.334
<v Speaker 4>gland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they haven't,</v>

714
00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.020
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that right?</v>

715
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:19.853
<v Speaker 4>Founded on the liver and the lungs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's being produced that they know </v>

716
00:32:22.781 --> 00:32:23.614
<v Speaker 4>that humans produce it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>indogenous but they don't know whether </v>

717
00:32:25.811 --> 00:32:27.040
<v Speaker 4>or not the pineal gland does.</v>

718
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.083
<v Speaker 4>I said the pineal gland represents the </v>
<v Speaker 4>third eye of eastern mysticism and that </v>

719
00:32:32.081 --> 00:32:32.914
<v Speaker 4>was what also they think what does it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the eye of horus that they connected to </v>

720
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:37.204
<v Speaker 4>the pineal gland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you ever seen those comparisons pull </v>

721
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 4>the comparison between the eye of horus </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the pineal gland.</v>

722
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.143
<v Speaker 4>It's essentially shaped like a cross </v>
<v Speaker 4>section of the pineal gland and I'm in </v>

723
00:32:50.061 --> 00:32:50.894
<v Speaker 4>the temple and man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see if you look at it up there and they </v>

724
00:32:53.691 --> 00:32:56.480
<v Speaker 4>think somehow or another that this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

725
00:32:56.481 --> 00:32:59.570
<v Speaker 4>the connection between these two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of different things have</v>

726
00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:02.180
<v Speaker 4>been written on this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this connection,</v>

727
00:33:02.181 --> 00:33:04.340
<v Speaker 4>because this appears in so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>

728
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.233
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Egyptian hieroglyphs and they think it </v>

729
00:33:07.371 --> 00:33:10.870
<v Speaker 4>might have some sort of a connection </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the portal to the afterlife that</v>

730
00:33:10.871 --> 00:33:14.080
<v Speaker 4>they think the dmt experiences and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea of the Dao.</v>

731
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.700
<v Speaker 4>How would they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how would they know?</v>

732
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't do they know about brains?</v>

733
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:19.933
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

734
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:20.803
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how they know how to build </v>

735
00:33:21.801 --> 00:33:23.660
<v Speaker 4>pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How'd they know a lot of things.</v>

736
00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did some pretty incredible shit.</v>

737
00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:26.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know,</v>

738
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:28.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the burning of the library of</v>

739
00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:30.680
<v Speaker 4>Alexandria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we lost almost everything.</v>

740
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:33.440
<v Speaker 4>We don't really know what they knew or </v>
<v Speaker 4>how they knew it,</v>

741
00:33:33.441 --> 00:33:34.274
<v Speaker 4>but we do know that no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that scholars from around the world </v>

742
00:33:36.411 --> 00:33:40.430
<v Speaker 4>would go to Egypt to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well in general,</v>

743
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.293
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a more open mind about many </v>

744
00:33:42.531 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 4>things since I've had these experiences </v>
<v Speaker 4>now than I did before.</v>

745
00:33:45.201 --> 00:33:48.380
<v Speaker 4>I was a kind of staunch materialists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's normal.</v>

746
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:49.483
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people see silliness and hippies </v>

747
00:33:51.561 --> 00:33:52.394
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these people that are out there </v>

748
00:33:54.111 --> 00:33:56.870
<v Speaker 4>doing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to air quote find themselves,</v>

749
00:33:56.871 --> 00:34:00.590
<v Speaker 4>you just see two seems like a foolish </v>
<v Speaker 4>venture and then you do it and you go,</v>

750
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:01.910
<v Speaker 4>oh okay.</v>

751
00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:03.933
<v Speaker 4>There it's just being done by morons are</v>
<v Speaker 4>being described by morons cause it's </v>

752
00:34:08.781 --> 00:34:11.090
<v Speaker 4>hard to describe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also illegal.</v>

753
00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:11.983
<v Speaker 4>So people shy away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to lose your family and </v>

754
00:34:13.671 --> 00:34:14.504
<v Speaker 4>get locked up in jail and all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>different things that people are </v>

755
00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:17.240
<v Speaker 4>terrified of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you'd like,</v>

756
00:34:17.241 --> 00:34:18.051
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to,</v>

757
00:34:18.051 --> 00:34:19.580
<v Speaker 4>I'll have a glass of whiskey with </v>
<v Speaker 4>dinner.</v>

758
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:21.140
<v Speaker 4>And that's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>

759
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:22.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a kind of embarrassment.</v>

760
00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean one of the really striking things</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I've,</v>

761
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.520
<v Speaker 4>I've been on the road now for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is my second week out talking about</v>

762
00:34:28.521 --> 00:34:29.354
<v Speaker 4>this book and I have been struck by how </v>
<v Speaker 4>many people have had powerful </v>

763
00:34:33.051 --> 00:34:35.480
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't talk to anybody about.</v>

764
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:39.140
<v Speaker 4>And I come along as a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

765
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.780
<v Speaker 4>credible person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

766
00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.960
<v Speaker 4>who's interested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>

767
00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:45.320
<v Speaker 4>this is journalists too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They turn off the tape recorder and they</v>

768
00:34:45.321 --> 00:34:46.670
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I tell you a story?</v>

769
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:47.893
<v Speaker 4>And they had something happened to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>might've been in their 20s or 30s or </v>

770
00:34:50.631 --> 00:34:53.240
<v Speaker 4>earlier that changed the course of their</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

771
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.133
<v Speaker 4>And either because there was a stigma </v>
<v Speaker 4>attached to it or it was kind of had </v>

772
00:34:58.701 --> 00:35:02.570
<v Speaker 4>this sixties kind woo think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or there were kids around,</v>

773
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.003
<v Speaker 4>they didn't feel comfortable and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they kept it in this box labeled </v>

774
00:35:06.651 --> 00:35:10.310
<v Speaker 4>weird drug experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not just a drug experience.</v>

775
00:35:10.311 --> 00:35:11.930
<v Speaker 4>So this is your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

776
00:35:11.931 --> 00:35:12.764
<v Speaker 4>the drug may have started the process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everything you see and in this </v>

777
00:35:16.731 --> 00:35:20.960
<v Speaker 4>experience is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are real psychological facts there</v>

778
00:35:20.961 --> 00:35:24.080
<v Speaker 4>from your unconscious or from your </v>
<v Speaker 4>interpretation or your environment.</v>

779
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:25.970
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

780
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.480
<v Speaker 4>it's not the molecule that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

781
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.220
<v Speaker 4>that ordered that for in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

782
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:33.470
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as Stan Stanislav Grof,</v>

783
00:35:33.471 --> 00:35:36.950
<v Speaker 4>who was one of the pioneering </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic psychiatrist in the 60s said</v>

784
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:37.921
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

785
00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:38.340
<v Speaker 4>lsd</v>

786
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.580
<v Speaker 2>is an unspecific amplifier of mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>activity.</v>

787
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.640
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing packaged with the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

788
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:45.503
<v Speaker 2>and that's important to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had this big experience and you </v>

789
00:35:48.391 --> 00:35:51.210
<v Speaker 2>put it in this box thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're drug experience,</v>

790
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.150
<v Speaker 2>but when you take it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you find that there's,</v>

791
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a real gold there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's fool's gold too.</v>

792
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.670
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting quote that quote you</v>

793
00:35:58.671 --> 00:36:03.230
<v Speaker 3>just said cause because in actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies of the human mind,</v>

794
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.123
<v Speaker 3>under the influence of Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually been shown to shut off </v>

795
00:36:06.261 --> 00:36:08.170
<v Speaker 3>parts of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>

796
00:36:08.171 --> 00:36:09.004
<v Speaker 3>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we blocking off these constant </v>

797
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.290
<v Speaker 3>frequencies that are around us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this experience that's around us,</v>

798
00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.253
<v Speaker 3>it is our own ego or our own mortality </v>
<v Speaker 3>or own desire to stay alive and protect </v>

799
00:36:25.191 --> 00:36:28.220
<v Speaker 3>ourselves or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The various blockades that we put up are</v>

800
00:36:28.221 --> 00:36:29.054
<v Speaker 3>those diminished by sales side and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>allows this ever present experience to </v>

801
00:36:33.681 --> 00:36:34.514
<v Speaker 3>manifest itself.</v>

802
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.340
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most,</v>

803
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:41.290
<v Speaker 2>the most interesting scientific finding </v>
<v Speaker 2>a of this current generation of research</v>

804
00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.680
<v Speaker 2>is that when they image the brains of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on psilocybin or LSD or Iowasca,</v>

805
00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.780
<v Speaker 2>they expected to see fireworks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

806
00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Lots of activity because the experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>has lots of fireworks,</v>

807
00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.090
<v Speaker 2>but they found something that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't expect,</v>

808
00:36:55.091 --> 00:36:55.924
<v Speaker 2>which was a diminishment of activity in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a very important brain network called </v>

809
00:36:59.381 --> 00:37:00.214
<v Speaker 2>the default mode network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is in the midline and it connects </v>

810
00:37:03.551 --> 00:37:04.384
<v Speaker 2>parts of your cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the evolutionarily most recent </v>

811
00:37:06.311 --> 00:37:07.870
<v Speaker 2>part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two older,</v>

812
00:37:07.871 --> 00:37:10.600
<v Speaker 2>deeper sources of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion and memory.</v>

813
00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:14.230
<v Speaker 2>And it's a hub in the brain and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain is a hierarchical system.</v>

814
00:37:14.231 --> 00:37:15.040
<v Speaker 2>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

815
00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.960
<v Speaker 2>this is the orchestra conductor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the neuroscientists put it,</v>

816
00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:18.340
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

817
00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.173
<v Speaker 2>it's a regulator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens in the default mode </v>

818
00:37:21.611 --> 00:37:22.660
<v Speaker 2>network normally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

819
00:37:22.661 --> 00:37:26.170
<v Speaker 2>it's very involved in um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self reflection,</v>

820
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.150
<v Speaker 2>self criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worry.</v>

821
00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:32.050
<v Speaker 2>It's where your mind goes to wander.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's involved in time travel,</v>

822
00:37:32.051 --> 00:37:32.884
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the future or the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's involved in something scientists </v>

823
00:37:35.921 --> 00:37:36.754
<v Speaker 2>called theory of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to imagine that another </v>

824
00:37:39.551 --> 00:37:41.760
<v Speaker 2>person has mental states and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>just Iraq.</v>

825
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.113
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is involved in what's called the </v>

826
00:37:45.071 --> 00:37:50.071
<v Speaker 2>experiential or autobiographical self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way we kind of take what's happening</v>

827
00:37:50.231 --> 00:37:54.100
<v Speaker 2>to us and connect it to the story we </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell ourselves about who we are based on</v>

828
00:37:54.101 --> 00:37:55.180
<v Speaker 2>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the future.</v>

829
00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:56.860
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

830
00:37:56.861 --> 00:37:59.950
<v Speaker 2>if the ego has an address,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in the default mode network.</v>

831
00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.360
<v Speaker 2>And what is the ego do for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ego kind of patrols the borders,</v>

832
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:05.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

833
00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:08.560
<v Speaker 2>it's what keeps out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

834
00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:10.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are threatening to you.</v>

835
00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.000
<v Speaker 2>It keeps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

836
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:17.050
<v Speaker 2>it's responsible for the repression of </v>
<v Speaker 2>subconscious thought or strong emotion.</v>

837
00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

838
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.601
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

839
00:38:19.601 --> 00:38:20.470
<v Speaker 2>it's a defense.</v>

840
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:24.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a set of defenses and psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 2>appear to turn this off,</v>

841
00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to one degree or another.</v>

842
00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Take the default mode network offline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When that happens,</v>

843
00:38:30.011 --> 00:38:32.440
<v Speaker 2>to go back to your metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

844
00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.160
<v Speaker 2>the whatever is blocking the that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocking lots of information from coming</v>

845
00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:39.064
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from outside or up from below in your </v>

846
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:46.141
<v Speaker 2>subconscious that's allowed to flow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you are getting more information,</v>

847
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:49.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than you might otherwise.</v>

848
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:51.610
<v Speaker 2>And this is a metaphor that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

849
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:55.960
<v Speaker 2>aldous Huxley used indoors or perception</v>
<v Speaker 2>that consciousness is a,</v>

850
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:59.770
<v Speaker 2>is eliminating more than it's creating </v>
<v Speaker 2>its it consciousness is,</v>

851
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:00.933
<v Speaker 2>is reducing our experience to that thin </v>
<v Speaker 2>trickle of information we need to get </v>

852
00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:07.840
<v Speaker 2>ahead to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

853
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:09.543
<v Speaker 2>and that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you opened the doors or perception on </v>

854
00:39:12.551 --> 00:39:17.290
<v Speaker 2>these drugs by turning off this network </v>
<v Speaker 2>and lots more information comes in which</v>

855
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:19.060
<v Speaker 2>can be overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

856
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.270
<v Speaker 2>but also extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

857
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.390
<v Speaker 2>that's wonder</v>

858
00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:26.610
<v Speaker 3>is there apprehension in writing a book </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this and describing these things,</v>

859
00:39:26.611 --> 00:39:27.444
<v Speaker 3>like as you're writing it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about all these other people </v>

860
00:39:30.121 --> 00:39:30.954
<v Speaker 3>that are sort of cynical straitlaced non</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug using folks who might admire your </v>

861
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:40.010
<v Speaker 3>previous work on agriculture </v>
<v Speaker 3>architecture or whatever and,</v>

862
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.390
<v Speaker 3>and you're sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I,</v>

863
00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.653
<v Speaker 3>how do I get this through without </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking like a guy who's losing his </v>

864
00:39:46.021 --> 00:39:49.300
<v Speaker 3>fucking mind or it's going Super Woo </v>
<v Speaker 3>Depok trope Ron,</v>

865
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

866
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:52.343
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you do this and maintain your </v>

867
00:39:54.121 --> 00:39:56.640
<v Speaker 3>position as a serious journalist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

868
00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I was nervous about undertaking this </v>
<v Speaker 2>project.</v>

869
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:00.563
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also came to think it was really </v>

870
00:40:02.281 --> 00:40:06.330
<v Speaker 2>important and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was something here and that,</v>

871
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:08.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started this process,</v>

872
00:40:08.731 --> 00:40:11.130
<v Speaker 2>Stan Grof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy or I made reference to earlier,</v>

873
00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.860
<v Speaker 2>he had said in the 60 something I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought was really outrageous.</v>

874
00:40:13.861 --> 00:40:16.920
<v Speaker 2>He said that the psychedelics would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the study of the mind,</v>

875
00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:21.390
<v Speaker 2>what the microscope was for biology or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the telescope for us.</v>

876
00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>astronomy.</v>

877
00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:25.290
<v Speaker 2>This is a really outrageous claim to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make.</v>

878
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as time's gone on,</v>

879
00:40:27.541 --> 00:40:28.374
<v Speaker 2>that idea seems less crazy to me that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are learning things about the mind that </v>

880
00:40:33.481 --> 00:40:34.314
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that these drugs are teaching it in </v>

881
00:40:36.331 --> 00:40:39.660
<v Speaker 2>a scientific context and in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual context.</v>

882
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:41.123
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just because some people think it's </v>

883
00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:46.410
<v Speaker 2>embarrassing or Wu is not a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not a reason not to do it.</v>

884
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:49.710
<v Speaker 2>I have to find a way to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

885
00:40:49.711 --> 00:40:50.544
<v Speaker 2>I'm being a little speculative with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about origins of religion and </v>

886
00:40:53.371 --> 00:40:54.204
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the book stays pretty close to </v>

887
00:40:55.621 --> 00:40:58.920
<v Speaker 2>here's what we really know and here's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I experienced.</v>

888
00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a science journalist,</v>

889
00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:02.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

890
00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:04.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I try to draw the line between,</v>

891
00:41:04.891 --> 00:41:07.680
<v Speaker 2>now I'm speculating and now here's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that we really know with some,</v>

892
00:41:07.681 --> 00:41:10.620
<v Speaker 2>with some certitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but without question,</v>

893
00:41:10.621 --> 00:41:14.340
<v Speaker 2>I had some misgivings about describing </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic experience,</v>

894
00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:17.100
<v Speaker 2>their legal issues there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

895
00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:18.540
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

896
00:41:18.541 --> 00:41:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I have a readership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a big readership that you know,</v>

897
00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:23.460
<v Speaker 2>is happy if I just keep writing books on</v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

898
00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:24.323
<v Speaker 2>But I had found something to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to interesting to pass up and I've been </v>

899
00:41:27.781 --> 00:41:30.410
<v Speaker 2>gratified that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

900
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:31.603
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking about this book on </v>

901
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.823
<v Speaker 2>like network television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think I would be talking to </v>

902
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Steven Colbert about ego dissolution and</v>
<v Speaker 2>here we are.</v>

903
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.390
<v Speaker 2>And he actually got the best line off on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole appearance.</v>

904
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:44.443
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

905
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:46.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

906
00:41:46.221 --> 00:41:47.054
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the ego should be a controlled </v>

907
00:41:48.081 --> 00:41:51.230
<v Speaker 2>substance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was pretty good.</v>

908
00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.780
<v Speaker 2>It is a great line is fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a clever boy.</v>

909
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

910
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:57.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I found though that the,</v>

911
00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:00.530
<v Speaker 2>if I was willing to talk about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues in my experiences,</v>

912
00:42:00.531 --> 00:42:05.060
<v Speaker 2>in a matter of fact way mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists would respond in kind.</v>

913
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:07.760
<v Speaker 2>And so I've been on the CBS morning show</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

914
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terry Gross on fresh air and,</v>

915
00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:12.140
<v Speaker 2>and we've had a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

916
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.750
<v Speaker 2>conversation where we're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>these as tools.</v>

917
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.823
<v Speaker 2>What are they good for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they not good for without </v>

918
00:42:17.481 --> 00:42:19.670
<v Speaker 2>getting caught up in the usual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

919
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:24.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>craziness that's associated with these,</v>

920
00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:25.640
<v Speaker 2>with these drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

921
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:26.533
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I'm trying to do is take </v>

922
00:42:27.741 --> 00:42:31.430
<v Speaker 2>that sixties crust off these things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>take a fresh look.</v>

923
00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

924
00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:36.160
<v Speaker 3>for someone like me who's been a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic advocate for a long time,</v>

925
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:41.190
<v Speaker 3>it was extremely exciting news that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy like you were stepping into the fray</v>

926
00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:43.803
<v Speaker 3>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're so well established and well </v>

927
00:42:45.641 --> 00:42:46.474
<v Speaker 3>respected already that I knew your </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach on it was going to be very </v>

928
00:42:49.961 --> 00:42:50.794
<v Speaker 3>clean and that I knew that people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have to start looking at this </v>

929
00:42:53.381 --> 00:42:53.701
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

930
00:42:53.701 --> 00:42:55.630
<v Speaker 3>it's Michael Pollan's looking at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

931
00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:56.723
<v Speaker 3>this might not be completely crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the cultural attitudes about </v>

932
00:42:59.921 --> 00:43:04.150
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic drugs or drugs in general </v>
<v Speaker 3>were so childlike and our,</v>

933
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:05.710
<v Speaker 3>our view on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

934
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.500
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful person,</v>

935
00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:09.633
<v Speaker 3>talks all kinds of crazy shit about </v>
<v Speaker 3>people smoking pot and take xanax every </v>

936
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:13.830
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

937
00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:15.580
<v Speaker 3>do people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't all,</v>

938
00:43:15.581 --> 00:43:17.590
<v Speaker 3>I just need a glass of wine and Xanax </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm good.</v>

939
00:43:17.591 --> 00:43:19.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why you people need drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

940
00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:22.270
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're fucking crazy.</v>

941
00:43:22.271 --> 00:43:23.104
<v Speaker 3>But our cultural attitudes on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>substances that are prohibited and that </v>

942
00:43:26.841 --> 00:43:28.630
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are accepted,</v>

943
00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:31.480
<v Speaker 3>there's so strange and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

944
00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.890
<v Speaker 3>because of our social standing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we don't want to be perceived as</v>

945
00:43:35.891 --> 00:43:40.270
<v Speaker 3>foolish or reckless or in some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>mid life crisis or what have you.</v>

946
00:43:40.271 --> 00:43:41.104
<v Speaker 3>We were like these journalists that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>shutting the microphones off and wanted </v>

947
00:43:43.271 --> 00:43:44.104
<v Speaker 3>to talk to you about these profound </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences that they had that they </v>

948
00:43:45.881 --> 00:43:47.860
<v Speaker 3>should be shouting about from the roof </v>
<v Speaker 3>rooftops.</v>

949
00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:48.581
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

950
00:43:48.581 --> 00:43:51.340
<v Speaker 2>it's really to normalize this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have to come out of the closet.</v>

951
00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some do.</v>

952
00:43:52.301 --> 00:43:53.134
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to a journalist in Boston </v>

953
00:43:54.401 --> 00:43:55.234
<v Speaker 2>who was the local NPR host and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he on the air live talked about his </v>

954
00:43:58.421 --> 00:43:59.254
<v Speaker 2>experiences and how important they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>in shaping his identity and the </v>

955
00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:03.973
<v Speaker 2>experiences he had in college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we're going to see more </v>

956
00:44:06.191 --> 00:44:09.880
<v Speaker 2>people come out of the closet and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have this kind of conversation will,</v>

957
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:12.520
<v Speaker 2>and we can actually look at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience in the same way now.</v>

958
00:44:12.521 --> 00:44:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still illegal.</v>

959
00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.620
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that there is all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>legal research going on,</v>

960
00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:20.590
<v Speaker 2>it has created a space where you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about it.</v>

961
00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:21.424
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interviewing all these people and </v>

962
00:44:22.541 --> 00:44:24.430
<v Speaker 2>they're describing their trips and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

963
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very straight people and um,</v>

964
00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.990
<v Speaker 2>and they've had profound experiences.</v>

965
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 2>So I think the culture is changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

966
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.310
<v Speaker 2>I definitely think it is with which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

967
00:44:35.311 --> 00:44:36.144
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't write it with that idea that I </v>

968
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:38.274
<v Speaker 2>had this authority that I earned and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about food and nutrition and </v>

969
00:44:41.371 --> 00:44:44.340
<v Speaker 2>then I'm going to apply it now to drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that way.</v>

970
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:46.500
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting from scratch.</v>

971
00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.753
<v Speaker 2>But I do realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people scare me a little when they </v>

972
00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:50.700
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

973
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:52.530
<v Speaker 2>peep psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say,</v>

974
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to do for,</v>

975
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:58.230
<v Speaker 2>for silicide been what you did for food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's really different.</v>

976
00:44:58.290 --> 00:44:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

977
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or this woman,</v>

978
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:03.390
<v Speaker 2>I was speaking at Google in Seattle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

979
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.820
<v Speaker 2>this woman stands up and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

980
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.500
<v Speaker 2>after I read your book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

981
00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I had a slaughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pig.</v>

982
00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I had to learn how to slaughter a pig.</v>

983
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:13.350
<v Speaker 2>You made me want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I was driving to work today,</v>

984
00:45:13.351 --> 00:45:16.290
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd ever take Lsd,</v>

985
00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:18.750
<v Speaker 2>but now or silicide but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now I feel like I need to,</v>

986
00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:20.183
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them to feel they have to </v>

987
00:45:22.621 --> 00:45:26.580
<v Speaker 2>have this experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can learn a lot about the mind.</v>

988
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.670
<v Speaker 2>This book is as much about the mind as </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is about psychedelics.</v>

989
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a book that uses psychedelics to</v>

990
00:45:32.191 --> 00:45:35.040
<v Speaker 2>explore this really interesting mystery </v>
<v Speaker 2>call consciousness.</v>

991
00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.293
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also exploring the nature of </v>

992
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Speaker 2>addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nature of depression,</v>

993
00:45:40.201 --> 00:45:41.034
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the illnesses that psychedelics </v>

994
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.470
<v Speaker 2>turns out to be very helpful in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

995
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:47.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

996
00:45:47.671 --> 00:45:50.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm not holding a brief that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>should do this.</v>

997
00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an addict.</v>

998
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:55.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an advocate for psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an advocate for the research at this</v>

999
00:45:55.681 --> 00:45:56.010
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1000
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:57.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1001
00:45:57.751 --> 00:45:59.880
<v Speaker 2>everybody should do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what our culture needs.</v>

1002
00:45:59.881 --> 00:46:00.421
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1003
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:02.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in that Timothy leary had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1004
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:06.450
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have a powerful agent that,</v>

1005
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.313
<v Speaker 2>that there is good data now that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>can help heal people who are really </v>

1006
00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:11.664
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other reason for the openness </v>

1007
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:14.753
<v Speaker 2>that's going on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that surprised me because I expected to </v>

1008
00:46:17.791 --> 00:46:20.670
<v Speaker 2>get a lot of pushback from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric establishment.</v>

1009
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:21.631
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1010
00:46:21.631 --> 00:46:23.760
<v Speaker 2>and I looked for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called around,</v>

1011
00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:25.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear the critical voice on the</v>

1012
00:46:25.471 --> 00:46:29.160
<v Speaker 2>hopkins work and the Nyu work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I kept hearing,</v>

1013
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:30.450
<v Speaker 2>blew my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1014
00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.313
<v Speaker 2>I remember calling the head of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>National Institute of Mental Health to </v>

1015
00:46:33.361 --> 00:46:34.194
<v Speaker 2>get what I thought would be a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative quote about silicide been </v>

1016
00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:37.830
<v Speaker 2>research and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1017
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Then we have to look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is really interesting research,</v>

1018
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:42.623
<v Speaker 2>former heads of the American psychiatric</v>
<v Speaker 2>association and the reason they're so </v>

1019
00:46:46.051 --> 00:46:46.884
<v Speaker 2>open to it is that mental health </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment in this country is just a </v>

1020
00:46:50.551 --> 00:46:51.384
<v Speaker 2>mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we only reach half of the people </v>

1021
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.240
<v Speaker 2>who are struggling with mental illness </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all,</v>

1022
00:46:57.241 --> 00:46:58.074
<v Speaker 2>have any exposure to the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you compare mental health treatment </v>

1023
00:47:00.961 --> 00:47:03.960
<v Speaker 2>to any other branch of medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oncology,</v>

1024
00:47:03.961 --> 00:47:04.794
<v Speaker 2>cardiology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infectious disease is accomplished very </v>

1025
00:47:07.201 --> 00:47:09.150
<v Speaker 2>little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't prolonged lifespan,</v>

1026
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.430
<v Speaker 2>it's not saving lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1027
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.360
<v Speaker 2>and yet we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1028
00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soaring rates of depression.</v>

1029
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Depression is now the leading cause of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disability worldwide.</v>

1030
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.033
<v Speaker 2>There 300 million people with major </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression or treatment resistant </v>

1031
00:47:22.681 --> 00:47:24.930
<v Speaker 2>depression in the world right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1032
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:27.840
<v Speaker 2>and suicide rates are way up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1033
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:29.470
<v Speaker 2>partly it's the vets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1034
00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:30.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in general,</v>

1035
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:31.623
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the taboo is coming off is come off </v>

1036
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:35.680
<v Speaker 2>suicide and suicide is climbing rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and addiction is,</v>

1037
00:47:35.681 --> 00:47:36.610
<v Speaker 2>we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is rampant,</v>

1038
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:38.470
<v Speaker 2>so they need some new tools.</v>

1039
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:39.303
<v Speaker 2>There hasn't really been innovation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental health treatment since the early </v>

1040
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:43.901
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>late eighties,</v>

1041
00:47:43.901 --> 00:47:46.990
<v Speaker 2>with the introduction of the SSRI </v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants,</v>

1042
00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:48.070
<v Speaker 2>drugs like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1043
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:50.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paxil and PROZAC.</v>

1044
00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.273
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need some new tools and that's why </v>

1045
00:47:53.381 --> 00:47:54.214
<v Speaker 2>they're open to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I think it will be </v>

1046
00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:58.990
<v Speaker 2>embraced eventually by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1047
00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.460
<v Speaker 2>by the medical world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1048
00:48:00.461 --> 00:48:03.790
<v Speaker 2>isn't it on the ballot in 2018 in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California?</v>

1049
00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:04.653
<v Speaker 2>They haven't quite gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're doing their petition drive </v>

1050
00:48:06.341 --> 00:48:09.310
<v Speaker 2>right now and an Oregon too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1051
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.950
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know that it'll get through </v>
<v Speaker 2>this time.</v>

1052
00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:16.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird item to put on the ballot </v>
<v Speaker 2>because actually a small minority people</v>

1053
00:48:16.511 --> 00:48:19.000
<v Speaker 2>know what silicide is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I on this show,</v>

1054
00:48:19.001 --> 00:48:19.834
<v Speaker 2>you're the first person who said the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingredient in Ma didn't say the </v>

1055
00:48:23.321 --> 00:48:24.154
<v Speaker 2>ingredient in magic mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have some confidence that your </v>

1056
00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:27.064
<v Speaker 2>audience knows what suicide in his butt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an unfamiliar world to most </v>

1057
00:48:29.921 --> 00:48:32.140
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know how people vote on that.</v>

1058
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:35.350
<v Speaker 2>It may be premature is what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggesting.</v>

1060
00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all dependent upon getting the word</v>

1061
00:48:38.261 --> 00:48:40.690
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if people understand what,</v>

1062
00:48:40.691 --> 00:48:41.524
<v Speaker 3>like the John Hopkins research or just </v>
<v Speaker 3>the anecdotal research that some of </v>

1063
00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:45.880
<v Speaker 3>these people have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1064
00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.990
<v Speaker 3>had these incredibly life changing </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>

1065
00:48:49.991 --> 00:48:50.824
<v Speaker 3>But I think one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying is I think very important </v>

1066
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.183
<v Speaker 3>is that this isn't for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that if you have problems with </v>

1067
00:48:57.221 --> 00:49:00.010
<v Speaker 3>normal consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is likely not for you.</v>

1068
00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.580
<v Speaker 3>If you're one of those people that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>schizophrenia and your family perhaps.</v>

1069
00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:04.613
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.180
<v Speaker 2>And in fact those people are screened </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of this research very carefully.</v>

1071
00:49:08.181 --> 00:49:09.014
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1072
00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.120
<v Speaker 3>Because the Fredonia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1073
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:14.230
<v Speaker 3>it's a real issue with people with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psilocybin and Ma many psychedelics,</v>

1074
00:49:14.231 --> 00:49:14.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1075
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:15.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens with schizophrenia is if </v>

1076
00:49:17.201 --> 00:49:19.290
<v Speaker 2>you are at risk for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1077
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.270
<v Speaker 2>either for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of inheritance,</v>

1078
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:25.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a psychedelic trip can set you off,</v>

1079
00:49:25.781 --> 00:49:26.614
<v Speaker 2>can be the trigger for a life of it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things can to a divorce your </v>

1080
00:49:31.901 --> 00:49:33.700
<v Speaker 2>parents getting divorced sets people </v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

1081
00:49:33.701 --> 00:49:34.534
<v Speaker 2>go to graduate school sets people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're someone who's probably going </v>

1082
00:49:38.171 --> 00:49:41.020
<v Speaker 2>to get schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of mental trauma,</v>

1083
00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:43.900
<v Speaker 2>if it happens at that window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is in your early twenties,</v>

1084
00:49:43.901 --> 00:49:45.160
<v Speaker 2>in your late twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1085
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:46.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1086
00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:47.913
<v Speaker 2>that's why we did see some cases because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the age people were using </v>

1087
00:49:50.501 --> 00:49:54.160
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics in the 60s of having their </v>
<v Speaker 2>first psychotic break.</v>

1088
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:56.830
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're at risk for that or,</v>

1089
00:49:56.831 --> 00:49:58.570
<v Speaker 2>or bipolar as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

1090
00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.620
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1091
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1092
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:02.470
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1093
00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.590
<v Speaker 3>the numbers though mirror the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1094
00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.900
<v Speaker 3>in standard populations when it terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1095
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:12.310
<v Speaker 3>I think it's one out of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one out of 10 people have some form</v>

1096
00:50:12.311 --> 00:50:16.210
<v Speaker 3>of schizophrenia and that's mirrored in </v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana use.</v>

1097
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:17.620
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1098
00:50:17.621 --> 00:50:19.960
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the problem is,</v>

1099
00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:21.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can exacerbate it or it can trigger </v>

1100
00:50:22.931 --> 00:50:25.030
<v Speaker 3>it or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending upon,</v>

1101
00:50:25.031 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's biology's different</v>

1102
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.530
<v Speaker 4>and everyone's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1103
00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:31.340
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way they absorb these,</v>

1104
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:33.310
<v Speaker 4>these chemicals is different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1105
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:35.990
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you are at risk,</v>

1106
00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.000
<v Speaker 4>something's going to do it eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1107
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:39.950
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1108
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:40.993
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have any evidence of someone </v>

1109
00:50:42.921 --> 00:50:43.754
<v Speaker 4>thrown into a situation of schizophrenia</v>
<v Speaker 4>or other serious mental illness as a </v>

1110
00:50:47.931 --> 00:50:48.764
<v Speaker 4>result of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strictly because of the psychedelic </v>

1111
00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:53.480
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It may have been the trigger,</v>

1112
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:55.730
<v Speaker 4>but there might have been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was going to happen anyway.</v>

1113
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:56.990
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just don't know.</v>

1114
00:50:56.991 --> 00:50:58.790
<v Speaker 4>But in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've got serious,</v>

1115
00:50:58.791 --> 00:51:01.370
<v Speaker 4>if you have personality disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have bipolar,</v>

1116
00:51:01.371 --> 00:51:02.204
<v Speaker 4>if you are at risk for schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will not accept you into these </v>

1117
00:51:04.611 --> 00:51:06.590
<v Speaker 4>trials and you should stay away from </v>
<v Speaker 4>these drugs.</v>

1118
00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:08.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1119
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:09.530
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1120
00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:13.310
<v Speaker 4>that is a real problem with it being </v>
<v Speaker 4>prohibited.</v>

1121
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:17.600
<v Speaker 4>The prohibition has really set back </v>
<v Speaker 4>research and understanding decades.</v>

1122
00:51:17.601 --> 00:51:18.434
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should have been studying this stuff </v>

1123
00:51:19.041 --> 00:51:19.770
<v Speaker 4>since the sixth.</v>

1124
00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:22.850
<v Speaker 4>We had 30 years of hiatus in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>research.</v>

1125
00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:23.793
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if another time where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a promising line of scientific </v>

1126
00:51:26.481 --> 00:51:29.690
<v Speaker 4>inquiry all through the 50s and early </v>
<v Speaker 4>sixties,</v>

1127
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:33.350
<v Speaker 4>that's just choked off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for 30 years nothing happened.</v>

1128
00:51:33.351 --> 00:51:35.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think of what we would know if we had 30</v>

1129
00:51:35.181 --> 00:51:37.310
<v Speaker 4>more years of research with these drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

1130
00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:40.970
<v Speaker 4>So now we're picking up the thread and </v>
<v Speaker 4>all that research is being resumed.</v>

1131
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:42.043
<v Speaker 4>But your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your point about prohibition is </v>

1132
00:51:42.951 --> 00:51:44.930
<v Speaker 4>really important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you have prohibition,</v>

1133
00:51:44.931 --> 00:51:47.630
<v Speaker 4>you can't regulate something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a free for all.</v>

1134
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:52.870
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whereas if you did legalize silicide and</v>

1135
00:51:53.081 --> 00:51:55.760
<v Speaker 4>let's take as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could set rules.</v>

1136
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:56.623
<v Speaker 4>You could say that it can only be </v>
<v Speaker 4>administered by licensed guides or in a </v>

1137
00:51:59.691 --> 00:52:03.920
<v Speaker 4>medical context or that no one under a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain age can have it.</v>

1138
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:08.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean it gives you a chance to regulate</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's why it's Saner to,</v>

1139
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:12.740
<v Speaker 4>to legalize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not in a free for all kinds of way,</v>

1140
00:52:12.741 --> 00:52:13.574
<v Speaker 4>but in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a very considered way then to have </v>

1141
00:52:16.341 --> 00:52:19.160
<v Speaker 4>the system we have now where people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to take the drug,</v>

1142
00:52:19.161 --> 00:52:21.650
<v Speaker 4>whether they should or not without any </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of clearance.</v>

1143
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.510
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>

1144
00:52:23.511 --> 00:52:25.060
<v Speaker 4>who knows what you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

1145
00:52:25.061 --> 00:52:26.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can also regulate the,</v>

1146
00:52:26.731 --> 00:52:28.430
<v Speaker 4>the strength and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1147
00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:30.620
<v Speaker 4>and in the case of Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1148
00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:31.454
<v Speaker 4>in the 60s there was this period where </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of pure lsd around and </v>

1149
00:52:33.891 --> 00:52:34.724
<v Speaker 4>then the mob got an interest in it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they started cutting it with speed and </v>

1150
00:52:37.941 --> 00:52:41.180
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of things and people got into </v>
<v Speaker 4>it a lot of trouble.</v>

1151
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:46.190
<v Speaker 4>It's also the issue with scheduling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like scheduled ones for things that have</v>

1152
00:52:46.191 --> 00:52:49.760
<v Speaker 4>zero medical value and that's where a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of these drugs find themselves.</v>

1153
00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:52.900
<v Speaker 4>Academics are all schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is just bananas,</v>

1154
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:56.180
<v Speaker 4>especially Dmt w the old Terence Mckenna</v>
<v Speaker 4>line.</v>

1155
00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.530
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's holding.</v>

1156
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:58.503
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all,</v>

1157
00:52:58.850 --> 00:52:59.683
<v Speaker 4>we all have dmt in our bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all have a schedule one substance </v>

1158
00:53:02.121 --> 00:53:02.954
<v Speaker 4>flowing through our veins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the most asinine thing in the </v>

1159
00:53:06.531 --> 00:53:09.230
<v Speaker 4>world to make your body a schedule one </v>
<v Speaker 4>substance.</v>

1160
00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:10.371
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

1161
00:53:10.371 --> 00:53:11.204
<v Speaker 4>And the fact is that schedule one means </v>
<v Speaker 4>that these drugs have a high potential </v>

1162
00:53:13.911 --> 00:53:14.744
<v Speaker 4>for abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which isn't really true with </v>

1163
00:53:16.611 --> 00:53:17.444
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics cause they're not addictive</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that they have no accepted medical </v>

1164
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.330
<v Speaker 4>use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is now no longer true either.</v>

1165
00:53:23.331 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 4>Because these studies have shown that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they do have a medical</v>

1166
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:26.910
<v Speaker 2>use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1167
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:30.660
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I hope happens and what,</v>

1168
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:34.050
<v Speaker 2>and what we're on track to see happen is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that these,</v>

1169
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.110
<v Speaker 2>these trials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these drug trials we'll expand.</v>

1170
00:53:37.111 --> 00:53:39.120
<v Speaker 2>There will be now phase three drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>trials,</v>

1171
00:53:39.121 --> 00:53:41.580
<v Speaker 2>which is the last step before FDA </v>
<v Speaker 2>approval.</v>

1172
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.403
<v Speaker 2>If the results of those trials are </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere near as good as the phase two </v>

1173
00:53:46.351 --> 00:53:47.184
<v Speaker 2>trials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the FDA will then approve psilocybin as </v>

1174
00:53:50.671 --> 00:53:54.330
<v Speaker 2>a medicine and MTMA which there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which probably happened first.</v>

1175
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 2>They're looking at that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1176
00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:58.950
<v Speaker 2>for use in treating people with trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1177
00:53:58.951 --> 00:53:59.784
<v Speaker 2>and then we will be in a world where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll have to reschedule it a to two </v>

1178
00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:04.560
<v Speaker 2>or three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1179
00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:06.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opiates are too,</v>

1180
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:09.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the drug causing most suffering</v>

1181
00:54:09.541 --> 00:54:12.360
<v Speaker 2>in our country right now in death is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>a schedule one.</v>

1182
00:54:12.361 --> 00:54:14.490
<v Speaker 2>It's a schedule too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's too,</v>

1183
00:54:14.491 --> 00:54:16.020
<v Speaker 2>it might be three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1184
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.980
<v Speaker 2>and so that we may see this in the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>five years or so,</v>

1185
00:54:19.981 --> 00:54:21.570
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of amazing.</v>

1186
00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:22.993
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to get someone like jeff </v>

1187
00:54:23.361 --> 00:54:27.350
<v Speaker 3>sessions out of there that requires some</v>
<v Speaker 3>fairly archaic ideas.</v>

1188
00:54:27.351 --> 00:54:27.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1189
00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:30.550
<v Speaker 2>I agree about marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1190
00:54:30.551 --> 00:54:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1191
00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:34.660
<v Speaker 2>in this administration we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have another backlash.</v>

1192
00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:38.560
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that surprise me </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that their voices on the right,</v>

1193
00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supporting this research.</v>

1194
00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:41.493
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rebecca Mercer has given money to maps </v>

1195
00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:48.490
<v Speaker 2>the Multidisciplinary Association of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelic studies for their work on,</v>

1196
00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:49.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mtma.</v>

1197
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:50.843
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Steve Bannon has spoken out in </v>

1198
00:54:52.931 --> 00:54:55.240
<v Speaker 2>approval of this research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1199
00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.400
<v Speaker 2>and Peter Teal is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1200
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:58.263
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is investing in a psychedelic </v>

1201
00:54:59.771 --> 00:55:02.320
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical company that's getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>started in England.</v>

1202
00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:06.100
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may not break down in the usual right</v>

1203
00:55:06.101 --> 00:55:08.570
<v Speaker 2>left way that we're so accustomed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1204
00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:10.180
<v Speaker 2>and that may give it some protection.</v>

1205
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.273
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the things that'll help </v>

1206
00:55:11.791 --> 00:55:12.624
<v Speaker 3>is anyone who has a loved one that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going through a terminal illness and </v>

1207
00:55:16.111 --> 00:55:21.111
<v Speaker 3>experiences these things and sees the </v>
<v Speaker 3>profound alleviation of anxiety and this</v>

1208
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:24.750
<v Speaker 3>just lessening of the worry of passing </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1209
00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:29.160
<v Speaker 3>And Larry Hagman was once on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a real straight television show,</v>

1210
00:55:29.161 --> 00:55:31.740
<v Speaker 3>like CBS or Fox News or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1211
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.850
<v Speaker 3>And they asked him about his life and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>

1212
00:55:34.851 --> 00:55:35.684
<v Speaker 3>what makes him so happy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said he had a profound acid trip </v>

1213
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:41.140
<v Speaker 3>and you see the host going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1214
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.611
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1215
00:55:41.611 --> 00:55:46.140
<v Speaker 3>well I took a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a really powerful dose of Lsd and a,</v>

1216
00:55:46.141 --> 00:55:49.170
<v Speaker 3>it completely alleviated my worries </v>
<v Speaker 3>about dying.</v>

1217
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:50.903
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember seeing him on television </v>

1218
00:55:52.681 --> 00:55:53.131
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1219
00:55:53.131 --> 00:55:53.964
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know this was coming and </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing this straight interview or just </v>

1220
00:55:57.811 --> 00:56:00.120
<v Speaker 3>trying to uncomfortably move past the </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject.</v>

1221
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.983
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the guy from Dallas is a fucking </v>

1222
00:56:02.341 --> 00:56:05.220
<v Speaker 3>drug addict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what to do with it,</v>

1223
00:56:05.221 --> 00:56:06.054
<v Speaker 3>but he was so warm and smiling and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it was a piece on his house </v>

1224
00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:12.203
<v Speaker 3>because he had some crazy off the grid </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of life and some ecofriendly house </v>

1225
00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:18.900
<v Speaker 3>and all solar powered and used a well </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all this different things.</v>

1226
00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:20.370
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1227
00:56:20.371 --> 00:56:21.204
<v Speaker 3>they were asking him what made him so </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy and I'll never forget that he was </v>

1228
00:56:23.501 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 3>saying</v>

1229
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.720
<v Speaker 4>when he did acid wants a really powerful</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

1230
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:28.380
<v Speaker 4>Cary grant also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1231
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:30.820
<v Speaker 4>had 60,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1232
00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:35.880
<v Speaker 4>guided LSD trips in the late fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he gave an interview in 1959 to a,</v>

1233
00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:38.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Gospel,</v>

1234
00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:41.630
<v Speaker 4>very famous Joseph hyams who was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>gossip columns.</v>

1235
00:56:41.631 --> 00:56:44.500
<v Speaker 4>So that time saying this had changed his</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1236
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:46.810
<v Speaker 4>He was using a low dose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

1237
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:51.160
<v Speaker 4>there were a lot of psychiatrists in la </v>
<v Speaker 4>who were giving a low dose Lsd to people</v>

1238
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:52.023
<v Speaker 4>in their normal talk therapy sessions to</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially it was called psycholytic </v>

1239
00:56:55.121 --> 00:56:55.954
<v Speaker 4>therapy cause it was mind loosening </v>
<v Speaker 4>therapy and it would give you more </v>

1240
00:56:59.261 --> 00:57:00.094
<v Speaker 4>access to your unconscious and make you </v>
<v Speaker 4>be able to talk about things that you </v>

1241
00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:04.890
<v Speaker 4>might otherwise feel very defensive </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

1242
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:06.093
<v Speaker 4>And he had 60 of these sessions and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>said he was born again and he said that </v>

1243
00:57:09.491 --> 00:57:12.610
<v Speaker 4>it had made him a much better actor </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he no longer had an ego.</v>

1244
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:14.800
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't crippled by his ego,</v>

1245
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:17.890
<v Speaker 4>but then he also said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it made me irresistible to women.</v>

1246
00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:22.930
<v Speaker 4>Sounds a little egotistical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have no ego with chicks love.</v>

1247
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:23.793
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1248
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:29.020
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you aware of any of the research are</v>

1249
00:57:29.021 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 4>doing now with ketamine and depression </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're there?</v>

1250
00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:33.933
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that are getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>administered pretty high doses of </v>

1251
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:40.420
<v Speaker 4>intravenous and intramuscular ketamine </v>
<v Speaker 4>for depression,</v>

1252
00:57:40.421 --> 00:57:42.940
<v Speaker 4>including one of my good friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Neil Brennan.</v>

1253
00:57:42.941 --> 00:57:43.774
<v Speaker 4>He's gone through it several times and </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about it on the podcast and said </v>

1254
00:57:46.751 --> 00:57:47.584
<v Speaker 4>it was a real game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of excitement in </v>

1255
00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:53.440
<v Speaker 4>psychiatry about ketamine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ketamine as an anesthetic.</v>

1256
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:54.071
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1257
00:57:54.071 --> 00:57:55.550
<v Speaker 4>it dissociative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1258
00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.393
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes you feel separated from your </v>

1259
00:57:57.341 --> 00:57:59.960
<v Speaker 4>body and that helps with pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1260
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:00.993
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's strictly speaking </v>

1261
00:58:01.991 --> 00:58:02.824
<v Speaker 4>the Psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's certainly not a classic </v>

1262
00:58:03.641 --> 00:58:06.070
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work on those brain networks.</v>

1263
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:07.420
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1264
00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is legal because it's been used as an</v>

1265
00:58:09.791 --> 00:58:10.624
<v Speaker 4>anesthetic for years and it's relatively</v>
<v Speaker 4>safe as an anesthetic compared to some </v>

1266
00:58:13.811 --> 00:58:14.710
<v Speaker 4>of the others that are used.</v>

1267
00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:16.360
<v Speaker 4>It's the one they use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

1268
00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:17.253
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1269
00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:18.183
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you come into the trauma center and </v>

1270
00:58:19.121 --> 00:58:19.954
<v Speaker 4>you'd been shot or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need surgery and they don't have </v>

1271
00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:23.380
<v Speaker 4>time to check whether you're allergic to</v>
<v Speaker 4>any other drugs.</v>

1272
00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:24.723
<v Speaker 4>That's the safe one to give you in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>crisis would carry it around during </v>

1273
00:58:26.951 --> 00:58:27.784
<v Speaker 4>times of war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that's turned to people on the </v>

1274
00:58:28.781 --> 00:58:29.500
<v Speaker 4>field.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1275
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:30.333
<v Speaker 4>they all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1276
00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1277
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:32.583
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't really understand how it </v>

1278
00:58:34.421 --> 00:58:35.254
<v Speaker 4>works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they give people what is kind of a </v>

1279
00:58:36.521 --> 00:58:39.400
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic dose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go way out there.</v>

1280
00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:42.070
<v Speaker 4>It's fairly brief,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

1281
00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:45.820
<v Speaker 4>and many people with depression have </v>
<v Speaker 4>found relief.</v>

1282
00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:47.680
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not permanent.</v>

1283
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:49.000
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they need to,</v>

1284
00:58:49.001 --> 00:58:52.420
<v Speaker 4>it looks like they need to do it again </v>
<v Speaker 4>every six months or something like that.</v>

1285
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:53.703
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it seems to kind of reset the brain </v>

1286
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:57.190
<v Speaker 4>in a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1287
00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.170
<v Speaker 4>many people are finding helpful.</v>

1288
00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:00.670
<v Speaker 4>And this is all legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1289
00:59:00.671 --> 00:59:02.440
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are ketamine clinics,</v>

1290
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:03.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you can go,</v>

1291
00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:05.650
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and psychiatrists who are,</v>

1292
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.000
<v Speaker 4>who are administering it to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1293
00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:13.350
<v Speaker 4>so for people who are struggling with </v>
<v Speaker 4>depression and can't wait for psilocybin</v>

1294
00:59:14.201 --> 00:59:17.380
<v Speaker 4>therapy to be approved for depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is still several years away,</v>

1295
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:19.540
<v Speaker 4>ketamine is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is worth exploring.</v>

1296
00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.550
<v Speaker 4>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you look into that at all?</v>

1297
00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.350
<v Speaker 4>A little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1298
00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:25.273
<v Speaker 4>I begin is a psychedelic from a root of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a tree that grows in Africa and it has </v>

1299
00:59:29.991 --> 00:59:32.630
<v Speaker 4>been used specifically to treat opiate </v>
<v Speaker 4>addiction.</v>

1300
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's God,</v>

1301
00:59:34.521 --> 00:59:35.354
<v Speaker 4>if we need something now a tool to deal </v>
<v Speaker 4>with opiate addiction are clinics in </v>

1302
00:59:38.451 --> 00:59:41.050
<v Speaker 4>Mexico where they one down there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1303
00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:43.760
<v Speaker 4>You opened it after he had his own </v>
<v Speaker 4>personal problems with pills.</v>

1304
00:59:43.761 --> 00:59:46.160
<v Speaker 4>He had a back injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got hooked on pills,</v>

1305
00:59:46.161 --> 00:59:47.960
<v Speaker 4>was really struggling to get off of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1306
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:52.220
<v Speaker 4>Went to Mexico to do Ibogaine caught </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely off of it felt amazing.</v>

1307
00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:53.270
<v Speaker 4>Realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1308
00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:55.730
<v Speaker 4>I have to help people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then opened up his own clinic.</v>

1309
00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.580
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a bunch in Guadalajara,</v>

1310
00:59:58.581 --> 00:59:59.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where he is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is,</v>

1311
00:59:59.931 --> 01:00:00.890
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is uh,</v>

1312
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people doing it.</v>

1313
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:04.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly what the legal </v>
<v Speaker 4>status is in Mexico,</v>

1314
01:00:04.251 --> 01:00:05.084
<v Speaker 4>whether it's legal or just tolerated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most drugs have been decriminalized in </v>

1315
01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:11.840
<v Speaker 4>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including LSD and mushrooms and a lot of</v>

1316
01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:12.674
<v Speaker 4>other things to try to do something to </v>
<v Speaker 4>curb the violence from the drug cartels </v>

1317
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.070
<v Speaker 4>at least keep it nonlocal right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1318
01:00:19.071 --> 01:00:21.560
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the violence is coming from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>drug cartels,</v>

1319
01:00:21.561 --> 01:00:26.561
<v Speaker 4>getting money to ship everything to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>United States with our use.</v>

1320
01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:28.183
<v Speaker 4>It is very strange that our insistence </v>
<v Speaker 4>on prohibition is actually funding one </v>

1321
01:00:31.971 --> 01:00:32.804
<v Speaker 4>of the largest drug and violence </v>
<v Speaker 4>epidemics we've ever seen in terms of </v>

1322
01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:38.720
<v Speaker 4>like what's happening south of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>border.</v>

1323
01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:39.211
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1324
01:00:39.211 --> 01:00:41.330
<v Speaker 4>and think about Columbia to the civil </v>
<v Speaker 4>war in Colombia.</v>

1325
01:00:41.331 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Speaker 4>It was funded by our card or cocaine </v>
<v Speaker 4>interest.</v>

1326
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:48.260
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I began as a very intense drug.</v>

1327
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.690
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1328
01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:51.080
<v Speaker 4>did you do it for though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

1329
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:51.973
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1330
01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:52.813
<v Speaker 4>and I wouldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think because it has big </v>

1331
01:00:55.071 --> 01:00:59.150
<v Speaker 4>implications for your heart and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in fact when you,</v>

1332
01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:00.463
<v Speaker 4>so it is more toxic to the body than the</v>
<v Speaker 4>so called classic psychedelics and it </v>

1333
01:01:04.311 --> 01:01:07.070
<v Speaker 4>can last like 36 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very long trip.</v>

1334
01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:11.270
<v Speaker 4>It's really intense in these clinics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They s you have to be on a heart monitor</v>

1335
01:01:11.271 --> 01:01:12.680
<v Speaker 4>while they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while you're doing it.</v>

1336
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.240
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that was like,</v>

1337
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:15.860
<v Speaker 4>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a,</v>

1338
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.510
<v Speaker 4>I have a minor heart issue that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that made me stay away from Mtma,</v>

1339
01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:21.650
<v Speaker 4>which is an amphetamine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1340
01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.870
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1341
01:01:23.871 --> 01:01:24.704
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm the kind of guy who goes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>his cardiologist before he has six </v>

1342
01:01:27.261 --> 01:01:29.960
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic trips to check it all out </v>
<v Speaker 4>and make sure it's okay.</v>

1343
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:33.530
<v Speaker 4>I have something called Afib,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a atrial fibrillation,</v>

1344
01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.550
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1345
01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:36.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his Ma you can manage with,</v>

1346
01:01:36.441 --> 01:01:38.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with medicine,</v>

1347
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.043
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or there's a procedure you can get it </v>

1348
01:01:39.801 --> 01:01:42.660
<v Speaker 4>just to kind of occasional irregular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1349
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.840
<v Speaker 4>it just happens sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1350
01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.793
<v Speaker 4>but my cardiologist warned me off of MDM</v>
<v Speaker 4>may because it can raise your heart </v>

1351
01:01:49.281 --> 01:01:50.930
<v Speaker 4>rate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although I've subsequently learned,</v>

1352
01:01:50.931 --> 01:01:52.950
<v Speaker 4>if you take a Beta blocker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1353
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:54.380
<v Speaker 4>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1354
01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:55.820
<v Speaker 4>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

1355
01:01:55.821 --> 01:01:58.910
<v Speaker 4>I've never experimented with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

1356
01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:01.520
<v Speaker 4>in light of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1357
01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:02.383
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1358
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:03.860
<v Speaker 4>I would stay away from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I began,</v>

1359
01:02:03.861 --> 01:02:04.694
<v Speaker 4>but I'm really curious about it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we have such a crisis with </v>

1360
01:02:06.651 --> 01:02:07.780
<v Speaker 4>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1361
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:08.743
<v Speaker 4>but silicide been is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is being used successfully for </v>

1362
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:11.840
<v Speaker 4>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I talked to,</v>

1363
01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:13.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking people,</v>

1364
01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:14.623
<v Speaker 4>lifelong smokers who broke their </v>
<v Speaker 4>addiction with a single or two silicide </v>

1365
01:02:18.011 --> 01:02:20.550
<v Speaker 4>and journeys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they had extraordinary</v>

1366
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:22.160
<v Speaker 2>stories to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1367
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:23.063
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand how you could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>one trip and then give up a lifelong </v>

1368
01:02:25.621 --> 01:02:27.720
<v Speaker 2>habit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I asked people about this and,</v>

1369
01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:28.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to this one woman,</v>

1370
01:02:28.981 --> 01:02:32.130
<v Speaker 2>she was about 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she was an Irish book editor,</v>

1371
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.570
<v Speaker 2>and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1372
01:02:33.571 --> 01:02:35.010
<v Speaker 2>she said on her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1373
01:02:35.011 --> 01:02:36.120
<v Speaker 2>so what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you,</v>

1374
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:37.440
<v Speaker 2>how'd you stop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

1375
01:02:37.441 --> 01:02:38.274
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1376
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.233
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I first I grew wings and I flew through </v>

1377
01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:43.650
<v Speaker 2>European history and I visited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1378
01:02:43.651 --> 01:02:44.484
<v Speaker 2>the site of Shakespeare's globe theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I saw the Salem witch trials and I </v>

1379
01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:49.943
<v Speaker 2>died three times and I saw my body a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rising from a funeral pyre on the </v>

1380
01:02:53.431 --> 01:02:54.264
<v Speaker 2>Ganges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I realize the universe was so </v>

1381
01:02:56.041 --> 01:02:56.874
<v Speaker 2>amazing and there were so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible things to do that killing </v>

1382
01:02:59.821 --> 01:03:01.560
<v Speaker 2>yourself with cigarettes seem kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>

1383
01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could've told you that.</v>

1384
01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1385
01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.590
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to that,</v>

1386
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:08.783
<v Speaker 2>that noetic quality that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had a perspective on her life she'd </v>

1387
01:03:12.061 --> 01:03:12.894
<v Speaker 2>never had or on the universe and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>she believed that smoking was stupid in </v>

1388
01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:22.560
<v Speaker 2>a way she knew before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't have that conviction.</v>

1389
01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:26.220
<v Speaker 2>That rock hard review revealed truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conviction.</v>

1390
01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:27.773
<v Speaker 2>And I heard that for many people and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked the doctor about it or the </v>

1391
01:03:30.361 --> 01:03:32.220
<v Speaker 2>psychologist who was running the study </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1392
01:03:32.221 --> 01:03:33.054
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody has these Duh moments and </v>

1393
01:03:35.041 --> 01:03:38.040
<v Speaker 2>they're on their psychedelic trips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then ended up being transformative.</v>

1394
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Did you have a dumb moment?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of insights.</v>

1395
01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:44.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I,</v>

1396
01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:45.240
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did actually.</v>

1397
01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.790
<v Speaker 2>I have different trips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you have while you're doing,</v>

1398
01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.530
<v Speaker 2>I had a six or seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1399
01:03:48.531 --> 01:03:51.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I just a couple to silicide trips.</v>

1400
01:03:51.721 --> 01:03:53.730
<v Speaker 2>One guy did one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not an LSD trip,</v>

1401
01:03:53.731 --> 01:03:56.850
<v Speaker 2>guided a couple IOWASCA circles.</v>

1402
01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:58.410
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1403
01:03:58.470 --> 01:04:02.010
<v Speaker 2>I had a really weird psychedelic call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five Meo DMT,</v>

1404
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:07.070
<v Speaker 2>which is the smoked venom of the Sonoran</v>
<v Speaker 2>desert toad who figured that out,</v>

1405
01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she gets some kind of prize.</v>

1406
01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1407
01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.880
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty potent,</v>

1408
01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:15.780
<v Speaker 2>very potent and thank God short acting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm short lived.</v>

1409
01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:16.441
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1410
01:04:16.441 --> 01:04:18.290
<v Speaker 2>it was actually a horrible experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really,</v>

1411
01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:19.380
<v Speaker 2>that was my worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1412
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:21.070
<v Speaker 2>I had a great experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what was wrong with it?</v>

1414
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.680
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1415
01:04:25.681 --> 01:04:28.290
<v Speaker 2>you take like one puff and before you </v>
<v Speaker 2>exhale,</v>

1416
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1417
01:04:29.971 --> 01:04:31.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a synthetic version two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1418
01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:33.290
<v Speaker 2>I was taking the venom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1419
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.230
<v Speaker 2>you're shut out of a cannon and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no lead up,</v>

1420
01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:37.940
<v Speaker 2>no warm up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like fun.</v>

1421
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:43.410
<v Speaker 2>And I felt like I was actually like </v>
<v Speaker 2>strapped to the outside of a rocket,</v>

1422
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:44.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going through space and through clouds </v>

1423
01:04:46.171 --> 01:04:48.480
<v Speaker 2>and like the g forces pulling down my </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheeks.</v>

1424
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:53.480
<v Speaker 2>And it was just this mental storm </v>
<v Speaker 2>without any nothing to Orient Myself.</v>

1425
01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:57.180
<v Speaker 2>There was no space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no time,</v>

1426
01:04:57.181 --> 01:05:00.360
<v Speaker 2>there was no self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1427
01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:01.763
<v Speaker 2>it was just unendurable this punishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>roar and my years and someone who had </v>

1428
01:05:05.641 --> 01:05:06.474
<v Speaker 2>done it said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually it's like a takeoff and you </v>

1429
01:05:08.191 --> 01:05:09.930
<v Speaker 2>get into orbit and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1430
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.850
<v Speaker 2>it's very nice at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what happened with me is I had the,</v>

1431
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I had the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I felt like it was like,</v>

1432
01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:21.790
<v Speaker 2>the metaphor I use in the book is like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1433
01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:24.730
<v Speaker 2>I can't explain this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell a story without place,</v>

1434
01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.110
<v Speaker 2>time and character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1435
01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.720
<v Speaker 2>I had none of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1436
01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:28.773
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just this in Kuwait energy and I </v>

1437
01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:34.330
<v Speaker 2>said it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like the before the big bang.</v>

1438
01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:35.230
<v Speaker 2>You remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1439
01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.900
<v Speaker 2>obviously nobody does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1440
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.980
<v Speaker 2>But there was pure energy and no matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>

1441
01:05:38.981 --> 01:05:39.910
<v Speaker 2>and no time yet.</v>

1442
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I was.</v>

1443
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:43.240
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was horrible.</v>

1444
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:45.250
<v Speaker 2>It was terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought I was dying,</v>

1445
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.930
<v Speaker 2>but then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come down,</v>

1446
01:05:47.931 --> 01:05:48.764
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of a suborbital flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I started coming down and </v>

1447
01:05:52.721 --> 01:05:53.890
<v Speaker 2>suddenly I could feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1448
01:05:53.891 --> 01:05:55.150
<v Speaker 2>I've got a body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1449
01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.980
<v Speaker 2>it was touching my legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a body and like,</v>

1450
01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:58.720
<v Speaker 2>oh there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a floor,</v>

1451
01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:02.100
<v Speaker 2>there's their space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's time and the,</v>

1452
01:06:02.101 --> 01:06:02.934
<v Speaker 2>and the universe kind of reconsolidated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had this feeling of incredible </v>

1453
01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:09.520
<v Speaker 2>gratitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just for being alive,</v>

1454
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.400
<v Speaker 2>which all of us have had at one point or</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

1455
01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.413
<v Speaker 2>but that anything existed I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was grateful for the fact that there </v>

1456
01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:19.600
<v Speaker 2>is something and not nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'd seen what nothing was lying.</v>

1457
01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.530
<v Speaker 2>And so in that sense it ended up kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>

1458
01:06:23.531 --> 01:06:25.960
<v Speaker 2>but you wouldn't want to go there to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have that experience.</v>

1459
01:06:25.961 --> 01:06:26.794
<v Speaker 2>So subsequently somebody said to me a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very experienced psychonaut who I was </v>

1460
01:06:30.881 --> 01:06:33.730
<v Speaker 2>telling the story too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said you didn't have enough.</v>

1461
01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.680
<v Speaker 3>I was just going to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1462
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:36.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause you only took one hit.</v>

1463
01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:40.450
<v Speaker 3>Usually take three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take three and the rocket lied.</v>

1464
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:43.410
<v Speaker 3>The rocket ride leads you somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes you too.</v>

1465
01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:44.650
<v Speaker 3>You take three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

1466
01:06:44.651 --> 01:06:45.540
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

1467
01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:47.430
<v Speaker 3>three in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a same time,</v>

1468
01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:50.290
<v Speaker 3>blow it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take a big one below it out.</v>

1469
01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Take a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as you're taking the third one,</v>

1470
01:06:52.571 --> 01:06:53.404
<v Speaker 3>you're already seeing the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>crystallize in front of you had already </v>

1471
01:06:55.091 --> 01:06:58.390
<v Speaker 3>starts turning into geometric patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He put the pipe down,</v>

1472
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:03.520
<v Speaker 3>lay back in the chair and just shoot off</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the center of the universe.</v>

1473
01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:06.310
<v Speaker 3>The terrifying thing is you cease to </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist like,</v>

1474
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:07.203
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the one drug that I've ever taken </v>

1475
01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:10.120
<v Speaker 3>where you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not there anymore.</v>

1476
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1477
01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:11.763
<v Speaker 3>even an end dimethyl trip to Maine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the difference between five </v>

1478
01:07:14.801 --> 01:07:15.634
<v Speaker 3>methoxy diamond field trip to me is just</v>
<v Speaker 3>an oxygen oxygen molecule attached to </v>

1479
01:07:18.521 --> 01:07:19.354
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but [inaudible] and dimethyltryptamine </v>

1480
01:07:20.711 --> 01:07:24.850
<v Speaker 3>is incredibly visually stimulating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five methoxy is not,</v>

1481
01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:26.080
<v Speaker 3>it's just white.</v>

1482
01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:28.290
<v Speaker 2>It was white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was definitely,</v>

1483
01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:31.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how I could have taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>three hits because I hadn't excelled.</v>

1484
01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.850
<v Speaker 2>The first one when I was gone,</v>

1485
01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:33.471
<v Speaker 3>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1486
01:07:33.471 --> 01:07:34.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1487
01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:37.580
<v Speaker 3>I only did the synthetic version of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're doing this.</v>

1488
01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:38.740
<v Speaker 3>And the person I know who</v>

1489
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.633
<v Speaker 2>did the synthetic version had a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>different experience and they felt like </v>

1490
01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:44.800
<v Speaker 2>they were installed in the firmament as </v>
<v Speaker 2>this happy star,</v>

1491
01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.480
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

1492
01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.670
<v Speaker 2>who knows I did something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1493
01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:49.683
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think you had a different </v>

1494
01:07:51.191 --> 01:07:53.800
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean I've obviously,</v>

1495
01:07:53.801 --> 01:07:55.520
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be some sort of chemical </v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

1496
01:07:55.521 --> 01:07:56.354
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably getting other things in </v>

1497
01:07:57.671 --> 01:08:01.120
<v Speaker 3>that frog venom as well as pure dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That may be it.</v>

1498
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's all,</v>

1499
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:06.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the answer to the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>frog spit do you,</v>

1500
01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:07.430
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no carbs.</v>

1501
01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.730
<v Speaker 3>No frogs were harmed in the making of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this drug.</v>

1502
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:13.210
<v Speaker 3>It's excreted on the outside of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>body and what most people can milk them.</v>

1503
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:14.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1504
01:08:14.011 --> 01:08:14.844
<v Speaker 3>you rub them on a glass and then let it </v>
<v Speaker 3>dry off and then you scrape it off the </v>

1505
01:08:19.131 --> 01:08:21.080
<v Speaker 3>glass and crystal get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1506
01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.553
<v Speaker 3>You just kind of squeeze them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it sprays the glass and </v>

1507
01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:26.900
<v Speaker 3>overnight it turns into it looks like </v>
<v Speaker 3>brown sugar.</v>

1508
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an amazing thing.</v>

1509
01:08:28.311 --> 01:08:30.890
<v Speaker 3>You're the first person who knows </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything about it that I've had that who</v>

1510
01:08:30.891 --> 01:08:35.460
<v Speaker 3>is going to be able to buy it used to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to buy legal time recently 2011 jug</v>

1511
01:08:35.461 --> 01:08:36.110
<v Speaker 3>of this shit.</v>

1512
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:37.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Offline.</v>

1513
01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:39.530
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought it from some company,</v>

1514
01:08:39.531 --> 01:08:42.320
<v Speaker 3>American chemical company or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they send it to you.</v>

1515
01:08:42.321 --> 01:08:43.154
<v Speaker 3>And I had enough to get the entire state</v>
<v Speaker 3>of California high for several days </v>

1516
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.823
<v Speaker 3>because it doesn't take much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not something you want to do </v>

1517
01:08:50.031 --> 01:08:50.864
<v Speaker 3>very often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it has the same kind of </v>

1518
01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:53.744
<v Speaker 3>healing properties because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing back information that's usable </v>

1519
01:08:56.601 --> 01:08:58.070
<v Speaker 3>bag a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1520
01:08:58.071 --> 01:08:58.904
<v Speaker 3>I brought back a lot about myself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I realized as I </v>

1521
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:05.630
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I recorded what I would do is post trip,</v>

1522
01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:09.290
<v Speaker 3>I'd hit a tape recorder right when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>became conscious again and start talking</v>

1523
01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:10.124
<v Speaker 3>about the experience and what I remember</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying about the five methoxy dmt </v>

1524
01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:14.984
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1525
01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:20.260
<v Speaker 3>as I'm trying to recount what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel my ego trying to retake,</v>

1526
01:09:22.161 --> 01:09:22.994
<v Speaker 3>hold the situation and even use words in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a way that might impress you with my </v>

1527
01:09:27.471 --> 01:09:29.990
<v Speaker 3>ability to describe things or as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1528
01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:30.824
<v Speaker 3>as a professional comedian too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was aware that like a lot of what </v>

1529
01:09:33.561 --> 01:09:34.394
<v Speaker 3>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying things in a way that's </v>

1530
01:09:35.961 --> 01:09:39.140
<v Speaker 3>pleasing to people so that they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>excited about hearing you talk.</v>

1531
01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.360
<v Speaker 3>And I was very aware of that while I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

1532
01:09:41.361 --> 01:09:42.194
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying I'm trying to explain things </v>

1533
01:09:44.181 --> 01:09:45.014
<v Speaker 3>that are not possible to explain because</v>
<v Speaker 3>the words that we're using were all </v>

1534
01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:53.090
<v Speaker 3>invented for a world that doesn't exist </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the DMT dimension.</v>

1535
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.670
<v Speaker 3>And it's once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you break through,</v>

1536
01:09:55.790 --> 01:10:00.790
<v Speaker 3>it is so profoundly alien that any words</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberating.</v>

1537
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:01.930
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1538
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:03.710
<v Speaker 3>Well in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it may,</v>

1539
01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:07.340
<v Speaker 3>it may be really truly realize that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>are in a soup of,</v>

1540
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.760
<v Speaker 3>of Adams and that it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1541
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:13.250
<v Speaker 3>There's not like Michael Pollan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan and Jamie Vernon in a room.</v>

1542
01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:15.490
<v Speaker 3>Here's a wood table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's oxygen in between.</v>

1543
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:16.460
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1544
01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:20.810
<v Speaker 3>we're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an universal stew of particles.</v>

1545
01:10:20.811 --> 01:10:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it breaks those particles down,</v>

1546
01:10:23.391 --> 01:10:27.140
<v Speaker 3>or at least it gives you a view into </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and you cease to exist,</v>

1547
01:10:27.141 --> 01:10:27.974
<v Speaker 3>which is the most bizarre thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so similar to end and </v>

1548
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:35.360
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine chemically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so different in the fact that you're</v>

1549
01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:40.010
<v Speaker 3>not there while you're doing regular d n</v>
<v Speaker 3>and dimethyl trip to me,</v>

1550
01:10:40.011 --> 01:10:42.560
<v Speaker 3>which is the active ingredient Iowasca </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you'd done that,</v>

1551
01:10:42.561 --> 01:10:43.400
<v Speaker 3>the pure version of it.</v>

1552
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:44.440
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the pure version.</v>

1553
01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:49.690
<v Speaker 3>The pure version is like a very short,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more intense Iowasca experience.</v>

1554
01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.930
<v Speaker 3>I've never done Iowasca.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only done the dmt version,</v>

1555
01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.930
<v Speaker 3>but the injection or no smoking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you,</v>

1556
01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:58.793
<v Speaker 3>what you get out of it is you're there </v>
<v Speaker 3>while this is happening and you're just </v>

1557
01:11:02.601 --> 01:11:05.250
<v Speaker 3>blown away and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can ask drew and I don't see,</v>

1558
01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:08.740
<v Speaker 3>but there's all these entities are </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to calm you down,</v>

1559
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:10.280
<v Speaker 3>relax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>relax,</v>

1560
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:12.290
<v Speaker 3>take it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>settle down,</v>

1561
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:15.550
<v Speaker 3>settle down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all trying to calm you down and,</v>

1562
01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:16.021
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1563
01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:17.670
<v Speaker 3>and alleviate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1564
01:11:17.671 --> 01:11:18.504
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1565
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.980
<v Speaker 3>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1566
01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:22.260
<v Speaker 3>and they're also fucking with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they give you the finger.</v>

1567
01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Like I had a bunch of jokers that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like dancing around me,</v>

1568
01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:28.560
<v Speaker 3>giving me the finger machine elves to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in that thing.</v>

1569
01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:29.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that is.</v>

1570
01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Like Mckenna had those experiences of </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine elves.</v>

1571
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.410
<v Speaker 3>I never saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw it.</v>

1572
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.333
<v Speaker 3>What I described is complex geometric </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns that are made out of love and </v>

1573
01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:39.860
<v Speaker 3>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1574
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.843
<v Speaker 3>they seem to me to be like the building </v>
<v Speaker 3>blocks of the soul all around you all </v>

1575
01:11:44.521 --> 01:11:46.920
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some just gigantic,</v>

1576
01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:52.200
<v Speaker 3>impossibly large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite well of souls.</v>

1577
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:54.690
<v Speaker 3>Just these things dancing around you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

1578
01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:57.810
<v Speaker 3>they were never one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would be one thing for a second and</v>

1579
01:11:57.811 --> 01:12:01.650
<v Speaker 3>they change into something else and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>change it to something different and the</v>

1580
01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:06.651
<v Speaker 3>more profound the experiences God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more profound the next one would be.</v>

1581
01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.420
<v Speaker 3>And they kept saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this,</v>

1582
01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:10.560
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>

1583
01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:13.410
<v Speaker 3>but the words weren't real words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing.</v>

1584
01:12:13.411 --> 01:12:16.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm saying the words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this and I would have that in my</v>

1585
01:12:16.891 --> 01:12:19.230
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I never heard anybody say it.</v>

1586
01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:21.600
<v Speaker 3>It was almost like it was triggering </v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1587
01:12:21.601 --> 01:12:23.760
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the concept of those words in my mind,</v>

1588
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:24.630
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1589
01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:27.060
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pre or post linguistics,</v>

1590
01:12:27.061 --> 01:12:29.030
<v Speaker 2>some of these experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>

1591
01:12:29.031 --> 01:12:30.690
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you asked about dumb moments though,</v>

1592
01:12:30.691 --> 01:12:33.030
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1593
01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:38.031
<v Speaker 2>I had one where I had this like </v>
<v Speaker 2>cascading since flood of love tour.</v>

1594
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:39.463
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about my family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about my son and my wife </v>

1595
01:12:41.221 --> 01:12:44.700
<v Speaker 2>and my parents and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1596
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:45.623
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like so banal and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that happens is that these </v>

1597
01:12:49.771 --> 01:12:52.770
<v Speaker 2>platitudes that love is the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>important thing there is.</v>

1598
01:12:52.771 --> 01:12:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take that for,</v>

1599
01:12:53.611 --> 01:12:58.050
<v Speaker 2>except that could be on a hallmark card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but suddenly it's infused with like,</v>

1600
01:12:58.230 --> 01:13:00.240
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is so profound.</v>

1601
01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.310
<v Speaker 2>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is profound.</v>

1602
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.713
<v Speaker 2>But we have these defenses against </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing it that way because we've heard </v>

1603
01:13:06.811 --> 01:13:08.520
<v Speaker 2>it so many times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1604
01:13:08.521 --> 01:13:10.890
<v Speaker 2>a sense of banality is just from </v>
<v Speaker 2>repetition,</v>

1605
01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.070
<v Speaker 2>but you're put back in touch with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1606
01:13:14.071 --> 01:13:14.904
<v Speaker 2>a platitude is a truth that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>drained of all emotion and the emotion </v>

1607
01:13:20.401 --> 01:13:22.830
<v Speaker 2>comes back and it becomes really </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

1608
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:23.663
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole riff in the book about </v>

1609
01:13:25.021 --> 01:13:26.100
<v Speaker 2>platitudes and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1610
01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:29.550
<v Speaker 2>we have to rethink these platitudes so </v>
<v Speaker 2>it can make you sound like an idiot.</v>

1611
01:13:29.890 --> 01:13:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is that right or is that right?</v>

1612
01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:34.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1613
01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:35.313
<v Speaker 2>and I actually think the experience is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more truthful than the ironic cynical </v>

1614
01:13:39.031 --> 01:13:41.340
<v Speaker 2>perspective that we bring to it in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday lives,</v>

1615
01:13:41.341 --> 01:13:42.174
<v Speaker 2>which is a defense against powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion and being overwhelmed every day </v>

1616
01:13:46.141 --> 01:13:47.430
<v Speaker 2>by wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>

1617
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:49.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

1618
01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.790
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1619
01:13:50.791 --> 01:13:52.800
<v Speaker 2>you end up revaluing those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1620
01:13:52.801 --> 01:13:53.634
<v Speaker 2>And that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was a really important takeaway </v>

1621
01:13:54.841 --> 01:13:55.674
<v Speaker 2>from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other was having an experience of </v>

1622
01:13:57.001 --> 01:13:57.834
<v Speaker 2>ego dissolution that which can be scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can also be very blissful if it's then </v>

1623
01:14:02.791 --> 01:14:06.390
<v Speaker 2>followed by emerging with nature or </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

1624
01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:11.230
<v Speaker 2>And I do think that is the therapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 2>agent in these,</v>

1625
01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 2>in the people who are</v>

1626
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:12.963
<v Speaker 4>healed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that our ego does keep us from </v>

1627
01:14:15.821 --> 01:14:20.680
<v Speaker 4>perceiving certain things and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>enforces really destructive stories.</v>

1628
01:14:20.681 --> 01:14:21.514
<v Speaker 4>We tell ourselves like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't get through this day without a </v>

1629
01:14:23.351 --> 01:14:26.500
<v Speaker 4>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm unworthy of love.</v>

1630
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:27.281
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1631
01:14:27.281 --> 01:14:31.210
<v Speaker 4>the voice of self criticism all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we get trapped in these loops.</v>

1632
01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:32.553
<v Speaker 4>And especially as we get older.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the reasons I think </v>

1633
01:14:34.091 --> 01:14:34.924
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics are actually more valuable </v>
<v Speaker 4>the older you get because we are </v>

1634
01:14:38.411 --> 01:14:39.244
<v Speaker 4>creatures of habit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by now we have these mental </v>

1635
01:14:40.841 --> 01:14:42.790
<v Speaker 4>algorithms that organize our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

1636
01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:45.460
<v Speaker 4>our response to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And sure,</v>

1637
01:14:45.461 --> 01:14:47.530
<v Speaker 4>that's very efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1638
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:48.423
<v Speaker 4>but it blinds you to experience it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blinds you to the everyday wonders and </v>

1639
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:54.430
<v Speaker 4>Psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1640
01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.790
<v Speaker 4>softens those habits and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1641
01:14:56.791 --> 01:15:01.300
<v Speaker 4>and helps you get out of those grooves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for me that was really useful.</v>

1642
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:02.680
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's only,</v>

1643
01:15:03.370 --> 01:15:07.240
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the experience of ego to </v>
<v Speaker 4>solution that allows you to,</v>

1644
01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.600
<v Speaker 4>cause your ego enforces those habits and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a little break.</v>

1645
01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.433
<v Speaker 4>There's a beautiful metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the scientists I interviewed in </v>

1646
01:15:12.881 --> 01:15:14.820
<v Speaker 4>the book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Dutchman working in,</v>

1647
01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in imperial college in London.</v>

1648
01:15:16.451 --> 01:15:17.284
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think of your mind is a hill covered in </v>

1649
01:15:19.601 --> 01:15:20.434
<v Speaker 4>snow?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And your thoughts are sleds going down </v>

1650
01:15:22.571 --> 01:15:24.940
<v Speaker 4>that hill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And after a while,</v>

1651
01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:26.440
<v Speaker 4>after a lot of thoughts have gone that </v>
<v Speaker 4>hill,</v>

1652
01:15:26.441 --> 01:15:27.274
<v Speaker 4>there'll be these grooves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then getting to get deeper and </v>

1653
01:15:28.481 --> 01:15:29.560
<v Speaker 4>deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to a certain point,</v>

1654
01:15:29.561 --> 01:15:32.500
<v Speaker 4>you can't go down the hill without </v>
<v Speaker 4>slipping into those grooves.</v>

1655
01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:35.050
<v Speaker 4>That's who we are is where like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1656
01:15:35.051 --> 01:15:37.090
<v Speaker 4>at this age and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1657
01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:40.720
<v Speaker 4>what psychedelics do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said his is flattened the snow,</v>

1658
01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:45.550
<v Speaker 4>lots of fresh powder and you can then </v>
<v Speaker 4>take the slit anyway you want to go.</v>

1659
01:15:45.610 --> 01:15:46.443
<v Speaker 4>That's a great way of describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always talked about predetermined </v>

1660
01:15:49.451 --> 01:15:51.520
<v Speaker 4>patterns and grooves that people fall </v>
<v Speaker 4>into.</v>

1661
01:15:51.521 --> 01:15:53.500
<v Speaker 4>So it's amazing hearing him say it that </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1662
01:15:53.501 --> 01:15:55.630
<v Speaker 4>but that's a much better way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>describing it.</v>

1663
01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:58.600
<v Speaker 4>Like snow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sliding these thoughts down,</v>

1664
01:15:58.601 --> 01:16:01.750
<v Speaker 4>these already existing patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

1665
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:04.650
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what you said about love and,</v>

1666
01:16:04.651 --> 01:16:06.190
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and being cynical.</v>

1667
01:16:06.191 --> 01:16:07.024
<v Speaker 4>That's so important too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's something that's </v>

1668
01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:14.590
<v Speaker 4>something that people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they avoid sincerity.</v>

1669
01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:15.843
<v Speaker 4>Like there's something about it that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you too vulnerable or too open to </v>

1670
01:16:21.101 --> 01:16:25.060
<v Speaker 4>criticism or to open to ridicule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're worried about being sincere.</v>

1671
01:16:25.061 --> 01:16:27.910
<v Speaker 4>And I do think that that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>primary benefits of psychedelics.</v>

1672
01:16:27.911 --> 01:16:28.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1673
01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:29.103
<v Speaker 4>we live in an ironic culture and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>defend ourselves against strong </v>

1674
01:16:31.571 --> 01:16:35.560
<v Speaker 4>experience or self exposure by adopting </v>
<v Speaker 4>this stance.</v>

1675
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:36.610
<v Speaker 4>That's ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1676
01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:38.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

1677
01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:39.280
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1678
01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:42.040
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics is not a cool experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the opposite.</v>

1679
01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:43.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's cool when it's over.</v>

1680
01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1681
01:16:46.061 --> 01:16:47.380
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's serious stuff.</v>

1682
01:16:47.381 --> 01:16:48.290
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1683
01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.830
<v Speaker 4>how much did you pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mckenna's theory?</v>

1684
01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:51.641
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

1685
01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:52.474
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the evolution of the human brain of the </v>

1686
01:16:54.761 --> 01:16:57.490
<v Speaker 4>stoned ape theory that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked at it,</v>

1687
01:16:57.550 --> 01:17:01.600
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I found I didn't find it persuasive.</v>

1688
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:04.060
<v Speaker 4>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you press Terence Mckenna,</v>

1689
01:17:04.061 --> 01:17:06.100
<v Speaker 4>he didn't find an entirely persuasive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very,</v>

1690
01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:08.770
<v Speaker 4>it's an interesting speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a mind game.</v>

1691
01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't</v>

1692
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.963
<v Speaker 2>see how I can see how uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics would influence the mind </v>

1693
01:17:14.691 --> 01:17:15.230
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1694
01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:18.300
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and create new ideas,</v>

1695
01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:20.310
<v Speaker 2>new memes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1696
01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:22.430
<v Speaker 2>and Mike contribute to language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1697
01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:23.453
<v Speaker 2>but how does it get into the genes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I had to change the genes </v>

1698
01:17:26.311 --> 01:17:28.860
<v Speaker 2>cause he said it changed us at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic level.</v>

1699
01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:30.473
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics is having had a profound </v>

1700
01:17:32.161 --> 01:17:32.994
<v Speaker 2>effect at the level of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution that there are lots of </v>

1701
01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:40.940
<v Speaker 2>interesting innovations that people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>had psychedelic experience introduced to</v>

1702
01:17:42.151 --> 01:17:44.370
<v Speaker 2>our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about religion earlier.</v>

1703
01:17:44.371 --> 01:17:45.510
<v Speaker 2>That could be one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

1704
01:17:45.511 --> 01:17:47.460
<v Speaker 2>I had a wonderful interview with Stewart</v>
<v Speaker 2>brand,</v>

1705
01:17:47.461 --> 01:17:50.370
<v Speaker 2>the founder of the whole earth catalog </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his insight.</v>

1706
01:17:50.371 --> 01:17:52.540
<v Speaker 2>He had this profound insight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1707
01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:57.000
<v Speaker 2>during a psychedelic trip on the roof of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his house in North Beach.</v>

1708
01:17:57.001 --> 01:17:59.460
<v Speaker 2>And he saw the curvature of the earth in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a way he hadn't before.</v>

1709
01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:00.481
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1710
01:18:00.481 --> 01:18:02.370
<v Speaker 2>if we could have a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is 1966,</v>

1711
01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.100
<v Speaker 2>we had never seen a picture of the earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>from space yet.</v>

1712
01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:06.353
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we had a picture of the earth from </v>

1713
01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:07.974
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we could see it as this round space </v>

1714
01:18:09.631 --> 01:18:11.670
<v Speaker 2>ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would change everything.</v>

1715
01:18:11.671 --> 01:18:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Because if you think of the earth is </v>
<v Speaker 2>flat,</v>

1716
01:18:13.651 --> 01:18:16.740
<v Speaker 2>as most of us instinctively do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's endless.</v>

1717
01:18:16.741 --> 01:18:18.600
<v Speaker 2>There's endless resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1718
01:18:18.601 --> 01:18:20.760
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to worry about limits in </v>
<v Speaker 2>any way.</v>

1719
01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:23.010
<v Speaker 2>But if we had that image and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized,</v>

1720
01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:23.903
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to start a campaign to get NASA </v>

1721
01:18:25.141 --> 01:18:27.240
<v Speaker 2>to turn the cameras around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're on their way to the moon,</v>

1722
01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.670
<v Speaker 2>show us the earth from space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1723
01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make a campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1724
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.971
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1725
01:18:32.971 --> 01:18:35.070
<v Speaker 2>this is not an LSD.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll make a button,</v>

1726
01:18:35.130 --> 01:18:37.980
<v Speaker 2>very important medium in 1966,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll make a button.</v>

1727
01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:39.083
<v Speaker 2>And what should the button say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be a little paranoid to get </v>

1728
01:18:40.921 --> 01:18:41.754
<v Speaker 2>people's attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why haven't they shown us an image of </v>

1729
01:18:44.371 --> 01:18:45.450
<v Speaker 2>the earth from space?</v>

1730
01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he would do.</v>

1731
01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:49.260
<v Speaker 2>And he started a campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started selling these buttons and the</v>

1732
01:18:49.261 --> 01:18:52.560
<v Speaker 2>campaign got in the newspapers and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes viral as you know,</v>

1733
01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:53.394
<v Speaker 2>as viral as you could get in 1966 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>two years later and NASA produced that </v>

1734
01:18:57.871 --> 01:18:58.704
<v Speaker 2>image and he put it on the whole earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>catalog and that image galvanize the </v>

1735
01:19:01.831 --> 01:19:02.664
<v Speaker 2>environmental movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's those kinds of memes that </v>

1736
01:19:05.551 --> 01:19:08.850
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics introduces into culture and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that changes culture,</v>

1737
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:11.130
<v Speaker 2>that image changed culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1738
01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.080
<v Speaker 2>and I think there are hundreds of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1739
01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Steve Jobs talked about his use of LSD </v>
<v Speaker 2>is very important to his,</v>

1740
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:19.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>formative experience.</v>

1741
01:19:19.021 --> 01:19:19.854
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole tradition of computer </v>

1742
01:19:20.761 --> 01:19:24.540
<v Speaker 2>engineers going back to the 50s using </v>
<v Speaker 2>lsd that I wrote about in the book.</v>

1743
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.823
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't see how we were selected </v>

1744
01:19:28.651 --> 01:19:32.400
<v Speaker 2>genetically because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an advantage to the people who</v>

1745
01:19:32.401 --> 01:19:34.720
<v Speaker 2>were taking a lot of psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1746
01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.800
<v Speaker 2>that's where he was at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm misrepresenting it.</v>

1747
01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.753
<v Speaker 3>His theory is that it coincides with </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate change and these lower hominids </v>

1748
01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.650
<v Speaker 3>experiencing experimenting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>different food sources.</v>

1749
01:19:46.770 --> 01:19:49.950
<v Speaker 3>So as the rain forest receded into </v>
<v Speaker 3>grasslands,</v>

1750
01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:55.080
<v Speaker 3>they started experimenting by flipping </v>
<v Speaker 3>over cow patties and finding grubs and,</v>

1751
01:19:55.081 --> 01:19:57.810
<v Speaker 3>and perhaps even mushrooms that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing on these cow patties.</v>

1752
01:19:58.110 --> 01:20:01.410
<v Speaker 3>And his theory was that there's a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 3>of different benefits.</v>

1753
01:20:01.411 --> 01:20:05.450
<v Speaker 3>One low doses of silicide but have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>shown to increased visual acuity.</v>

1754
01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:08.310
<v Speaker 2>The hunting dogs in certain cultures.</v>

1755
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1756
01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:09.983
<v Speaker 3>Make you a better hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make you more in tune with what you're </v>

1757
01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:12.340
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1758
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:13.223
<v Speaker 3>that it would make you more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would a central nervous system </v>

1759
01:20:15.571 --> 01:20:18.270
<v Speaker 3>arousal including sexual arousal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It make you more horny,</v>

1760
01:20:18.271 --> 01:20:20.820
<v Speaker 3>which would make you productive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate more often.</v>

1761
01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:22.073
<v Speaker 3>And that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the very unusual effect that psilocybin </v>

1762
01:20:26.911 --> 01:20:27.744
<v Speaker 3>has on the mind could have led to </v>
<v Speaker 3>language and could have also led to the </v>

1763
01:20:30.391 --> 01:20:33.030
<v Speaker 3>expansion of neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That language to me,</v>

1764
01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.890
<v Speaker 3>brain out of cultural evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1765
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:35.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The doubling of the human brain size </v>

1766
01:20:37.081 --> 01:20:37.741
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it?</v>

1767
01:20:37.741 --> 01:20:39.960
<v Speaker 3>The particular thing is that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>coincided,</v>

1768
01:20:39.961 --> 01:20:42.280
<v Speaker 3>according to the Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been there.</v>

1769
01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:44.100
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that disagree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with him,</v>

1770
01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:47.550
<v Speaker 3>but his brother makes a very compelling </v>
<v Speaker 3>case for him and his brother Dennis,</v>

1771
01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:49.890
<v Speaker 3>who's still alive and was a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant guy.</v>

1772
01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:50.933
<v Speaker 3>He talked about it on this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talked about his take on the stone </v>

1773
01:20:54.691 --> 01:20:57.420
<v Speaker 3>Arab or a stoned ape theory </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientifically,</v>

1774
01:20:57.421 --> 01:20:59.610
<v Speaker 3>why he believes it's really what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

1775
01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:03.300
<v Speaker 3>but that it does coincide with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>change in climate of these,</v>

1776
01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:05.040
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1777
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:05.903
<v Speaker 3>eight black people trying out different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and that the doubling of the </v>

1778
01:21:08.611 --> 01:21:10.740
<v Speaker 3>human brain size over a period of 2 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million years,</v>

1779
01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:13.110
<v Speaker 3>it was like one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>mysteries in the entire fossil record.</v>

1780
01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Their alternative theories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1781
01:21:14.551 --> 01:21:15.384
<v Speaker 3>I wrote it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my last big all coincided maybe </v>

1782
01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:18.840
<v Speaker 3>cooking with fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1783
01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:19.674
<v Speaker 3>You can explain the increase in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain size because you get more </v>

1784
01:21:21.391 --> 01:21:24.060
<v Speaker 3>nutritional value from cooked food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the throwing arm,</v>

1785
01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:25.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1786
01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:25.861
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1787
01:21:25.861 --> 01:21:26.694
<v Speaker 3>the desire to hunt all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals and the calculating all these </v>

1788
01:21:29.131 --> 01:21:30.840
<v Speaker 3>different ways to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And communication.</v>

1789
01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:32.003
<v Speaker 3>I think there's cooperation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of coinciding fat and it may </v>

1790
01:21:35.071 --> 01:21:36.090
<v Speaker 3>well be that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1791
01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:38.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were eating everything right?</v>

1792
01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Our ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing what they ate.</v>

1793
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:41.483
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no doubt they ate psychedelic </v>

1794
01:21:43.321 --> 01:21:44.820
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms and no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1795
01:21:44.821 --> 01:21:45.654
<v Speaker 3>he also believed that language was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>form of synesthesia in the way that </v>

1796
01:21:48.631 --> 01:21:52.160
<v Speaker 3>synesthesia you can smell a musical note</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that,</v>

1797
01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:55.290
<v Speaker 3>that you're taking a sound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a meaningless sound,</v>

1798
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:56.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1799
01:21:56.490 --> 01:21:57.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1800
01:21:57.650 --> 01:22:02.650
<v Speaker 3>and you're attaching it to a concept </v>
<v Speaker 3>that maybe that happened on Psilocybin,</v>

1801
01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:04.950
<v Speaker 3>but a bunch of ideas that never panned </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1802
01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.230
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

1803
01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:09.390
<v Speaker 3>he was in high or audibly creative </v>
<v Speaker 3>person and yeah.</v>

1804
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:10.021
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1805
01:22:10.021 --> 01:22:11.250
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're all,</v>

1806
01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:12.373
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really interesting to think about some </v>

1807
01:22:14.011 --> 01:22:14.844
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you could probably discredit </v>

1808
01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:19.710
<v Speaker 3>based on what we understand about genes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and evolution,</v>

1809
01:22:19.711 --> 01:22:22.950
<v Speaker 3>but others are just really provocative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where his brother comes in.</v>

1810
01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.511
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His brothers,</v>

1811
01:22:23.511 --> 01:22:25.560
<v Speaker 3>his brother's a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strict scientists.</v>

1812
01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:26.403
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't tolerate any of the woo woo </v>

1813
01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:31.900
<v Speaker 3>and straight and he's skeptical of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother's idea is to open.</v>

1814
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:33.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean loved his brother,</v>

1815
01:22:33.331 --> 01:22:33.981
<v Speaker 3>but he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1816
01:22:33.981 --> 01:22:35.570
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of things that weren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really accurate,</v>

1817
01:22:35.571 --> 01:22:37.440
<v Speaker 3>but also terence Mckenna to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd say,</v>

1818
01:22:37.441 --> 01:22:38.030
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1819
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:42.390
<v Speaker 3>just putting these ideas out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy was a constant pot user.</v>

1820
01:22:42.450 --> 01:22:45.360
<v Speaker 3>He was constantly doing psychedelics and</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good talker.</v>

1821
01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:46.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would have a podcast now,</v>

1822
01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:47.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1823
01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.450
<v Speaker 3>it would be amazing.</v>

1824
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:49.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1825
01:22:49.351 --> 01:22:50.710
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I promote the shit out.</v>

1826
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:52.780
<v Speaker 3>I would too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1827
01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a fun guy to listen to talk and,</v>

1828
01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.033
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1829
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:57.263
<v Speaker 3>there's a podcast called the psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 3>salon that my friend Lorenzo hosts that </v>

1830
01:23:00.421 --> 01:23:04.680
<v Speaker 3>has pretty much every terence Mckenna </v>
<v Speaker 3>lecture and speeches ever done,</v>

1831
01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.790
<v Speaker 3>available for free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can download it.</v>

1832
01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:10.360
<v Speaker 3>And Lorenzo is taking these and </v>
<v Speaker 3>digitally remastered them to,</v>

1833
01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:12.700
<v Speaker 3>the sound is better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's really awesome that,</v>

1834
01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:13.960
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's got this resource.</v>

1835
01:23:13.961 --> 01:23:17.350
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1836
01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:21.010
<v Speaker 3>lower hominids experienced ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>hominids experienced,</v>

1837
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.903
<v Speaker 3>experimented rather with silicide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then this was what advanced culture </v>

1838
01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:29.260
<v Speaker 3>or advanced language advanced their </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of each other.</v>

1839
01:23:29.261 --> 01:23:31.090
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very compelling idea.</v>

1840
01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:31.811
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

1841
01:23:31.811 --> 01:23:32.644
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the way I think about drugs like </v>

1842
01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.990
<v Speaker 4>second alex in evolution in the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1843
01:23:37.991 --> 01:23:38.824
<v Speaker 4>like in genetic evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>radiation causes mutations and some of </v>

1844
01:23:42.131 --> 01:23:44.410
<v Speaker 4>those mutations turn out to be really </v>
<v Speaker 4>valuable,</v>

1845
01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>purely by accident.</v>

1846
01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:51.121
<v Speaker 4>Some great new trait is introduced to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the species and it increases fitness and</v>

1847
01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:55.420
<v Speaker 4>that person or that individual lives on </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the cultural realm,</v>

1848
01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:56.493
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics are like radiation there </v>
<v Speaker 4>mutagens they create change variation </v>

01:24:07.690 --> 01:24:10.390
<v Speaker 4>99% of them are stupid and useless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll bet.</v>

1852
01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:13.780
<v Speaker 4>But that 1% can change the world.</v>

<v Speaker 4>how would it change your mind,</v>

1859
01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:28.570
<v Speaker 4>what the new science of psychedelics is </v>
<v Speaker 4>teaching us about consciousness,</v>

1860
01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.130
<v Speaker 4>dying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the addiction,</v>
