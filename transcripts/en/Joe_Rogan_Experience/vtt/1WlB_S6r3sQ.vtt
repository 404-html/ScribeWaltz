<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me hear what you're saying,</v>

16
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>but then let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me talk about the world in a way.</v>

17
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a phone?</v>

18
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a tiny little tiny one man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you get the little tiny iphone.</v>

19
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

20
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>This is for my daily example of why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be patient.</v>

21
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I had an iphone six plus the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>storage I was.</v>

22
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>I was really happy with it and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

23
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to get that iphone seven.</v>

24
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.420
<v Speaker 1>And the only one they had was the small </v>
<v Speaker 1>one with the smallest storage and it's,</v>

25
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a piece of garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

26
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well just because I'm like,</v>

27
00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need that much storage,</v>

28
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:11.661
<v Speaker 1>I'll use the cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't because I don't trust the </v>

29
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:11.661
<v Speaker 1>cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I cared of all those Dick Pics,</v>

30
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:16.611
<v Speaker 1>getting all the Dick pics kegs of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the good thing about not </v>

31
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>being extraordinary in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>

32
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have to worry about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dirt.</v>

33
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.990
<v Speaker 1>No one needs to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just ran out of,</v>

34
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.530
<v Speaker 1>what is it like a 32 gigabyte or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

35
00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

36
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.090
<v Speaker 1>it's like I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

37
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.710
<v Speaker 1>which memory will I delete before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>

38
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.450
<v Speaker 1>It makes me be a little bit selective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

39
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>In this day and age of stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it bother you that it's small?</v>

40
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Not as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get used to it,</v>

41
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you have?</v>

42
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the seven plus man.</v>

43
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you use that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at websites in particular </v>

44
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>where you don't have to expand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen to get the entire thing,</v>

45
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:54.411
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go back and forth to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get the entire article and there's </v>

46
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 1>little tricks that people don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like you just double tap,</v>

47
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.780
<v Speaker 1>not pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but double tap and like all that shit </v>

48
00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>that's on the top of the screen that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes down for you [inaudible].</v>

49
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>They just use it for people with tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

50
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

51
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The if you double tap the home button,</v>

52
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This stuff,</v>

53
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:10.170
<v Speaker 1>that stuff they made for people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just aren't.</v>

54
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>They don't fit like the standard and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

55
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>you just use them and then fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>buzzfeed calls it life hacks.</v>

56
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Then like 10 things you didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>let's get 7 million people's office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some basic shit there.</v>

58
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.770
<v Speaker 1>There was that one phone that they had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was the iphone four that had </v>

59
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>the sharper edges on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very narrow.</v>

60
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>That's the perfect size phone for </v>
<v Speaker 1>texting.</v>

61
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>It just fits in your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

63
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:39.441
<v Speaker 1>Like it locks in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can text with one hand with this </v>

64
00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:39.441
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

65
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little slippery.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but my friend Brian Cowen was trying to </v>

<v Speaker 1>So are you okay?</v>

84
00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:21.680
<v Speaker 1>If in the trailer they let you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid has cancer,</v>

85
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>fucking stupid.</v>

86
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.820
<v Speaker 1>I see what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like kid out of here and you were </v>

87
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>talking about arrival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even watch the movie.</v>

88
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I watched the movie for three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl had cancer and I'm like,</v>

89
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I hung it up.</v>

90
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to watch this.</v>

91
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>He's going to want to go on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressing journey right before bed.</v>

92
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get me fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dreams,</v>

93
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>so uninterested in depressing movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

94
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>I've read the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch television.</v>

95
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I pay attention to internet videos from </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the world of depressing shit.</v>

96
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I know it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the moment I had my first kid,</v>

97
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

98
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my realization that at any point</v>

99
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I could have the most damaging pain in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

100
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.170
<v Speaker 1>so I get that I don't need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to be depressed and </v>

101
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.170
<v Speaker 1>reminded of that at every moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

102
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm constantly thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about when I'm not having a happy </v>

103
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.770
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

104
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.471
<v Speaker 1>how?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could the world completely fuck up </v>

105
00:04:16.471 --> 00:04:16.471
<v Speaker 1>my whole being?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:04:16.471 --> 00:04:20.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm more interested in funny things </v>
<v Speaker 1>these days or really stupid horror </v>

107
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.801
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that just escapism from the insanity </v>

108
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:25.801
<v Speaker 1>that we're dealing with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

109
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 1>that's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all escapism.</v>

110
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even game of thrones or House of cards,</v>

111
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>which is like about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So total escapism.</v>

112
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 1>These are not real people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

113
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:41.611
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I ended up finding is I end </v>

114
00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:41.611
<v Speaker 1>up rooting for people that normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't root for it.</v>

115
00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in house of cards,</v>

116
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally rooting for them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking bad.</v>

117
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Even the final season when he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that fucked up stuff,</v>

118
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

119
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 1>well too white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you man.</v>

120
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch the final season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get that far.</v>

121
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.900
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the middle of a season three </v>

122
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 1>right now of house of cards and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Spacey's goddamned murderer.</v>

123
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember if third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the third season is kind of like the </v>

124
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.010
<v Speaker 1>man season before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because last season the last season was </v>

125
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.931
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it like how they have five out </v>

126
00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:15.540
<v Speaker 1>for is for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So three I think was kind of just felt </v>

127
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.540
<v Speaker 1>like a setup season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm and through them,</v>

128
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking cooking through them.</v>

129
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Watching a four or five a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

131
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:22.540
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't started that episode one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of season two,</v>

132
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>that's where I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

133
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm in this is because I feel like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>always have to have that one episode </v>

134
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:29.850
<v Speaker 1>where you don't know what's gonna happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're like,</v>

135
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on,</v>

136
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm on fucking shaky ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't something that I'm going to </v>

137
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.791
<v Speaker 1>watch while I'm cooking dinner and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really paying attention and not miss </v>

138
00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:38.791
<v Speaker 1>anything out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

139
00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:38.791
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like scandal.</v>

140
00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

141
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:43.831
<v Speaker 1>they're going to go on some like fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight minute monologue where it's like </v>

142
00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:43.831
<v Speaker 1>you can't do blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah,</v>

143
00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

144
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

145
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

146
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

147
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Whatever bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

148
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.160
<v Speaker 1>escapism is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's fun.</v>

149
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.650
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after awhile you just run it.</v>

150
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.250
<v Speaker 1>It runs its course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think just absorbing media,</v>

151
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>just taking</v>

152
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.040
<v Speaker 3>in too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After a while you just get extremely </v>

153
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.040
<v Speaker 3>jaded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

154
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 3>like I've seen people that are tweeting </v>
<v Speaker 3>about things online and you go,</v>

155
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:08.650
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's fucking jaded man.</v>

156
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 3>Like people are so jaded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they realized like the amount of </v>

157
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.720
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of data that people are </v>

158
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 3>getting on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just you're not designed for this.</v>

159
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's designed have unlimited options</v>

160
00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 3>for entertainment viewing at your </v>
<v Speaker 3>disposal on demand all the time.</v>

161
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.630
<v Speaker 1>If you ever want to like a quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>reminder of how add and how true that </v>

162
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.501
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just look at your fucking not you </v>

163
00:06:34.501 --> 00:06:34.501
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your own twitter history.</v>

164
00:06:34.501 --> 00:06:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I'll go from talking about something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

165
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.100
<v Speaker 3>Deeply political and I'm like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking craziness to like did you see </v>

166
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.221
<v Speaker 3>tonight's episode?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's like a difference of five </v>

167
00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:44.221
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

168
00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:44.430
<v Speaker 3>Everything's always</v>

169
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.770
<v Speaker 1>happening and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

170
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm critical of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

171
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

172
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.450
<v Speaker 3>well we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

173
00:06:51.451 --> 00:06:56.451
<v Speaker 3>we're definitely changing in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention span is changing and probably </v>

174
00:06:56.451 --> 00:06:57.990
<v Speaker 3>not for the better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're,</v>

175
00:06:57.991 --> 00:07:02.991
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're accustomed to things being quick </v>

176
00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 3>and rapid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like here's a perfect example.</v>

177
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.380
<v Speaker 3>The way you guys edit your videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any pauses.</v>

178
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 3>You're not human in your video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is because I got like a c minus in </v>

179
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.500
<v Speaker 3>public speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody does it.</v>

180
00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Everybody on Youtube does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all do that thing where they take </v>

181
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 3>out all the ums and pauses and they go </v>
<v Speaker 3>from one thing to level a little bit,</v>

182
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.240
<v Speaker 3>a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little,</v>

183
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 3>a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little,</v>

184
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.720
<v Speaker 3>a little bit because it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is</v>

185
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.830
<v Speaker 1>battle of attention and battle of eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that I think people are </v>

186
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.770
<v Speaker 1>seeing more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially even the youtube,</v>

187
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.490
<v Speaker 1>the Youtube Algorithm podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there is 100 percent always</v>

188
00:07:32.491 --> 00:07:34.410
<v Speaker 1>going to be an audience for longer form </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

189
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my video is started out as it was even </v>

190
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:40.200
<v Speaker 1>in the little intro sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It started out as three to four minutes.</v>

191
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Let me talk about the world for three or</v>
<v Speaker 1>four minutes.</v>

192
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.480
<v Speaker 1>My videos now are 10 to 18 minutes every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

193
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Granted a lot more is happening every </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and they're like this,</v>

194
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:51.600
<v Speaker 1>this new new presidency and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>

195
00:07:51.601 --> 00:07:54.390
<v Speaker 1>But there is an audience that wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

196
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.240
<v Speaker 1>And so you had the vine guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even,</v>

197
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean finds dead now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those guys have now launched into </v>

198
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.740
<v Speaker 1>longer form pieces where some of it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>three to four and then some are daily,</v>

199
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.010
<v Speaker 1>10 to 18 minute pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think there's always going to be an</v>

200
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.900
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are tuning in longer,</v>

201
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 1>more than ever because the Internet was </v>
<v Speaker 1>tuned in for for six seconds,</v>

202
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.100
<v Speaker 1>15 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one minute,</v>

203
00:08:17.101 --> 00:08:19.110
<v Speaker 1>three to four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just getting longer and longer,</v>

204
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 3>but it's not even just the longer </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer.</v>

205
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 3>Even if you do a three minute thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still going to edit out all those</v>

206
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:26.450
<v Speaker 3>little tiny gaps in between sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

207
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 3>What's that about?</v>

208
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.220
<v Speaker 1>It's just getting out as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I didn't,</v>

209
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 1>if I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I stopped cutting out my pause,</v>

210
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.030
<v Speaker 1>my video is five minutes longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be.</v>

211
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.560
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

212
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

213
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Because my video is I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't script.</v>

214
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not reading from everyone else or </v>
<v Speaker 1>from something.</v>

215
00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Someone else wrote A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do all my own research.</v>

216
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.230
<v Speaker 1>It's me taking all the information and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then just going on this,</v>

217
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.240
<v Speaker 1>this word soup rambly thing for for five</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes to make a three minute piece.</v>

218
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you like you take in too much data </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're doing all this,</v>

219
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:03.651
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have to have the main </v>

220
00:09:03.651 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 1>difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the last time I came on here,</v>

221
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:08.570
<v Speaker 1>which was about two years ago and now is</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then I was,</v>

222
00:09:08.571 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 1>I was Kinda scared to share my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

223
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:16.431
<v Speaker 1>So I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would kind of reputation of reddit </v>

224
00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:19.971
<v Speaker 1>stories that popped up and things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>popped up on websites of like distinct </v>

225
00:09:19.971 --> 00:09:19.971
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

226
00:09:19.971 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the next thing that happened.</v>

227
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:26.091
<v Speaker 1>So you're more of an aggregator of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that have happened like I was </v>

228
00:09:26.091 --> 00:09:28.140
<v Speaker 1>then and now it's more of because no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>trusts anything,</v>

229
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where we talk about right wing or left </v>

230
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.300
<v Speaker 1>wing people being in their own bubbles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

231
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:38.380
<v Speaker 1>we go in like I know I know the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might not because you're just </v>

232
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.240
<v Speaker 1>sticking to the stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

233
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.300
<v Speaker 1>that you believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you see something from an </v>

234
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:44.300
<v Speaker 1>outside source and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's bullshit.</v>

235
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:44.310
<v Speaker 1>That's not buzzfeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

236
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Well and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

237
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

238
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.750
<v Speaker 1>buzzfeed really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

239
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:51.840
<v Speaker 1>fuck themselves with the way that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>released those documents.</v>

240
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.260
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be completely confirmed right</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the whole,</v>

241
00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:55.800
<v Speaker 1>like trump and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

242
00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.560
<v Speaker 1>the prostitutes peeing on the bed stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

243
00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:03.561
<v Speaker 1>we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't confirm it and neither can any </v>

244
00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:05.010
<v Speaker 1>of the other places that have gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>this information can't confirm it.</v>

245
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.310
<v Speaker 1>But there is this piece of paper that </v>
<v Speaker 1>says that it may have happened.</v>

246
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.400
<v Speaker 1>What's even worse is all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream news sources.</v>

247
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:13.890
<v Speaker 1>We're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all releasing this story,</v>

248
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:18.891
<v Speaker 1>the salacious details on the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump and the Russian </v>

249
00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:20.100
<v Speaker 1>prostitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water sports.</v>

250
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Fuck Outta here.</v>

251
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Just a way it read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I immediately called bullshit.</v>

252
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really think that he has people </v>

253
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.111
<v Speaker 1>pee on him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People pee on the bed and he wants them </v>

254
00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:33.660
<v Speaker 1>to pee on the bed and he watches like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

255
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:34.920
<v Speaker 1>So that's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

256
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Is that's not even the actual thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story was,</v>

257
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it turned into the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

258
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 1>And ended up being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like we're supposed to be that Barack</v>

259
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Obama and Michelle Obama stayed in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel room.</v>

260
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hated them so much that he hired to </v>

261
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:51.310
<v Speaker 1>come and pee on the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not on him.</v>

262
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that.</v>

263
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.700
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then everyone made it like,</v>

264
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he likes pee on his face.</v>

265
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:57.690
<v Speaker 1>And it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it became this example of,</v>

266
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.060
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's hilarious enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget who said it,</v>

267
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:02.460
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's hilarious and enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will just roll with it.</v>

268
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.460
<v Speaker 1>But it's so hack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even hilarious.</v>

269
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like what a hack premise writer </v>

270
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.040
<v Speaker 1>would write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to write a hack story,</v>

271
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.380
<v Speaker 1>a hack scene in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a crazy person.</v>

272
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.530
<v Speaker 1>He hires all these ogres baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

273
00:11:16.531 --> 00:11:18.310
<v Speaker 1>pee on Daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

274
00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:19.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so stupid.</v>

275
00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:24.771
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you heard that though and you were </v>

276
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:24.771
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

277
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:24.771
<v Speaker 1>it's like a coke fueled businessman from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eighties.</v>

278
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:24.771
<v Speaker 1>He be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

279
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:26.880
<v Speaker 1>that probably happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not in today's world.</v>

280
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

281
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:31.770
<v Speaker 1>you don't think Donald Trump would check</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hotel room for cameras.</v>

282
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you don't think that a </v>

283
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.530
<v Speaker 1>multibillionaire who's kind of a freak </v>
<v Speaker 1>would go into that thing and have </v>

284
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>someone scrubbed the room and may have </v>
<v Speaker 1>some expert?</v>

285
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:43.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

286
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.800
<v Speaker 1>he's probably super paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fucked over so many people.</v>

287
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why we don't see the tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>returns.</v>

288
00:11:48.811 --> 00:11:50.900
<v Speaker 1>He's paying all these people off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

289
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 1>The tax return thing is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that bother you?</v>

290
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that bothers a lot of people.</v>

291
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should.</v>

292
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

293
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

294
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:00.460
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to argue that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

295
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people aren't going to be able to </v>

296
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.321
<v Speaker 1>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also know so where people are </v>

297
00:12:07.321 --> 00:12:07.321
<v Speaker 1>going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's going to be misconstrued,</v>

298
00:12:07.321 --> 00:12:07.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

299
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

300
00:12:08.511 --> 00:12:10.240
<v Speaker 1>it's an honest question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that argument?</v>

301
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be.</v>

302
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Taxes are going to be misconstrued.</v>

303
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna.</v>

304
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.610
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna take the smallest things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to on TV and the media</v>

305
00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:20.170
<v Speaker 1>does at times and they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna.</v>

306
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Expand on it and make it this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

307
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.000
<v Speaker 1>The same example with the urination </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

308
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.510
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden I looked at facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all my real story,</v>

309
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it started out as a core thing.</v>

310
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he plays for this and then it turned</v>

311
00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:36.670
<v Speaker 1>into Donald trump likes getting peed on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you're saying,</v>

312
00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is the taxes are an </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual real thing.</v>

313
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.810
<v Speaker 1>100 tax returns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very clear and concise,</v>

314
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:42.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

315
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 1>so they're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look at this money.</v>

316
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.870
<v Speaker 1>It could have been all these things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's not.</v>

317
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.250
<v Speaker 1>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

318
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an argument.</v>

319
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:54.361
<v Speaker 1>It's not one that I agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would prefer to actually see </v>

320
00:12:54.361 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 1>because I am a big fan of like get as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much information out as possible so that</v>

321
00:12:56.801 --> 00:12:57.970
<v Speaker 1>we can actually break shit down.</v>

322
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single president has done it,</v>

323
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.830
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's so unprecedented about it.</v>

324
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.860
<v Speaker 1>And he has multiple business ties </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently with Russia and he owes a </v>

325
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:13.321
<v Speaker 1>shitload of money to China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those things are massive factors </v>

326
00:13:13.321 --> 00:13:16.981
<v Speaker 1>and he has these business ventures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he has an all these countries all over </v>

327
00:13:16.981 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's really crazy is his son's running</v>

328
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:20.390
<v Speaker 1>his business now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

329
00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:25.420
<v Speaker 1>So his sons are getting flown around </v>
<v Speaker 1>with secret service details all on the </v>

330
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.731
<v Speaker 1>country's dime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He spending more money on travel in </v>

331
00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:31.120
<v Speaker 1>seven months and Obama did in eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

332
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the projection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If things go really?</v>

333
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

334
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to look at the numbers so you </v>

335
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:40.170
<v Speaker 1>can find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

336
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:40.630
<v Speaker 1>because that's for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like New York Times.</v>

337
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure because that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

338
00:13:42.581 --> 00:13:47.581
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole premise of my show now </v>

339
00:13:47.581 --> 00:13:47.620
<v Speaker 1>is you're making that argument of why we</v>
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>

340
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.320
<v Speaker 1>I then on my show mentioned that </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

341
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.560
<v Speaker 1>I then go into the argument of how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be misconstrued and then I </v>

342
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.770
<v Speaker 1>separately give my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I personally believe that we </v>

343
00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:57.880
<v Speaker 1>should get the tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not even an opinion thing.</v>

344
00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Speaker 1>It's law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He supposed to release his tax returns.</v>

345
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.380
<v Speaker 1>That's what your supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't you remember there's the whole</v>

346
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:09.910
<v Speaker 1>audit audit which will go on to the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time and none of it makes any sense.</v>

347
00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean how long does the audit last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year?</v>

348
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Who's auditing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

349
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.330
<v Speaker 1>And then the hard thing is the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like eight stories every day.</v>

350
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like because I haven't seen </v>

351
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Kellyanne Conway on TV as much lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

352
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.190
<v Speaker 1>it's less of the case and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

353
00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:26.020
<v Speaker 1>it felt like two days were Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't tweet,</v>

354
00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:28.560
<v Speaker 1>which was unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

355
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's overloading your [inaudible] there.</v>

356
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.030
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of people that will ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>me why didn't you cover a certain story?</v>

357
00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:39.031
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am one guy making at that time a 16 </v>

358
00:14:39.031 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 1>minute show that I'm trying to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>things properly.</v>

359
00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:42.490
<v Speaker 1>So how am I going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how am I going to get a point?</v>

360
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Get across all the points?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

361
00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:49.201
<v Speaker 1>Look at this in Forbes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's family cost his trips to costco </v>

362
00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>taxpayers nearly as much in a month as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama's in a whole year.</v>

363
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

364
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:58.710
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole thing is very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's really crazy is he was very </v>

365
00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.750
<v Speaker 1>critical of Obama President Barack </v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama's vacation.</v>

366
00:15:01.751 --> 00:15:04.160
<v Speaker 1>It's costing tax payers millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

367
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about you?</v>

368
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's going to be.</v>

369
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.090
<v Speaker 1>You have to think about the net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to save all that money from</v>

370
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:13.310
<v Speaker 1>all the fewer regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

371
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something we're not saving any money </v>

372
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:18.700
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer regulations,</v>

373
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.360
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to clean all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>ducks that get covered in oil.</v>

374
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.680
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is so fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>

375
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

376
00:15:26.631 --> 00:15:31.631
<v Speaker 1>but even like you're throwing out your </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions now and I think that it's </v>

377
00:15:31.631 --> 00:15:35.501
<v Speaker 1>important to have those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's also then important to </v>

378
00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:36.600
<v Speaker 1>take the time to look into where the Fox</v>
<v Speaker 1>News,</v>

379
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.060
<v Speaker 1>the Breitbarts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Donald,</v>

380
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:43.061
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those places where they're coming </v>

381
00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:43.061
<v Speaker 1>from as far as where their opinions come</v>
<v Speaker 1>from because I don't think so.</v>

382
00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Salon.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rolfing didn't post.</v>

383
00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:49.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've got to echo chambers on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left and on the right and it's the sound</v>

384
00:15:49.941 --> 00:15:54.941
<v Speaker 1>of the both of them is definitely to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point where you can't make out what the </v>

385
00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:54.941
<v Speaker 1>fuck is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

386
00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:59.141
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's why it's important to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at both so you can kind of fucking </v>

387
00:15:59.141 --> 00:16:00.770
<v Speaker 1>like Shimmy it through a filter and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>where these sources are coming from.</v>

388
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Gold looking for gold man.</v>

389
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Looking for the fucking truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because who knows what the fuck it is.</v>

390
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:05.970
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

391
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.510
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

392
00:16:08.511 --> 00:16:10.210
<v Speaker 1>It's reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

393
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 1>it's been a conversation of like reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter,</v>

394
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:13.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about perception.</v>

395
00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:16.340
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is more true than ever today,</v>

396
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because people believe people believe in</v>

397
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.870
<v Speaker 1>their right or left wing thing like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in God,</v>

398
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:24.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

399
00:16:24.621 --> 00:16:27.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a fact to them,</v>

400
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:31.250
<v Speaker 1>it's not just opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is ingrained belief and it's.</v>

401
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:36.330
<v Speaker 1>And it's just me trying not to close the</v>
<v Speaker 1>door on anyone so that I can always try </v>

402
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:36.950
<v Speaker 1>and have someone's ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

403
00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:39.740
<v Speaker 1>So people can think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by that?</v>

404
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.450
<v Speaker 1>So depending on the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

405
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:44.780
<v Speaker 1>So yesterday I talked about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>

406
00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:45.530
<v Speaker 1>is that you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

407
00:16:45.531 --> 00:16:45.950
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

408
00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:47.950
<v Speaker 1>So yesterday I talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

409
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.210
<v Speaker 1>the police officer or the off duty cop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Anaheim.</v>

410
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>

411
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:52.070
<v Speaker 1>I was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

412
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:57.130
<v Speaker 1>And my whole thing was playing it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that don't know what we're </v>

413
00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:57.130
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

414
00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.120
<v Speaker 1>So there's some stuff that we don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two arguments.</v>

415
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is one that,</v>

416
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the off duty cop will,</v>

417
00:17:02.681 --> 00:17:07.681
<v Speaker 1>we'll go through his story first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that these kids were walking on </v>

418
00:17:07.681 --> 00:17:07.681
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

419
00:17:07.681 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 1>his property walk through his property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're cutting through.</v>

420
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said something to the girl.</v>

421
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.780
<v Speaker 1>The boy says that you called her a </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>

422
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not appropriate.</v>

423
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>

424
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child's didn't say that.</v>

425
00:17:20.181 --> 00:17:23.000
<v Speaker 1>He said that he was willing to shoot the</v>
<v Speaker 1>off duty cop.</v>

426
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.020
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to shoot you.</v>

427
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:25.970
<v Speaker 1>The boy says no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

428
00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:30.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sue you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the cop says he's going to detain </v>

429
00:17:30.971 --> 00:17:33.881
<v Speaker 1>the kid until the police arrive because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you threatened an off duty police </v>

430
00:17:33.881 --> 00:17:33.881
<v Speaker 1>officer.</v>

431
00:17:33.881 --> 00:17:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That then turns into this.</v>

432
00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:37.960
<v Speaker 1>This kid he like pushes the police </v>
<v Speaker 1>officer,</v>

433
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.350
<v Speaker 1>another kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different cable.</v>

434
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.230
<v Speaker 1>So that happens at first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

435
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.090
<v Speaker 1>the kid that's being detained pushes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>police.</v>

436
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the off duty cop into a bush.</v>

437
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Then two minutes past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

438
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.450
<v Speaker 1>they slowly get closer to this hedge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

439
00:17:50.451 --> 00:17:55.451
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another kid puts hands on the off duty </v>

440
00:17:55.451 --> 00:17:55.451
<v Speaker 1>cop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another kid.</v>

441
00:17:55.451 --> 00:17:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Then shoulder checks the cop over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hedge.</v>

442
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Then the kid who originally did that </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch them.</v>

443
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:05.690
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be so much easier to have the </v>

444
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.690
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then one of the other kids who would put</v>

445
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.690
<v Speaker 1>hands on him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punched the cop,</v>

446
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 1>another kid jumped over the hedge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of surrounded him.</v>

447
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.310
<v Speaker 1>And at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

448
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.460
<v Speaker 1>the cop pulled out a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

449
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:17.510
<v Speaker 1>and everyone kind of ran away and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like the cops trying to pull </v>

450
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:18.480
<v Speaker 1>the kid over the hedge while holding the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun,</v>

451
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:19.890
<v Speaker 1>it goes off.</v>

452
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.770
<v Speaker 1>And then two kids arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not right.</v>

453
00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:27.771
<v Speaker 1>And it's a crazy video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're talking about a story like </v>

454
00:18:27.771 --> 00:18:30.681
<v Speaker 1>that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a little different than </v>

455
00:18:30.681 --> 00:18:32.631
<v Speaker 1>just talking about politics because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing something not knowing fully how </v>

456
00:18:32.631 --> 00:18:33.150
<v Speaker 1>it started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

457
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:38.151
<v Speaker 1>So you're having to take the word of to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people without having the evidence and </v>

458
00:18:38.151 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 1>trying to get across the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My pain,</v>

459
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.490
<v Speaker 1>my main points in the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

460
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cop didn't seem to deescalate the </v>

461
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.190
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't continually announced that he was</v>

462
00:18:47.191 --> 00:18:52.191
<v Speaker 1>a police officer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't announce that he was denouncing </v>

463
00:18:52.191 --> 00:18:52.500
<v Speaker 1>it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this point in the video where</v>

464
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.190
<v Speaker 1>a kid I believe says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe you're a cop or how do I</v>

465
00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:57.510
<v Speaker 1>know you're a cop or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

466
00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two different videos,</v>

467
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.370
<v Speaker 1>so it seems like maybe he announced it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I was him,</v>

468
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.900
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is hindsight,</v>

469
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:07.320
<v Speaker 1>of course I'd be constantly announcing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I am an off duty police officer and</v>

470
00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:12.321
<v Speaker 1>I'm detaining this kid until the police </v>
<v Speaker 1>show up rather than potentially just </v>

471
00:19:12.321 --> 00:19:15.090
<v Speaker 1>some stranger grabbing a child and also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

472
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or I,</v>

473
00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:19.560
<v Speaker 1>if I was in his position and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden I started being attacked,</v>

474
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.270
<v Speaker 1>I would 100 percent have pulled the gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

475
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:23.520
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't have fired it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were already running away.</v>

476
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:24.540
<v Speaker 1>And I think that is</v>

477
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:28.010
<v Speaker 4>attacking him because the way he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>handling the situation.</v>

478
00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

479
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:34.180
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard thing of I have my </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal opinion in these segmented </v>

480
00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.501
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he could have done way more to </v>

481
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:37.501
<v Speaker 1>deescalate the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

482
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:41.011
<v Speaker 1>I think that when he pulled out the gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a choice to either fix his hands </v>

483
00:19:41.011 --> 00:19:44.890
<v Speaker 1>so that he didn't accidentally shoot a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun around children.</v>

484
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.250
<v Speaker 1>Why does he have a round chambered?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

485
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Why is the safety not on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are important questions,</v>

486
00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to,</v>

487
00:19:52.361 --> 00:19:54.400
<v Speaker 1>especially someone that has a concealed </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapon,</v>

488
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:59.790
<v Speaker 1>someone that's an off duty cop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to hold them to a higher </v>

489
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:02.071
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My argument there though is if I was in </v>

490
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:04.861
<v Speaker 1>that same position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have 100 percent as I was being </v>

491
00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:04.861
<v Speaker 1>attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if I have a weapon on me that</v>

492
00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:08.911
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden I'm going to get worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe it could be used against me </v>

493
00:20:08.911 --> 00:20:09.580
<v Speaker 1>as these kids are already attacked me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would pull it out,</v>

494
00:20:09.581 --> 00:20:11.540
<v Speaker 1>but then he takes it to a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>right level</v>

495
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.600
<v Speaker 4>where even the way he pulled it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he pulled it out slow and sloppy,</v>

496
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.640
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I saw someone reaching under </v>

497
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:19.700
<v Speaker 4>their shirt like that for a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I was a crazy person,</v>

498
00:20:19.701 --> 00:20:23.420
<v Speaker 4>I would totally attacked him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tackle them 100 percent.</v>

499
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.260
<v Speaker 4>If they don't get ahold of that gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're not armed.</v>

500
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.510
<v Speaker 4>As soon as they get ahold of that gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there aren't.</v>

501
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

502
00:20:30.201 --> 00:20:33.770
<v Speaker 4>if he's doing all this jazz and reaching</v>
<v Speaker 4>in and it's taken so much time,</v>

503
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.010
<v Speaker 4>that's all the time you can punch him in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the face like this.</v>

504
00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.230
<v Speaker 4>He's not going to stop you from punching</v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

505
00:20:39.231 --> 00:20:42.560
<v Speaker 4>The face of it is reaching and grabbing </v>
<v Speaker 4>his guns slow and sloppy.</v>

506
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.560
<v Speaker 4>It took a long time because he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>it with one hand,</v>

507
00:20:45.561 --> 00:20:47.560
<v Speaker 4>lifting up his shirt was trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>the gun.</v>

508
00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:47.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

509
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.860
<v Speaker 1>I think he was posturing a lot of ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like letting the.</v>

510
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

511
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.460
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at ditch dare has been garden.</v>

512
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Now what the the press conference </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

513
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.170
<v Speaker 1>It feels very much like they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting their,</v>

514
00:21:00.171 --> 00:21:03.340
<v Speaker 1>their ducks in a row before they really </v>
<v Speaker 1>come down on them of course,</v>

515
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:07.510
<v Speaker 1>but a cop is just a person so there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be great cops and there's going</v>

516
00:21:07.511 --> 00:21:12.511
<v Speaker 1>to be morons and there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that just didn't realize the </v>

517
00:21:12.511 --> 00:21:16.831
<v Speaker 1>situation was going to get to where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to and they just didn't handle all </v>

518
00:21:16.831 --> 00:21:18.370
<v Speaker 1>the steps along the way and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably what happened with him.</v>

519
00:21:18.371 --> 00:21:19.660
<v Speaker 1>He probably thought he was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

520
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.790
<v Speaker 1>stop coming through my lawn and making </v>
<v Speaker 1>noise.</v>

521
00:21:21.791 --> 00:21:23.350
<v Speaker 1>You will fucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:24.330
<v Speaker 1>and the kids like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

523
00:21:24.331 --> 00:21:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll shoot you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

524
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

525
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Motherfuck Aroma Cup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't believe me?</v>

526
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.040
<v Speaker 1>God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

527
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.850
<v Speaker 1>This is my fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so like talking about that story,</v>

528
00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:38.851
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to take in both sides of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument and then separately giving my </v>

529
00:21:38.851 --> 00:21:41.080
<v Speaker 1>opinion and I did an event last night </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a kid said,</v>

530
00:21:41.081 --> 00:21:41.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

531
00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:43.600
<v Speaker 1>what do you say to people that disagree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you there?</v>

532
00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Especially from the Latino community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

533
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Where things like how a cop is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat me is going to be different than </v>

534
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:51.490
<v Speaker 1>how they treat us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

535
00:21:51.491 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 100 percent fine for you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a disagreement.</v>

536
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to me.</v>

537
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look at my opinion and go,</v>

538
00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.400
<v Speaker 1>this is a fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate this fucking guy.</v>

539
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Michael trade talks about in the special</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he had he went through like a </v>

540
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:05.970
<v Speaker 1>weird thing to try and educate me.</v>

541
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Give me your point of view and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>why it's okay for people to go like he.</v>

542
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.030
<v Speaker 1>He tried to give both both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave his opinion.</v>

543
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is he though?</v>

544
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Were you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just people.</v>

545
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.740
<v Speaker 1>People out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that watch my show,</v>

546
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I have far left far right.</v>

547
00:22:20.651 --> 00:22:22.360
<v Speaker 1>People that watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't always agree,</v>

548
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:27.510
<v Speaker 1>but they know that I'm always going into</v>
<v Speaker 1>it with the best of intentions and I'm </v>

549
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.530
<v Speaker 1>not going to hide facts and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna Hide my opinion and I think that's</v>

550
00:22:29.531 --> 00:22:30.550
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

551
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're seeing a video like that,</v>

552
00:22:32.111 --> 00:22:34.950
<v Speaker 1>you're not seeing what had transpired </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

553
00:22:34.951 --> 00:22:36.790
<v Speaker 1>It got to the point where he's holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto that kid.</v>

554
00:22:36.791 --> 00:22:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who knows who was a dick.</v>

555
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.160
<v Speaker 1>He didn't handle it well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't expect the kids to him </v>

556
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.540
<v Speaker 1>well because your fucking kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No kid handles anything.</v>

557
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what name me a 10 year old kid who deals</v>

558
00:22:49.781 --> 00:22:50.590
<v Speaker 1>with things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

559
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>

560
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.030
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying things out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experimenting.</v>

561
00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.130
<v Speaker 1>They really don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate properly.</v>

562

<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

578
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about it in that avenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that guy that cut me </v>

579
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:33.630
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should kill himself.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

582
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:42.390
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only clip they're going to </v>

583
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.390
<v Speaker 1>use from this entire podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Cheney should kill himself.</v>

584
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:43.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a few people that just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

585
00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:44.500
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What have you done?</v>

586
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.150
<v Speaker 1>What have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What have you done?</v>

587
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.370
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some monsters out there for sure.</v>

588
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Just jump off bridges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

589
00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

590
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:56.981
<v Speaker 1>that should jump off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you think there's too many people </v>

591
00:23:56.981 --> 00:23:57.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And child molesters.</v>

592
00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Jump off the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of priests out there that </v>

593
00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:02.980
<v Speaker 1>could definitely run into traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't.</v>

594
00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that because you fuck up </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's car.</v>

595
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jump off the bridge.</v>

596
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not the worst thing to say,</v>

597
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.020
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just this.</v>

598
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:14.070
<v Speaker 1>This game didn't go so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pull the plug on the console and </v>

599
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.380
<v Speaker 1>replug this pitch in and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens is.</v>

600
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Then you drive it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flip the board.</v>

601
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Just it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The game's over.</v>

602
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Knock the chess pieces down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just walk away.</v>

603
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.700
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely too many taboo words </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

604
00:24:28.701 --> 00:24:33.701
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking about this in my act </v>

605
00:24:33.701 --> 00:24:34.670
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit lately because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's this supposed to convey tent?</v>

606
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:39.730
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not supposed to be magic taboo </v>

607
00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.641
<v Speaker 1>words and half of it is not even about </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get people to be more </v>

608
00:24:43.431 --> 00:24:48.431
<v Speaker 1>considerate or more kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about calling people out on doing </v>

609
00:24:48.431 --> 00:24:52.481
<v Speaker 1>something wrong and stopping them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the intent matters more </v>

610
00:24:52.481 --> 00:24:56.111
<v Speaker 1>than the word hundred percent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I feel like we saw that a lot </v>

611
00:24:56.111 --> 00:24:56.360
<v Speaker 1>with um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

612
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:57.800
<v Speaker 1>there's two big youtubers that were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

613
00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.810
<v Speaker 1>it was a or one was in the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a cutie pie.</v>

614
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Talk about that because I saw his </v>
<v Speaker 1>response video and I kinda got sickened.</v>

615
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By what's happening to him.</v>

616
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by what's happening.</v>

617
00:25:10.131 --> 00:25:11.790
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were saying you know his </v>
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

618
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

619
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.030
<v Speaker 1>he was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

620
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:19.090
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making it out like he's a Nazi </v>

621
00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:20.100
<v Speaker 1>and he's not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

622
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:25.430
<v Speaker 1>He had made some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some videos where he had told people to </v>

623
00:25:25.731 --> 00:25:30.731
<v Speaker 1>not be Nazis and not until like to too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you know,</v>

624
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.940
<v Speaker 1>what was his exact words?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

625
00:25:32.941 --> 00:25:37.941
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them to this ripping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It originally started with this whole </v>

626
00:25:37.941 --> 00:25:38.320
<v Speaker 1>fiverr video that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

627
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.190
<v Speaker 1>and then fiverr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

628
00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:43.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a website where you can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to do thing for things originally</v>

629
00:25:43.851 --> 00:25:47.870
<v Speaker 1>for $5 now for more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he went through the site.</v>

630
00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:49.940
<v Speaker 1>It all started from this one video that </v>
<v Speaker 1>got him attention.</v>

631
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.970
<v Speaker 1>He went to fiverr and try to get people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do ridiculous,</v>

632
00:25:52.971 --> 00:25:54.270
<v Speaker 1>outrageous things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

633
00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Good guy dressed as Jesus to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something weird.</v>

634
00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.060
<v Speaker 1>He got these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

635
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.310
<v Speaker 1>the main thing that blew up were these </v>
<v Speaker 1>two guys,</v>

636
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.680
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in like a jungle setting of some</v>

637
00:26:03.681 --> 00:26:04.100
<v Speaker 1>sort.</v>

638
00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.270
<v Speaker 1>They dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they laugh,</v>

639
00:26:05.271 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 1>they'll hold up a sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll say something.</v>

640
00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:12.220
<v Speaker 1>And so he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be hilarious because </v>

641
00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:12.220
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be like,</v>

642
00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:12.920
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no.</v>

643
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.550
<v Speaker 1>But they actually made a video where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys were laughing and dancing,</v>

644
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:21.610
<v Speaker 1>held up a sign that said a death to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews and then said to subscribe to a </v>

645
00:26:21.921 --> 00:26:22.970
<v Speaker 1>youtube channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

646
00:26:22.971 --> 00:26:23.990
<v Speaker 1>The whole of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

647
00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:24.260
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

648
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.560
<v Speaker 1>of someone else asked them to say death </v>
<v Speaker 1>to all Jews.</v>

649
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.680
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote in as like a cause in the same </v>

650
00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.050
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets all these people that are like,</v>

651
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do the stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous thing that you said.</v>

652
00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:40.740
<v Speaker 1>But then they actually did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big reason I feel like they did it </v>

653
00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.421
<v Speaker 1>as they didn't understand what the words</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were writing in the words that </v>

654
00:26:43.421 --> 00:26:43.421
<v Speaker 1>we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

655
00:26:43.421 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 1>they're from another country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What country</v>

656
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.360
<v Speaker 4>were they from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

657
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.740
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to double check.</v>

658
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:51.770
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they just essentially wrote down the </v>

659
00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.511
<v Speaker 4>symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't really know how to even say </v>

660
00:26:53.511 --> 00:26:53.511
<v Speaker 4>the word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so there it is.</v>

661
00:26:53.511 --> 00:26:53.511
<v Speaker 4>So there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

662
00:26:53.511 --> 00:26:54.060
<v Speaker 4>And they're laughing.</v>

663
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.520
<v Speaker 1>And so I think this might be from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation video,</v>

664
00:26:56.521 --> 00:27:00.090
<v Speaker 1>but in the first one he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck did they do it?</v>

665
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.740
<v Speaker 1>How do I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I even include this?</v>

666
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.250
<v Speaker 1>And so then that sent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

667
00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:10.251
<v Speaker 1>got that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a little traction and then people </v>

668
00:27:10.251 --> 00:27:10.251
<v Speaker 1>started going through his other videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

669
00:27:10.251 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's dressed up,</v>

670
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:15.890
<v Speaker 1>he's watching Hitler in this one taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely out of context of him saying </v>

671
00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:19.551
<v Speaker 1>that the Youtube Heroes Program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a program where people can </v>

672
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:24.980
<v Speaker 1>highlight videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not highlight them but mark them </v>

673
00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:24.980
<v Speaker 1>down for deletion because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive.</v>

674
00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people were like,</v>

675
00:27:25.771 --> 00:27:30.771
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that censorship that's you're talking </v>

676
00:27:30.771 --> 00:27:30.900
<v Speaker 1>about like obviously hyperbole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like those are Nazis.</v>

677
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 1>So he made that joke in that relation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was one,</v>

678
00:27:35.191 --> 00:27:37.890
<v Speaker 1>if I want to say if it was on the verge </v>
<v Speaker 1>or wired,</v>

679
00:27:37.891 --> 00:27:39.270
<v Speaker 1>but then they go even further and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

680
00:27:39.271 --> 00:27:44.271
<v Speaker 1>he was Leslie Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Picture on Harambie taken completely out</v>

681
00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:48.030
<v Speaker 1>of context because he was using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this Microsoft Ai Bot,</v>

682
00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:49.860
<v Speaker 1>this chat Bot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd say,</v>

683
00:27:49.861 --> 00:27:52.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see Harambie as Jesus.</v>

684
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:57.770
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either the AI was messed up or people </v>

685
00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:58.830
<v Speaker 1>had manipulated it where it was putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>Leslie Jones his face on it.</v>

686
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.020
<v Speaker 1>And he was horrified by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a whole joke,</v>

687
00:28:01.021 --> 00:28:02.820
<v Speaker 1>but they were saying that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was doing it.</v>

688
00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.660
<v Speaker 4>So this is clear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he,</v>

689
00:28:04.661 --> 00:28:07.360
<v Speaker 4>you saw him use the software and saw the</v>
<v Speaker 4>error.</v>

690
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.540
<v Speaker 1>You try and use the bot today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A picture won't come up because now they</v>

691
00:28:10.541 --> 00:28:11.920
<v Speaker 1>are aware that that's what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

692
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they took all these things and it</v>

693
00:28:14.231 --> 00:28:16.420
<v Speaker 1>was this like this crusade of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look guys,</v>

694
00:28:16.421 --> 00:28:18.640
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at this bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the biggest guy on youtube,</v>

695
00:28:18.641 --> 00:28:20.530
<v Speaker 1>he's the bad guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take them down.</v>

696
00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.680
<v Speaker 1>So much taken out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some things are not defensible where I </v>

697
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.511
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say it in the sense of like you </v>

698
00:28:30.511 --> 00:28:30.511
<v Speaker 1>say that words don't have power based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>intent.</v>

699
00:28:30.511 --> 00:28:31.510
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of truth in that.</v>

700
00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.630
<v Speaker 4>Not saying words don't have power based </v>
<v Speaker 4>on intent.</v>

701
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that words should just convey</v>
<v Speaker 4>intent.</v>

702
00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.310
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there are times where a word,</v>

703
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.820
<v Speaker 4>there's times where like you see a </v>
<v Speaker 4>friend,</v>

704
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:44.810
<v Speaker 4>Nico,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's up bitch,</v>

705
00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:49.860
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you in there and you're both laughing </v>

706
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.481
<v Speaker 4>and being silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's times where you call </v>

707
00:28:52.481 --> 00:28:52.880
<v Speaker 4>someone a bitch because you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're being mean.</v>

708
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:55.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean those two words exactly the same.</v>

709
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.740
<v Speaker 4>But one conveys a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 4>intent.</v>

710
00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But out of this it was,</v>

711
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:05.430
<v Speaker 1>it was very obvious that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do this takedown thing and it </v>

712
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.430
<v Speaker 1>blew up entirely in their face I think</v>

713
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:08.450
<v Speaker 4>because I don't think most people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>aware.</v>

714
00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean there was a Wall Street Journal </v>
<v Speaker 4>article.</v>

715
00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:15.220
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which was where it got really weird </v>

716
00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.561
<v Speaker 4>because three people worked on this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they combed through hundreds of hours </v>

717
00:29:17.561 --> 00:29:21.410
<v Speaker 4>and they found like instances of him </v>
<v Speaker 4>holding his arm out like this.</v>

718
00:29:21.411 --> 00:29:23.870
<v Speaker 4>And they used that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's A.</v>

719
00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's weird.</v>

720
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

721
00:29:28.361 --> 00:29:30.520
<v Speaker 1>and then once all that came out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

722
00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:33.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing about the context.</v>

723
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.470
<v Speaker 1>He's just like Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

724
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:40.950
<v Speaker 1>it was an immediate jump to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's using the same tactic tactics as </v>

725
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just insane.</v>

726
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

727
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.980
<v Speaker 4>he's very reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did a video response video about it </v>

728
00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:47.590
<v Speaker 4>and the way he handled it was very </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasonable.</v>

729
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.830
<v Speaker 4>And he explained what he was doing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on and you know,</v>

730
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:55.831
<v Speaker 4>he's doing hundreds of hours of him </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing video games and talking and </v>

731
00:29:55.831 --> 00:30:00.160
<v Speaker 4>being silly and if you comb through </v>
<v Speaker 4>those and take these things again out of</v>

732
00:30:00.161 --> 00:30:03.730
<v Speaker 4>context and try to make it look like </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a Nazi,</v>

733
00:30:03.731 --> 00:30:05.440
<v Speaker 4>that's a hit piece.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

734
00:30:05.441 --> 00:30:09.160
<v Speaker 4>And it's deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not indicative of his overall.</v>

735
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:11.890
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to call it a body of work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let's call it a body of work,</v>

736
00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.960
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>His overall body of performance that's </v>

737
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:16.960
<v Speaker 4>online,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to call it,</v>

738
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>His talking,</v>

739
00:30:17.861 --> 00:30:22.861
<v Speaker 4>it's not who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for them to call him a Nazi and say </v>

740
00:30:22.861 --> 00:30:26.410
<v Speaker 4>that pooty pie has seven videos where </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's done something about Nazis,</v>

741
00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:30.790
<v Speaker 4>like people when they're doing these </v>
<v Speaker 4>long form spit ball,</v>

742
00:30:30.791 --> 00:30:33.040
<v Speaker 4>improvisation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>videos like that,</v>

743
00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:38.041
<v Speaker 4>and you're interacting with people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to say all kinds of shit </v>

744
00:30:38.041 --> 00:30:41.760
<v Speaker 4>that in the moment is legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you chop it up and edit it and </v>

745
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.160
<v Speaker 4>splice them all together and then make a</v>
<v Speaker 4>five minute montage of him saying Nazi,</v>

746
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.380
<v Speaker 4>like he's obsessed with Nazis</v>

747
00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.850
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of sucked from it was a lot of</v>

748
00:30:50.851 --> 00:30:51.810
<v Speaker 1>people think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

749
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.220
<v Speaker 1>they're there articles about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>downfall of Pewdiepie.</v>

750
00:30:55.050 --> 00:31:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I think he's gone up half a million if </v>
<v Speaker 1>not more than a million subscribers </v>

751
00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:00.050
<v Speaker 1>since all of this happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

752
00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:02.710
<v Speaker 1>So he's gotten all this new support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a temporary phase for a,</v>

753
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:07.730
<v Speaker 1>for free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech and persecution for </v>

754
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:07.730
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't even lose some,</v>

755
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:09.040
<v Speaker 1>some get matter for him though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

756
00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:09.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

757
00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:11.700
<v Speaker 1>it sucks more for the people that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on that project.</v>

758
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.940
<v Speaker 1>What was the project?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was scare Pewdie pie season two.</v>

759
00:31:14.941 --> 00:31:16.800
<v Speaker 1>It was a youtube red series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

760
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:21.830
<v Speaker 1>so they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there were about to go into </v>

761
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.830
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

762
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.830
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then that got canceled.</v>

763
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:24.840
<v Speaker 1>So Youtube didn't want to fund that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said it,</v>

764
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:29.990
<v Speaker 1>he said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He understands why they would have to </v>

765
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:31.731
<v Speaker 1>separate because then it becomes a story</v>
<v Speaker 1>of youtube and or Youtube and Disney </v>

766
00:31:31.731 --> 00:31:32.380
<v Speaker 1>support an anti Semite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

767
00:31:32.381 --> 00:31:32.660
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>

768
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:36.070
<v Speaker 4>He's not an anti Semite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so why would they back away?</v>

769
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I think because they were scared that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Wall Street Journal was like,</v>

770
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.310
<v Speaker 1>did you see all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to write this article,</v>

771
00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.740
<v Speaker 4>Wall Street Journal at that slip </v>
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>

772
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.230
<v Speaker 4>That seems to me very response.</v>

773
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Many of them are standing by it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people,</v>

774
00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.940
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent and many are touting</v>

775
00:31:50.941 --> 00:31:55.200
<v Speaker 1>it as this victory because he lost a </v>
<v Speaker 1>google preferred ads on Youtube,</v>

776
00:31:55.201 --> 00:32:00.201
<v Speaker 1>which I will say I don't know how he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>still seen as family friendly because </v>

777
00:32:00.201 --> 00:32:03.921
<v Speaker 1>I'm not family friendly on my show his </v>
<v Speaker 1>past two years at the very least not </v>

778
00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:05.700
<v Speaker 1>family friendly and then dropped by </v>
<v Speaker 1>maker.</v>

779
00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:07.650
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't need his.</v>

780
00:32:07.651 --> 00:32:12.651
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his MTN has his company around him and </v>

781
00:32:12.651 --> 00:32:15.471
<v Speaker 1>the youtube red series is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's still gonna make millions of </v>

782
00:32:15.471 --> 00:32:15.471
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's grown.</v>

783
00:32:15.471 --> 00:32:17.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like now if you,</v>

784
00:32:17.271 --> 00:32:19.260
<v Speaker 1>if you have mainstream media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try and take a swing at you.</v>

785
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:20.830
<v Speaker 1>It's some of the best promotion in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

786
00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:26.320
<v Speaker 4>Why did they take a swing at him and why</v>
<v Speaker 4>is anyone saying that they took down a </v>

787
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:26.470
<v Speaker 4>bad guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

788
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:29.890
<v Speaker 1>that it's a big thing of them trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>label and it's,</v>

789
00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:35.160
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem with a lot of media is </v>

790
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:35.160
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're overextending,</v>

791
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:35.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all of a sudden start talking about</v>

792
00:32:35.561 --> 00:32:40.460
<v Speaker 1>this narrative about outright and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rise of white again in this country.</v>

793
00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:42.830
<v Speaker 1>And then they look at this big guy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

794
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:47.120
<v Speaker 1>we can use him as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can be the heroes that expose this,</v>

795
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:49.000
<v Speaker 1>that do the take down piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

796
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 1>and they're not and they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like so driven for that,</v>

797
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.780
<v Speaker 1>that they then just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

798
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.340
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that doesn't add up there.</v>

799
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.140
<v Speaker 1>It's an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have the power.</v>

800
00:32:57.141 --> 00:33:00.380
<v Speaker 1>We have the size of the audience were </v>
<v Speaker 1>good and it just blew up in their face.</v>

801
00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:05.580
<v Speaker 4>So they were thinking they could get </v>
<v Speaker 4>away with it even though it wasn't </v>

802
00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:05.580
<v Speaker 4>kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe so too.</v>

803
00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.470
<v Speaker 4>What is their response so far?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do,</v>

804
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.910
<v Speaker 4>do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you read anything about it?</v>

805
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Right as far as like fans or Wall Street</v>
<v Speaker 1>Journal posts,</v>

806
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.140
<v Speaker 1>posts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>digging their heels in,</v>

807
00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:21.650
<v Speaker 1>and then a lot of people started trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to find as always turned on like the </v>

808
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:26.180
<v Speaker 1>authors in the past one was like a joke </v>
<v Speaker 1>from 2015 because and,</v>

809
00:33:26.181 --> 00:33:27.960
<v Speaker 1>and while part of me would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's petty.</v>

810
00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.940
<v Speaker 1>If the argument is that context doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>

811
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.600
<v Speaker 1>then fine then then look at these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they said a year ago,</v>

812
00:33:33.601 --> 00:33:38.601
<v Speaker 1>look at what they are saying now look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the writers who have the article like I </v>

813
00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:40.740
<v Speaker 1>think Ben Fritz was one of the art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The writer is where you made A.</v>

814
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

815
00:33:42.231 --> 00:33:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I never knew that Jews were so good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>frying joke from way back.</v>

816
00:33:45.451 --> 00:33:50.451
<v Speaker 1>And then he made another joke about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a back and forth with </v>

817
00:33:50.451 --> 00:33:52.680
<v Speaker 1>someone where he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these racial jokes are so stupid.</v>

818
00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:54.420
<v Speaker 1>And then someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

819
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hit everyone.</v>

820
00:33:55.501 --> 00:33:56.130
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

821
00:33:56.131 --> 00:33:58.050
<v Speaker 1>at least the black jokes are funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those ones,</v>

822
00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.370
<v Speaker 1>those ones are funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

823
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.480
<v Speaker 1>and so people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

824
00:34:00.481 --> 00:34:00.990
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

825
00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:03.270
<v Speaker 1>if context doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you a scumbag?</v>

826
00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:08.810
<v Speaker 1>And then people just dismissed it as are</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of mainstream people dismissed it </v>

827
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.810
<v Speaker 1>as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

828
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:10.080
<v Speaker 1>that's not the same thing.</v>

829
00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.170
<v Speaker 4>How could anyone say context doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter.</v>

830
00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.900
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is an insane thing to say.</v>

831
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:17.870
<v Speaker 4>Is that literally what they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that context does not matter.</v>

832
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.150
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the.</v>

833
00:34:19.151 --> 00:34:24.151
<v Speaker 1>One of the people I'm going to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is so many people have written </v>

834
00:34:24.151 --> 00:34:27.001
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was one article that was promoted </v>

835
00:34:27.001 --> 00:34:29.161
<v Speaker 1>and it said all these are articles or </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people defending Felix with,</v>

836
00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:34.260
<v Speaker 1>but context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bullshit argument and that's </v>

837
00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.970
<v Speaker 1>insane if you think that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everything exists in a,</v>

838
00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.630
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a highly edited bubble,</v>

839
00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.430
<v Speaker 4>dope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ruined everyone's career.</v>

840
00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.310
<v Speaker 4>If you're talking about a mathematician </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussing algorithms,</v>

841
00:34:42.311 --> 00:34:47.311
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>context doesn't really mean that much </v>

842
00:34:47.311 --> 00:34:47.380
<v Speaker 4>because he's talking about numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're not talking about numbers,</v>

843
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:52.710
<v Speaker 4>talking about words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about the way people </v>

844
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:55.081
<v Speaker 4>express themselves and we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about someone who is generally </v>

845
00:34:55.081 --> 00:34:55.840
<v Speaker 4>considered to be humorous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean pooty Pie,</v>

846
00:34:55.841 --> 00:34:57.850
<v Speaker 4>a lot of his stuff is playful and </v>
<v Speaker 4>humorous,</v>

847
00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:02.880
<v Speaker 4>so if your humerus and you're playing </v>
<v Speaker 4>around and you say something that might </v>

848
00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.141
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even want to use the </v>

849
00:35:07.141 --> 00:35:09.061
<v Speaker 4>appropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be the thing for him to say in </v>

850
00:35:09.061 --> 00:35:09.710
<v Speaker 4>that moment to try to be entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

851
00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:14.850
<v Speaker 4>That does not mean he's a Nazi and two </v>
<v Speaker 4>to label him like that is incredibly </v>

852
00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:18.640
<v Speaker 4>irresponsible and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really bad.</v>

853
00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a lawyer,</v>

854
00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.050
<v Speaker 4>but I would sue the fuck out of him if I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was him.</v>

855
00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.230
<v Speaker 4>I would sue the fuck out of them for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

856
00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:31.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because what they're doing is </v>

857
00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:32.350
<v Speaker 4>misrepresenting who he is as a human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being and even if it's beneficial in the</v>

858
00:35:32.351 --> 00:35:37.351
<v Speaker 4>long run,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's super dangerous to set that </v>

859
00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:37.351
<v Speaker 4>precedent.</v>

860
00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in this climate where you </v>

861
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.101
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what he supports and it 100 </v>

862
00:35:43.101 --> 00:35:43.101
<v Speaker 1>percent isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know someone doesn't just see</v>

863
00:35:43.101 --> 00:35:44.820
<v Speaker 1>those articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't see as defense and tries to kill</v>

864
00:35:44.821 --> 00:35:45.950
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why</v>

865
00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.500
<v Speaker 4>Wall Street Journal do something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this?</v>

866
00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:53.680
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is where the conspiratorially </v>

867
00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.301
<v Speaker 4>minded start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this pooty pie kid is this youtube </v>

868
00:35:55.941 --> 00:35:58.610
<v Speaker 4>sensation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much like this Philip Defranco guy.</v>

869
00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.170
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have 5 million subscribers.</v>

870
00:36:00.171 --> 00:36:01.610
<v Speaker 4>This guy has like $53,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million,</v>

871
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:02.780
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's still a lot.</v>

872
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.230
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But do you feel,</v>

873
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.970
<v Speaker 4>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

874
00:36:07.971 --> 00:36:12.971
<v Speaker 4>you have a legitimate viewpoint on this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you feel like there is some sort of </v>

875
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:19.150
<v Speaker 4>resentment or anger or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so people that are working against </v>

876
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:25.870
<v Speaker 4>the folks that are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have become these new media stars </v>

877
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:25.870
<v Speaker 4>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you essentially mean,</v>

878
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.550
<v Speaker 4>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you kind of run your own thing,</v>

879
00:36:28.551 --> 00:36:28.850
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

880
00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.330
<v Speaker 1>For the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am part of a company right now.</v>

881
00:36:32.331 --> 00:36:37.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a financial decision that you </v>

882
00:36:37.331 --> 00:36:37.331
<v Speaker 1>made along the way once you became </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful doing it in a year.</v>

883
00:36:37.331 --> 00:36:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll be back on my own and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to get threats.</v>

884
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.430
<v Speaker 1>This is where I start the negotiations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

885
00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:48.450
<v Speaker 1>and in a year because if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want to start my own larger </v>

886
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:51.971
<v Speaker 1>news organization of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the left and from the Ryan can </v>

887
00:36:51.971 --> 00:36:52.250
<v Speaker 1>debate like one of my favorite play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a character.</v>

888
00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.170
<v Speaker 1>I want to wear a fake nose and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mustache.</v>

889
00:36:54.171 --> 00:36:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Just talk shit and make things up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>

890
00:36:56.991 --> 00:36:59.240
<v Speaker 1>I want to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be like a line news guy.</v>

891
00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.210
<v Speaker 1>At first I thought muddied the water </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

892
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:02.870
<v Speaker 1>At first I thought you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Gavin,</v>

893
00:37:02.871 --> 00:37:04.680
<v Speaker 1>but then you said the life that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>originally knew him as a comedian and </v>

896
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:15.320
<v Speaker 1>then I found all the new stuff with or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not that new,</v>

897
00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:16.940
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all his political stuff.</v>

898
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.580
<v Speaker 1>I like listening to the [inaudible]</v>

<v Speaker 4>questions,</v>

00:37:58.461 --> 00:38:03.461
<v Speaker 4>So interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the most fascinating people </v>

917
00:38:03.461 --> 00:38:06.311
<v Speaker 4>I've ever talked to him because of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>passion for things like the way he </v>

918
00:38:06.311 --> 00:38:09.941
<v Speaker 4>described space and astrophysics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that he's so </v>

919
00:38:09.941 --> 00:38:13.571
<v Speaker 4>knowledgeable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the intense passionate in which it </v>

920
00:38:13.571 --> 00:38:13.880
<v Speaker 4>delivers that information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so infectious.</v>

921
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what separates people is the </v>

922
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.450
<v Speaker 1>passion relating everything to to art </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way and the lease.</v>

923
00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.240
<v Speaker 1>It's relatable to everyone.</v>

924
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.780
<v Speaker 4>Everyone will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really is,</v>

925
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:24.270
<v Speaker 4>and there's an art form to the way he </v>
<v Speaker 4>does it.</v>

926
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many people.</v>

927
00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:31.761
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you probably experienced at </v>

928
00:38:31.761 --> 00:38:31.761
<v Speaker 4>some point in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a boring science teacher,</v>

929
00:38:31.761 --> 00:38:32.280
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all have.</v>

930
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:33.750
<v Speaker 4>Where you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

931
00:38:33.751 --> 00:38:38.751
<v Speaker 4>it's so boring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have thought that as an adult I </v>

932
00:38:38.751 --> 00:38:41.371
<v Speaker 4>would be fascinated by sirens so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>will be constantly looking at science </v>

933
00:38:41.371 --> 00:38:44.911
<v Speaker 4>blogs and reading all these scientific </v>
<v Speaker 4>papers and paying attention to every </v>

934
00:38:44.911 --> 00:38:49.670
<v Speaker 4>single news release by NASA of new </v>
<v Speaker 4>exoplanets that they've discovered.</v>

935
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Passionate makes a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in school,</v>

936
00:38:52.791 --> 00:38:55.510
<v Speaker 1>I was way better at math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was.</v>

937
00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I was fascinated with storytelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I had a really passionate </v>

938
00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.970
<v Speaker 1>English teacher really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I sucked at it initially,</v>

939
00:39:01.971 --> 00:39:04.510
<v Speaker 1>but really got me into storytelling and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

940
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:09.550
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the journey and the beauty of a </v>

941
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:10.430
<v Speaker 1>story and I feel like that we need more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like that.</v>

942
00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.220
<v Speaker 1>People that care rather than just </v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing the dollar.</v>

943
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

944
00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:14.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

945
00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:16.030
<v Speaker 1>no disrespect for making money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

946
00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.110
<v Speaker 1>I do feel like some people villainize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

947
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:20.240
<v Speaker 1>but you have to have the passion.</v>

948
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:25.620
<v Speaker 4>Well for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the role of the school teacher </v>

949
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:29.010
<v Speaker 4>is such an underappreciated and </v>
<v Speaker 4>undervalued and also it's not just </v>

950
00:39:31.781 --> 00:39:34.930
<v Speaker 4>undervalued under appreciated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when done incorrectly,</v>

951
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.900
<v Speaker 4>it's so fucking potentially damaging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

952
00:39:37.901 --> 00:39:40.180
<v Speaker 4>you could really screw a kid's head up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

953
00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:45.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did any teacher ever say mean shit to </v>

954
00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:47.881
<v Speaker 4>you when you were a kid that stung you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and stayed with you for years and years </v>

955
00:39:47.981 --> 00:39:48.610
<v Speaker 4>afterwards?</v>

956
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shoot.</v>

957
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had some,</v>

958
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.290
<v Speaker 1>some rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

959
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.640
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some rough,</v>

960
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:55.920
<v Speaker 1>a Catholic school teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was like,</v>

961
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.300
<v Speaker 1>that was early day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was elementary.</v>

962
00:39:57.301 --> 00:39:59.460
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was stuff that maybe pushed me more</v>

963
00:39:59.461 --> 00:40:04.461
<v Speaker 1>away from the religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think later on it was probably my </v>

964
00:40:04.461 --> 00:40:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Spanish teacher who was just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointed.</v>

965
00:40:06.661 --> 00:40:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I got anything wrong that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just made me scared and made me a.</v>

966
00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any enthusiasm to all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden learn a new language.</v>

967
00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.900
<v Speaker 1>And so now I'm this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of these dumb fucks.</v>

968
00:40:15.901 --> 00:40:18.780
<v Speaker 1>It only knows one language me to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it a man or a woman?</v>

969
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did she yell at you?</v>

970
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she just wanted to fuck down,</v>

971
00:40:23.701 --> 00:40:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

972
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.500
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to just get you </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable.</v>

973
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:28.620
<v Speaker 1>The next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come over my house.</v>

974
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to teach you Spanish.</v>

975
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:34.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm into children that are 170 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and five foot tall.</v>

976
00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.550
<v Speaker 1>You need to roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

977
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.770
<v Speaker 1>I still can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

978
00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:38.430
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

979
00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:41.550
<v Speaker 1>whoa role now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a dumb fat tongue.</v>

980
00:40:41.551 --> 00:40:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

981
00:40:42.361 --> 00:40:43.250
<v Speaker 1>You can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

982
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Rah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sound like a fucking car trying to </v>

983
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.270
<v Speaker 1>start up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn White people I know.</v>

984
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.800
<v Speaker 1>So just ruining everything now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

985
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:56.040
<v Speaker 1>so to jump back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what you were saying about </v>

986
00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:56.340
<v Speaker 1>mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they have any real bad guy?</v>

987
00:40:56.630 --> 00:41:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get scared when everyone talks about </v>

988
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.910
<v Speaker 1>stuff in generalities right when I talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

989
00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:07.970
<v Speaker 1>And I'm guilty of it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I talked about like all mainstream </v>

990
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:07.970
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not everyone you know.</v>

991
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are.</v>

992
00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:13.850
<v Speaker 1>I stopped doing interviews with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream outlets several years ago </v>

993
00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:17.961
<v Speaker 1>because they made everything about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>I would talk about all the really cool </v>

994
00:41:17.961 --> 00:41:21.651
<v Speaker 1>ventures that we're going into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how our space is changing things up and </v>

995
00:41:21.651 --> 00:41:25.341
<v Speaker 1>it would always be turned into a one </v>
<v Speaker 1>comment that maybe was somewhat critical</v>

996
00:41:26.251 --> 00:41:29.580
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say like a studio all become about</v>

997
00:41:29.581 --> 00:41:31.710
<v Speaker 1>that or if all become about the money.</v>

998
00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:33.200
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

999
00:41:33.201 --> 00:41:36.210
<v Speaker 1>you just fucking manipulating what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying with this.</v>

1000
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.720
<v Speaker 1>And so the point is become a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the Wall Street Journal knocks on </v>

1001
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Felix's door after they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently approach him for the original</v>

1002
00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

1003
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:50.380
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to give you a platform to tell </v>

1004
00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:50.380
<v Speaker 1>your story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1005
00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:50.380
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're doing now?</v>

1006
00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The after the story broke and there were</v>

1007
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:52.340
<v Speaker 1>all these people that came to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense,</v>

1008
00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:54.470
<v Speaker 1>they came to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not gonna.</v>

1009
00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what a journalist should </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1010
00:41:57.070 --> 00:42:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Talk to the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>May Not be different journalists.</v>

1011
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think from what Felix wrote,</v>

1012
00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:09.440
<v Speaker 1>it was the Wall Street Journal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They left their cards and that's how we </v>

1013
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:09.440
<v Speaker 1>knew it was 100 percent of them.</v>

1014
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:14.270
<v Speaker 3>But why does someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean what I mean is it different </v>

1015
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.270
<v Speaker 3>journalists from the Wall Street Journal</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the same age to hit.</v>

1016
00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:17.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it was the same ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't seek out,</v>

1017
00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:18.660
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're super sorry.</v>

1018
00:42:18.661 --> 00:42:20.700
<v Speaker 3>We called you a Nazi in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>millions of people.</v>

1019
00:42:20.701 --> 00:42:22.110
<v Speaker 3>And we were totally lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1020
00:42:22.111 --> 00:42:23.820
<v Speaker 3>But the argument all of a sudden is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

1021
00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.770
<v Speaker 3>why should he do an interview with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Wall Street Journal?</v>

1022
00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Maybe because they have a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience,</v>

1023
00:42:27.391 --> 00:42:31.950
<v Speaker 3>but he has his own larger platform where</v>
<v Speaker 3>he controls the narrative.</v>

1024
00:42:31.951 --> 00:42:34.980
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to be selectively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's not speaking to the people that</v>

1025
00:42:34.981 --> 00:42:37.460
<v Speaker 3>the Wall Street Journal risperidone him </v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of it,</v>

1026
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:42.470
<v Speaker 3>but I would assume that they are also </v>
<v Speaker 3>covering their ass by going to him and </v>

1027
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:43.470
<v Speaker 3>reaching out and giving him a platform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can say,</v>

1028
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:48.710
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we gave him a chance to respond and the </v>

1029
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:51.051
<v Speaker 3>facts remain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did say those things and they are </v>

1030
00:42:51.051 --> 00:42:51.051
<v Speaker 3>valid.</v>

1031
00:42:51.051 --> 00:42:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I think if he was confident enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should probably do what I've seen </v>

1032
00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Milo Yiannopoulos during the past where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he had someone film at the same time.</v>

1033
00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:57.560
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1034
00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:01.030
<v Speaker 3>did ms dot represent him in some manner?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

1035
00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.100
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter because they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>already done it.</v>

1036
00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.440
<v Speaker 3>They've already misrepresented him in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the article.</v>

1037
00:43:05.441 --> 00:43:10.441
<v Speaker 3>If they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he has someone film his response to </v>

1038
00:43:10.441 --> 00:43:10.441
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1039
00:43:10.441 --> 00:43:13.831
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean just if he did something with </v>

1040
00:43:13.831 --> 00:43:13.831
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1041
00:43:13.831 --> 00:43:17.191
<v Speaker 3>If I did film something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understood what the entire thing just </v>

1042
00:43:17.191 --> 00:43:17.191
<v Speaker 3>so you can show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying it doesn't matter because</v>

1043
00:43:17.191 --> 00:43:19.420
<v Speaker 3>they've already done the damage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that damaging thing,</v>

1044
00:43:19.421 --> 00:43:24.421
<v Speaker 3>like how many people who read the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing or even going to read the second </v>

1045
00:43:24.421 --> 00:43:24.421
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1046
00:43:24.421 --> 00:43:28.710
<v Speaker 3>It might even be 30 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 70 percent people and how many </v>

1047
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:32.341
<v Speaker 3>people just read the Wall Street Journal</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe a local paper and our online </v>

1048
00:43:32.341 --> 00:43:33.910
<v Speaker 3>and aren't hearing all these responses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they go,</v>

1049
00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:34.510
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1050
00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:35.900
<v Speaker 3>they catch their son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1051
00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:37.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching pooty pie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1052
00:43:37.361 --> 00:43:39.460
<v Speaker 3>you watched that Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a Nazi?</v>

1053
00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:40.480
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not dead.</v>

1054
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:41.710
<v Speaker 3>You hate everything I liked</v>

1055
00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.990
<v Speaker 1>and now that kid's doing meth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of his life.</v>

1056
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:46.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1057
00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:46.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1058
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that it is sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1059
00:43:49.821 --> 00:43:51.250
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge problem with,</v>

1060
00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:56.280
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of the fake news or just news</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's false is the crazy salacious </v>

1061
00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.890
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you then look at the correction,</v>

1062
00:43:57.891 --> 00:44:00.950
<v Speaker 1>half the time that gets like 20 times </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shares,</v>

1063
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.720
<v Speaker 1>you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's fucking insane.</v>

1064
00:44:02.721 --> 00:44:03.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you see this?</v>

1065
00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Did you see this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's something that I've been </v>

1066
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:09.100
<v Speaker 1>critical of people I like in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

1067
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.180
<v Speaker 1>a critical level out of the mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

1068
00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:13.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it sucks because there's not,</v>

1069
00:44:13.911 --> 00:44:16.490
<v Speaker 1>there's not a clear answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you delete the false thing?</v>

1070
00:44:16.491 --> 00:44:18.350
<v Speaker 1>And then it looks like you're hiding </v>
<v Speaker 1>that information.</v>

1071
00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you do,</v>

1072
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.070
<v Speaker 1>you should definitely delete the false </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1073
00:44:22.071 --> 00:44:23.420
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's my argument.</v>

1074
00:44:23.421 --> 00:44:25.850
<v Speaker 1>But then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an argument that you leave it up</v>

1075
00:44:25.851 --> 00:44:28.640
<v Speaker 1>because you show that you were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's on twitter,</v>

1076
00:44:28.641 --> 00:44:30.110
<v Speaker 1>you quote tweet it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's still,</v>

1077
00:44:30.111 --> 00:44:31.440
<v Speaker 1>that's still doesn't fix it because</v>

1078
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:34.380
<v Speaker 4>as much as we talk about bubbles and </v>
<v Speaker 4>separation,</v>

1079
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:39.620
<v Speaker 4>that tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that promotion of a thing is separate </v>

1080
00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.501
<v Speaker 4>from everything else in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tweets are problematic anyway because </v>

1081
00:44:42.501 --> 00:44:45.321
<v Speaker 4>it's 140 characters and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult to adequately explained some </v>

1082
00:44:45.321 --> 00:44:48.591
<v Speaker 4>subjects in hundred 40 characters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you put out some information </v>

1083
00:44:48.591 --> 00:44:48.930
<v Speaker 4>that's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this pooty pie thing,</v>

1084
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.700
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

1085
00:44:49.701 --> 00:44:53.130
<v Speaker 4>you absolutely should print a retraction</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you absolutely,</v>

1086
00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:58.131
<v Speaker 4>if you have it still up on your website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first thing you should say is this </v>

1087
00:44:58.131 --> 00:45:01.550
<v Speaker 4>is all taken out of context and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>incorrect and it's not.</v>

1088
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.340
<v Speaker 4>It does not represent who this guy is </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you should absolutely not have those</v>

1089
00:45:05.341 --> 00:45:06.960
<v Speaker 4>writers do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1090
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:11.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you fire them or whether you </v>

1091
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.030
<v Speaker 4>assignment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows what they were asked to do.</v>

1092
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:17.060
<v Speaker 4>This is another part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was this an independent thing that they </v>

1093
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:17.550
<v Speaker 4>decided to pursue on their own?</v>

1094
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:22.790
<v Speaker 4>Did someone ask them to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was there someone who decided that this </v>

1095
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:26.871
<v Speaker 4>guy was a Nazi because maybe they tuned </v>
<v Speaker 4>in at the very moment he was doing </v>

1096
00:45:26.871 --> 00:45:26.871
<v Speaker 4>something and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make.</v>

1097
00:45:26.871 --> 00:45:29.430
<v Speaker 4>Some people obviously are very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very sensitive to that kind of stuff,</v>

1098
00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:34.431
<v Speaker 4>so I think that's why it's important,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially on an editorial team of some </v>

1099
00:45:34.431 --> 00:45:37.881
<v Speaker 4>sort to have people with with mixed </v>
<v Speaker 4>opinions because it's very easy to all </v>

1100
00:45:37.881 --> 00:45:39.450
<v Speaker 4>of a sudden get railroaded behind an </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea of just like,</v>

1101
00:45:39.451 --> 00:45:40.050
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at these.</v>

1102
00:45:40.051 --> 00:45:45.051
<v Speaker 4>Look at these seven specific things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not gonna say that it's out of </v>

1103
00:45:45.051 --> 00:45:45.051
<v Speaker 4>context,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but look at this information.</v>

1104
00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.130
<v Speaker 4>We got this guy we got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got this guy dead to rights,</v>

1105
00:45:47.131 --> 00:45:48.390
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all flimsy.</v>

1106
00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:50.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1107
00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:50.970
<v Speaker 4>context,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1108
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:56.300
<v Speaker 4>As soon as you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is part of the problem with doing </v>

1109
00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.320
<v Speaker 4>something like you do and it's certainly</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the problem with a podcast is if</v>

1110
00:45:58.321 --> 00:46:03.321
<v Speaker 4>you're talking for three hours and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>take these little snippets of those </v>

1111
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:08.511
<v Speaker 4>three hours out of context,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it paints a completely distorted </v>

1112
00:46:08.511 --> 00:46:11.601
<v Speaker 4>perception of who the person is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's also a problem with language </v>

1113
00:46:11.941 --> 00:46:12.510
<v Speaker 4>in general.</v>

1114
00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:17.880
<v Speaker 4>It really is a problem with and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly a problem with words and </v>

1115
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.730
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the problems with these </v>
<v Speaker 4>magic words like that.</v>

1116
00:46:20.731 --> 00:46:24.740
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to say anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever those words are there,</v>

1117
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:25.560
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1118
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:30.920
<v Speaker 4>you give the weight gives so much weight</v>
<v Speaker 4>to these words that just taken a loan on</v>

1119
00:46:33.421 --> 00:46:35.130
<v Speaker 4>their own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can get you in trouble.</v>

1120
00:46:35.131 --> 00:46:40.131
<v Speaker 4>Just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uttering the phrase as if it was a </v>

1121
00:46:40.131 --> 00:46:40.131
<v Speaker 4>magic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abracadabra.</v>

1122
00:46:40.131 --> 00:46:44.330
<v Speaker 4>I think it get you in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's important that we stopped </v>

1123
00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:44.340
<v Speaker 4>trying to got it rhymes and it's not on </v>
<v Speaker 4>purpose.</v>

1124
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:47.070
<v Speaker 4>We have to stop just blindly hating and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we try and educate.</v>

1125
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:52.340
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that don't blindly hate educate </v>

1126
00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:55.800
<v Speaker 4>an afterschool special star.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

1127
00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:59.640
<v Speaker 4>That sounds like straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something from the navy's skateboard.</v>

1128
00:46:59.641 --> 00:47:01.210
<v Speaker 4>You pull up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't hate hate.</v>

1129
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Educate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1130
00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:05.850
<v Speaker 1>but I mean if you want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>allies,</v>

1131
00:47:05.851 --> 00:47:07.320
<v Speaker 1>you want to talk about people meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1132
00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was.</v>

1133
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:11.100
<v Speaker 1>If you turn it into the Trans issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1134
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:16.790
<v Speaker 1>For the longest time I didn't want it </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever touch the issue because if I use </v>

1135
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:17.520
<v Speaker 1>the wrong pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the fucking devil.</v>

1136
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I was the devil and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just educate me at that time.</v>

1137
00:47:20.491 --> 00:47:25.491
<v Speaker 1>And this is years ago when at that time </v>
<v Speaker 1>I had never met anyone that was trends.</v>

1138
00:47:25.591 --> 00:47:29.720
<v Speaker 1>I was just a completely new concept to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and,</v>

1139
00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden it was just like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1140
00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

1141
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:37.480
<v Speaker 1>when I should have said she and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was the worst person in the world</v>

1142
00:47:37.481 --> 00:47:40.930
<v Speaker 1>and people want it to ruin me and ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's again,</v>

1143
00:47:40.931 --> 00:47:43.720
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really what they're doing.</v>

1144
00:47:43.721 --> 00:47:48.721
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing is trying to find a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to control you and call you a bad </v>

1145
00:47:48.721 --> 00:47:49.210
<v Speaker 1>person and be angry at you.</v>

1146
00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.960
<v Speaker 1>They could see that it was a mistake or </v>
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't a mistake,</v>

1147
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:58.290
<v Speaker 1>you just look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone was a heat for 30 fucking </v>

1148
00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:01.210
<v Speaker 1>years and they became a sheet for a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you still call him a he,</v>

1149
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1150
00:48:03.761 --> 00:48:08.761
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We knew Bruce Jenner for his entire leg </v>

1151
00:48:08.761 --> 00:48:11.550
<v Speaker 1>even saying Bruce Jenner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're not supposed to say it </v>

1152
00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:14.221
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go and look at the records for </v>

1153
00:48:14.221 --> 00:48:14.221
<v Speaker 1>the fucking Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says Caitlyn Jenner now.</v>

1154
00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1155
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.300
<v Speaker 1>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>

1156
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1157
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:18.860
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one second.</v>

1158
00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm go then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it's true.</v>

1159
00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so,</v>

1160
00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:22.600
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1161
00:48:22.601 --> 00:48:23.140
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1162
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:25.270
<v Speaker 1>so I think that's what pushed so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people away.</v>

1163
00:48:25.271 --> 00:48:27.430
<v Speaker 1>And then the way that I try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I try and make,</v>

1164
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:32.700
<v Speaker 1>I try to make it so no one's the villain</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my head so that I can see where </v>

1165
00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:32.700
<v Speaker 1>they're coming from.</v>

1166
00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:32.700
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1167
00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:33.280
<v Speaker 1>maybe that person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're not.</v>

1168
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Because there are definitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional victims and cry bullies out</v>

1169
00:48:36.281 --> 00:48:41.281
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's someone that in their day </v>

1170
00:48:41.281 --> 00:48:41.281
<v Speaker 1>to day life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone says,</v>

1171
00:48:41.281 --> 00:48:42.230
<v Speaker 1>you fucking tranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they say all this hateful stuff.</v>

1172
00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:43.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1173
00:48:43.511 --> 00:48:45.130
<v Speaker 1>But then they take it out on the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1174
00:48:45.131 --> 00:48:50.131
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try and see if is this person being </v>

1175
00:48:50.131 --> 00:48:51.010
<v Speaker 1>attacked so much that then they become </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1176
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:54.070
<v Speaker 1>this accidental monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what has pushed me more towards</v>

1177
00:48:54.071 --> 00:48:55.900
<v Speaker 1>the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went before I came to California.</v>

1178
00:48:55.901 --> 00:48:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I was an ultra liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1179
00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.130
<v Speaker 1>I hope the most liberal ideas of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1180
00:49:00.131 --> 00:49:05.131
<v Speaker 1>if I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a doctor and I'm making </v>

1181
00:49:05.131 --> 00:49:05.131
<v Speaker 1>$3,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>

1182
00:49:05.131 --> 00:49:06.370
<v Speaker 1>I should give 70 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fucking crazy.</v>

1183
00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:11.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were thinking that because you </v>

1184
00:49:11.371 --> 00:49:11.371
<v Speaker 1>weren't a doctor because I had no </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking money.</v>

1185
00:49:11.371 --> 00:49:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Fucking money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor people always think like that.</v>

1186
00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:16.940
<v Speaker 1>You want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to slowly come to the center </v>

1187
00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:16.940
<v Speaker 1>and fucking start a business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1188
00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:21.810
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so and then being around people </v>

1189
00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:24.001
<v Speaker 1>everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 100 percent because you see the </v>

1190
00:49:24.001 --> 00:49:24.940
<v Speaker 1>problems with many of the arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1191
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:29.950
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think also part of the reason I was </v>

1192
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.950
<v Speaker 1>ultra liberal is there's definitely as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going up a counterculture thing,</v>

1193
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:33.160
<v Speaker 1>and I grew up in the south so it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like everyone's wrong.</v>

1194
00:49:33.161 --> 00:49:36.760
<v Speaker 1>And I'm in North Carolina for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida for a bit.</v>

1195
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:38.770
<v Speaker 1>What part of North Carolina?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asheville.</v>

1196
00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like the hip hop part that's is </v>

1197
00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:44.030
<v Speaker 1>left is a gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1198
00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:45.050
<v Speaker 1>But then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

1199
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.440
<v Speaker 1>you go around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start going out and like,</v>

1200
00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:49.690
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just walk straight and you're eventually</v>

1201
00:49:49.691 --> 00:49:51.810
<v Speaker 1>going to run into a burning cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1202
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:55.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like people in hacky sack and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate the writer of the quarter.</v>

1203
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.520
<v Speaker 1>It's an awesome city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

1204
00:49:57.530 --> 00:50:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I guess you'd call it town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really too small for a city,</v>

1205
00:50:00.341 --> 00:50:03.640
<v Speaker 1>but I played Asheville a few years back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get back there.</v>

1206
00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:08.970
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you can go to the fuck was at the </v>

1207
00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:08.970
<v Speaker 1>biltmore house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go really small chairs.</v>

1208
00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.840
<v Speaker 1>What does that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like this giant,</v>

1209
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.820
<v Speaker 1>giant comp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the history of it,</v>

1210
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:14.830
<v Speaker 1>but when I went there I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

1211
00:50:14.831 --> 00:50:17.530
<v Speaker 1>So people used to be like really short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>

1212
00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:20.200
<v Speaker 1>They really tiny chairs because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how people were back then.</v>

1213
00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Speaker 1>They were just smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shorter people didn't have any food.</v>

1214
00:50:22.361 --> 00:50:27.361
<v Speaker 1>Man Nourished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go back there and give those </v>

1215
00:50:27.361 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>fuckers some God damn American brief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget</v>

1216
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.460
<v Speaker 3>who I was</v>

1217
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.620
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was blown away.</v>

1218
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 1>I also had the same belief that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>just died when they were 30.</v>

1219
00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was Chris Ryan,</v>

1220
00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.370
<v Speaker 3>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking.</v>

1221
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Infant mortality fucks up the numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the thing.</v>

1222
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:44.250
<v Speaker 3>It's got to make sure people know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's infallible.</v>

1223
00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:45.720
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone can be wrong.</v>

1224
00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those numbers that gets </v>

1225
00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:51.150
<v Speaker 3>incorrectly used.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the gender wage gap.</v>

1226
00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.580
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of another similar number that</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets incorrectly used.</v>

1227
00:50:53.581 --> 00:50:56.670
<v Speaker 3>People say like women make eighty cents </v>
<v Speaker 3>to every dollar a man makes.</v>

1228
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do overall,</v>

1229
00:50:59.581 --> 00:51:04.581
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the same jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like the woman is a doctor and </v>

1230
00:51:04.581 --> 00:51:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Amanda doctor man makes a dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The woman who makes eighty cents.</v>

1231
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:09.270
<v Speaker 3>Now it's like the woman is a nurse and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the man is a fucking coal miner.</v>

1232
00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.230
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1233
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:16.520
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one thing I'd have to dive deep </v>

1234
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:16.520
<v Speaker 3>and educate myself on because I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1235
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.250
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounds legit,</v>

1236
00:51:17.251 --> 00:51:18.290
<v Speaker 3>but I have to check myself.</v>

1237
00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.010
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird one too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

1238
00:51:20.011 --> 00:51:23.400
<v Speaker 3>US Olympic Committee will update Bruce </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jenner's hall of fame plaque to say,</v>

1239
00:51:23.401 --> 00:51:26.900
<v Speaker 3>Caitlin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a headline this morning once I saw</v>

1240
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:29.040
<v Speaker 3>a headline this morning that said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Caitlyn.</v>

1241
00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Caitlyn said something that like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>presidencies ridiculous.</v>

1242
00:51:32.221 --> 00:51:33.540
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do we care?</v>

1243
00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:35.910
<v Speaker 3>We care more on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a fucking moron.</v>

1244
00:51:35.911 --> 00:51:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Why do we care what celebrities?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how about this?</v>

1245
00:51:38.071 --> 00:51:41.450
<v Speaker 3>Caitlyn Jenner doesn't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking gay marriage issue.</v>

1246
00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:43.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gay Marriage.</v>

1247
00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm more of a traditional worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what she said.</v>

1248
00:51:47.491 --> 00:51:49.820
<v Speaker 3>Or more of a traditional last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1249
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.080
<v Speaker 3>you definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1250
00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what traditions you're talking about,</v>

1251
00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:59.230
<v Speaker 3>but anytime any of these places get any </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these celebrities,</v>

1252
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.280
<v Speaker 3>celebrities that have an opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1253
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:04.140
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the election proof,</v>

1254
00:52:04.141 --> 00:52:09.141
<v Speaker 3>no one fucking cares.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one cares what these bucket people </v>

1255
00:52:09.141 --> 00:52:09.141
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially Caitlyn Jenner,</v>

1256
00:52:09.141 --> 00:52:13.400
<v Speaker 3>like at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get a free pass just because </v>

1257
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:13.400
<v Speaker 3>you change your gender.</v>

1258
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:17.600
<v Speaker 3>You're still judged based on the quality</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your thoughts and how you express </v>

1259
00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.910
<v Speaker 3>yourself and if you are a fucking grown </v>
<v Speaker 3>adult and you are against gay marriage,</v>

1260
00:52:20.911 --> 00:52:25.680
<v Speaker 3>but you're also transgender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your crazy and I know she's buck buckled</v>

1261
00:52:25.681 --> 00:52:28.710
<v Speaker 3>down for because of some of the pressure</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people put on it like Ellen and she</v>

1262
00:52:28.711 --> 00:52:33.711
<v Speaker 3>kind of like soft into her stance on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the bottom line is you're in your </v>

1263
00:52:33.711 --> 00:52:36.750
<v Speaker 3>fucking sixties and you don't think that</v>
<v Speaker 3>men should be able to get married.</v>

1264
00:52:36.751 --> 00:52:41.751
<v Speaker 3>If they're in love with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're out of your mind or women or </v>

1265
00:52:41.751 --> 00:52:41.880
<v Speaker 3>anybody just fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's your stupid.</v>

1266
00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:42.350
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like</v>

1267
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.550
<v Speaker 1>I feel like more and more people when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started hearing about like this,</v>

1268
00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.510
<v Speaker 1>this new kind of Republican I thought it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1269
00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:54.120
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen a lot of people will know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people have then talked </v>

1270
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:54.140
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>

1271
00:52:55.260 --> 00:53:00.260
<v Speaker 1>there's this weird thing where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you say new kind of </v>

1272
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

1273
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:04.131
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're talking about white </v>

1274
00:53:04.131 --> 00:53:04.131
<v Speaker 1>supremacist under a whole different </v>
<v Speaker 1>banner.</v>

1275
00:53:04.131 --> 00:53:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about when I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about where people that Republicans,</v>

1276
00:53:06.271 --> 00:53:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck about gay people </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting married and they're like,</v>

1277
00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Republican because,</v>

1278
00:53:11.461 --> 00:53:12.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small government,</v>

1279
00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:13.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1280
00:53:13.311 --> 00:53:13.990
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1281
00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.560
<v Speaker 1>and jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not like if gay people get married,</v>

1282
00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:17.400
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's,</v>

1283
00:53:17.401 --> 00:53:20.440
<v Speaker 1>if it's a moral issue like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find myself more liberal and I was,</v>

1284
00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:23.610
<v Speaker 1>I all of a sudden became kind of excited</v>
<v Speaker 1>about all these,</v>

1285
00:53:23.611 --> 00:53:24.960
<v Speaker 1>these new people that didn't give a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1286
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:30.440
<v Speaker 1>And that was interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when you really see a lot of </v>

1287
00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.880
<v Speaker 1>other stuff that I don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel about a lot of other stuff that you</v>

1288
00:53:32.881 --> 00:53:36.870
<v Speaker 1>don't know how I feel about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean after?</v>

1289
00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I think I had to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't beat around the bush.</v>

1290
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:39.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1291
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:44.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think how to say it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's these all these fucking </v>

1292
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:44.210
<v Speaker 1>different avenues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that um,</v>

1293
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:48.720
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll maybe consider themselves all </v>

1294
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:48.720
<v Speaker 1>right because they just love fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>trolling people.</v>

1295
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Like how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I trigger someone with some crazy</v>

1296
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:50.850
<v Speaker 1>outrageous thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1297
00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:56.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's like I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there are people then that you </v>

1298
00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:57.640
<v Speaker 1>can take it a whole different avenue </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's known that,</v>

1299
00:53:57.641 --> 00:53:58.470
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing,</v>

1300
00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:00.600
<v Speaker 1>it is now white supremacy that pepe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frog.</v>

1301
00:54:00.601 --> 00:54:02.110
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to the point where it fucking.</v>

1302
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton puts a thing on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>website where she's like,</v>

1303
00:54:04.141 --> 00:54:06.820
<v Speaker 1>this is a white supremacist symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1304
00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:08.340
<v Speaker 1>But what is the frog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember?</v>

1305
00:54:08.341 --> 00:54:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Pepe the frog get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it is 100 percent of whites</v>

1306
00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:12.900
<v Speaker 4>premise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She put that on her website.</v>

1307
00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:17.930
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was because Donald trump people </v>

1308
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:18.930
<v Speaker 4>were using that frog to troll online,</v>
<v Speaker 4>overextend.</v>

1309
00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.130
<v Speaker 4>You look like an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1310
00:54:20.131 --> 00:54:25.131
<v Speaker 4>but here's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's part of the problem when you're </v>

1311
00:54:25.131 --> 00:54:26.340
<v Speaker 4>talking about people who troll online,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go back to when you were a young liberal</v>

1312
00:54:26.341 --> 00:54:28.860
<v Speaker 4>and you thought that if I was a doctor </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was making $3,000,000</v>

1313
00:54:28.861 --> 00:54:33.861
<v Speaker 4>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course I should be given 70 percent </v>

1314
00:54:33.861 --> 00:54:33.861
<v Speaker 4>in taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have that,</v>

1315
00:54:33.861 --> 00:54:36.620
<v Speaker 4>so you're looking at the people who do </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's part of you is like,</v>

1316
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:37.800
<v Speaker 4>give it away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1317
00:54:37.801 --> 00:54:39.210
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't deserve it.</v>

1318
00:54:39.211 --> 00:54:42.750
<v Speaker 4>Give it away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That same mentality exists with trolls.</v>

1319
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:48.020
<v Speaker 4>They don't have anything going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking losers for the most </v>

1320
00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:48.020
<v Speaker 4>part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do they want to do?</v>

1321
00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:51.090
<v Speaker 4>They want to burn it all down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want the whole thing burned down.</v>

1322
00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.540
<v Speaker 4>Go trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go try.</v>

1323
00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:58.530
<v Speaker 4>I want the reason why they want to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>go tropos because they want this clearly</v>

1324
00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:03.060
<v Speaker 4>maniacal person to just throw a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>monkey wrench into the gears and watched</v>

1325
00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:06.030
<v Speaker 4>the whole system explode.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's half of what they're doing.</v>

1326
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:08.640
<v Speaker 4>They don't have a vested interest in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not.</v>

1327
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:11.550
<v Speaker 4>They're not successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not happy,</v>

1328
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.890
<v Speaker 4>they're not doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think their role is,</v>

1329
00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:15.180
<v Speaker 4>if you're talking about all trump </v>
<v Speaker 4>supporters,</v>

1330
00:55:15.181 --> 00:55:17.380
<v Speaker 4>I think part of that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not talking about all.</v>

1331
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.870
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1332
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:19.620
<v Speaker 4>Because I was talking about all trump </v>
<v Speaker 4>supporters.</v>

1333
00:55:19.621 --> 00:55:22.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those people with the green frog fucking</v>

1334
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:24.870
<v Speaker 4>with the crazy hair on their twitter </v>
<v Speaker 4>profile.</v>

1335

<v Speaker 4>a few people that I follow and I don't </v>

1339
00:55:40.311 --> 00:55:40.311

<v Speaker 4>bookmarked and I'll go to their page </v>

<v Speaker 4>are disenfranchised and very upset and </v>

<v Speaker 4>and they get to talk.</v>

1368
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:57.360
<v Speaker 4>That's a big part of what you have in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>society where people are being </v>

1369
00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:00.900
<v Speaker 4>incredibly mean at every opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When people have the opportunity to </v>

1370
00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:05.131
<v Speaker 4>troll people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you see like some of the shit that </v>

<v Speaker 4>And why do they do that?</v>

1374
00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.010
<v Speaker 4>Because they want to burn it down.</v>

1375
00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:17.540
<v Speaker 1>The one thing I think it's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part part is going to be that they want </v>

1376
00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:20.601
<v Speaker 1>to burn it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's just also there are a </v>

1377
00:57:20.601 --> 00:57:20.730
<v Speaker 1>lot of people that don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of shit that we do online having</v>

1378
00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:23.280
<v Speaker 1>potentially horrible ramifications in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the real world.</v>

1379
00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:28.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that slowly we're getting closer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that where it's all the fucking same </v>

1380
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.450
<v Speaker 1>thing and if you do some crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outlandish shit,</v>

1381
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:33.240
<v Speaker 1>you should know that a ton of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>might see it.</v>

1382
00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:37.390
<v Speaker 1>It's why it's one of my favorite things </v>
<v Speaker 1>to screenshot and and,</v>

1383
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:42.470
<v Speaker 1>and talk back to a few people that say </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid shit to me online just because </v>

1384
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:43.290
<v Speaker 1>it's like you think that you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in this tiny room,</v>

1385
00:57:43.291 --> 00:57:45.300
<v Speaker 1>but the Internet's fucking everybody in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a room.</v>

1386
00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Everyone like what you say has </v>
<v Speaker 1>ramifications.</v>

1387
00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

1388
00:57:49.441 --> 00:57:54.441
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't want to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to get to the root of the </v>

1389
00:57:54.441 --> 00:57:54.441
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1390
00:57:54.441 --> 00:57:54.441
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1391
00:57:54.441 --> 00:57:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Why would someone want to be so evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would someone want to hurt someone's</v>

1392
00:57:57.541 --> 00:58:00.030
<v Speaker 1>feelings so badly that you're mocking </v>
<v Speaker 1>his.</v>

1393
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I think there are a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fit just died.</v>

1394
00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:07.310
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking horrible emotional </v>

1395
00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:07.310
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when and why?</v>

1396
00:58:07.310 --> 00:58:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I would say separately from </v>

1397
00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.881
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking about trolling </v>

1398
00:58:13.881 --> 00:58:13.881
<v Speaker 1>liberals or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1399
00:58:13.881 --> 00:58:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I think that there are people that want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to burn the whole thing down.</v>

1400
00:58:15.931 --> 00:58:20.931
<v Speaker 1>And then I think there are some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that literally they have the mindset </v>

1401
00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:20.931
<v Speaker 1>that it's just for laughs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1402
00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:20.931
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1403
00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:21.600
<v Speaker 1>that's not him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1404
00:58:21.601 --> 00:58:26.601
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's one of those things where I </v>

1405
00:58:26.601 --> 00:58:30.890
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think was people are inherently </v>

1406
00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:32.751
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that especially if you're </v>

1407
00:58:32.751 --> 00:58:33.120
<v Speaker 1>talking about like a Patton Oswald thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's incredibly wrong and horrible,</v>

1408
00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:34.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

1409
00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:36.300
<v Speaker 1>my question becomes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I,</v>

1410
00:58:36.301 --> 00:58:37.710
<v Speaker 1>how do I talk to that person?</v>

1411
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I not a,</v>

1412
00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:42.240
<v Speaker 1>how do you talk to who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patton Oswald with trolls,</v>

1413
00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:45.810
<v Speaker 1>the trolls when you got to go back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to when the mother was raising them</v>

1414
00:58:45.811 --> 00:58:50.811
<v Speaker 1>and take them away from the Mama and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring them to a happy person and give </v>

1415
00:58:50.811 --> 00:58:52.320
<v Speaker 1>them love and lots of hugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people,</v>

1416
00:58:52.321 --> 00:58:57.321
<v Speaker 1>as long as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you don't automatically call </v>

1417
00:58:57.321 --> 00:58:57.330
<v Speaker 1>someone the villain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that you can get some people,</v>

1418
00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:59.130
<v Speaker 1>not all of them because some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

1419
00:58:59.131 --> 00:59:02.880
<v Speaker 1>they want to call them the villain when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a troll,</v>

1420
00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:05.130
<v Speaker 1>when they're evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is that what you mean?</v>

1421
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they're maybe saying something they</v>

1422
00:59:06.691 --> 00:59:11.691
<v Speaker 1>would see as evil and things when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not talking about the patent Oswald </v>

1423
00:59:11.691 --> 00:59:12.600
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you go after someone grieving</v>

1424
00:59:12.601 --> 00:59:17.601
<v Speaker 1>over their wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking horrible monster and </v>

1425
00:59:17.601 --> 00:59:20.390
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do understand that that has a real </v>

1426
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.910
<v Speaker 1>world ramifications or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're just an,</v>

1427
00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.100
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to get</v>

1428
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:23.870
<v Speaker 4>away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just a little egg,</v>

1429
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:29.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck face 69 on twitter and you can get </v>

1430
00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:30.140

<v Speaker 4>They'll ban your account,</v>

1431
00:59:30.141 --> 00:59:31.160
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ha Ha.</v>

1432
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:32.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got them.</v>

1433
00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:37.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what you're doing and trying to </v>

1434
00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:37.780
<v Speaker 4>get a reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're playing a game.</v>

1435
00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:40.631
<v Speaker 4>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're playing operation and when that </v>

1436
00:59:40.631 --> 00:59:41.470
<v Speaker 4>tweezer hits the sides and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hi,</v>

<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we have another caller.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You could have a whole movie about it.</v>

1453
01:00:11.061 --> 01:00:12.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't need to know about it.</v>

1454
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:13.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1455
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:15.170
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1456
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.300
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a new thing.</v>

1457
01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:21.590
<v Speaker 4>It's a new thing for human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This unbridled communication ability.</v>

1458
01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's going to.</v>

1459
01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be the whole like,</v>

1460
01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:27.910
<v Speaker 1>let's destroy each other war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to try and be the asshole</v>

1461
01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:31.930
<v Speaker 1>that's in the middle with with leanings </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and there that tries to go like,</v>

1462
01:00:31.931 --> 01:00:33.250
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we fucking calm down.</v>

1463
01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:38.460
<v Speaker 1>That's not the best thing for my career </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I would have a far larger </v>

1464
01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>audience if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I pandered to just one side because I</v>

1465
01:00:41.021 --> 01:00:44.170
<v Speaker 1>alienated people daily by having left </v>
<v Speaker 1>views and then right views.</v>

1466
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:46.100
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so crazy.</v>

1467
01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:51.330
<v Speaker 4>You will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really think that your audience </v>

1468
01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:51.330
<v Speaker 4>would be bigger if you just picked a </v>
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>

1469
01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>

1470
01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>

1471
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:57.740

<v Speaker 1>Crowder is fantastic.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's one of the fair guys.</v>

1473
01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he does a great job.</v>

1474
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>You have a bigger audience in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1475
01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:04.610
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger than me.</v>

1476
01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.230
<v Speaker 4>You're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your audience is way bigger than his.</v>

1477
01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:10.750
<v Speaker 4>You have five fucking million youtube.</v>

1491
01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:47.370
<v Speaker 1>there's hypocrisy in that a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sense of every time she's </v>

1492
01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:51.131
<v Speaker 1>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she does seem like a snowflake on some </v>

1493
01:01:51.131 --> 01:01:51.131
<v Speaker 1>of the topics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but putting things,</v>

1494
01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that's for effect though</v>
<v Speaker 1>for dramatic effect because half of it </v>

1495
01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>is performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1496
01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>but that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1497
01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.971
<v Speaker 1>But it's aimed at one group of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've seen the massive rise where </v>

1498
01:02:00.971 --> 01:02:02.810
<v Speaker 1>it started as this kind of small thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It blew up.</v>

1499
01:02:02.811 --> 01:02:07.811
<v Speaker 1>Now you see her on fox news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she doesn't even need that because </v>

1500
01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:10.421
<v Speaker 1>she has a giant platforM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a good move for her to </v>

1501
01:02:10.421 --> 01:02:10.970
<v Speaker 1>be on fox news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1502
01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a different audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is playing to one side.</v>

1503
01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I still don't think she's as big as you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1504
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So go to her.</v>

1505
01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Her,</v>

1506
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.470
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her twitter feed.</v>

1507
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 4>Find out what</v>

1508
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.260
<v Speaker 3>our twitter feed is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many she has,</v>

1509
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.450
<v Speaker 3>and then go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many twitter feed people you got?</v>

1510
01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.630
<v Speaker 3>800,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not huge on a bet shit.</v>

1511
01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:30.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually as the last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about her?</v>

1512
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Did she have to look at the engagement </v>
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>

1513
01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:34.110
<v Speaker 3>Because she mentioned you're one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys.</v>

1514
01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:36.420
<v Speaker 3>You paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't pay attention to.</v>

1515
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:37.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's no.</v>

1516
01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.280
<v Speaker 1>You don't care about the engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a sales guy and you're like,</v>

1517
01:02:40.281 --> 01:02:41.570
<v Speaker 1>he has 5 million.</v>

1518
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:43.460
<v Speaker 3>What did she got here at 6:40.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1519
01:02:43.461 --> 01:02:46.670
<v Speaker 3>you've got a beat or engagements or </v>
<v Speaker 3>engagements?</v>

1520
01:02:46.671 --> 01:02:49.010
<v Speaker 3>A little low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>how weird.</v>

1521
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's got her.</v>

1522
01:02:49.911 --> 01:02:52.340
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag final thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck off tommy.</v>

1523
01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Off of your final thoughts.</v>

1524
01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:56.440
<v Speaker 3>Get outta here.</v>

1525
01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:01.560
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying whether you </v>

1526
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:01.560
<v Speaker 1>consider it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you consider it performance art,</v>

1527
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:05.611
<v Speaker 1>whether you consider it anything and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>plays one side and it has been a very </v>

1528
01:03:05.611 --> 01:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>massive successful rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1529
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>but what I want to do for the longterm.</v>

1530
01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:12.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is not taking that into account.</v>

1531
01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.290
<v Speaker 3>Like you're saying that if you went one </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

1532
01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:18.910
<v Speaker 3>show me another guy who's gone one way </v>
<v Speaker 3>who looks like you have reasonable,</v>

1533
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.880
<v Speaker 3>normal looking fella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not a thing.</v>

1534
01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:24.280
<v Speaker 3>Some super buff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pro athlete or some,</v>

1535
01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:29.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>androgynous weirdo that people can't </v>

1536
01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:30.550
<v Speaker 3>take their eyes away from your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a regular guy</v>

1537
01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>king if you're looking at maybe like </v>
<v Speaker 1>monthly views on owned and operated </v>

1538
01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>sites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

1539
01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.750
<v Speaker 1>all the other places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1540
01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:40.010
<v Speaker 1>the young turks who I'm not really a </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1541
01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I know them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not a fan of the messaging a lot</v>

1542
01:03:43.401 --> 01:03:45.200
<v Speaker 1>of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're massive.</v>

1543
01:03:45.201 --> 01:03:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I think they get more,</v>

1544
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.630
<v Speaker 3>been around a long time doing that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1545
01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:53.170
<v Speaker 3>They get a lot of monthly views,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they also get a lot of hate,</v>

1546
01:03:53.171 --> 01:03:58.171
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that hate watch </v>

1547
01:03:58.171 --> 01:03:58.800
<v Speaker 3>jank comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>

1548
01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.940
<v Speaker 3>They go after him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He should have.</v>

1549
01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.760
<v Speaker 3>He should watch youtube for like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>binder.</v>

1550
01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:13.090
<v Speaker 3>We could only look at the video shit on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can't read the comments at all.</v>

1551
01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.090
<v Speaker 3>Hire someone that only reads the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comments,</v>

1552
01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:19.030
<v Speaker 3>don't read them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't even engaged.</v>

1553
01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.170
<v Speaker 3>Stay away.</v>

1554
01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>That I liked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the conversations on mine </v>

1555
01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have people that are,</v>

1556
01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:28.830
<v Speaker 1>that are really passionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there are a lot of threads </v>

1557
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:28.830
<v Speaker 1>where it's like people having </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations that didn't work normally</v>

1558
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:30.130
<v Speaker 3>agree with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While I'm saying this,</v>

1559
01:04:30.131 --> 01:04:35.131
<v Speaker 3>the whole reason why I said in the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>place is more of a compliment than </v>

1560
01:04:35.131 --> 01:04:37.681
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a great thing that you're </v>

1561
01:04:37.681 --> 01:04:37.681
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1562
01:04:37.681 --> 01:04:41.220
<v Speaker 3>here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way you handled the milo </v>

1563
01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.070
<v Speaker 3>yiannopoulos thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're very fair and I think.</v>

1564
01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it's great that you're neither </v>
<v Speaker 3>left nor right,</v>

1565
01:04:45.251 --> 01:04:47.320
<v Speaker 3>but rather reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1566
01:04:47.321 --> 01:04:50.230
<v Speaker 3>you're reasonable and considered and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that's one of your strengths.</v>

1567
01:04:50.231 --> 01:04:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you would have a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience if you just went all right.</v>

1568
01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.050
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd be a big old phony and </v>
<v Speaker 3>less less.</v>

1569
01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:00.360
<v Speaker 3>You became felina and then then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1570
01:05:00.361 --> 01:05:05.361
<v Speaker 3>you got some tits and put on a nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>little dress and then you could wear </v>

1571
01:05:05.361 --> 01:05:07.390
<v Speaker 3>like a sleeveless shirts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1572
01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:08.920
<v Speaker 3>because right now if you wear sleeveless</v>
<v Speaker 3>shirts,</v>

1573
01:05:08.921 --> 01:05:10.930
<v Speaker 3>you're a douche bag because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>male,</v>

1574
01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:14.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If You're a man and you show your arms,</v>

1575
01:05:14.231 --> 01:05:15.010
<v Speaker 3>you're a piece of shit,</v>

1576
01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:17.530
<v Speaker 1>so I got to start going to the gym </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I no one wants to see that.</v>

1577
01:05:17.531 --> 01:05:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

1578
01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:23.240
<v Speaker 4>they would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they'd be lIke lena dunham type </v>

1579
01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:23.240
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even bigger.</v>

1580
01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:23.330
<v Speaker 4>So if you're going to go and become a </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>

1581
01:05:23.331 --> 01:05:26.300
<v Speaker 4>you either become a hot woman or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking sloppy one.</v>

1582
01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:30.260
<v Speaker 4>A really sloppy one who celebrates food </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is who I am.</v>

1583
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:31.670
<v Speaker 4>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or leave it.</v>

1584
01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:33.530
<v Speaker 4>Fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find that finally</v>

1585
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:37.250
<v Speaker 1>the lena dunham's end up doing more </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage to their cars then then good.</v>

1586
01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:42.420
<v Speaker 4>Or she has 100 million twitter followers</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's got food stuck in our teeth </v>

1587
01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:42.990
<v Speaker 4>and no one gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big old fuck.</v>

1588
01:05:42.991 --> 01:05:46.750
<v Speaker 4>Fucking sloppy arms like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a 300 pound man's legs.</v>

1589
01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:48.910
<v Speaker 4>This is nothing wrong with it.</v>

01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:51.460
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a while ago.</v>

1607
01:06:33.191 --> 01:06:38.191
<v Speaker 1>She sat at the same table and she wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole post about how he looked at </v>

1608
01:06:38.191 --> 01:06:39.580
<v Speaker 1>her like she was a piece of garbage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

1609
01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:40.870
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

1610
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:45.040
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to be humorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you say the humorous thing?</v>

1611
01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because I think she,</v>

1612
01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.160
<v Speaker 1>because she wrote this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then apology where she was like,</v>

1613
01:06:48.161 --> 01:06:50.090
<v Speaker 1>it was all in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1614
01:06:50.091 --> 01:06:50.340
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1615
01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:55.490
<v Speaker 4>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you try to not mention her as much </v>

1616
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:56.050
<v Speaker 4>as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it happens so often.</v>

1617
01:06:56.450 --> 01:07:01.450
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the weirdest thing was how she was </v>

1618
01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:01.450
<v Speaker 4>giving a free pass for sexually </v>
<v Speaker 4>assaulting her young</v>

1619
01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>cisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weird like shoving things up her </v>

1620
01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>vagina when she was little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1621
01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:06.840
<v Speaker 1>what will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where,</v>

1622
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:09.410
<v Speaker 1>that's where when you say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm reasonable with the milo thing,</v>

1623
01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:14.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to take into context </v>

1624
01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:14.490
<v Speaker 1>other other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1625
01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a hit job,</v>

1626
01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:19.061
<v Speaker 1>but also what you said earlier where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are human beings and like let's </v>

1627
01:07:19.061 --> 01:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>talk it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So milo said some,</v>

1628
01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.820
<v Speaker 1>some things that even he said he </v>
<v Speaker 1>apologized for others,</v>

1629
01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:27.020
<v Speaker 1>he said was misconstrued but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's.</v>

1630
01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:30.500
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the george decay thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is different but still the same</v>

1631
01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:36.360
<v Speaker 4>two k thing you have to explain to </v>
<v Speaker 4>people because most people have no idea </v>

1632
01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:36.360
<v Speaker 4>what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So sorry.</v>

1633
01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is a problem for me.</v>

1634
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.840
<v Speaker 4>I have conversations in my head that </v>
<v Speaker 4>then I,</v>

1635
01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.050
<v Speaker 4>other words here are just so entrenched </v>
<v Speaker 4>with media.</v>

1636
01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.680
<v Speaker 4>So much shit coming into your head </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyday.</v>

1637
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:46.850
<v Speaker 4>The assume everybody else is watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same video.</v>

1638
01:07:46.851 --> 01:07:48.410
<v Speaker 4>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're actually living their lives.</v>

1639
01:07:48.411 --> 01:07:53.411
<v Speaker 4>so they went on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did a hit piece on george decay </v>

1640
01:07:53.411 --> 01:07:53.510
<v Speaker 4>essentially to sort of show that george </v>
<v Speaker 4>takei.</v>

1641
01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:59.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was talking about his own personal </v>

1642
01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:01.031
<v Speaker 4>experiences when he was very young with </v>
<v Speaker 4>a camp counselor who did some sexually </v>

1643
01:08:01.031 --> 01:08:04.751
<v Speaker 4>inappropriate things to him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was talking about them in a very </v>

1644
01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:07.211
<v Speaker 4>positive way that he enjoyed it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people are saying george decay is </v>

1645
01:08:07.211 --> 01:08:08.930
<v Speaker 4>promoting sex amongst 13 year olds as </v>
<v Speaker 4>being okay.</v>

1646
01:08:09.110 --> 01:08:14.110
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's talking about his own personal </v>

1647
01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:14.110
<v Speaker 4>experience and being honest about it.</v>

1648
01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the way that ends up becoming a</v>

1649
01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:19.061
<v Speaker 1>comparison is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it ends up being this weird </v>

1650
01:08:19.061 --> 01:08:21.440
<v Speaker 1>argument of numbers of lines in the sand</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he said,</v>

1651
01:08:21.441 --> 01:08:24.320
<v Speaker 1>I said 13 because that's when I had my </v>
<v Speaker 1>first experience.</v>

1652
01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Then we talked about the the age of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh god,</v>

1653
01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talked about the age of 14,</v>

1654
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.790
<v Speaker 1>which was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you were.</v>

1655
01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:35.370
<v Speaker 1>So that was a conversation he had with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you with the situation.</v>

1656
01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people were pointing out that </v>

1657
01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.821
<v Speaker 1>it's his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His mindset changed and my argument </v>

1658
01:08:42.821 --> 01:08:42.821
<v Speaker 1>there was what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

1659
01:08:42.821 --> 01:08:44.870
<v Speaker 1>even if he at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at any point before,</v>

1660
01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:48.170
<v Speaker 1>before he acknowledged it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to me it sounded like he was a victim</v>

1661
01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:53.980
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then that creates the argument too </v>

1662
01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:55.250
<v Speaker 1>of if someone's a victim early in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that excuse later on?</v>

1663
01:08:55.250 --> 01:09:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not making the argument that </v>
<v Speaker 1>milo then went on to do and became a </v>

1664
01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:01.630
<v Speaker 1>sandusky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1665
01:09:01.631 --> 01:09:06.631
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was having a conversation and it's </v>

1666
01:09:06.631 --> 01:09:06.631
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at what point do we excuse things?</v>

1667
01:09:06.631 --> 01:09:11.291
<v Speaker 1>And that's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a conversation I'd like to have </v>

1668
01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:11.291
<v Speaker 1>where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not damning.</v>

1669
01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:14.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go in on a victim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also at the same time I'm going,</v>

1670
01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:19.560
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking weird to me and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely wrong if you have an </v>

1671
01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:20.420
<v Speaker 1>adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try and fuck a 13 year old.</v>

1672
01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I think that's completely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just when you feel like you always </v>

1673
01:09:25.690 --> 01:09:25.730
<v Speaker 1>have to put people in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>

1674
01:09:25.731 --> 01:09:26.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1675
01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.150
<v Speaker 1>in their shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where if I was a parent and I'm dropping</v>

1676
01:09:29.151 --> 01:09:34.151
<v Speaker 1>my kid off the fucking middle school and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find out some 25 year old is fucking </v>

1677
01:09:34.151 --> 01:09:35.030
<v Speaker 1>my son that's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to jail,</v>

1678
01:09:35.031 --> 01:09:36.680
<v Speaker 1>but that's gonna be a fucking dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

1679
01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:42.160
<v Speaker 1>A dead person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent that someone's </v>

1680
01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:42.160
<v Speaker 1>molesting my child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1681
01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>

1682
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:44.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1683
01:09:44.530 --> 01:09:47.360
<v Speaker 4>I completely feel you and I understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying.</v>

1684
01:09:47.690 --> 01:09:52.690
<v Speaker 4>I think with the milo situation is very </v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre because I think there is </v>

1685
01:09:53.061 --> 01:09:56.630
<v Speaker 4>irreparable damage done to people when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're molested as children and I think</v>

1686
01:09:56.631 --> 01:10:00.530
<v Speaker 4>milo has been really clear about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that he was molested and he's tried</v>

1687
01:10:00.531 --> 01:10:04.310
<v Speaker 4>to paint it in a positive light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he tries to paint a lot of fucked up</v>

1688
01:10:04.311 --> 01:10:09.311
<v Speaker 4>things in a positive light and it could </v>
<v Speaker 4>easily be his rationalizing and trying </v>

1689
01:10:09.311 --> 01:10:10.830
<v Speaker 4>to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one wants to be a victim in their own</v>

1690
01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.190
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Made it a positive thing.</v>

1691
01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Control it was him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1692
01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:16.350
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

1693
01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:19.290
<v Speaker 1>let's think of it in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather than going,</v>

1694
01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.720
<v Speaker 1>he's against me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just destroy him.</v>

1695
01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the besides outlandish thing</v>

1696
01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.480
<v Speaker 4>that milo does that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1697
01:10:25.481 --> 01:10:30.481
<v Speaker 4>he's a merchant of outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's his business and when people get </v>

1698
01:10:30.481 --> 01:10:34.351
<v Speaker 4>outraged back at him and if somehow </v>
<v Speaker 4>another sticks like this pedophile </v>

1699
01:10:34.351 --> 01:10:36.160
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't be upset.</v>

1700
01:10:36.161 --> 01:10:37.960
<v Speaker 4>This is the game that you just started </v>
<v Speaker 4>to play.</v>

1701
01:10:37.961 --> 01:10:40.860
<v Speaker 4>If you get knocked the fuck out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know if your bike tyson and all of a</v>

1702
01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:43.300
<v Speaker 4>sudden you get knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are we supposed to feel bad for you?</v>

1703
01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.280
<v Speaker 4>You've been knocking people out your </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole career.</v>

1704
01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:47.800
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a merchant of outrage.</v>

1705
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:50.890
<v Speaker 4>If it's valid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the outrage is valid and I think it's</v>

1706
01:10:50.891 --> 01:10:55.891
<v Speaker 4>valid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that what they're saying about </v>

1707
01:10:55.891 --> 01:10:58.801
<v Speaker 4>what he was saying is absolutely valid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he says that there can be incredibly </v>

1708
01:10:58.801 --> 01:11:03.451
<v Speaker 4>positive relationships between very </v>
<v Speaker 4>young men and our young boys rather an </v>

1709
01:11:03.451 --> 01:11:06.130
<v Speaker 4>older gay men and that this could keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>men from suicide,</v>

1710
01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.920
<v Speaker 4>hit the brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop.</v>

1711
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking illegal for a reason and </v>

1712
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:17.371
<v Speaker 4>you could potentially be encouraging </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone whose fence sitting right now </v>

1713
01:11:17.371 --> 01:11:22.161
<v Speaker 4>thinking about fucking kids to hop right</v>
<v Speaker 4>over to the other side and start doing </v>

1714
01:11:22.161 --> 01:11:23.700
<v Speaker 4>it because it was positive for my low.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does because it was beneficial.</v>

1715
01:11:23.701 --> 01:11:24.840
<v Speaker 4>It is the conversation</v>

1716
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:28.320
<v Speaker 1>also to that extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might be someone that is 13 that's</v>

1717
01:11:28.321 --> 01:11:30.360
<v Speaker 1>being abused that all of a sudden it </v>
<v Speaker 1>feels like that's normal.</v>

1718
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1719
01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.660
<v Speaker 1>but let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about it.</v>

1720
01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:35.220
<v Speaker 1>I 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't agree with the words.</v>

1721
01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:40.370
<v Speaker 1>It is a tricky situation because you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about someone that was a victim </v>

1722
01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:43.430
<v Speaker 1>of a heinous crime and then just talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about talking about it and going from </v>

1723
01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:44.430
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1724
01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:47.000
<v Speaker 4>But it's also he said that he was gay at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

1725
01:11:47.001 --> 01:11:52.001
<v Speaker 4>He knew he was gay and he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sexual predator in every situation </v>

1726
01:11:52.001 --> 01:11:52.580
<v Speaker 4>has its own variables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1727
01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:57.470
<v Speaker 4>And in his look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's clearly a damaged guy.</v>

1728
01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.760
<v Speaker 4>OkAy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I liked him.</v>

1729
01:11:58.850 --> 01:12:02.510
<v Speaker 4>He's clearly a damaged guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the way he lashes out and the way he</v>

1730
01:12:02.511 --> 01:12:07.040
<v Speaker 4>gets attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like the left's reaction to him.</v>

1731
01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:10.190
<v Speaker 4>I like that far less than.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like what he's saying.</v>

1732
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:14.420
<v Speaker 4>I feel like with a guy like milo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not doing any real violent things.</v>

1733
01:12:14.421 --> 01:12:19.421
<v Speaker 4>He's not doing any real damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what you should do is confront him </v>

1734
01:12:19.421 --> 01:12:19.421
<v Speaker 4>with words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bait him,</v>

1735
01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:24.410
<v Speaker 4>pick apart his arguments about feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about transgender people,</v>

1736
01:12:24.411 --> 01:12:29.411
<v Speaker 4>about gay rights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's got some crazy writes </v>

1737
01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:31.751
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got some crazy thoughts about gay </v>

1738
01:12:31.751 --> 01:12:33.431
<v Speaker 4>people and he's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks that it's a choice and he </v>

1739
01:12:33.431 --> 01:12:33.431
<v Speaker 4>thinks that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's offensive.</v>

1740
01:12:33.431 --> 01:12:35.420
<v Speaker 4>And if he could have a pill to not be </v>
<v Speaker 4>gay,</v>

1741
01:12:35.421 --> 01:12:37.580
<v Speaker 4>you would take it in a heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like he said,</v>

1742
01:12:37.581 --> 01:12:38.540
<v Speaker 4>all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

1743
01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.830
<v Speaker 1>What do you have someone like milo or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else?</v>

1744
01:12:40.831 --> 01:12:43.380
<v Speaker 1>The number one thing shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me silence that person.</v>

1745
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's just going to one,</v>

1746
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.470
<v Speaker 1>bolster them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>validate them,</v>

1747
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:48.500
<v Speaker 1>let them talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1748
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:50.320
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see situations like,</v>

1749
01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:52.950
<v Speaker 1>like berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I did see,</v>

1750
01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I had people that sent me videos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like,</v>

1751
01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.200
<v Speaker 1>there was a protest in the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was just people being outspoken </v>

1752
01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:03.141
<v Speaker 1>and there's a fucking crazy chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People I know that you've talked about </v>

1753
01:13:03.141 --> 01:13:06.471
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like the people getting sprayed in </v>

1754
01:13:06.471 --> 01:13:06.471
<v Speaker 1>the face with fucking pepper spray </v>
<v Speaker 1>people beaten in the streets.</v>

1755
01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate those people.</v>

1756
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:09.930
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I really,</v>

1757
01:13:09.931 --> 01:13:13.050
<v Speaker 1>really hate is the people that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>

1758
01:13:13.051 --> 01:13:13.950
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1759
01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:16.680
<v Speaker 1>that's what we should be doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't doing like,</v>

1760
01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:19.020
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think this is a positive.</v>

1761
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.220
<v Speaker 1>You think this bolsters your argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that we're going to go against what</v>

1762
01:13:23.221 --> 01:13:26.520
<v Speaker 1>we don't agree them that they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>with fucking violence.</v>

1763
01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.440
<v Speaker 1>You think that makes you the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1764
01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:29.900
<v Speaker 1>It straight up and saying,</v>

1765
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:31.290
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also the.</v>

1766
01:13:31.291 --> 01:13:34.950
<v Speaker 4>They put these blanket labels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a nazi.</v>

1767
01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:37.230
<v Speaker 4>He promotes genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1768
01:13:37.231 --> 01:13:40.800
<v Speaker 4>they say all these things and they say </v>
<v Speaker 4>these things so that they can attack.</v>

1769
01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:41.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a whole.</v>

1770
01:13:41.691 --> 01:13:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole.</v>

1771
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:47.210
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascist nazi movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After Richard Spencer got punched in the</v>

1772
01:13:47.211 --> 01:13:48.680
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which once again,</v>

1773
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:50.150
<v Speaker 1>who's Richard Spencer or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1774
01:13:50.151 --> 01:13:50.390
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

1775
01:13:50.391 --> 01:13:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Am I getting the name wrong now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy that will double check.</v>

1776
01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've.</v>

1777
01:13:55.820 --> 01:14:00.550
<v Speaker 1>You've made me doubt myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's part of a two,</v>

1778
01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:00.790
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

1779
01:14:00.791 --> 01:14:01.000
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

1780
01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:01.910
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be right.</v>

1781
01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know who it is.</v>

1782
01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always.</v>

1783
01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 1>You always see his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just got booted out of c pack for my </v>

1784
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's.</v>

1785
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Speaker 1>He talks</v>

1786
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:14.970
<v Speaker 3>about just look them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to.</v>

1787
01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.500
<v Speaker 3>I imagine you aren't going to be a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people were like,</v>

1788
01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:20.320
<v Speaker 3>he's a literal nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to punch these people that people</v>

1789
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:24.490
<v Speaker 3>like overjoyed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he really is a nazi people just happy</v>

1790
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.230
<v Speaker 3>supremacist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy,</v>

1791
01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to label this guy on it.</v>

1792
01:14:28.781 --> 01:14:33.781
<v Speaker 3>I think that you would call himself a </v>
<v Speaker 3>white nationalist or anything like that </v>

1793
01:14:33.781 --> 01:14:35.830
<v Speaker 3>on the website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1794
01:14:35.831 --> 01:14:38.550
<v Speaker 3>he's neo nazi nazi everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he calls himself that.</v>

1795
01:14:38.551 --> 01:14:39.280
<v Speaker 3>I'll double check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1796
01:14:39.281 --> 01:14:40.180
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>

1797
01:14:40.181 --> 01:14:42.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to slam a label on someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then do that thing.</v>

1798
01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:44.710
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's hard,</v>

1799
01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:46.480
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he got punched in the face.</v>

1800
01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Everyone fucking cheered for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is then then they move.</v>

1801
01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:50.440
<v Speaker 3>Then you move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The goalposts have,</v>

1802
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:51.580
<v Speaker 3>who's a fucking nazi.</v>

1803
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:54.190
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden cutie pies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A fucking nazi ever.</v>

1804
01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:59.200
<v Speaker 3>Ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's a nazi and we can just be </v>

1805
01:14:59.200 --> 01:14:59.200
<v Speaker 3>violent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Punch nazis.</v>

1806
01:14:59.200 --> 01:14:59.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The punch nazi thing.</v>

1807
01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:04.680
<v Speaker 3>And so the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is just debate these </v>

1808
01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:04.680
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1809
01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.040
<v Speaker 3>So like just just let them be their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>undoing if they are actually that wrong.</v>

1810
01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a.</v>

1811
01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:11.800
<v Speaker 3>Does a giant problem with groups humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>when groups of humans get together.</v>

1812
01:15:11.801 --> 01:15:15.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean that phrase mob mentality exists </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a reason.</v>

1813
01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.090
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't say mob mentality.</v>

1814
01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:17.650
<v Speaker 3>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

1815
01:15:17.651 --> 01:15:19.210
<v Speaker 3>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean philly date?</v>

1816
01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.100
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is a mob mentality?</v>

1817
01:15:21.101 --> 01:15:22.540
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people know it happens.</v>

1818
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:27.750
<v Speaker 3>Giant groups of people face something </v>
<v Speaker 3>called diffusion of responsibility and </v>

1819
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:28.420
<v Speaker 3>that means when chaotic events are going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1820
01:15:28.421 --> 01:15:33.421
<v Speaker 3>they don't take responsibility for their</v>
<v Speaker 3>own actions because they're a part of </v>

1821
01:15:33.421 --> 01:15:34.210
<v Speaker 3>this gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaotic movement and I personally,</v>

1822
01:15:34.211 --> 01:15:35.890
<v Speaker 3>and this is just totally unfounded.</v>

1823
01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:40.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely not a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he came from war and I think </v>

1824
01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:44.251
<v Speaker 3>people are used to large scale tribal </v>
<v Speaker 3>war and I think it's been going on for </v>

1825
01:15:44.251 --> 01:15:46.750
<v Speaker 3>so long and the atrocities that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>required for you to survive and war,</v>

1826
01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.840
<v Speaker 3>like battle axes and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>braveheart style.</v>

1827
01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:55.170
<v Speaker 3>I think once that breaks out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd lock into this massive mind sync </v>

1828
01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:57.970
<v Speaker 3>with all the people around you and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>

1829
01:15:57.971 --> 01:16:02.971
<v Speaker 3>Except this violent chaos and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens on campuses when people </v>

1830
01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.350
<v Speaker 3>burn it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>burn it down,</v>

1831
01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:08.970
<v Speaker 3>that is the same mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>EveryoNe is involved in this,</v>

1832
01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:14.490
<v Speaker 3>this hurricane of chaos and you just get</v>
<v Speaker 3>swept up in this mob mentality and it's </v>

1833
01:16:15.131 --> 01:16:16.790
<v Speaker 3>a really dangerous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1834
01:16:16.791 --> 01:16:21.791
<v Speaker 3>like I'm sure you saw the girl that got </v>
<v Speaker 3>maced in the Face that had the matan </v>

1835
01:16:21.791 --> 01:16:22.960
<v Speaker 3>bitcoin great again hat and he hit her </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the head with a stick.</v>

1836
01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.150
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck are you doing?</v>

1837
01:16:25.151 --> 01:16:26.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think that's okay,</v>

1838
01:16:26.051 --> 01:16:28.870
<v Speaker 3>I think you're in the wrong 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a girl.</v>

1839
01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:32.380
<v Speaker 3>Just a girl nonviolent non non non </v>
<v Speaker 3>motion.</v>

1840
01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.970
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was stationary.</v>

1841
01:16:34.230 --> 01:16:39.230
<v Speaker 3>She's not threatening whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you listen to the audio </v>

1842
01:16:39.230 --> 01:16:39.230
<v Speaker 3>before all of it happens outside of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>clip,</v>

1843
01:16:39.230 --> 01:16:40.300
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's literally saying,</v>

1844
01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:45.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually surprised things are pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>calm here because sometimes things go </v>

1845
01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:48.190
<v Speaker 3>out of hand and then 20 seconds later </v>
<v Speaker 3>pepper spray to the face,</v>

1846
01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:52.360
<v Speaker 3>they just decided that her hat was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>trump hat and so they just blasted her.</v>

1847
01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.040
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even a trump hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1848
01:16:54.041 --> 01:16:59.041
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had the right font so she had to get </v>

1849
01:16:59.041 --> 01:17:02.520
<v Speaker 3>punished and that's so I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the big thing of understanding </v>

1850
01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.420
<v Speaker 3>whether it'd be a 60 year old maN that </v>
<v Speaker 3>did it to her too,</v>

1851
01:17:03.421 --> 01:17:05.210
<v Speaker 3>or she don't know that something insane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know that.</v>

1852
01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.890
<v Speaker 3>Find out that because someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone told me that,</v>

1853
01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 3>that it was a 60 year old man that</v>

1854
01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.740
<v Speaker 1>a pepper sprayed her in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1855
01:17:11.741 --> 01:17:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of severity,</v>

1856
01:17:14.061 --> 01:17:16.120
<v Speaker 1>but there are people on both sides and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1857
01:17:16.121 --> 01:17:21.121
<v Speaker 1>it's important to acknowledge that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that want to burn the whole fucking </v>

1858
01:17:21.121 --> 01:17:24.341
<v Speaker 1>thing down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it be a person or an argument </v>

1859
01:17:24.341 --> 01:17:24.920
<v Speaker 1>for your 60 year old man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still a fucking loser and there's</v>

1860
01:17:24.921 --> 01:17:27.110
<v Speaker 1>a pretty girl in front of you and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1861
01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:30.550
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was young.</v>

1862
01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1863
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous,</v>

1864
01:17:36.471 --> 01:17:37.300
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1865
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:42.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very much of the belief that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have rather than more and more people </v>

1866
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:46.721
<v Speaker 1>are putting in talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>generalities where it's the left versus </v>

1867
01:17:46.721 --> 01:17:46.721
<v Speaker 1>the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a lot of the conversation,</v>

1868
01:17:46.721 --> 01:17:48.230
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the stories end up being about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1869
01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:53.231
<v Speaker 1>these far left and far right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that are like fucking pack </v>

1870
01:17:53.231 --> 01:17:56.171
<v Speaker 1>manning their way to the middle and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly absorbing more and more people </v>

1871
01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:56.450
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into their opinion.</v>

1872
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:59.480
<v Speaker 1>And what's scary is if they ever do get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the center,</v>

1873
01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.360
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it does become all of us in a,</v>

1874
01:18:02.361 --> 01:18:06.110
<v Speaker 1>an us versus them on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot closer to that in real life.</v>

1875
01:18:06.111 --> 01:18:08.440
<v Speaker 1>so how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so after the.</v>

1876
01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:13.540
<v Speaker 1>After the election,</v>

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:29.210
<v Speaker 1>was telling me about his office where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>works at.</v>

1907
01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:32.090
<v Speaker 1>One of the women at the office was </v>
<v Speaker 1>openly weeping.</v>

1908
01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like a,</v>

1909
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:35.510
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

1910
01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Can't do that here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a place for that.</v>

1911
01:19:38.991 --> 01:19:42.830
<v Speaker 1>This is a week free zone who can't weep </v>
<v Speaker 1>over democracy.</v>

1912
01:19:42.831 --> 01:19:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Not going your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for a lot of.</v>

1913
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:47.450
<v Speaker 1>For a lot of liberals I knew it was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a national day of mourning.</v>

1914
01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then for,</v>

1915
01:19:48.681 --> 01:19:50.620
<v Speaker 1>for everyone else that voted for him </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1916
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:53.060
<v Speaker 1>it was the day that will always </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>

1917
01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:58.150
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that were super </v>

1918
01:19:58.150 --> 01:19:58.150
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

1919
01:19:58.150 --> 01:19:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like everyone was was either like</v>

1920
01:19:58.551 --> 01:20:03.551
<v Speaker 1>burning bridges or coming out to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friends in a way of like friends and </v>

1921
01:20:03.551 --> 01:20:06.020
<v Speaker 1>family as trump supporters because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are a lot of people that were scared.</v>

1922
01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think</v>

1923
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:13.100
<v Speaker 4>that he represents a lot of very </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous things and he in a lot of </v>

1924
01:20:13.231 --> 01:20:16.470
<v Speaker 4>people's eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the death of responsibility.</v>

1925
01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:21.620
<v Speaker 4>He can get away with more things and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then also these all the different </v>

1926
01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:26.300
<v Speaker 4>business ties and different </v>
<v Speaker 4>entanglements and all the different </v>

1927
01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:29.871
<v Speaker 4>things and and also just the way he </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicates that like people don't feel</v>

1928
01:20:30.781 --> 01:20:35.781
<v Speaker 4>like it's statesmen lee and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not representative of what they </v>

1929
01:20:35.781 --> 01:20:37.860
<v Speaker 4>would like to think of as someone who is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the president of the United States.</v>

1930
01:20:37.861 --> 01:20:41.430
<v Speaker 4>They want to think about someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredibly noble and well spoken and the</v>

1931
01:20:41.431 --> 01:20:43.650
<v Speaker 4>best representative that we can have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1932
01:20:43.651 --> 01:20:46.380
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forget about obama's policies.</v>

1933
01:20:46.381 --> 01:20:49.110
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just forget just him as a human being,</v>

1934
01:20:49.111 --> 01:20:54.111
<v Speaker 4>standing in front of that podium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking as the president was a joy in </v>

1935
01:20:54.111 --> 01:20:57.870
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was very measured and very calm and I</v>

1936
01:20:57.871 --> 01:21:02.871
<v Speaker 4>think that he is also very articulate </v>
<v Speaker 4>and very well educated in that thing </v>

1937
01:21:03.181 --> 01:21:05.820
<v Speaker 4>that he represented when he was up there</v>
<v Speaker 4>at that thing.</v>

1938
01:21:05.821 --> 01:21:09.030
<v Speaker 4>The president don,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that figurehead that he represented,</v>

1939
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:14.390
<v Speaker 4>he did such an amazing job of </v>
<v Speaker 4>representing that because he was </v>

1940
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.820
<v Speaker 4>exceptioNal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an exceptional man.</v>

1941
01:21:14.821 --> 01:21:18.000
<v Speaker 4>He's exceptionally smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's exceptionally well read.</v>

1942
01:21:18.001 --> 01:21:23.001
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way he communicates is smooth and </v>

1943
01:21:23.001 --> 01:21:24.660
<v Speaker 4>even the way he's responded to criticism</v>
<v Speaker 4>was very well measured,</v>

1944
01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:25.410
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

1945
01:21:25.411 --> 01:21:30.411
<v Speaker 4>I though he did fuck up when he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>joking aRound about trump back in the </v>

1946
01:21:30.411 --> 01:21:30.411
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1947
01:21:30.411 --> 01:21:33.420
<v Speaker 4>like he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we was joking about trump's criticism of</v>

1948
01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:34.620
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1949
01:21:34.621 --> 01:21:39.621
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm one thing that you'll never be the </v>

1950
01:21:39.621 --> 01:21:39.621
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>

1951
01:21:39.621 --> 01:21:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I agree.</v>

1952
01:21:40.361 --> 01:21:43.690
<v Speaker 1>I agree with what you said about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's going to be one of the most</v>

1953
01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:45.760
<v Speaker 1>well spoken presidents of my lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1954
01:21:45.761 --> 01:21:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Well received.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after the fact,</v>

1955
01:21:47.861 --> 01:21:49.600
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that and go,</v>

1956
01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:51.790
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was all phony.</v>

1957
01:21:51.970 --> 01:21:55.180
<v Speaker 1>It was all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all an act from trump.</v>

1958
01:21:55.270 --> 01:22:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Trump may speak six syllables at a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and break and then go on tangents.</v>

1959
01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1960
01:22:03.311 --> 01:22:06.920
<v Speaker 1>it's in the bubble bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the bubble of that arm brace.</v>

1961
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:08.970
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1962
01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there are people that go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1963
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:14.860
<v Speaker 1>he's not the best speaker in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's more real.</v>

1964
01:22:14.890 --> 01:22:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's gonna be that argument.</v>

1965
01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I 100 percent agree with you about obama</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as like the,</v>

1966
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:23.870
<v Speaker 1>the office and the nobility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're going to be people that say </v>

1967
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.870
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just bullshit.</v>

1968
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.870
<v Speaker 1>That's why we needed something </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

1969
01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:25.060
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1970
01:22:25.061 --> 01:22:30.061
<v Speaker 4>there's other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's other people that look at the </v>

1971
01:22:30.061 --> 01:22:32.551
<v Speaker 4>whole thing and they say this is a well </v>
<v Speaker 4>needed break from the system that,</v>

1972
01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:34.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's things,</v>

1973
01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:40.020
<v Speaker 4>a big test.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a test of our system that have been</v>

1974
01:22:41.050 --> 01:22:46.050
<v Speaker 4>controlling the system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People that were deeply entrenched in </v>

1975
01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:49.351
<v Speaker 4>the left and deeply entrenched in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ride for so long that he's the first </v>

1976
01:22:49.351 --> 01:22:52.870
<v Speaker 4>businessmen that has been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's been a participant in our system.</v>

1977
01:22:53.621 --> 01:22:58.621
<v Speaker 4>He's been essentially paying these guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>off for years and years and now here he </v>

1978
01:22:58.621 --> 01:23:00.430
<v Speaker 4>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he talked pretty openly,</v>

1979
01:23:00.431 --> 01:23:05.431
<v Speaker 4>which I thought was hilarious about </v>
<v Speaker 4>hillary and bill coming to his wedding </v>

1980
01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

1981
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.930
<v Speaker 3>that the reason why they did is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he paid them,</v>

1982
01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:09.340
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1983
01:23:09.341 --> 01:23:12.160
<v Speaker 3>he paid them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was more than $100,000</v>

1984
01:23:12.161 --> 01:23:13.810
<v Speaker 3>for them to come to his wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow.</v>

1985
01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:16.450
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just how they do things.</v>

1986
01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Do you mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think he literally paid them </v>

1987
01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:21.850
<v Speaker 3>where he gave them a donation and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>there were like donation.</v>

1988
01:23:21.851 --> 01:23:26.851
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's be real about what the clinton </v>

1989
01:23:26.851 --> 01:23:26.851
<v Speaker 3>foundation is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not it did good work.</v>

1990
01:23:26.851 --> 01:23:30.560
<v Speaker 3>It's a goddamn pay to play operation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things they got besides the </v>

1991
01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:34.291
<v Speaker 3>donations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm sure did go to charitable </v>

1992
01:23:34.291 --> 01:23:36.301
<v Speaker 3>causes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got paid to speak and they didn't </v>

1993
01:23:36.301 --> 01:23:38.881
<v Speaker 3>just get paid to speak a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got paid to speak hundreds of </v>

1994
01:23:38.881 --> 01:23:39.850
<v Speaker 3>thousands of dollars and they did it </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over and over again.</v>

1995
01:23:39.851 --> 01:23:42.250
<v Speaker 3>Both bill and hillary and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why,</v>

1996
01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:45.460
<v Speaker 3>just for the same reason why trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>release his taxes,</v>

1997
01:23:45.610 --> 01:23:50.610
<v Speaker 3>hillary won't release the transcripts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those speeches that she gave to the </v>

1998
01:23:50.610 --> 01:23:51.160
<v Speaker 3>banks because they would be horrific.</v>

1999
01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:53.080
<v Speaker 3>If they weren't horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would release them.</v>

2000
01:23:53.081 --> 01:23:54.370
<v Speaker 3>It'd be really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2001
01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:58.180
<v Speaker 3>I said some great things about income </v>
<v Speaker 3>equality and how we all need to,</v>

2002
01:23:58.430 --> 01:24:00.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>support the impoverished communities.</v>

2003
01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You dId because did you had released </v>

2004
01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:05.760
<v Speaker 3>that and everybody would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2005
01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:06.540
<v Speaker 3>even though hillary is worth millions </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars,</v>

2006
01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:08.890
<v Speaker 3>she's super fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's reasonable.</v>

2007
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:10.140
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was none of that.</v>

2008
01:24:10.141 --> 01:24:13.360
<v Speaker 3>The reason there's a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a corrupt system,</v>

2009
01:24:13.361 --> 01:24:18.361
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a system that they figured out how </v>

2010
01:24:18.361 --> 01:24:20.401
<v Speaker 3>to find loopholes and they've created </v>
<v Speaker 3>legislation over the years that have </v>

2011
01:24:20.401 --> 01:24:23.851
<v Speaker 3>allowed them to skirt through these </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird sort of fucking avenues of,</v>

2012
01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.400
<v Speaker 3>of legality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get to this point where they're</v>

2013
01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:30.430
<v Speaker 3>making insane amounts of money as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>public servant.</v>

2014
01:24:30.670 --> 01:24:35.670
<v Speaker 3>I meaN,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bill clinton and hillary clinton have </v>

2015
01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:37.621
<v Speaker 3>earned hundreds of fucking of millions </v>
<v Speaker 3>of dollars and doing what?</v>

2016
01:24:38.230 --> 01:24:40.720
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a business?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you selling laptops?</v>

2017
01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:41.430
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2018
01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:46.440
<v Speaker 3>you have a new car to you're selling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where are you making all thiS fucking </v>

2019
01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:46.440
<v Speaker 3>money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2020
01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:49.501
<v Speaker 3>just talking how weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're making hundreds of millions of </v>

2021
01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:51.460
<v Speaker 3>dollars talking when you used to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>president who's paying you?</v>

2022
01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:52.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is weird.</v>

2023
01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:57.960
<v Speaker 3>THe people that are paying you are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that benefited from you being in </v>

2024
01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:57.960
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute,</v>

2025
01:24:57.970 --> 01:25:02.130
<v Speaker 3>did they pay you off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you stiff?</v>

2026
01:25:02.970 --> 01:25:07.970
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the argument and that's what </v>

2027
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:07.970
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the drain.</v>

2028
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:07.970
<v Speaker 3>The swamp shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2029
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:10.270
<v Speaker 3>that's where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So donald trump's not guilty of that.</v>

2030
01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:16.370
<v Speaker 3>So that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing that he's not guilty of </v>

2031
01:25:16.370 --> 01:25:19.291
<v Speaker 3>getting paid hundreds of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars to talk and to give his </v>

2032
01:25:19.291 --> 01:25:23.170
<v Speaker 3>influence as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a person who's serving,</v>

2033
01:25:23.171 --> 01:25:26.410
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the senate or someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a president that's not while he's.</v>

2034
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:27.790
<v Speaker 3>While he's getting that money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's.</v>

2035
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:30.630
<v Speaker 3>He's corrupt in a totally different way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2036
01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:32.260
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

2037
01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:34.000
<v Speaker 3>he's a special one because it's special </v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

2038
01:25:34.001 --> 01:25:35.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

2039
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:38.860
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get exhausted about it and I hate even</v>

2040
01:25:38.861 --> 01:25:40.450
<v Speaker 3>talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were mad at right now.</v>

2041
01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they hitting you?</v>

2042
01:25:41.921 --> 01:25:44.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they are just imagining rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2043
01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:46.570
<v Speaker 3>IF you don't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

2044
01:25:46.571 --> 01:25:51.571
<v Speaker 3>which the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should probably shut the fuck up by </v>

2045
01:25:51.571 --> 01:25:51.610
<v Speaker 3>learning more and then get more upset </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then talk more.</v>

2046
01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:56.700
<v Speaker 3>I used to joke about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I still do it from time to time </v>

2047
01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:58.921
<v Speaker 3>that I would want to be president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you see these dudes become </v>

2048
01:25:58.921 --> 01:25:58.921
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look,</v>

2049
01:25:58.921 --> 01:26:03.271
<v Speaker 3>they look like they like one month in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look like they're in a race they </v>

2050
01:26:03.271 --> 01:26:06.871
<v Speaker 3>didn't train for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody should have a picture of trump </v>

2051
01:26:06.871 --> 01:26:09.311
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he talked to at seapak this </v>

2052
01:26:09.311 --> 01:26:09.410
<v Speaker 3>morning and he was on the prompter is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was just like,</v>

2053
01:26:09.650 --> 01:26:12.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's the white balance </v>
<v Speaker 3>on this video,</v>

2054
01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:12.830
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

2055
01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's this?</v>

2056
01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:17.660
<v Speaker 3>My friend cameron hanes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep hammering five k,</v>

2057
01:26:17.661 --> 01:26:20.750
<v Speaker 3>the only race I've ever run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran a five k asked me many times.</v>

2058
01:26:20.751 --> 01:26:24.080
<v Speaker 3>I ran a train for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seven zero.</v>

2059
01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.710
<v Speaker 3>I thought it would be zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought we're going to fuck with.</v>

2060
01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.400
<v Speaker 3>I ran the rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't trade at all,</v>

2061
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:31.250
<v Speaker 3>so that's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She caught me at the end of that race.</v>

2062
01:26:31.251 --> 01:26:31.880
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

2063
01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.430
<v Speaker 3>that's hard to do if you'd like to here </v>
<v Speaker 3>in shape.</v>

2064
01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:39.440
<v Speaker 3>So a lot longer than.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was more difficult to run </v>

2065
01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:43.091
<v Speaker 3>five k than it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like I've worked out all the </v>

2066
01:26:43.091 --> 01:26:43.091
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is for pussies,</v>

2067
01:26:43.091 --> 01:26:46.661
<v Speaker 3>so I'll just go run it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you think that you could be </v>

2068
01:26:46.661 --> 01:26:46.680
<v Speaker 3>the prentice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the president,</v>

2069
01:26:46.681 --> 01:26:49.910
<v Speaker 3>like I have amazing stamina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a winning mentality,</v>

2070
01:26:50.590 --> 01:26:52.010
<v Speaker 3>a winning temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2071
01:26:52.011 --> 01:26:53.480
<v Speaker 3>like once you get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2072
01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.890
<v Speaker 3>that guy looks bewildered.</v>

2073
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:59.890
<v Speaker 3>THat press conference that he did the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other day where he's just going on and </v>

2074
01:26:59.890 --> 01:27:00.440
<v Speaker 3>on about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy shit.</v>

2075
01:27:00.441 --> 01:27:02.690
<v Speaker 3>That was terrifying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had friends that are conservatives</v>

2076
01:27:02.691 --> 01:27:04.640
<v Speaker 3>at texted me afterwards go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looks unstable.</v>

2077
01:27:04.641 --> 01:27:05.940
<v Speaker 3>This is making me nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2078
01:27:06.230 --> 01:27:07.070
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

2079
01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're making America great </v>

2080
01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:12.100
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucks.</v>

2081
01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Kellyanne conway hasn't been on tv for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile,</v>

2082
01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:12.100
<v Speaker 3>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some of the last one,</v>

2083
01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:13.900
<v Speaker 3>she was just looked like she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrecked.</v>

2084
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:18.970
<v Speaker 3>They got her in a bunker somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're feeding her adderall and the </v>

2085
01:27:18.970 --> 01:27:18.970
<v Speaker 3>tone of what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's just like,</v>

2086
01:27:18.970 --> 01:27:19.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I could do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>

2087
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:24.510
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would probably collapse under it all </v>

2088
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.510
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would call out.</v>

2089
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:28.401
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would decide everything on fucking </v>

2090
01:27:28.401 --> 01:27:28.401
<v Speaker 3>internet polls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you fucking run this thing too.</v>

2091
01:27:28.401 --> 01:27:30.320
<v Speaker 3>I first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be drunk on tv all the time.</v>

2092
01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:34.070
<v Speaker 3>I'd be smoking weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like we got to do is burn down.</v>

2093
01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:39.670
<v Speaker 3>The whole system broke down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be like when they found marlin </v>

2094
01:27:39.670 --> 01:27:40.280
<v Speaker 3>brando and apocalypse now and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>desert,</v>

2095
01:27:40.281 --> 01:27:42.450
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about the snail going </v>
<v Speaker 3>across the razor blade,</v>

2096
01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.600
<v Speaker 3>razor blade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's really right now with </v>

2097
01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:51.600
<v Speaker 3>everyone that's involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>

2098
01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.070
<v Speaker 3>It's a test of endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2099
01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:54.920
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's who is going to last the longest.</v>

2100
01:27:54.921 --> 01:27:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Who's gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's gonna?</v>

2101
01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.440
<v Speaker 3>KEep on fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's shaking.</v>

2102
01:27:57.670 --> 01:28:02.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're having an earthquake and the </v>

2103
01:28:02.670 --> 01:28:02.670
<v Speaker 3>earthquake is going to fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those shitty buildings.</v>

2104
01:28:02.670 --> 01:28:05.120
<v Speaker 3>All the ones without the strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>foundation.</v>

2105
01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:06.800
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna be brecht,</v>

2106
01:28:06.801 --> 01:28:11.801
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to have to condemn them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and tear them down and start fresh and </v>

2107
01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:15.710
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it.</v>

2108
01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:19.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't like how this has gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have hoped that we got a savior.</v>

2109
01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:22.700
<v Speaker 3>I would've hoped that someone stepped in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a really reasonable person,</v>

2110
01:28:22.701 --> 01:28:25.160
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think a reasonable person </v>
<v Speaker 3>even could get traction.</v>

2111
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:30.370
<v Speaker 3>I think our system is so fucked up that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we almost might benefit from some crazy </v>

2112
01:28:30.370 --> 01:28:32.660
<v Speaker 3>ass hole coming in here and doing what </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing.</v>

2113
01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:38.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you'd get a normal person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who one wants to be president and then </v>

2114
01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:39.200
<v Speaker 3>gets propped up by all the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are already in empower.</v>

2115
01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.750
<v Speaker 3>You don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That person couldn't agree more.</v>

2116
01:28:41.751 --> 01:28:42.320
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2117
01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:43.700
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person has baggage.</v>

2118
01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.950
<v Speaker 3>Everyone at that fucking point has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have baggage,</v>

2119
01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:51.250
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the things about obama </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that he was so measured and you know,</v>

2120
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:54.980
<v Speaker 3>wasn't vindictive and what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe behind the scenes you killed a few</v>

2121
01:28:54.981 --> 01:28:56.360
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2122
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:57.830
<v Speaker 3>when you say few people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people will go,</v>

2123
01:28:57.831 --> 01:28:58.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about drones though?</v>

2124
01:28:59.090 --> 01:29:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was exactly thinking that.</v>

2125
01:29:01.471 --> 01:29:06.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he certainly is responsible for </v>

2126
01:29:06.471 --> 01:29:08.181
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They killed something like 80 percent </v>

2127
01:29:08.181 --> 01:29:09.380
<v Speaker 3>civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it 10 percent of entire populations?</v>

2128
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:10.000
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2129
01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:15.140
<v Speaker 3>I think that was the most recent </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistic finding innocent deaths by </v>

2130
01:29:15.451 --> 01:29:17.130
<v Speaker 3>drone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by percentage.</v>

2131
01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:19.860
<v Speaker 3>I really think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super high.</v>

2132
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:22.050
<v Speaker 3>Scary high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even you saying that sentence,</v>

2133
01:29:22.051 --> 01:29:24.090
<v Speaker 3>it's horrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that statistic exists,</v>

2134
01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:24.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2135
01:29:24.781 --> 01:29:26.880
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we just google a horror?</v>

2136

<v Speaker 3>google horrific things happening right </v>

2137

<v Speaker 3>That's the internet right now.</v>

2139
01:29:35.650 --> 01:29:40.650
<v Speaker 3>It's us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone yelling about politics and </v>

2140
01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:40.650
<v Speaker 3>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you got,</v>

2141
01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:40.860
<v Speaker 3>jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you say the top one that popped up</v>

2142
01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:45.920
<v Speaker 3>with nearly 90 percent of people killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>in recent drone strikes were not the </v>

2143
01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:49.040
<v Speaker 3>target.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck jesus.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fixed it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They fixed it from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My fucking head hurts and on the </v>

<v Speaker 3>My fucking head hurts when you read </v>

2149

<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

2150

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>chaotic now,</v>

2152
01:30:05.131 --> 01:30:06.960
<v Speaker 1>but we live in disneyland compared to</v>

2153
01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:10.300
<v Speaker 3>world and I think that's important for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to remember for sure.</v>

2154
01:30:10.510 --> 01:30:13.940
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is those people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>over there in non disney land,</v>

<v Speaker 3>kinda shitty?</v>

<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2158
01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:23.830

<v Speaker 3>if someone's a muslim,</v>

2159
01:30:23.831 --> 01:30:25.390
<v Speaker 3>you can keep them from coming into this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>One of my best friends believes that the</v>

2172
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:53.290
<v Speaker 3>the fucking government is spraying </v>
<v Speaker 3>things out of the back of planes.</v>

2173
01:30:53.410 --> 01:30:55.960
<v Speaker 3>When you see those contracts in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thinks it's like,</v>

2174
01:30:56.290 --> 01:30:58.960
<v Speaker 3>what does he call this strategic aerosol</v>
<v Speaker 3>injection leads?</v>

2175
01:30:59.090 --> 01:31:00.760
<v Speaker 3>It's an ssi program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2176
01:31:01.330 --> 01:31:02.260
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

2177
01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:03.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2178
01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:08.980
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that believe </v>

2179
01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:09.670
<v Speaker 3>some ridiculous shit and they need the </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity just like all of us do,</v>

2180
01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:14.820
<v Speaker 3>to have peace and prosperity and to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>the opportunities you take in more </v>

2181
01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:16.890
<v Speaker 3>information that may make you reconsider</v>
<v Speaker 3>your beliefs.</v>

2182
01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like when it comes to the </v>

2183
01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:22.100
<v Speaker 1>immigration thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people on two fronts,</v>

2184
01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:25.561
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one as far as general </v>

2185
01:31:25.561 --> 01:31:28.171
<v Speaker 1>immigration people coming through </v>
<v Speaker 1>legally from countries and then there's </v>

2186
01:31:28.171 --> 01:31:29.020
<v Speaker 1>also the refugee program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2187
01:31:29.230 --> 01:31:32.410
<v Speaker 1>And so what I've seen is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments of,</v>

2188
01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:34.070
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're saying that you know,</v>

2189
01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:39.080
<v Speaker 1>these people are displaced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're having to go through all these </v>

2190
01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:39.080
<v Speaker 1>horrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are saYing,</v>

2191
01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:44.220
<v Speaker 1>why is that my problem is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>America is the land of dreams and we </v>

2192
01:31:44.471 --> 01:31:47.860
<v Speaker 1>should offer that because we're great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should that?</v>

2193
01:31:48.190 --> 01:31:49.990
<v Speaker 1>And then once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not my argument,</v>

2194
01:31:50.110 --> 01:31:53.980
<v Speaker 1>but why is that taking precedent over </v>
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>

2195
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

2196
01:31:54.761 --> 01:31:55.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to college,</v>

2197
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:58.630
<v Speaker 1>things haven't worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My life's fucking in shambles.</v>

2198
01:31:58.690 --> 01:32:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I have yelling that I have white </v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege all the time and the fucking </v>

2199
01:32:03.690 --> 01:32:05.410
<v Speaker 1>seems like the world's more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>against me every day.</v>

2200
01:32:05.710 --> 01:32:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

2201
01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:09.490
<v Speaker 1>if and in their heads like all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are at risk.</v>

2202
01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:13.270
<v Speaker 4>Let me stop right there for that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got three words.</v>

2203
01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:18.730
<v Speaker 4>What's a fuck yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then form words,</v>

2204
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:23.790
<v Speaker 4>suck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pussy jesus christ you.</v>

2205
01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:25.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can be.</v>

2206
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:27.640
<v Speaker 4>We'll call you have white privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You freaking out,</v>

2207
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:29.140
<v Speaker 4>you're in America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

2208
01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:32.590
<v Speaker 4>If if things aren't going well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>work harder,</v>

2209
01:32:32.650 --> 01:32:35.500
<v Speaker 4>figuring it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a white guy in America,</v>

2210
01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:39.730
<v Speaker 4>you're so lucky you finding shit to </v>
<v Speaker 4>complain about,</v>

2211
01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.430
<v Speaker 4>but so everybody has their own hand that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're dealt,</v>

2212
01:32:42.431 --> 01:32:47.431
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some people are in impoverished </v>

2213
01:32:47.431 --> 01:32:49.141
<v Speaker 4>fucking coal miner communities in West </v>
<v Speaker 4>Virginia and some people are born in </v>

2214
01:32:49.141 --> 01:32:49.990
<v Speaker 4>marin county with a silver spoon in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their mouth.</v>

2215
01:32:50.170 --> 01:32:51.760
<v Speaker 4>GraNted we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all aware of that,</v>

2216
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:57.030
<v Speaker 4>but if you don't think that your </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunities are far greater because </v>

2217
01:32:57.030 --> 01:33:00.511
<v Speaker 4>you live in american and are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're a syrian refugee coming over </v>

2218
01:33:00.511 --> 01:33:00.640
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrapped up in a fucking tent,</v>

2219
01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:01.960
<v Speaker 4>you're crazy.</v>

2220
01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:07.140
<v Speaker 4>You're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that makes this </v>

2221
01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:08.470
<v Speaker 4>place so fucking special is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the land of opportunity.</v>

2222
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:11.740
<v Speaker 4>As soon as you stop having it be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>land of opportunity,</v>

2223
01:33:11.741 --> 01:33:16.741
<v Speaker 4>you stopped taking in those new people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You stopped giving those people that </v>

2224
01:33:16.741 --> 01:33:17.710
<v Speaker 4>opportunity and then you make this place</v>
<v Speaker 4>a different thing.</v>

2225
01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:21.160
<v Speaker 4>You make this place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is this secluded,</v>

2226
01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:22.900
<v Speaker 4>isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2227
01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:24.880
<v Speaker 4>put the fence up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put the wall up.</v>

2228
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:28.240
<v Speaker 4>Everybody in is in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody else could go fuck themselves.</v>

2229
01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:31.720
<v Speaker 4>that's not what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're changing what it is.</v>

2230
01:33:31.870 --> 01:33:36.870
<v Speaker 4>This is the land of opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a country that was founded </v>

2231
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:38.110
<v Speaker 4>entirely by immigrants who killed the </v>
<v Speaker 4>natives,</v>

2232
01:33:38.410 --> 01:33:41.200
<v Speaker 4>but that that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what we are.</v>

2233
01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:43.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's.</v>

2234
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.000
<v Speaker 4>There's certainly good and bad to all </v>
<v Speaker 4>forms of immigration and there's </v>

2235
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.740
<v Speaker 4>certainly good and bad to cultural </v>
<v Speaker 4>integration.</v>

2236
01:33:50.770 --> 01:33:53.050
<v Speaker 4>Cultural integration is where things get</v>
<v Speaker 4>really problematic,</v>

2237
01:33:53.051 --> 01:33:56.860
<v Speaker 4>especially for women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for women and women that have dealt with</v>

2238
01:33:56.861 --> 01:34:00.850
<v Speaker 4>all the horrific situations that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened in all these european countries</v>

2239
01:34:00.851 --> 01:34:05.851
<v Speaker 4>where muslims have come in and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>radical ones have wanted to enforce </v>

2240
01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:09.430
<v Speaker 4>their ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sharia law ideas on the women in the</v>

2241
01:34:09.431 --> 01:34:11.190
<v Speaker 4>area and they see women walking around </v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

2242
01:34:11.230 --> 01:34:14.080
<v Speaker 4>skirts and all that stuff is a real </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

2243
01:34:14.110 --> 01:34:19.110
<v Speaker 4>The Integration of cultural norms and </v>
<v Speaker 4>values into a western society that has </v>

2244
01:34:19.871 --> 01:34:23.170
<v Speaker 4>just a completely different idea of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's acceptable and not acceptable.</v>

2245
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:26.050
<v Speaker 4>That's going to take some time and if I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was in that area,</v>

2246
01:34:26.051 --> 01:34:28.900
<v Speaker 4>I get the fuck out of dodge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would not want to be around.</v>

2247
01:34:28.901 --> 01:34:33.901
<v Speaker 4>If there's a culture war going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what people are fighting and arguing </v>

2248
01:34:33.901 --> 01:34:34.690
<v Speaker 4>over ideas that may or may not include </v>
<v Speaker 4>your wife,</v>

2249
01:34:34.691 --> 01:34:35.770
<v Speaker 4>your daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your mother,</v>

2250
01:34:36.190 --> 01:34:37.000
<v Speaker 4>that's too dangerous.</v>

2251
01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Then you'd have a lot of those same </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that I talk about saying,</v>

2252
01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:44.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck should I have to move </v>

2253
01:34:44.841 --> 01:34:44.841
<v Speaker 1>because we're this thing.</v>

2254
01:34:44.841 --> 01:34:46.810
<v Speaker 4>you can't let that happen in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a different thing,</v>

2255
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:49.570
<v Speaker 4>but that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cannot let that happen in America.</v>

2256
01:34:49.571 --> 01:34:54.571
<v Speaker 4>If you get people that are coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to have a no tolerance policy </v>

2257
01:34:54.571 --> 01:34:57.511
<v Speaker 4>to anyone that's giving anyone a hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>time over accepted values in America.</v>

2258
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:01.340
<v Speaker 4>Like the way women are allowed to dress </v>
<v Speaker 4>or driving cars.</v>

2259
01:35:01.341 --> 01:35:06.341
<v Speaker 4>What if you come over from Saudi Arabia </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you want to kill all the women that </v>

2260
01:35:06.341 --> 01:35:06.341
<v Speaker 4>are driving cars?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know like what if you would,</v>

2261
01:35:06.341 --> 01:35:10.930
<v Speaker 4>if you want to impart sharia law and on </v>
<v Speaker 4>women that are committing adultery or </v>

2262
01:35:10.930 --> 01:35:13.040
<v Speaker 4>doing any of the things that are just </v>
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>

2263
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:17.360
<v Speaker 4>There's no law against a girl decided to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck 100 guys in America.</v>

2264
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:19.880
<v Speaker 4>If a girl decides to rent out a </v>
<v Speaker 4>warehouse and go,</v>

2265
01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:20.540
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2266
01:35:20.541 --> 01:35:22.340
<v Speaker 4>first a hundred guys get the fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on in.</v>

2267
01:35:22.690 --> 01:35:27.690
<v Speaker 4>Like in another country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you can be put to death for that </v>

2268
01:35:27.690 --> 01:35:28.610
<v Speaker 4>and that there are women that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrested that are sexually assaulted.</v>

2269
01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.970
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you look at what sucks is it's</v>

2270
01:35:31.971 --> 01:35:36.971
<v Speaker 4>not like that was one story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many stories over the years </v>

2271
01:35:36.971 --> 01:35:37.190
<v Speaker 4>and it's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's horrifying,</v>

2272
01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:42.220
<v Speaker 4>but so that's why I then argued because </v>
<v Speaker 4>even to the point that you're saying </v>

2273
01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:42.380
<v Speaker 4>there are people that are scared of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2274
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:47.390
<v Speaker 4>but there has to be some sort of a zero </v>
<v Speaker 4>tolerance policy for subjecting other </v>

2275
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:49.460
<v Speaker 4>people to your ideas and beliefs in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

2276
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:52.880
<v Speaker 4>but it also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every culture evolves.</v>

2277
01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:56.870
<v Speaker 4>Mean christians used to be a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>inquisition.</v>

2278
01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:59.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean that Was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were torturing people and they were</v>

2279
01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:04.390
<v Speaker 4>there getting people to confess to </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrific crimes and they never really </v>

2280
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:08.021
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did all sorts of things to people </v>

2281
01:36:08.021 --> 01:36:09.800
<v Speaker 4>that were nonbelievers and that was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal part of life in some parts of the</v>

2282
01:36:09.801 --> 01:36:11.070
<v Speaker 4>world a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2283
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:16.390
<v Speaker 4>We have to assume that that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>progress is not just isolated to </v>

2284
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.390
<v Speaker 4>christians.</v>

2285
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:20.450
<v Speaker 4>It's not just something that one belief </v>
<v Speaker 4>system can,</v>

2286
01:36:21.110 --> 01:36:23.420
<v Speaker 4>can sort of embodied that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolution,</v>

2287
01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:28.720
<v Speaker 4>that this can be something that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced in a lot of different </v>

2288
01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:29.870
<v Speaker 4>mindsets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of different ideologies,</v>

2289
01:36:29.871 --> 01:36:34.871
<v Speaker 4>and then the opportunity to educate </v>
<v Speaker 4>those people in a place where they're </v>

2290
01:36:34.871 --> 01:36:37.730
<v Speaker 4>free might be the only way that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to change when the echo chamber of</v>

2291
01:36:37.731 --> 01:36:41.510
<v Speaker 4>the middle east where these people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>growing up in these and obviously you're</v>

2292
01:36:41.511 --> 01:36:44.270
<v Speaker 4>talking about places with very few </v>
<v Speaker 4>resources,</v>

2293
01:36:44.271 --> 01:36:47.000
<v Speaker 4>really dangerous environments for </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone.</v>

2294
01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:52.020
<v Speaker 4>YOu know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're living in these incredibly </v>

2295
01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:52.020
<v Speaker 4>impoverished middle eastern places where</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people were freeing.</v>

2296
01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:54.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you are fleeing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you've seen the videos of aleppo,</v>

2297
01:36:54.531 --> 01:36:56.360
<v Speaker 4>you've seen the stuff of the news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's.</v>

2298
01:36:57.390 --> 01:37:02.390
<v Speaker 4>Anything's better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything's better than being in a a </v>

2299
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:05.231
<v Speaker 4>bombs zone where things are just going </v>
<v Speaker 4>off left and right and suicide bombings </v>

2300
01:37:05.231 --> 01:37:09.221
<v Speaker 4>and missiles and chaos and death and </v>
<v Speaker 4>isis throwing people off the roof for </v>

2301
01:37:09.221 --> 01:37:09.380
<v Speaker 4>being gay.</v>

2302
01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:10.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just horrific.</v>

2303
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:14.930
<v Speaker 4>So those people that are living in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like their life.</v>

2304
01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.140
<v Speaker 4>It can't get any worse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2305
01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:22.310
<v Speaker 4>They are in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They literally in an apocalypse right </v>

2306
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.310
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at a mel gibson movie look,</v>

2307
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:26.961
<v Speaker 4>get any kind of crazy mad max movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is that any different than Syria </v>

2308
01:37:26.961 --> 01:37:27.650
<v Speaker 4>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's really not.</v>

2309
01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:32.770
<v Speaker 4>It's just we know that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons why we don't consider this the </v>

2310
01:37:32.770 --> 01:37:36.410
<v Speaker 4>apocalypse right now because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>the apocalypse here in woodland hills,</v>

2311
01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:37.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2312
01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:42.640
<v Speaker 4>but it's the apocalypse in Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the apocalypse and there's pockets </v>

2313
01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:47.410
<v Speaker 4>of the world where things are absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 4>horrific and those areas were scared.</v>

2314
01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:52.100
<v Speaker 4>Those areas going to come here and make </v>
<v Speaker 4>us the apocalypse to.</v>

2315
01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:57.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean it goes back to the </v>

2316
01:37:57.460 --> 01:37:57.460
<v Speaker 4>disneyland thing where it is it </v>
<v Speaker 4>disneyland and where</v>

2317
01:37:57.460 --> 01:38:00.980
<v Speaker 1>were really pissed that some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rides are closed than where we're in </v>

2318
01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:01.050
<v Speaker 1>line and we feel like other people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting ahead,</v>

2319
01:38:01.410 --> 01:38:05.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that it is not,</v>

2320
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:07.800
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't compare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I have,</v>

2321
01:38:07.801 --> 01:38:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I have a bleeding heart in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2322
01:38:09.031 --> 01:38:14.031
<v Speaker 1>in some capacity is when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see those things and you're </v>

2323
01:38:14.031 --> 01:38:14.031
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to help whoever we have to help,</v>

2324
01:38:14.031 --> 01:38:17.160
<v Speaker 1>but my goal is to always understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that doesn't want to have to fucking</v>

2325
01:38:17.161 --> 01:38:19.920
<v Speaker 1>move out of his neighborhood because all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2326
01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:22.710
<v Speaker 1>all these people came in and the culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed,</v>

2327
01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:27.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just tAking into account his </v>

2328
01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:27.760
<v Speaker 1>mindset where you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even you said,</v>

2329
01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:28.380
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you're worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your daughter,</v>

2330
01:38:28.381 --> 01:38:33.381
<v Speaker 1>your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are people that have that </v>

2331
01:38:33.381 --> 01:38:33.381
<v Speaker 1>mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2332
01:38:33.381 --> 01:38:33.381
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're human beings.</v>

2333
01:38:33.381 --> 01:38:36.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the easiest thing in the world to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create an us versus them argument,</v>

2334
01:38:36.691 --> 01:38:39.030
<v Speaker 1>especially if there's fear onto my </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

2335
01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're anyone that's a,</v>

2336
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:43.500
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have fear for yourself,</v>

2337
01:38:43.501 --> 01:38:45.210
<v Speaker 1>but anytime all of a sudden you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

2338
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:48.260
<v Speaker 3>it's next level will also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tHink people were worried about people</v>

2339
01:38:48.261 --> 01:38:53.261
<v Speaker 3>coming over here and not integrating and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then coming over here and then they </v>

2340
01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:57.101
<v Speaker 3>start these communities where they all </v>
<v Speaker 3>use the same language and they all use </v>

2341
01:38:57.101 --> 01:38:57.101
<v Speaker 3>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>YOu know,</v>

2342
01:38:57.330 --> 01:39:02.330
<v Speaker 3>the same written language on their signs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they develop these like </v>

2343
01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:04.190
<v Speaker 3>chinatown titan neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not disparaging chinatown in any way,</v>

2344
01:39:04.191 --> 01:39:07.190
<v Speaker 3>but that just as an example of ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities,</v>

2345
01:39:07.191 --> 01:39:08.550
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of stay isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2346
01:39:08.830 --> 01:39:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Like there's places in chinatown where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go and no one's speaking english,</v>

2347
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:14.330
<v Speaker 3>they'll just running around speaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>chinese and they can't speak english,</v>

2348
01:39:14.331 --> 01:39:15.780
<v Speaker 3>but they figured out a way to integrate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>THere's,</v>

2349
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:18.410
<v Speaker 3>there's also latino communities in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>country that are like,</v>

2350
01:39:18.411 --> 01:39:22.790
<v Speaker 3>that's similarly as well and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are worried about that,</v>

2351
01:39:22.791 --> 01:39:27.791
<v Speaker 3>like that spreading and they say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has actually happened in parts of </v>

2352
01:39:27.791 --> 01:39:30.761
<v Speaker 3>paris and it's happened in parts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany where these people have come </v>

2353
01:39:30.761 --> 01:39:34.031
<v Speaker 3>over from other countries as refugees </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they've established communities and </v>

2354
01:39:34.031 --> 01:39:37.481
<v Speaker 3>then they enforce their laws and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was something that my low was going to </v>

2355
01:39:37.551 --> 01:39:38.000
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

2356
01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:43.130
<v Speaker 3>He was going to do some sort oF a march </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was going to do like some,</v>

2357
01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:47.600
<v Speaker 3>a gay march through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Sweden.</v>

2358
01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:53.040
<v Speaker 3>I think it was going to go through like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst muslim neighborhoods and </v>

2359
01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:56.431
<v Speaker 3>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they just decided it was far too </v>

2360
01:39:56.431 --> 01:39:56.520
<v Speaker 3>sweet and trips so much promo on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sweetened promo.</v>

2361
01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:58.490
<v Speaker 3>They're in denial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2362
01:39:58.491 --> 01:39:59.600
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're fine.</v>

2363
01:39:59.630 --> 01:40:00.680
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we haven't done anything.</v>

2364
01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:05.800
<v Speaker 3>And then right afTer they said that some</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrific outbreak took place by the way,</v>

2365
01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:11.890
<v Speaker 3>it's got a little violence going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and now that you didn't use to </v>

2366
01:40:11.890 --> 01:40:11.890
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2367
01:40:11.890 --> 01:40:11.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is growing pains.</v>

2368
01:40:11.961 --> 01:40:16.961
<v Speaker 3>Like if you take people from a violent </v>
<v Speaker 3>place and then you let them loose and </v>

2369
01:40:16.961 --> 01:40:21.450
<v Speaker 3>like there was this one horrific story </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this guy from Iraq that came over </v>

2370
01:40:22.041 --> 01:40:27.041
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some refugee and he raped some boy in </v>

2371
01:40:27.041 --> 01:40:29.861
<v Speaker 3>Germany and his response where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>asked him why he did it was like I </v>

2372
01:40:29.861 --> 01:40:32.450
<v Speaker 3>hadn't seen my wife and six months and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was having a sexual emergency.</v>

2373
01:40:33.010 --> 01:40:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>SO it'll be like what?</v>

2374
01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:37.260
<v Speaker 3>Like there's things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

2375
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:39.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was from Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was from Afghanistan,</v>

2376
01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:42.290
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's things that go on in other parts</v>

2377
01:40:42.291 --> 01:40:46.700
<v Speaker 3>of the world that become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say the norm,</v>

2378
01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:50.390
<v Speaker 3>but they do happen there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that they don't happen.</v>

2379
01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:53.120
<v Speaker 1>That's where I think it's important that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general,</v>

2380
01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:55.290
<v Speaker 1>people don't have the time where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to,</v>

2381
01:40:55.530 --> 01:40:57.910
<v Speaker 1>to be as educated as possible because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2382
01:40:57.911 --> 01:41:02.911
<v Speaker 1>if we're basing things off of the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are generally becoming or it </v>

2383
01:41:02.911 --> 01:41:03.850
<v Speaker 1>seems like more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2384
01:41:03.851 --> 01:41:05.860
<v Speaker 1>But if yOu're basing stuff off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outliers,</v>

2385
01:41:06.090 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where,</v>

2386
01:41:08.290 --> 01:41:09.780
<v Speaker 1>that's where things are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you here?</v>

2387
01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2388
01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:16.110
<v Speaker 1>someone that was here illegally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep talking about the same story </v>

2389
01:41:16.110 --> 01:41:16.110
<v Speaker 1>over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2390
01:41:16.110 --> 01:41:17.350
<v Speaker 1>it was a someone who are illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a murder.</v>

2391
01:41:17.650 --> 01:41:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like the same story and I want </v>

2392
01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:22.650
<v Speaker 1>to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the bigger picture because</v>

2393
01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:23.200
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking horrifying and a bubble.</v>

2394
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:25.570
<v Speaker 1>But what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the big thing?</v>

2395
01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.550
<v Speaker 1>If it leans more towards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>

2396
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:29.410
<v Speaker 1>this is scary then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2397
01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:33.730
<v Speaker 1>But if you base something off of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>with guns,</v>

2398
01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:38.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you base something off of one </v>

2399
01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:40.801
<v Speaker 1>specific shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is like if you look at the body </v>

2400
01:41:40.801 --> 01:41:43.771
<v Speaker 1>count,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guns involved specifically if it's </v>

2401
01:41:43.771 --> 01:41:43.771
<v Speaker 1>an outlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's.</v>

2402
01:41:43.771 --> 01:41:45.100
<v Speaker 1>If it's representative of a biGger </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

2403
01:41:45.110 --> 01:41:47.260
<v Speaker 1>then if you really go after the bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

2404
01:41:47.261 --> 01:41:52.261
<v Speaker 1>if you actually want to have an effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just superficial or that's not </v>

2405
01:41:52.261 --> 01:41:52.261
<v Speaker 1>just a big stance,</v>

2406
01:41:52.261 --> 01:41:56.800
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all want to be safe and we all want </v>

2407
01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:58.811
<v Speaker 3>our loved ones safe and so do they mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I think is really important </v>

2408
01:41:58.811 --> 01:42:01.280
<v Speaker 3>and when they don't anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2409
01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:04.370
<v Speaker 3>when when people don't want to be safe </v>
<v Speaker 3>or they don't want their loved one safe,</v>

2410
01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:06.290
<v Speaker 3>then we have to figure out why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

2411
01:42:06.291 --> 01:42:09.260
<v Speaker 3>What'S going on that you're willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>strap your kid full of dynamite and have</v>

2412
01:42:09.261 --> 01:42:14.261
<v Speaker 3>him walk into a mall and blow people up </v>
<v Speaker 3>like and now you think he's a holy </v>

2413
01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:18.161
<v Speaker 3>martyr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember watching some documentary on </v>

2414
01:42:18.161 --> 01:42:21.131
<v Speaker 3>suicide bombings and they were raising </v>
<v Speaker 3>these children to be suicide bombings </v>

2415
01:42:21.131 --> 01:42:21.131
<v Speaker 3>and they had these pictures of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>

2416
01:42:21.410 --> 01:42:24.440
<v Speaker 3>these holy images of these children with</v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide vests on,</v>

2417
01:42:24.441 --> 01:42:26.480
<v Speaker 3>on the wall that had already committed </v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide.</v>

2418
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:29.900
<v Speaker 3>And there was a sign in islamic that </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

2419
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:34.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>today's actually islamic's not a </v>

2420
01:42:34.990 --> 01:42:34.990
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

2421
01:42:34.990 --> 01:42:35.100
<v Speaker 3>When I talked to her mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2422
01:42:35.101 --> 01:42:36.050
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go with it.</v>

2423
01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:37.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well in arabic,</v>

2424
01:42:37.521 --> 01:42:42.521
<v Speaker 3>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it said today's children are </v>

2425
01:42:42.521 --> 01:42:45.551
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow's holy martyrs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was on the wall and they were </v>

2426
01:42:45.551 --> 01:42:49.001
<v Speaker 3>interviewing these people and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrap their head around this and make </v>

2427
01:42:49.001 --> 01:42:49.001
<v Speaker 3>sense of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2428
01:42:49.001 --> 01:42:53.350
<v Speaker 3>when you've got situations like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone should be scared because then </v>

2429
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:54.950
<v Speaker 3>people embrace their ideology to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point where they're willing to let their</v>

2430
01:42:54.951 --> 01:42:59.951
<v Speaker 3>own babies blow themselves up in k so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a real problem there and </v>

2431
01:42:59.951 --> 01:43:02.480
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is as much of a problem as any kind</v>

2432
01:43:02.481 --> 01:43:04.460
<v Speaker 3>of cult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any kind of mind control,</v>

2433
01:43:04.461 --> 01:43:06.050
<v Speaker 3>any kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>

2434
01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:07.460
<v Speaker 3>if that's happening over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2435
01:43:07.461 --> 01:43:07.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2436
01:43:07.821 --> 01:43:09.410
<v Speaker 3>That needs to be taken into </v>
<v Speaker 3>consideration.</v>

2437
01:43:09.411 --> 01:43:13.250
<v Speaker 3>But how many people are doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the percentage?</v>

2438
01:43:13.251 --> 01:43:16.700
<v Speaker 3>how many people aren't doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people are productive,</v>

2439
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:21.910
<v Speaker 3>kind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasonable people that are stuck in a </v>

2440
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:24.461
<v Speaker 3>really shitty place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And isn't that supposed to be what </v>

2441
01:43:24.461 --> 01:43:26.921
<v Speaker 3>America is about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't just say there's a small </v>

2442
01:43:26.921 --> 01:43:27.110
<v Speaker 3>percentage of people that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrific shit,</v>

2443
01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:31.290
<v Speaker 3>so now we can't let anybody that looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>like them in as that gets crazy and that</v>

2444
01:43:31.291 --> 01:43:33.380
<v Speaker 3>isolates us from the whole rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world too.</v>

2445
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:38.590
<v Speaker 3>But it ain't easy man and it's not an </v>
<v Speaker 3>easy problem to solve and I'm certainly </v>

2446
01:43:38.590 --> 01:43:39.530
<v Speaker 3>not the fucking guy to do it.</v>

2447
01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.400
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ditto.</v>

2448
01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because because the argument </v>

2449
01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:45.680
<v Speaker 1>automatically becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if my family right and then</v>

2450
01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:47.160
<v Speaker 3>secure people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you make things secure?</v>

2451
01:43:47.161 --> 01:43:48.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good question.</v>

2452
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a screen.</v>

2453
01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 1>That thing is saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as safety before </v>

2454
01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 1>they were safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2455
01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:55.160
<v Speaker 1>But you can make things more safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make things somewhat safe.</v>

2456
01:43:55.161 --> 01:43:58.820
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a dark thing to think about.</v>

2457
01:43:58.821 --> 01:44:01.940
<v Speaker 1>But before there were even more of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>shootings that happened.</v>

2458
01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:07.480
<v Speaker 1>you look at why do you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have to blow up a plane or </v>

2459
01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:09.170
<v Speaker 1>why do you have to crash a plane if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can just get the people in line,</v>

2460
01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:10.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to a mall,</v>

2461
01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:12.590
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people that are just,</v>

2462
01:44:12.730 --> 01:44:17.730
<v Speaker 1>they're all soft targets everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's ever going to be fully safe </v>

2463
01:44:17.730 --> 01:44:19.490
<v Speaker 1>unless it's under some crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

2464
01:44:19.491 --> 01:44:24.491
<v Speaker 1>crazy like big brother control and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want that either because there'll </v>

2465
01:44:24.491 --> 01:44:27.290
<v Speaker 1>be consequences for going against big </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

2466
01:44:27.291 --> 01:44:28.620
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

2467
01:44:28.730 --> 01:44:31.820
<v Speaker 1>when I talk about these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just it's a we're fucked,</v>

2468
01:44:31.821 --> 01:44:36.821
<v Speaker 1>but in what way are we going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked situation and I know that can be </v>

2469
01:44:36.821 --> 01:44:36.821
<v Speaker 1>a dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2470
01:44:36.821 --> 01:44:39.240
<v Speaker 1>but it is dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2471
01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:44.640
<v Speaker 1>it's disappointing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as ultimate </v>

2472
01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:44.640
<v Speaker 1>safety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2473
01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I think I understand the argument of gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>free zones,</v>

2474
01:44:45.201 --> 01:44:47.210
<v Speaker 1>great targets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their targets everywhere.</v>

2475
01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the real question.</v>

2476
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:52.020
<v Speaker 4>How do you make the rest of the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you,</v>

2477
01:44:52.021 --> 01:44:57.021
<v Speaker 4>if you were some sort of a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>benevolent person who is just looking to</v>

2478
01:44:58.471 --> 01:45:03.471
<v Speaker 4>do the best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best job of managing this world and </v>

2479
01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:10.280
<v Speaker 4>making all the places that are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>disarray and these horrific war zones </v>

2480
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:12.600
<v Speaker 4>and bring them up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you.</v>

2481
01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:15.870
<v Speaker 4>How do you ever do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you ever even the world out?</v>

2482
01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:17.160
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's ever</v>

2483
01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:19.100
<v Speaker 1>we need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need aliens to come to,</v>

2484
01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:24.340
<v Speaker 1>to come and get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only time humanity works out </v>

2485
01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:26.650
<v Speaker 1>is when we have a common enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is we're always our own </v>

2486
01:45:26.650 --> 01:45:26.650
<v Speaker 1>common enemy,</v>

2487
01:45:26.650 --> 01:45:27.200
<v Speaker 4>but I will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But is that inevitable?</v>

2488
01:45:27.230 --> 01:45:28.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at one point in time,</v>

2489
01:45:28.521 --> 01:45:29.810
<v Speaker 4>people were way worse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2490
01:45:29.811 --> 01:45:33.110
<v Speaker 4>At one point in time there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that really freaked me</v>

2491
01:45:33.111 --> 01:45:38.111
<v Speaker 4>out was when they started finding all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these scraping marks on the inside of a </v>

2492
01:45:38.111 --> 01:45:42.810
<v Speaker 4>neanderthal heads that indicated that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people were eating the neanderthal </v>

2493
01:45:42.810 --> 01:45:42.810
<v Speaker 4>brains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2494
01:45:42.810 --> 01:45:43.400
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jesus.</v>

2495
01:45:43.610 --> 01:45:48.610
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there was an article recently </v>

2496
01:45:48.610 --> 01:45:50.711
<v Speaker 4>about cannibalism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about how frequent cannibalism occurred </v>

2497
01:45:50.711 --> 01:45:51.710
<v Speaker 4>back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>

2498
01:45:51.711 --> 01:45:52.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2499
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously that's not going on anymore.</v>

2500
01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:56.590
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2501
01:45:56.690 --> 01:46:00.010
<v Speaker 4>Is that the bar far less cannibalism </v>
<v Speaker 4>than ever before?</v>

2502
01:46:00.090 --> 01:46:01.380
<v Speaker 1>That's the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're fucked.</v>

2503
01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:02.730
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not eating each other.</v>

2504
01:46:02.731 --> 01:46:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say what you will.</v>

2505
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:05.470
<v Speaker 1>We're not eating each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2506
01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:09.280
<v Speaker 4>it used to be that you couldn't just </v>
<v Speaker 4>show up in a new town,</v>

2507
01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:12.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't just pull your boat up in,</v>

2508
01:46:12.370 --> 01:46:13.000
<v Speaker 4>into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2509
01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.120
<v Speaker 4>some doc somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And get out and do some tourists </v>

2510
01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:18.520
<v Speaker 4>shopping because if you pulled your boat</v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

2511
01:46:18.521 --> 01:46:23.521
<v Speaker 4>that meant you were probably a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>rapists and murderers from some other </v>

2512
01:46:23.521 --> 01:46:26.281
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're comIng over with swords and bows </v>

2513
01:46:26.281 --> 01:46:26.281
<v Speaker 4>and arrows and shooting everybody and </v>
<v Speaker 4>killing them.</v>

2514
01:46:26.281 --> 01:46:26.640
<v Speaker 4>Taking all the gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2515
01:46:26.650 --> 01:46:31.650
<v Speaker 4>that's not the case anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so things are much more reasonable in </v>

2516
01:46:31.650 --> 01:46:32.680
<v Speaker 4>terms of foreign travel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of international relations.</v>

2517
01:46:32.681 --> 01:46:37.681
<v Speaker 4>Things are much more reasonable to think</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if it continues to go in that </v>

2518
01:46:37.681 --> 01:46:41.911
<v Speaker 4>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll we'll have a better world for our </v>

2519
01:46:41.911 --> 01:46:42.580
<v Speaker 4>grandchIldren and our great </v>
<v Speaker 4>grandchildren,</v>

2520
01:46:42.581 --> 01:46:47.581
<v Speaker 4>but what steps have to be taken to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure that the rest of the world's </v>

2521
01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:50.400
<v Speaker 4>horrific conditions</v>

2522
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:55.400
<v Speaker 3>don't spill over to America?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well isn't one of the best ways to take </v>

2523
01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:59.661
<v Speaker 3>those people out of those horrific </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions and introduce them to this </v>

2524
01:46:59.661 --> 01:47:03.480
<v Speaker 3>beautiful free concept is concept of </v>
<v Speaker 3>self,</v>

2525
01:47:03.481 --> 01:47:04.350
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

2526
01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:09.351
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this unique place where there isn't a </v>

2527
01:47:09.351 --> 01:47:11.310
<v Speaker 3>caste system where you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If yOu play your cards right and you,</v>

2528
01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:16.380
<v Speaker 3>you're fortunate and you get the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>brakes and putting the right amount of </v>

2529
01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:20.121
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you literally can go from being a poor </v>

2530
01:47:20.121 --> 01:47:22.461
<v Speaker 3>person to being a very wealthy person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go from being unsuccessful witH </v>

2531
01:47:22.531 --> 01:47:27.531
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no job and no hope to being very </v>

2532
01:47:27.531 --> 01:47:27.531
<v Speaker 3>successful and happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2533
01:47:27.531 --> 01:47:31.561
<v Speaker 3>It's possible here and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>few places in the world when you can </v>

2534
01:47:31.561 --> 01:47:35.541
<v Speaker 3>build yourself up like that and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is an amazing opportunity that </v>

2535
01:47:35.541 --> 01:47:37.500
<v Speaker 3>probably didn't exist in history.</v>

2536
01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:40.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm too much of a cynic to think</v>

2537
01:47:40.091 --> 01:47:45.091
<v Speaker 1>that the idea of all of us coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>together on a positive idea will bring </v>

2538
01:47:45.091 --> 01:47:49.561
<v Speaker 1>us altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I 100 percent think it has to be a bad </v>

2539
01:47:49.561 --> 01:47:50.770
<v Speaker 1>thing that unites us meteor impact or </v>
<v Speaker 1>some shit.</v>

2540
01:47:51.010 --> 01:47:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Meteor impact fake fake that aLiens are </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>

2541
01:47:53.771 --> 01:47:56.140
<v Speaker 1>So we all have to come together to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone fake them.</v>

2542
01:47:56.850 --> 01:47:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens,</v>

2543
01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I want to kill us in like the next 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years rather than at some point in the </v>

2544
01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:02.480
<v Speaker 1>eventual time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think</v>

2545
01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:05.150
<v Speaker 3>the word 10 years is not good because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are good.</v>

2546
01:48:05.170 --> 01:48:10.130
<v Speaker 3>We'll deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None at all.</v>

2547
01:48:10.410 --> 01:48:12.860
<v Speaker 3>They'll just go fucking crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bottom line is,</v>

2548
01:48:12.861 --> 01:48:14.360
<v Speaker 3>bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the aliens get here,</v>

2549
01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:18.110

<v Speaker 3>you're raping while you can.</v>

2550
01:48:18.230 --> 01:48:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to be on my side.</v>

2551
01:48:19.551 --> 01:48:21.340
<v Speaker 1>They're going to call you an alien </v>
<v Speaker 1>apologist.</v>

2552
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:22.520
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2553

<v Speaker 1>he's an alien apologist.</v>

<v Speaker 3>a tv and he doesn't know.</v>

2557
01:48:31.090 --> 01:48:32.410
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't give a shit about those </v>
<v Speaker 3>aliens.</v>

2558
01:48:32.411 --> 01:48:37.411
<v Speaker 3>He said he did qa drive where he wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go to duke.</v>

2559
01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.430
<v Speaker 3>Who is jealous of the internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>connection because it was in africa.</v>

01:48:43.090 --> 01:48:44.770
<v Speaker 3>Live in a grass hut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry.</v>

2561
01:48:44.771 --> 01:48:46.210
<v Speaker 3>Zuckerberg is fixing it.</v>

2563
01:48:48.191 --> 01:48:53.191
<v Speaker 3>Bill gates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It blew up right there where they're </v>

2564
01:48:53.191 --> 01:48:53.720
<v Speaker 3>spending a ton of money on a satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the space that really.</v>

2565
01:48:53.730 --> 01:48:54.610
<v Speaker 3>That blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2566
01:48:54.611 --> 01:48:58.750
<v Speaker 3>There was supposed to be an nc that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>one big one that recently blew up was to</v>

2567
01:48:58.751 --> 01:49:02.680
<v Speaker 3>provide satellite internet access to </v>
<v Speaker 3>impoverished parts of africa.</v>

2568
01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2569
01:49:03.621 --> 01:49:04.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2570
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I think the more connected that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing,</v>

2571
01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:09.530
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be a bad thing.</v>

2572
01:49:09.550 --> 01:49:14.550
<v Speaker 1>That has to be a bad thing that unites </v>
<v Speaker 1>us of where we become the we or the us </v>

2573
01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:16.420
<v Speaker 1>versus them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other cars,</v>

2574
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:21.790
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is there is whether it </v>
<v Speaker 1>be nationalism or religion or fucking </v>

2575
01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:26.081
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things that within our </v>

2576
01:49:26.081 --> 01:49:28.061
<v Speaker 1>own creative creating us an easy us </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus them mentality and I mean I'm a </v>

2577
01:49:29.421 --> 01:49:32.030
<v Speaker 1>personal believer in that eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just gonna kill it,</v>

2578
01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:33.500
<v Speaker 1>kill ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you think.</v>

2579
01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn philly,</v>

2580

<v Speaker 1>I don't want it to happen.</v>

01:49:43.461 --> 01:49:45.060
<v Speaker 3>today's the safest time ever to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>

2585
01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:48.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about on a grand scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking as a grand scale.</v>

2586
01:49:48.371 --> 01:49:50.380
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about statistically </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

2587
01:49:50.381 --> 01:49:55.381
<v Speaker 1>that's the grand scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about like the next big </v>

2588
01:49:55.381 --> 01:49:55.381
<v Speaker 1>thing to happen as far as whether it be </v>

2590
01:49:56.110 --> 01:49:58.210
<v Speaker 1>The things that are happening are </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in our streets right now.</v>

2591
01:49:58.270 --> 01:50:02.140
<v Speaker 1>God damn doom and gloom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm planning for 20,</v>

2592
01:50:02.141 --> 01:50:04.450
<v Speaker 1>24.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be make birth rate again.</v>

2593
01:50:04.660 --> 01:50:07.520
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be mega new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2594
01:50:07.930 --> 01:50:09.610
<v Speaker 1>how old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 31.</v>

2595
01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:12.190
<v Speaker 1>So you were young when nine slash 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened?</v>

2596
01:50:12.191 --> 01:50:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in.</v>

2597
01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I was in my classroom and they like </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheeled in the tv.</v>

2598
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2599
01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:17.890
<v Speaker 1>what grade were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember?</v>

2600
01:50:18.610 --> 01:50:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I want to say I was in middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2601
01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I think it might have been my first year</v>
<v Speaker 1>of high school.</v>

2602
01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:24.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved around.</v>

2603
01:50:24.701 --> 01:50:25.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think.</v>

2604
01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:27.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a hard time placing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember I was in class.</v>

2605
01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:32.510
<v Speaker 1>I for my memory at the product's problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>with memory is like,</v>

2606
01:50:32.590 --> 01:50:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you've made me slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>change it 100 percent,</v>

2607
01:50:34.811 --> 01:50:37.570
<v Speaker 1>but from my understanding or my memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2608
01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:41.140
<v Speaker 1>they wield the tv and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was after the first tower got hit and</v>

2609
01:50:41.141 --> 01:50:44.110
<v Speaker 1>then I'm pretty sure we watched the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second tower get hit live.</v>

2610
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:47.470
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2611
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:52.650
<v Speaker 1>And that was just in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a mix of horror a to then also </v>

2612
01:50:53.531 --> 01:50:58.531
<v Speaker 1>them because they cut to a certain shots</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're the shots that you </v>

2613
01:50:58.531 --> 01:50:58.531
<v Speaker 1>remember if people running away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>debris,</v>

2614
01:50:58.531 --> 01:51:03.451
<v Speaker 1>but then there was also shots with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just looking at it and then some </v>

2615
01:51:03.451 --> 01:51:05.260
<v Speaker 1>people just like walking at a steady </v>
<v Speaker 1>pace before the second one hit.</v>

2616
01:51:05.590 --> 01:51:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2617
01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:08.500
<v Speaker 1>like nothing for a second.</v>

2618
01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:11.230
<v Speaker 1>When I looked at the people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>there before the,</v>

2619
01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:13.180
<v Speaker 1>You saw like the people running in to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help people.</v>

2620
01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I thought nothing can destroy us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was,</v>

2621
01:51:16.271 --> 01:51:21.271
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of my mindset of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible thing just happened and it was </v>

2622
01:51:21.271 --> 01:51:21.271
<v Speaker 1>before the second one hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like,</v>

2623
01:51:21.271 --> 01:51:21.790
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening?</v>

2624
01:51:22.130 --> 01:51:24.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

2625
01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good example too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that to ever happen again.</v>

2626
01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

2627
01:51:29.010 --> 01:51:30.610
<v Speaker 1>in a smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big scale.</v>

2628
01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:33.460
<v Speaker 1>But do you remember how united everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>was?</v>

2629
01:51:34.250 --> 01:51:35.280
<v Speaker 1>that's why I brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2630
01:51:35.590 --> 01:51:36.340
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2631
01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:41.820
<v Speaker 1>The problem is we became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we somehow took that situation and then </v>

2632
01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:43.220
<v Speaker 1>made everything horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2633
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:45.160
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it waS an us,</v>

2634
01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:46.420
<v Speaker 1>like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

2635
01:51:46.421 --> 01:51:48.130
<v Speaker 1>there was a united us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2636
01:51:48.131 --> 01:51:50.800
<v Speaker 1>it was american,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't just the united us,</v>

2637
01:51:50.801 --> 01:51:53.560
<v Speaker 1>it was also the rest of the world was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic to our plight.</v>

2638
01:51:53.610 --> 01:51:58.610
<v Speaker 4>And there was a headline and some paper </v>
<v Speaker 4>in paris that said,</v>

2639
01:51:59.311 --> 01:52:02.580
<v Speaker 4>we're all americans today that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>never happen now.</v>

2640
01:52:03.090 --> 01:52:05.820
<v Speaker 4>Not in a million years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have the same exact thing happened.</v>

2641
01:52:06.170 --> 01:52:08.220
<v Speaker 4>Would it be they would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you deserve it.</v>

2642
01:52:08.250 --> 01:52:11.070
<v Speaker 4>Why are you in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why you in Afghanistan?</v>

2643
01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:12.750
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't be.</v>

2644
01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:16.800
<v Speaker 4>We're all americans because back then we</v>
<v Speaker 4>had invaded Iraq.</v>

2645
01:52:16.801 --> 01:52:19.170
<v Speaker 4>We hadn't invaded Afghanistan and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

2646
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:22.260
<v Speaker 4>there was so much more sympathy just 16 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

2647
01:52:22.490 --> 01:52:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even closer to.</v>

2648
01:52:23.421 --> 01:52:24.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when charlie hebdo,</v>

2649
01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:25.700
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got hit.</v>

2650
01:52:25.701 --> 01:52:29.420
<v Speaker 1>It was just sweet charlie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when something happens,</v>

2651
01:52:29.421 --> 01:52:29.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2652
01:52:29.961 --> 01:52:31.900
<v Speaker 1>look at what's happening there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want more,</v>

2653
01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:33.320
<v Speaker 1>we want that here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2654
01:52:33.321 --> 01:52:34.010
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2655
01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:37.100
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a death metal thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they've gone down all those people</v>

2656
01:52:37.101 --> 01:52:41.540
<v Speaker 1>that concert or some paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leon France,</v>

2657
01:52:41.541 --> 01:52:41.990
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2658
01:52:41.991 --> 01:52:44.750
<v Speaker 1>the truck driver that drove over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody pull.</v>

2659
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

2660
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:47.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot less of.</v>

2661
01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:52.960
<v Speaker 3>We are right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more of look what's happening and </v>

2662
01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:55.961
<v Speaker 3>it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely more fear based rather </v>

2663
01:52:55.961 --> 01:52:55.961
<v Speaker 3>than if we're just united and we stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>against this,</v>

2664
01:52:55.961 --> 01:52:57.630
<v Speaker 3>there still is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not as big.</v>

2665
01:52:57.770 --> 01:53:02.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in New York right after September </v>

2666
01:53:02.770 --> 01:53:02.770
<v Speaker 3>11th.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't very long afterwards.</v>

2667
01:53:02.770 --> 01:53:05.120
<v Speaker 3>And I remember it was amazing how </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly everybody was.</v>

2668
01:53:05.121 --> 01:53:10.121
<v Speaker 3>It was just a different feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People Were shook and their response in </v>

2669
01:53:10.191 --> 01:53:13.550
<v Speaker 3>recovery to that was people were smarter</v>
<v Speaker 3>and smarter,</v>

2670
01:53:13.551 --> 01:53:16.280
<v Speaker 3>kinder and they were smiling more and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2671
01:53:16.281 --> 01:53:17.830
<v Speaker 3>it was a different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a different feel.</v>

2672
01:53:17.831 --> 01:53:22.220
<v Speaker 3>There was more comradery and massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive respect to first responders.</v>

2673
01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:27.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive respect to police and fire </v>

2674
01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:27.280
<v Speaker 3>department.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had just,</v>

2675
01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:31.121
<v Speaker 3>there was a different feeling and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people felt about them instead of </v>

2676
01:53:31.121 --> 01:53:33.851
<v Speaker 3>being the oppressors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they became the saviors and it not </v>

2677
01:53:33.851 --> 01:53:33.851
<v Speaker 3>fireman.</v>

2678
01:53:33.851 --> 01:53:34.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody ever thinks of the firemen is the</v>

2679
01:53:34.491 --> 01:53:35.580
<v Speaker 3>oppressors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Firemen.</v>

2680
01:53:35.670 --> 01:53:40.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's was a thing in the riots after </v>

2681
01:53:40.670 --> 01:53:40.670
<v Speaker 3>the riots in la where they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking fireman like they were.</v>

2682
01:53:40.930 --> 01:53:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was horrible.</v>

2683
01:53:42.021 --> 01:53:43.670
<v Speaker 3>There was shooting at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

2684
01:53:43.671 --> 01:53:48.671
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thing where people just decided that </v>

2685
01:53:48.671 --> 01:53:49.280
<v Speaker 3>the man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever the man is needed to go down,</v>

2686
01:53:49.281 --> 01:53:54.281
<v Speaker 3>whether it was fire department or police</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were shooting at cops and </v>

2687
01:53:54.281 --> 01:53:58.090
<v Speaker 3>that's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were burning buildings down that </v>

2688
01:53:58.090 --> 01:53:59.180
<v Speaker 3>had nothing to do with the riots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure you saw there was a,</v>

2689
01:53:59.181 --> 01:54:04.181
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a piece on these korean business owners </v>

2690
01:54:04.181 --> 01:54:07.541
<v Speaker 3>in Korea town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were invaded during the riots </v>

2691
01:54:07.541 --> 01:54:07.541
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2692
01:54:07.541 --> 01:54:07.541
<v Speaker 3>they're not the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2693
01:54:07.541 --> 01:54:12.160
<v Speaker 3>the proximity to where all the south </v>
<v Speaker 3>central shit was going down post rodney </v>

2694
01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:16.421
<v Speaker 3>king and these people were on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rooftops just trying to defend their </v>

2695
01:54:16.421 --> 01:54:16.421
<v Speaker 3>stores and trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2696
01:54:16.421 --> 01:54:20.950
<v Speaker 3>stop looters from taking away everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>they earned and everything they worked </v>

2697
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.950
<v Speaker 3>for their whole lives.</v>

2698
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:25.450
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those moments when things get chaotic,</v>

2699
01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:30.880
<v Speaker 3>they do open up the door for people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>reconsider how fortunate we are when </v>

2700
01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:31.500
<v Speaker 3>things aren't chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2701
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.000
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a very unfortunate thing </v>

2702
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:37.000
<v Speaker 3>that we only open up our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

2703
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.121
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our open ourselves up after something </v>

2704
01:54:41.121 --> 01:54:41.121
<v Speaker 3>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2705
01:54:41.121 --> 01:54:42.110
<v Speaker 3>and because I think that we see horrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing after a horrible thing,</v>

2706
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:47.870
<v Speaker 3>we slowly get further and further away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from being able to unite just because </v>

2707
01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:51.461
<v Speaker 3>it's at least in our 24 slash seven news</v>
<v Speaker 3>cycle it seems like if that's just the </v>

2708
01:54:51.461 --> 01:54:52.010
<v Speaker 3>world we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2709
01:54:52.011 --> 01:54:55.310
<v Speaker 3>It's just like they're scary shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully we can keep that away from us.</v>

2710
01:54:56.150 --> 01:54:57.920
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes back to what we're talking about</v>

2711
01:54:57.921 --> 01:55:02.921
<v Speaker 3>really early on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just honestly think we're taking in </v>

2712
01:55:02.921 --> 01:55:05.830
<v Speaker 3>too much data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your life in my life should really </v>

2713
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:10.541
<v Speaker 3>revolve around the people that were in </v>
<v Speaker 3>contact with the people that we </v>

2714
01:55:10.541 --> 01:55:14.711
<v Speaker 3>communicate with and our immediate </v>
<v Speaker 3>surroundings and our immediate </v>

2715
01:55:14.711 --> 01:55:15.290
<v Speaker 3>surroundings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We both work in the same area.</v>

2716
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:17.690
<v Speaker 3>It's really pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really fine.</v>

2717
01:55:17.691 --> 01:55:19.850
<v Speaker 3>And the folks we run into for the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>part,</v>

2718
01:55:19.851 --> 01:55:23.530
<v Speaker 3>like 99 point nine percent of them are </v>
<v Speaker 3>very pleasant and hi,</v>

2721
01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:31.060
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's really how we're supposed to </v>

2722
01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:31.060
<v Speaker 3>be thinking about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

2723
01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:34.820
<v Speaker 3>this is our world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now our world is extended to include</v>

2724
01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan and North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is happening here and what's </v>

2725
01:55:39.850 --> 01:55:40.520
<v Speaker 3>happening there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear that?</v>

2726
01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:44.190
<v Speaker 3>King john owns half brother was with </v>
<v Speaker 3>some toxic</v>

2727
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:46.230
<v Speaker 4>painters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like fuck man,</v>

<v Speaker 4>There's too much.</v>

2730
01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:53.670
<v Speaker 4>And that can really give you this really</v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre,</v>

2731
01:55:53.671 --> 01:55:57.270
<v Speaker 4>twisted sense of the state of the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the.</v>

2732
01:55:57.780 --> 01:56:02.780
<v Speaker 4>If you just go out now and look at like </v>
<v Speaker 4>bill hicks used to have a joke about </v>

2733

<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about watching cnn and it was all about.</v>

<v Speaker 4>turner.</v>

2735

01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:12.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd be like today on the news aids,</v>

2737
01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:13.030
<v Speaker 4>death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>murder,</v>

2738
01:56:13.050 --> 01:56:14.660
<v Speaker 4>pitbulls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guns,</v>

2739
01:56:14.770 --> 01:56:19.770
<v Speaker 4>stabbings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you go outside hear birds chirping </v>

2740
01:56:19.770 --> 01:56:20.600
<v Speaker 4>or where the fuck is all this happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget</v>

2741
01:56:20.670 --> 01:56:21.910
<v Speaker 1>what I was listening to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

2742
01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:26.920
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a comparison to when people are </v>

2743
01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:26.920
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're thinking about the country,</v>

2744
01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:29.490
<v Speaker 1>all of that is usually far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far different when they talk about their</v>

2745
01:56:29.491 --> 01:56:32.730
<v Speaker 1>local community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because our local community were like,</v>

2746
01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:33.520
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are for them.</v>

2747
01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:38.600
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think things are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there are places where bad </v>

2748
01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:38.600
<v Speaker 1>shit's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we look at our own community,</v>

2749
01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:43.431
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great and I do think that's a </v>

2750
01:56:43.431 --> 01:56:43.431
<v Speaker 1>place where we start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2751
01:56:43.431 --> 01:56:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Make me for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>May make the local good and try and </v>

2752
01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:47.430
<v Speaker 1>expand from there because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2753
01:56:47.431 --> 01:56:52.080
<v Speaker 1>when when you look out and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at it specifically like chicago</v>

2754
01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:55.500
<v Speaker 1>as the state of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what it is.</v>

2755
01:56:55.501 --> 01:57:00.501
<v Speaker 1>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're sitting side of chicago was </v>

2756
01:57:00.501 --> 01:57:00.660
<v Speaker 1>actually really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2757
01:57:00.810 --> 01:57:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2758
01:57:01.231 --> 01:57:06.231
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again you have to look at specific </v>

2759
01:57:06.231 --> 01:57:07.881
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like when trump is saying when </v>

2760
01:57:07.881 --> 01:57:11.210
<v Speaker 1>donald trump's talking about chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is stuff that I've been talking to </v>

2761
01:57:11.210 --> 01:57:11.210
<v Speaker 1>my show like two years.</v>

2762
01:57:11.210 --> 01:57:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I had segments almost every monday where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like this is how many people died</v>

2763
01:57:15.210 --> 01:57:19.470
<v Speaker 1>in chicago and it's crazy numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you look,</v>

2764
01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:21.210
<v Speaker 1>you look close and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2765
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:26.270
<v Speaker 1>things are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's where everyone needs </v>

2766
01:57:26.270 --> 01:57:28.311
<v Speaker 1>to start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start locally and then kind of expand </v>

2767
01:57:28.311 --> 01:57:30.150
<v Speaker 1>from there to get that local to somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>or another make its way into chicago.</v>

2768
01:57:30.210 --> 01:57:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because most people,</v>

2769
01:57:31.951 --> 01:57:32.830
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your,</v>

2770
01:57:32.831 --> 01:57:34.980
<v Speaker 1>your small little group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2771
01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:37.860
<v Speaker 1>you're in a great position where I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk to hundreds of thousands,</v>

2772
01:57:37.861 --> 01:57:39.510
<v Speaker 1>millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same for me.</v>

2773
01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2774
01:57:40.581 --> 01:57:45.581
<v Speaker 1>and we're in this exceptional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing position that of I feel like I'm</v>

2775
01:57:45.601 --> 01:57:49.500
<v Speaker 1>so scared to do the wrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how were you scared to do the wrong?</v>

2776
01:57:49.610 --> 01:57:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to mislead people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean in the sense of like </v>

2777
01:57:54.610 --> 01:57:57.081
<v Speaker 1>when I do my show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like I have a whole team for </v>

2778
01:57:57.081 --> 01:57:57.081
<v Speaker 1>full production and stuff like that.</v>

2779
01:57:57.081 --> 01:58:01.280
<v Speaker 1>But I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm researching it because it's my name </v>

2780
01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:03.951
<v Speaker 1>on the line and I want to really in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past year and a half just focusing like </v>

2781
01:58:03.951 --> 01:58:05.520
<v Speaker 1>how do we get to the truth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not infallible.</v>

2782
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:07.590
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be mistakes and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>along the way.</v>

2783
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:12.570
<v Speaker 1>But how can I try and I guess I got 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes to 20 minutes of someone's life.</v>

2784
01:58:12.630 --> 01:58:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

2785
01:58:13.411 --> 01:58:18.411
<v Speaker 1>that's hUge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with how much information </v>

2786
01:58:18.411 --> 01:58:20.631
<v Speaker 1>people are getting and people hold on to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that they see in a fucking two </v>

2787
01:58:20.631 --> 01:58:24.580
<v Speaker 1>second glimmer of a tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to make sure that I'm trying </v>

2788
01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:26.790
<v Speaker 1>in that way to make my community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which happens to be a little larger than</v>

2789
01:58:26.791 --> 01:58:28.410
<v Speaker 1>your everyday joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2790
01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Like a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

2791
01:58:30.121 --> 01:58:31.860
<v Speaker 1>smart place where we don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree,</v>

2792
01:58:31.861 --> 01:58:33.480
<v Speaker 1>but we're working on iT.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

2793
01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:34.990
<v Speaker 4>You're doing the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2794
01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:37.130
<v Speaker 4>It's very admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2795
01:58:37.131 --> 01:58:42.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what we're talking about with </v>

2796
01:58:42.131 --> 01:58:42.680
<v Speaker 4>chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Syria and all these other things too,</v>

2797
01:58:42.681 --> 01:58:47.681
<v Speaker 4>just when you're dealIng with the data </v>
<v Speaker 4>from 7 billion people and that is </v>

2798
01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:49.600
<v Speaker 4>unfathomable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible.</v>

2799
01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:54.780
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible to handle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's why take a look then look </v>

2800
01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:55.750
<v Speaker 4>like you're saying around you and start </v>
<v Speaker 4>from there.</v>

2801
01:58:55.900 --> 01:59:00.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because otherwise you're going to at </v>

2802
01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:02.641
<v Speaker 4>some point and just be completely wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's probably a good idea </v>

2803
01:59:02.641 --> 01:59:04.000
<v Speaker 4>for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You and I included to filter out some of</v>

2804
01:59:04.001 --> 01:59:09.001
<v Speaker 4>the data that we're taking in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just too much at this point in </v>

2805
01:59:09.001 --> 01:59:12.601
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can just be inundated with horrific </v>

2806
01:59:12.601 --> 01:59:13.160
<v Speaker 4>news all day long if you so choose to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2807
01:59:13.210 --> 01:59:14.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there those rabbIt holes you can.</v>

2808
01:59:15.010 --> 01:59:16.900
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's just there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alex Jones,</v>

2809
01:59:16.901 --> 01:59:18.250
<v Speaker 4>until your fucking head explodes.</v>

2810
01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:23.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean you really could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can go down to all the dark pizza </v>

2811
01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:23.280
<v Speaker 4>gate rabbit holes until you can't take </v>
<v Speaker 4>it anymore.</v>

2812
01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:27.961
<v Speaker 4>It's just you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can find the worst parts of the </v>

2813
01:59:27.961 --> 01:59:28.330
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the worst pockets of terrorism,</v>

2814
01:59:28.331 --> 01:59:33.331
<v Speaker 4>the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you just absorb yourself in that </v>

2815
01:59:33.331 --> 01:59:34.390
<v Speaker 4>data and then you wIll be convinced </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the life that is the world,</v>

2816
01:59:34.450 --> 01:59:38.350
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's why people have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight a good fight right now to be like,</v>

2817
01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:39.850
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're heroes.</v>

2818
01:59:40.030 --> 01:59:45.030
<v Speaker 4>But I think that's why you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that throw themselves out there </v>

2819
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:47.110
<v Speaker 4>that are going to get steamrolled by </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that oppose on that specific day,</v>

2820
01:59:47.111 --> 01:59:52.111
<v Speaker 4>that viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to have those people </v>

2821
01:59:52.111 --> 01:59:53.170
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise the just the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have that time that want to see the</v>

2822
01:59:53.171 --> 01:59:55.540
<v Speaker 4>world just fucking implode.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2823
01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:58.180
<v Speaker 4>They're the people that have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that have that time,</v>

2824
01:59:58.181 --> 02:00:03.181
<v Speaker 4>so we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think be dedicated to have a </v>

2825
02:00:03.181 --> 02:00:03.181
<v Speaker 4>conversation and this is the last thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to ask you about,</v>

2826
02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:07.390
<v Speaker 4>and this might come off as being silly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think there might be some validity</v>

2827
02:00:07.391 --> 02:00:07.660
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>

2828
02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:13.020
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that this ability that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have and and I have and all the people </v>

2829
02:00:13.020 --> 02:00:17.911
<v Speaker 4>that come on this podcast or any podcast</v>
<v Speaker 4>have this new ability to express ideas </v>

2830
02:00:17.911 --> 02:00:22.831
<v Speaker 4>and communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that that is having an </v>

2831
02:00:22.831 --> 02:00:25.891
<v Speaker 4>effect on the way people view the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that this open form of communication</v>

2832
02:00:28.031 --> 02:00:30.750
<v Speaker 4>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I with I,</v>

2833
02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:35.760
<v Speaker 4>I've never been trained in the media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you Trained as an emt but he told </v>

2834
02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:39.310
<v Speaker 4>you how to do this right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you and I to normal people,</v>

2835
02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:44.760
<v Speaker 4>we can communicate to millions of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>having this conversation and then </v>

2836
02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:49.050
<v Speaker 4>millions of people will talk to their </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends and express their own opinions.</v>

2837
02:00:50.831 --> 02:00:52.120
<v Speaker 4>Whether they agree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>disagree,</v>

2838
02:00:52.121 --> 02:00:54.310
<v Speaker 4>or maybe have some other things to add </v>
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>

2839
02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:59.580
<v Speaker 4>They express that to their friends at </v>
<v Speaker 4>work and their friends you know at home </v>

2840
02:00:59.620 --> 02:01:04.620
<v Speaker 4>and these dialogues take on a life of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their own and they they they these ideas</v>

2841
02:01:05.590 --> 02:01:10.590
<v Speaker 4>that we're expressing and that other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people expressing at work or at play </v>

2842
02:01:10.590 --> 02:01:15.080
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're more potent now and they spread </v>

2843
02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:18.721
<v Speaker 4>faster now than they ever have before </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think there's an evolution of </v>

2844
02:01:18.721 --> 02:01:19.240
<v Speaker 4>ideas that's taking place now.</v>

2845
02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:24.360
<v Speaker 4>Good and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where all the whIte privilege </v>

2846
02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:26.821
<v Speaker 4>shit comes from and all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the gender politics and all the </v>

2847
02:01:26.821 --> 02:01:30.520
<v Speaker 4>weirdness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of it comes from these turbo charged</v>

2848
02:01:30.521 --> 02:01:35.521
<v Speaker 4>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these nuclear ideas now where ideas </v>

2849
02:01:35.521 --> 02:01:38.701
<v Speaker 4>spread to the point where words become </v>
<v Speaker 4>taboo and use the wrong gender pronoun </v>

2850
02:01:40.611 --> 02:01:45.611
<v Speaker 4>when you're talking about a trans person</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're the worst human ever and all </v>

2851
02:01:45.611 --> 02:01:48.971
<v Speaker 4>these new things that are existing and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think these new things are because </v>

2852
02:01:49.730 --> 02:01:54.680
<v Speaker 4>dialogue and information is just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has a different weight to it now.</v>

2853
02:01:54.681 --> 02:01:56.660
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like the gravity has shifted</v>
<v Speaker 4>on it.</v>

2854
02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:01.760
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the reason why we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>our positions and other people do it is </v>

2855
02:02:02.190 --> 02:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>because it is that it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a dialogue.</v>

2856
02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>It is in a weird way and extended </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>

2857
02:02:07.501 --> 02:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>group friends talking about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where people have,</v>

2858
02:02:11.731 --> 02:02:16.731
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best conversations as far as where </v>

2859
02:02:16.731 --> 02:02:16.731
<v Speaker 1>we grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2860
02:02:16.731 --> 02:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>If mean they constantly come out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers of the trust in media,</v>

2861
02:02:20.370 --> 02:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like they have an agenda,</v>

2862
02:02:22.321 --> 02:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>but if it's just people talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2863
02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:26.060
<v Speaker 1>this guy's talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2864
02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>that you don't feel like joe's got this </v>
<v Speaker 1>agenda that he wants to just shoved down</v>

2865
02:02:30.121 --> 02:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>everyone's throat or they're gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that say that.</v>

2866
02:02:32.041 --> 02:02:35.250
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2867
02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be shit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>then becomes this like confirmation </v>

2868
02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:45.111
<v Speaker 1>bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only deal with the friends that </v>

2869
02:02:45.111 --> 02:02:45.111
<v Speaker 1>confirm what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>

2870
02:02:45.111 --> 02:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a very good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's where it's the more human way to,</v>

2871
02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:52.360
<v Speaker 1>to take in information and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and form an opinion and,</v>

2872
02:02:52.361 --> 02:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>and grow from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

2873
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:56.430
<v Speaker 4>that opinion's going to shift to and </v>
<v Speaker 4>move around.</v>

2874
02:02:56.630 --> 02:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when people look back and </v>

2875
02:03:01.630 --> 02:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person flip flop,</v>

2876
02:03:01.630 --> 02:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>that person fucking grew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully.</v>

2877
02:03:01.630 --> 02:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iT could be completely calculated it on </v>

2878
02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>pandora and blah blah</v>

2879
02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:06.700
<v Speaker 4>data or change who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2880
02:03:06.701 --> 02:03:07.310
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you</v>

2881
02:03:07.330 --> 02:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flip flopping things so silly.</v>

2882
02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2883
02:03:10.211 --> 02:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>this person has a yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully,</v>

2884
02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:16.740
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you can have a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion that you're not locked into </v>

2885
02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:16.740
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

2886
02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:19.620
<v Speaker 1>I think that everyone needs to focus on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it with like the not the,</v>

2887
02:03:19.630 --> 02:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>not ever going to school for this sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

2888
02:03:22.571 --> 02:03:25.810
<v Speaker 1>I've never taken a journalism class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about it in a video.</v>

2889
02:03:26.050 --> 02:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I focus on,</v>

2890
02:03:27.130 --> 02:03:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I call like the liquor method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2891
02:03:28.590 --> 02:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I listened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I questioned,</v>

2892
02:03:30.490 --> 02:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I research and I refute right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I take in as many sources as I can,</v>

2893
02:03:35.410 --> 02:03:40.410
<v Speaker 1>whether it be the huffington post and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cnn or fox news,</v>

2894
02:03:40.721 --> 02:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>breitbart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the donald,</v>

2895
02:03:41.771 --> 02:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>anything I want to see where everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from,</v>

2896
02:03:43.570 --> 02:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I start throwing out questions,</v>

2897
02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:46.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

2898
02:03:46.370 --> 02:03:47.650
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does this come from?</v>

2899
02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:52.860
<v Speaker 1>What do they say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go down that rabbit hole with research </v>

2900
02:03:52.860 --> 02:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm armed with information.</v>

2901
02:03:52.900 --> 02:03:57.900
<v Speaker 1>That's why I think whether you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>milo or you have fucking anybody let </v>

2902
02:03:57.900 --> 02:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>people talk so you can learn because </v>
<v Speaker 1>information's ammo,</v>

2903
02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Information,</v>

2904
02:04:00.521 --> 02:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>something that you can take in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

2905
02:04:03.070 --> 02:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a flawed argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's opinion based,</v>

2906
02:04:05.921 --> 02:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>if it's a flawed argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can use it and then,</v>

2907
02:04:09.290 --> 02:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's not a flawed argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking learn something,</v>

2908
02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

2909
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you thought you were right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were wrong.</v>

2910
02:04:14.831 --> 02:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

2911
02:04:16.270 --> 02:04:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flip flop,</v>

2912
02:04:18.041 --> 02:04:19.720
<v Speaker 1>have a different opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2913
02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm for it all day.</v>

2914
02:04:21.641 --> 02:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I think you got to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are people that wake up in</v>

2915
02:04:25.661 --> 02:04:27.280
<v Speaker 1>the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fucking burn the world,</v>

2916
02:04:27.281 --> 02:04:32.281
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I refuse to believe that that's the </v>

2917
02:04:32.281 --> 02:04:32.281
<v Speaker 1>majority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2918
02:04:32.281 --> 02:04:35.870
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to start trying to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people I think that are sensible </v>

2919
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>that at the very least think they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensible.</v>

2920
02:04:36.250 --> 02:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Weed ouT.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones really aren't once</v>

2921
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:41.940
<v Speaker 3>tested and just fucking go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a hundred percent with you.</v>

2922
02:04:41.970 --> 02:04:44.580
<v Speaker 3>And I really liked what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think you're a very reasonable</v>

2923
02:04:44.581 --> 02:04:47.070
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're very well thought out and</v>

2924
02:04:47.071 --> 02:04:50.880
<v Speaker 3>when you consider things like the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>recent milo video you're being,</v>

2925
02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:55.920
<v Speaker 3>you're being very fair and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world needs more of that reasonable and </v>

2926
02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:57.180
<v Speaker 3>fair.</v>

2928
02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:02.790

<v Speaker 3>That's it for the week.</v>
