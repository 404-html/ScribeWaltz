00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>have to put their phones in the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I stopped doing it.</v>

62
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated.</v>

63
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>It's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes.</v>

64
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're doing two shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a giant space in between them,</v>

65
00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>but never have I seen a crowd like</v>

66
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 2>cause you to use your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to get out of the arena and </v>

67
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.681
<v Speaker 2>then come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was just constantly going out </v>

68
00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're constantly getting up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it was like I was doing standup not in </v>

70
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 2>front of people sitting down in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in a constant state of moving,</v>

71
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 2>sitting down and getting up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking insane.</v>

72
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 2>Just constantly moving like no place </v>

73
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.940

<v Speaker 2>if you want to starve to death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open up a bookstore in Miami,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm not comfortable with that.</v>

92
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.440
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what are we going to do?</v>

93
00:04:12.441 --> 00:04:13.760
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to tread lightly.</v>

155
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.610

<v Speaker 1>drops his pants and it is huge.</v>

156
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.350
<v Speaker 1>No hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a lighthouse.</v>

157
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Just I just dropped the mic because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my show and I just walk off </v>

158
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the FA that will.</v>

159
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>That club was fun,</v>

160
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 3>insane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>

161
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.430
<v Speaker 3>You know what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They started giving out free tickets and</v>

162
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.450
<v Speaker 3>just went off the charts like no one was</v>
<v Speaker 3>paying and it was all just like young </v>

163
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.270
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember I had a joke once where I</v>

164
00:07:09.271 --> 00:07:13.380
<v Speaker 3>said something about I think Oscar de la</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hoya.</v>

165
00:07:13.381 --> 00:07:15.650
<v Speaker 3>It was like a joke about boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about like,</v>

166
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking a left hook from Oscar de la Hoya</v>

167
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.770
<v Speaker 3>and someone yells out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck him,</v>

168
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.360
<v Speaker 3>fuck him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fernando Vargas.</v>

169
00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:22.650
<v Speaker 3>And then somebody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck him.</v>

170
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.680
<v Speaker 3>So Chavez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they just started fucking debating </v>

171
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.680
<v Speaker 3>about what my guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a joke,</v>

172
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.860
<v Speaker 3>has nothing to do with boxing even what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck.</v>

173
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.040
<v Speaker 3>But it turned into this like gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument over which Latino boxer is </v>

174
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

175
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 3>craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been to a club that was more </v>

176
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.090
<v Speaker 3>out of control and I saw it get out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>control because when I first started </v>

177
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.910
<v Speaker 3>working there it was fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was fine,</v>

178
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.420
<v Speaker 3>and then somewhere along the line it </v>
<v Speaker 3>just went to chaos.</v>

179
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 3>They started doing just rowdy and ratty </v>
<v Speaker 3>or acts that getting more and more young</v>

180
00:07:56.941 --> 00:08:01.941
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then sometimes you'd go there and </v>

181
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:01.941
<v Speaker 3>the whole audience you'd be like 18.</v>

182
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

183
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not everyone spoke English.</v>

184
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:05.540
<v Speaker 1>That was another real problem in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>

185
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 3>You never saw anybody kill like you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>diaz do spanglish in front of those </v>

186
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.750
<v Speaker 3>fucking people.</v>

187
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he came up in that club while he</v>

188
00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:17.120
<v Speaker 1>was always there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think him and ricky,</v>

189
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:22.510
<v Speaker 1>ricky crews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those guys had all worked at club </v>

190
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>and just wore job at Joey murmured or</v>

191
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Bert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd worked with Joey there a ton of </v>

192
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:30.010
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

193
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Joey and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we knew how to work together like it </v>

194
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:33.820
<v Speaker 3>worked and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

195
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.170
<v Speaker 3>from doing the comedy store so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just used to chaos and then you get </v>

196
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:39.180
<v Speaker 3>used to chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked it.</v>

197
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fun,</v>

198
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.700
<v Speaker 3>it's fun sometimes you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as you're not filming a special </v>

199
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.910
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a shell.</v>

200
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 3>It's just a show and it's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>

201
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.440
<v Speaker 1>That was my first taping and Philly </v>
<v Speaker 1>philly's wild ass place to I I call it </v>

202
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 1>called Tommy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

203
00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 1>that's why we taped to brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have good,</v>

204
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.520
<v Speaker 1>good luck on the next one.</v>

205
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take for now.</v>

206
00:09:01.581 --> 00:09:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do for now.</v>

207
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is genius.</v>

208
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.980
<v Speaker 2>So way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really should do six.</v>

209
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Chappelle did nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the way to go.</v>

210
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.250
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is like you want to make </v>

211
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.281
<v Speaker 2>it the most like a regular show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ironic thing is most of what I </v>

212
00:09:18.281 --> 00:09:21.851
<v Speaker 2>use I use from the first show because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so loose because I know I have four </v>

213
00:09:21.851 --> 00:09:22.850
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's different.</v>

214
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.540
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

215
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.360
<v Speaker 2>it's when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you film in one show,</v>

216
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.540
<v Speaker 2>like always remember seeing a bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hicks.</v>

217
00:09:29.541 --> 00:09:32.780
<v Speaker 2>Relentless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the one he did in the UK,</v>

218
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.580
<v Speaker 2>is a big theater in the UK and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

219
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:40.490
<v Speaker 2>giant production.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes out to like a Jimi Hendrix song</v>

220
00:09:40.491 --> 00:09:45.491
<v Speaker 2>and his fire behind them and all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and you could feel the tension,</v>

221
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:51.110
<v Speaker 2>like he's got tension because he's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>one shot at this and he did a great job,</v>

222
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.490
<v Speaker 2>but it was stiff.</v>

223
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.820
<v Speaker 2>It's just stiff and like I was dating </v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl at the time.</v>

224
00:09:55.821 --> 00:10:00.821
<v Speaker 2>She's very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had washed it with her and she's </v>

225
00:10:00.821 --> 00:10:01.700
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's interesting,</v>

226
00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:04.220
<v Speaker 2>but this is not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way she said that.</v>

227
00:10:04.221 --> 00:10:05.060
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

228
00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:07.760
<v Speaker 2>Like I was a giant Bill Hicks van.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like hurt.</v>

229
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to argue with her,</v>

230
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:14.441
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't argue with her because she's </v>

231
00:10:14.441 --> 00:10:14.441
<v Speaker 2>kind of right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't.</v>

232
00:10:14.441 --> 00:10:18.910
<v Speaker 2>I didn't laugh when I was such a fan </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like watching him was important to </v>

233
00:10:18.921 --> 00:10:23.921
<v Speaker 2>me early on wanting to watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like because I felt like he was a very </v>

234
00:10:23.921 --> 00:10:25.190
<v Speaker 2>important figure in comedy even though </v>
<v Speaker 2>rh fear shits on them relentlessly,</v>

235
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.120
<v Speaker 2>but I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was watching him,</v>

236
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.760
<v Speaker 2>he's an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I was watching them I was </v>

237
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.660
<v Speaker 2>thinking she's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really making me laugh at all,</v>

238
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.530
<v Speaker 2>but I know the materials well thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and it's very good.</v>

239
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.920
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just that.</v>

240
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.220
<v Speaker 2>And I recognized that one show thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're filming one show.</v>

241
00:10:46.221 --> 00:10:47.240

242
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.250
<v Speaker 1>See I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because I come from a,</v>

243
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.630
<v Speaker 1>like a baseball sports background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like having pressure on me.</v>

244
00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:59.631
<v Speaker 1>I love that feeling of you got one shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>so affiliated to and the first one it </v>

245
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:04.851
<v Speaker 1>rained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the generator went out and we had to </v>

246
00:11:04.851 --> 00:11:04.851
<v Speaker 1>hold the audience in the rain for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour and a half.</v>

247
00:11:04.851 --> 00:11:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lost their buzz right there.</v>

248
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:12.531
<v Speaker 1>Soaking wet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They finally come into the show in the </v>

249
00:11:12.531 --> 00:11:13.200
<v Speaker 1>show that they're trying to catch a buzz</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

250
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.480
<v Speaker 1>And it was a bad show.</v>

00:15:10.481 --> 00:15:13.781
<v Speaker 3>regular people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that aren't necessarily there to </v>

349
00:15:13.781 --> 00:15:16.001
<v Speaker 3>see you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the beautiful thing about the </v>

350
00:15:16.001 --> 00:15:16.001
<v Speaker 3>stores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's 15 people in the lineup or 20</v>

351
00:15:16.001 --> 00:15:16.001
<v Speaker 3>people in the lineup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

352
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.070
<v Speaker 3>how many others see you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ten percent,</v>

353
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 3>30 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 percent.</v>

354
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:21.690
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

355
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.410
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're there to see you and Talia</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also,</v>

356
00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tom and also Christina,</v>

357
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.670
<v Speaker 3>like it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just comedy fans,</v>

358
00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.240
<v Speaker 3>crusher fans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

359
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:31.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

360
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.340
<v Speaker 3>that's giant as jarring because those </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

361
00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:39.341
<v Speaker 3>they like develop like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a few people that develop an </v>

362
00:15:39.341 --> 00:15:42.671
<v Speaker 3>audience and that's all their audience </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just get real complacent,</v>

363
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:44.000
<v Speaker 3>real lazy.</v>

364
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.190
<v Speaker 1>The um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

365
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

366
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.430
<v Speaker 1>I say lightly because there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet comics,</v>

367
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.940
<v Speaker 1>meaning like youtube comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that do comedy now.</v>

368
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.640
<v Speaker 1>And some are good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some are good and some are developing.</v>

369
00:15:55.641 --> 00:15:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just saying that to be polite,</v>

370
00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.480
<v Speaker 1>but like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that one guy,</v>

371
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:02.690
<v Speaker 1>he got booed off stage in Montreal </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's been performing to fan.</v>

372
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well here's the other thing about that </v>

373
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:07.960
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy goes up on a show where there's</v>

374
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.880
<v Speaker 3>all these other comedians on and then at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of his set says that comedy </v>

375
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.730
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be about about preaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be about making people laugh,</v>

376
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't be about ethics or morals,</v>

377
00:16:23.541 --> 00:16:27.500
<v Speaker 3>sexuality or race or sexuality or race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be about making people laugh.</v>

378
00:16:27.501 --> 00:16:29.930
<v Speaker 3>People pay to forget about that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bitch,</v>

379
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.190
<v Speaker 3>you are on stage not making people </v>
<v Speaker 3>laugh.</v>

380
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.740
<v Speaker 3>That is what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You silly.</v>

381
00:16:36.741 --> 00:16:39.860
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it is one of the silliest things </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever seen in my life.</v>

382
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:45.190
<v Speaker 3>It's like this is an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's essentially a beginning comic,</v>

383
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:46.480
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open mic.</v>

384
00:16:46.481 --> 00:16:48.970
<v Speaker 1>He's maybe been doing standup for three </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

385
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.440
<v Speaker 3>so he does like videos and the videos </v>
<v Speaker 3>are very popular and they're funny.</v>

386
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're from the south,</v>

387
00:16:53.941 --> 00:16:58.941
<v Speaker 3>they're really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just someone's doing your shit unless </v>

388
00:16:58.941 --> 00:17:00.900
<v Speaker 3>they're stealing or stealing from </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody else,</v>

389
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:06.350
<v Speaker 3>just do your fucking act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless something happened before you </v>

390
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.951
<v Speaker 3>that's so egregious and ridiculous that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like you have to address it </v>

391
00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:14.301
<v Speaker 3>when you go on stage because it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in the room and to just try to </v>

392
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:17.331
<v Speaker 3>do ever notice when you pick up your </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone if you just try to do that and </v>

393
00:17:17.331 --> 00:17:18.090
<v Speaker 3>everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck you not going to address,</v>

394
00:17:18.091 --> 00:17:23.091
<v Speaker 3>which has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you have to address what just </v>

395
00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:23.091
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like sometimes someone will go on before</v>

396
00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:26.700
<v Speaker 3>you and just eat so much shit that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to say something.</v>

397
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.280
<v Speaker 3>You have to say something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>

398
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what that guy did was ridiculous.</v>

399
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.670
<v Speaker 1>It's to tell someone what comedy is and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what isn't.</v>

400
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I'd said I'd read an article about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

401
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:44.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming she's a gay woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote about like trashing Hannah Gadsby </v>

402
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:44.550
<v Speaker 1>and going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

403
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.830
<v Speaker 1>we're gay and we're doing standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

404
00:17:46.831 --> 00:17:48.150
<v Speaker 1>We're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not just preaching.</v>

405
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.670
<v Speaker 1>We're doing stand up comedy about her </v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma and it's working.</v>

406
00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:55.671
<v Speaker 1>You just don't see us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't write us off and say comedy is </v>

407
00:17:55.671 --> 00:17:55.671
<v Speaker 1>dead because you don't see us.</v>

408
00:17:55.671 --> 00:17:57.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Hannah Gadsby saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedies dead.</v>

409
00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.740
<v Speaker 3>I think journalists are saying comedies </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead,</v>

410
00:17:59.741 --> 00:18:04.741
<v Speaker 3>and I think we're all buying into it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because these people were writing these </v>

411
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:07.981
<v Speaker 3>articles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not even in comedy there just </v>

412
00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:10.471
<v Speaker 3>comedy fans or fans of her and what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think she did and I've only seen part of</v>

413
00:18:10.691 --> 00:18:10.870
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

414
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.890
<v Speaker 1>I saw the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you right now.</v>

415
00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one joke I like</v>

416
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever she did is fine.</v>

417
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.110
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's her artwork.</v>

418
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.880
<v Speaker 3>This is what she's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>

419
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

420
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 3>If people enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

421
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.420
<v Speaker 3>The problem with comedy is that comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>is one category.</v>

422
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.350
<v Speaker 3>It's just comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but comedy could be Cat Stevens,</v>

423
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.950
<v Speaker 3>it could be guns and roses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be the Geto boys.</v>

424
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.770
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you go to see music,</v>

425
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.560
<v Speaker 3>there's very distinct genres.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no.</v>

426
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.140
<v Speaker 3>There's just comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comedy is just comedy.</v>

427
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Like you could go see a folk singer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing on stage,</v>

428
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:52.251
<v Speaker 3>like really slow and quiet his music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you go to fucking led Zepplin </v>

429
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.420
<v Speaker 3>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

430
00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:57.240
<v Speaker 3>well that's music to how the fuck is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that music too?</v>

431
00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.450
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is motley crew the same kind of </v>

432
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:02.450
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Cat Power?</v>

433
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:03.120
<v Speaker 3>How is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are they?</v>

434
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.050
<v Speaker 3>How are they the same?</v>

435
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.320
<v Speaker 3>Will they are both music just like we do</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy and she's doing a version of </v>

436
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:15.171
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of it is really funny and some of </v>

437
00:19:15.171 --> 00:19:16.740
<v Speaker 3>it is her just talking about stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a very serious way.</v>

438
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:17.950
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

439
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 3>That we're not against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what's crazy.</v>

440
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

441
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.520
<v Speaker 3>this is deconstructing comedy and comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>is dead now.</v>

442
00:19:23.521 --> 00:19:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

443
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.280
<v Speaker 3>We know she's doing what she's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you enjoy it and that's what you want</v>

444
00:19:29.281 --> 00:19:30.840
<v Speaker 3>to see more of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go see that.</v>

445
00:19:30.841 --> 00:19:31.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what she goes.</v>

446
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:32.490
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

447
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:38.150
<v Speaker 1>She was a great joke about Unicorns that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I giggled about once a week and I'll </v>

448
00:19:38.641 --> 00:19:39.930
<v Speaker 1>tell her jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all on Netflix.</v>

449
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:41.970
<v Speaker 1>You can see that and when I was growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

450
00:19:41.971 --> 00:19:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I knew more facts about unicorns and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did lesbians.</v>

451
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.220
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no facts about you.</v>

452
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good fucking.</v>

453
00:19:51.651 --> 00:19:54.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a good fucking joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a good joke.</v>

454
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:55.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's her experience,</v>

455
00:19:55.941 --> 00:19:56.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a lesbian.</v>

456
00:19:56.751 --> 00:19:58.460
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard out there for a pimp.</v>

457
00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.770
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking like where we are.</v>

458
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:09.500
<v Speaker 3>I think people create unnecessary and </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial adversaries.</v>

459
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.920
<v Speaker 3>I really do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is one of the ones </v>

460
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.150
<v Speaker 3>that's going on right now in comedy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I see it all the time with this internet</v>

461
00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:16.340
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

462
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.750
<v Speaker 3>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop,</v>

463
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.560
<v Speaker 3>stop with the art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I fall into a too.</v>

464
00:20:21.561 --> 00:20:24.680
<v Speaker 3>I buy a new too and I read some of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>articles like comedy is not dead.</v>

465
00:20:24.681 --> 00:20:26.690
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

466
00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.130
<v Speaker 1>You read the article and you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

467
00:20:28.131 --> 00:20:30.290
<v Speaker 1>She said it like the way that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

468
00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:31.160
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

469
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.260
<v Speaker 1>she's telling us I can't do comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

470
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.350
<v Speaker 1>She didn't say she just did something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone interpreted it that way,</v>

471
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.770
<v Speaker 3>and if she says she can't do comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>

472
00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.140
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

473
00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.610
<v Speaker 3>she could just do like now she's famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

474
00:20:42.611 --> 00:20:46.810
<v Speaker 3>She could just do one woman specials or </v>
<v Speaker 3>one person specials or one entity.</v>

475
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:47.770
<v Speaker 3>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are we</v>

476
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.390
<v Speaker 2>framing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even say it.</v>

477
00:20:49.391 --> 00:20:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I say the gender?</v>

478
00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even be like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't think gender's often off </v>

479
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:56.050
<v Speaker 2>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

480
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:56.830
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's off limits.</v>

481
00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine that when you're a kid,</v>

482
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:01.660
<v Speaker 2>if somebody came up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

483
00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:06.661
<v Speaker 2>one day you're going to have to ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone whether they're a boy or a girl </v>

484
00:21:06.661 --> 00:21:07.660
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to be very delicate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna have to ask them what their</v>

485
00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:09.460
<v Speaker 2>preferred pronouns are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd be like,</v>

486
00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:10.320
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

487
00:21:10.321 --> 00:21:10.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

488
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.800
<v Speaker 2>it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real soon,</v>

489
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.600
<v Speaker 2>like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years.</v>

490
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.780
<v Speaker 2>And then everyone's gonna be this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna be a lot of ambiguity and </v>

491
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.690
<v Speaker 2>ambiguity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird word.</v>

492
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Ambiguity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How often you say that word?</v>

493
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.540
<v Speaker 2>I'll say ambiguous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how often do you say ambiguity?</v>

494
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.490
<v Speaker 2>I've never said it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird one.</v>

495
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I stay away from a lot of big words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially after coffee ambiguity.</v>

496
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:37.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But nobody would have ever anticipated </v>

497
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.630
<v Speaker 2>that there would be debate about gender.</v>

498
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daughter's,</v>

499
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're outside of one of the progressive </v>

500
00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:44.700
<v Speaker 1>bathrooms were not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the bathroom.</v>

501
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.360
<v Speaker 1>And my daughters saw her first dick that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

502
00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Just pushed open the door because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no man or woman.</v>

503
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.060
<v Speaker 1>And then she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh ha ha.</v>

504
00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.320
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it matter?</v>

505
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.910
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just saw a man's penis.</v>

506
00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.040
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't the guy locked the door?</v>

507
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it.</v>

508
00:21:59.841 --> 00:22:02.030
<v Speaker 1>You walk in and you're not thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't lock the door.</v>

509
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.430
<v Speaker 2>So was it at any sex bathroom or was it </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

510
00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.820

<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking know.</v>

512
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.160

<v Speaker 2>I was in a restaurant once,</v>

513
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.660
<v Speaker 2>a restaurant once and I was waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bathroom.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

515
00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.720
<v Speaker 2>finally the door opens and a chick comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>out the men's room and she looked at me </v>

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:02.230
<v Speaker 1>Don't put up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just telling Jamie back like </v>

579
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.040
<v Speaker 1>before you got here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how important those videos were.</v>

580
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.120
<v Speaker 1>All the videos you shot with Brett with </v>
<v Speaker 1>red band and Ari and Joey,</v>

581
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.880
<v Speaker 1>the joey karate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff you guys use to put online</v>

582
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.860
<v Speaker 1>that's so important to where you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

583
00:25:12.861 --> 00:25:15.410
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean a man?</v>

584
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.680
<v Speaker 1>The I found that stuff when youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>started blowing up,</v>

585
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:21.920
<v Speaker 1>that stuff was in such heavy rotation </v>
<v Speaker 1>for comics,</v>

586
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:27.130
<v Speaker 1>like you'd look for comics and you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizable because of fear factor in </v>

587
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:27.130
<v Speaker 1>news radio.</v>

588
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:32.020
<v Speaker 1>But I've got to those videos and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably watched every single one of the</v>

589
00:25:32.091 --> 00:25:34.190
<v Speaker 1>videos you guys shot as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as did all of us.</v>

590
00:25:34.191 --> 00:25:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Tom Did all of us just because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was the content we could find.</v>

591
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:43.790
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're talking about with </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitch is like get on twitch now and </v>

592
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.590
<v Speaker 1>start uploading content because one day </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone will see it and go,</v>

593
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:46.610
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that guy.</v>

594
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.940
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really believe that you guys were </v>

595
00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 1>so ahead of that curve where people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

596
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how to upload a video.</v>

597
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:59.060
<v Speaker 1>You guys had edited great content </v>
<v Speaker 1>Heckler in Columbus,</v>

598
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>already dealing with a heckler in DC.</v>

599
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.890
<v Speaker 1>The car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feminist arguing with you,</v>

600
00:26:03.891 --> 00:26:05.900
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you choking that guy out the store.</v>

601
00:26:05.901 --> 00:26:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Like those were videos where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

602
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.040
<v Speaker 1>I'd watch them four or five times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of those.</v>

603
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:15.040
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was really good about it was red </v>

604
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:15.040
<v Speaker 1>bands editing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like to do that though.</v>

605
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.300
<v Speaker 1>It's too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too time consuming and he's too lazy.</v>

606
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:22.540
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't like to do video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's really talented like his video </v>

607
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.441
<v Speaker 1>editing skills like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men See a video that was part of why </v>

608
00:26:26.441 --> 00:26:27.530
<v Speaker 1>that video is so popular because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long ass video,</v>

609
00:26:27.531 --> 00:26:30.380
<v Speaker 1>but he's editing skills are so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the music you played?</v>

610
00:26:30.381 --> 00:26:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Dead and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The music was perfect.</v>

611
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

612
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.810
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

613
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.210
<v Speaker 1>he's a really good editor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really,</v>

614
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 1>he's really talented at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so time</v>

615
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:49.310
<v Speaker 3>consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It drives them nuts that he'd rather </v>

616
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.310
<v Speaker 3>just fuck around and do podcasts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a good time.</v>

617
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.680
<v Speaker 3>But when he was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when we were going on the road </v>

618
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:54.680
<v Speaker 3>together and he was filming a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and splicing things together would</v>

619
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.220
<v Speaker 3>make a video every couple months or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

620
00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:57.990
<v Speaker 3>It was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

621
00:26:57.991 --> 00:26:59.820
<v Speaker 3>it was an interesting experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

622
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.230
<v Speaker 3>just just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to fuck around.</v>

623
00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I got into when I got into blogging or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie was like right there when I </v>

624
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.831
<v Speaker 1>started blogging because we were both </v>
<v Speaker 1>found Casey Neistat I think at the same </v>

625
00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:14.461
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got really into blogging and I </v>

626
00:27:14.461 --> 00:27:14.461
<v Speaker 1>loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

627
00:27:14.461 --> 00:27:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I maybe did like 40 episodes and</v>

628
00:27:15.581 --> 00:27:20.581
<v Speaker 1>it was just fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I started realizing it was </v>

629
00:27:20.581 --> 00:27:22.270
<v Speaker 1>cannibalizing my life to a point where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't living an authentic life at all.</v>

630
00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.570
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't writing any material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just shooting everything.</v>

631
00:27:25.571 --> 00:27:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Everything was shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I saw you,</v>

632
00:27:27.251 --> 00:27:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be like,</v>

633
00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.860
<v Speaker 1>oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to hang out with Joe.</v>

634
00:27:29.861 --> 00:27:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

635
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:31.140
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Jew,</v>

636
00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:31.930
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

637
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.450
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

638
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:36.120
<v Speaker 3>The trap that people fall into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

639
00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:37.890
<v Speaker 3>If you look on some people's instagram </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories,</v>

640
00:27:37.891 --> 00:27:39.570
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing man?</v>

641
00:27:39.571 --> 00:27:44.571
<v Speaker 3>You have a million dots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your instagram was like little tiny </v>

642
00:27:44.571 --> 00:27:44.571
<v Speaker 3>dots.dot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dot,</v>

643
00:27:44.571 --> 00:27:45.540
<v Speaker 3>dot.like</v>
<v Speaker 3>your whole day,</v>

644
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.610
<v Speaker 3>your whole day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have just a phone in front of you.</v>

645
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:52.750
<v Speaker 3>What do you just have like constant </v>
<v Speaker 3>battery chargers and you're just </v>

646
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:53.310
<v Speaker 3>constantly charging up your phone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>film and video.</v>

647
00:27:53.311 --> 00:27:53.910
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>

648
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I do it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at Instagram,</v>

649
00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do those stories aggressively if </v>

650
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm running the triathlon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running a marathon,</v>

651
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.890
<v Speaker 1>doing a big event and that's not to tip </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hat or whatever.</v>

652
00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:07.850
<v Speaker 1>We're telling you guys my business plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I do like it.</v>

653
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I like to do big things and then that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how my stories and then I'll fuck around</v>

654
00:28:11.941 --> 00:28:14.820
<v Speaker 1>on the weekend and I'll put up maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>like three stories a day,</v>

655
00:28:14.821 --> 00:28:17.760
<v Speaker 1>five stories a day and I'll show you my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life a little bit.</v>

656
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:20.680
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to,</v>

657
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I try to distance myself from it for two</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

658
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it fucks with my eyesight.</v>

659
00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm on my phone a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

660
00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.650
<v Speaker 1>My eyes are fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

661
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.300
<v Speaker 1>And number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does cannibalize your life,</v>

662
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.970
<v Speaker 1>but what I would like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I want to do,</v>

663
00:28:32.971 --> 00:28:37.971
<v Speaker 1>I think the next level is businesses is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is honestly like going backwards and </v>

664
00:28:37.971 --> 00:28:40.560
<v Speaker 1>doing what you and red band we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with those videos.</v>

665
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:45.590
<v Speaker 1>But getting yourself out of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a guy like red band who that's </v>

666
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.590
<v Speaker 1>his job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

667
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.810
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

668
00:28:45.811 --> 00:28:49.680
<v Speaker 3>the thing is with a guy like red band,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that job is very hard to do.</v>

669
00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Like Brian is uniquely talented at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's his greatest talent.</v>

670
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.740
<v Speaker 3>He's really good at making videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he,</v>

671
00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:03.890
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't like to do it and a lot of </v>

672
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:03.890
<v Speaker 3>people don't like to do it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>time consuming.</v>

673
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.730
<v Speaker 3>So you could just take stuff and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

674
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.100
<v Speaker 3>cut it and paste it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he did more than that.</v>

675
00:29:08.101 --> 00:29:11.380
<v Speaker 3>He had special effects and music and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

676
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.400
<v Speaker 3>what he was doing was he was figuring </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a way to make sometimes mundane </v>

677
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.840
<v Speaker 3>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting and interesting situations.</v>

678
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Way more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

679
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.580
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like for you to say,</v>

680
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to get you,</v>

681
00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.820
<v Speaker 3>like you'd have to find a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you'd almost like to have to get </v>

682
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Brian to start doing it again.</v>

683
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

684
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely,</v>

685
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.850
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie and I were talking about this.</v>

686
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.660
<v Speaker 1>My next step is doing what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a much smaller level,</v>

687
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:38.640
<v Speaker 1>like getting an area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a space,</v>

688
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.470
<v Speaker 1>doing my podcast and my solo podcast of </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

689
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 1>But then creating content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your Solo podcast?</v>

690
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:47.890
<v Speaker 1>You have a solo ones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I do a solo podcast.</v>

691
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Talk to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

692

736
00:31:54.901 --> 00:31:56.560
<v Speaker 1>coast of Florida is a big spear fishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

737
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Shooting a lot of hog head groupers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

738
00:31:58.631 --> 00:32:00.790
<v Speaker 1>This is where I talk about something </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never fucking done.</v>

739
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.380
<v Speaker 1>We should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do.</v>

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>

741
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to spear fishing.</v>

742
00:32:05.111 --> 00:32:10.111
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like hunting underwater dude and </v>

743
00:32:10.111 --> 00:32:10.111
<v Speaker 1>out now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you ready for this?</v>

744
00:32:10.111 --> 00:32:12.340
<v Speaker 1>This is what is wrong with me is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched so much spear fishing.</v>

745
00:32:12.341 --> 00:32:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk about it intimately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about shooting out on the west</v>

746
00:32:15.641 --> 00:32:17.650
<v Speaker 1>coast of Florida is they use a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaiian slinks.</v>

747
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very different than the average spirit.</v>

748
00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Hawaiian sling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you asked joe to rubber bands </v>

749
00:32:28.211 --> 00:32:31.930
<v Speaker 1>and use a rubber band with a pointy </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick.</v>

750
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.960
<v Speaker 1>But when kimmy werner goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got like string,</v>

751
00:32:34.961 --> 00:32:39.440
<v Speaker 1>like she'll shoot a tuna and it'll take </v>
<v Speaker 1>off and she'll hold on and ride with it.</v>

752
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

753
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:43.400
<v Speaker 1>It's ride the tuna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just based on the depths of</v>

754
00:32:43.401 --> 00:32:48.401
<v Speaker 1>where you hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you hunt over on the west coast </v>

755
00:32:48.401 --> 00:32:48.900
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm talking out of my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not listen to anything I say been,</v>

756
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's a lot of shallower shoots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 30 feet.</v>

757
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:57.130
<v Speaker 1>A lot of reef shoots out in Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kimmy Warner goes down like a hundred </v>

758
00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:58.550
<v Speaker 1>feet and chills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

759
00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.090
<v Speaker 1>And just chills and feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred feet.</v>

760
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:03.950

<v Speaker 1>And you'll be good in the Bahamas.</v>

761
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:05.690

763
00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:12.320
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just over your head where you can still </v>

764
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.520
<v Speaker 1>sand down to nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get crazy.</v>

765
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Get done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nine,</v>

766
00:33:14.751 --> 00:33:17.170
<v Speaker 1>you can push off the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pop back up again bro.</v>

767
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessed with spirit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I would love to try it.</v>

771
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.750
<v Speaker 1>It looks like fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She invited me.</v>

772
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Valentine invited me to go next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have the time.</v>

773
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.750
<v Speaker 1>It's going to go to San Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to go tuna spear fishing.</v>

774
00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:35.510
<v Speaker 1>See then San Diego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

775
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:36.080
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

776
00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:41.081
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific Ocean Spear phishing is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it a little bit of sport sport </v>

777
00:33:41.081 --> 00:33:45.461
<v Speaker 1>like [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to really know how to hold your </v>

778
00:33:45.461 --> 00:33:45.461
<v Speaker 1>breath for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>

779
00:33:45.461 --> 00:33:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think only because of depths.</v>

780
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Like everything's pretty shallow out on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the west coast and the east coast or the</v>

781
00:33:51.261 --> 00:33:52.430
<v Speaker 1>east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's pretty shallow.</v>

782
00:33:52.431 --> 00:33:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Every like all the keys you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing like 15 feet.</v>

783
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:56.590

<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

785
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:01.520
<v Speaker 1>but on the west coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is a tad bit deeper,</v>

786
00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least from what I've been watching </v>

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:57.980
<v Speaker 3>there's certain machines that like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>could hover your hand over them and </v>

808
00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.330
<v Speaker 3>it'll register that an electrical </v>
<v Speaker 3>signals coming off of your body.</v>

809
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:05.480
<v Speaker 3>But then when you put this heck suit on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you run your hand over the same exact </v>

810
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:05.790
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shows nothing really.</v>

811
00:35:05.791 --> 00:35:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>

812
00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:11.570
<v Speaker 3>this suit is something that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very controversial in the hunting </v>

813
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.571
<v Speaker 3>community because some people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe it really works because there's </v>

814
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:16.650
<v Speaker 3>no real clear absolute studies that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>works on animals.</v>

815
00:35:16.651 --> 00:35:21.651
<v Speaker 3>But there are clear studies that had </v>
<v Speaker 3>shields your body's electrical signal </v>

816
00:35:21.651 --> 00:35:26.300
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it works pretty unequivocably on </v>

817
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:26.300
<v Speaker 3>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on fish.</v>

818
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.270
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to pull up hex sue hecs suit,</v>

819
00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:31.830
<v Speaker 3>video fish.</v>

820
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.600
<v Speaker 1>So you basically roll into the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Predator put you put gloves on</v>

821
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 3>Sudan and they can't see you</v>

822
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.650
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason you can get right up</v>

823
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:42.600
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking weird man.</v>

824
00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:43.750
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

825
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.880
<v Speaker 1>You get right up to fish right up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like corals.</v>

826
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:49.860
<v Speaker 1>They get right up to coral reefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

827
00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:51.000
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

828
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:56.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much of this would </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen exactly the same way if this guy </v>

829
00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.500
<v Speaker 1>wasn't wearing this suit because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

830
00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't really have that information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that people that spearfish</v>

831
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.480
<v Speaker 1>and people that are involved with,</v>

834
00:36:09.861 --> 00:36:11.550
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say it absolutely works.</v>

835
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.400
<v Speaker 1>And they had it on shark week two.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

924
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever want to quit drinking.</v>

925
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever want to quit smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever want to go with Ari and run</v>

926
00:39:46.691 --> 00:39:48.430
<v Speaker 1>a marathon and then not do mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

927
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:51.220
<v Speaker 1>It's in Buenos Aires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want that to be a part of my life,</v>

928
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:55.210
<v Speaker 1>but I can't have that if I'm going at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pace I'm going at like I can't,</v>

929
00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.310
<v Speaker 1>I can't have both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you started</v>

930
00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:02.350
<v Speaker 3>to rely on your body a lot more like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing with all this running </v>

931
00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:03.350
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

932
00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:04.210
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

933
00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:07.120
<v Speaker 3>what was that one that you did where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to do all the obstacle courses,</v>

934
00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.210
<v Speaker 3>race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spartan,</v>

935
00:40:08.211 --> 00:40:10.100
<v Speaker 3>race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a triathlon.</v>

936
00:40:10.101 --> 00:40:11.730
<v Speaker 3>You relying on your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

937
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.760
<v Speaker 3>Like part of your recreation now is </v>
<v Speaker 3>relying on your endurance and when </v>

938
00:40:17.211 --> 00:40:18.950
<v Speaker 3>you're doing that and you're drinking at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same time,</v>

939
00:40:18.951 --> 00:40:20.240
<v Speaker 3>you're just shooting yourself in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>foot.</v>

940
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I still,</v>

941
00:40:21.711 --> 00:40:26.711
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we did the Spartan race and right </v>

942
00:40:26.711 --> 00:40:26.711
<v Speaker 1>after you sit up in the stands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has some beers,</v>

943
00:40:26.711 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 1>couple of beers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a hit of a vape pen and then you </v>

944
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 1>just go home and you get a good night's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

945
00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:32.990
<v Speaker 1>But you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for me,</v>

946
00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:36.370
<v Speaker 1>training for the triathlon was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

947
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just was not able to do both.</v>

948
00:40:39.441 --> 00:40:42.080
<v Speaker 1>And then when I got done I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

949
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.930
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of like I was thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about last night,</v>

950
00:40:44.931 --> 00:40:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't drink last night obviously.</v>

951
00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.610
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

952
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I was in the shower today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a really hard time sleeping last </v>

953
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:54.670
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was up all night.</v>

954
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:58.580
<v Speaker 1>I've just been doing a lot of press and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think you empty your serotonin </v>

955
00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:58.820
<v Speaker 1>because you're giving everyone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

956
00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:04.330
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was up all night with like a </v>

957
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:05.080
<v Speaker 1>little bit of panic attacks and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely would've drank last night.</v>

958
00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:06.860
<v Speaker 1>You get a panic attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that mean?</v>

959
00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Like what happens for me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

960
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:12.830
<v Speaker 1>you kind of get blinders on and for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>

961
00:41:12.831 --> 00:41:17.831
<v Speaker 1>I will start saying the same phrase over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over in my head again where I can't </v>

962
00:41:17.831 --> 00:41:21.060
<v Speaker 1>get it out like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

963
00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

964
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:28.370
<v Speaker 1>like my brain will go satellite of love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sad,</v>

965
00:41:28.371 --> 00:41:32.840
<v Speaker 1>a lot of love Satta Line of love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>satellite.</v>

966
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll start going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like last night I had a phrase going </v>

967
00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:38.020
<v Speaker 1>through my head and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

968
00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Z,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alarm on is the alarm on and I get up </v>

969
00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:42.360
<v Speaker 1>and I go check the alarm and then I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>in bed and I go,</v>

970
00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.040
<v Speaker 1>I should just make sure all the doors </v>
<v Speaker 1>were locked.</v>

971
00:41:43.041 --> 00:41:45.170
<v Speaker 1>And then I go and check all the doors </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I get up and go.</v>

972
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Did I lock the man cave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get up and I locked the man </v>

973
00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:50.660
<v Speaker 1>cave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now normally that's where I will start.</v>

974
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Like if I have a few drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does not happen.</v>

975
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.910
<v Speaker 1>You know what's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Jamie was talking about this too,</v>

976
00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:58.570
<v Speaker 1>it's at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

977
00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:03.670
<v Speaker 1>At night when you get weirded out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you're getting ready to </v>

978
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.670
<v Speaker 1>shut off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

979
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:04.820
<v Speaker 1>can I shut the body off yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Everything cool?</v>

980
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:09.170
<v Speaker 1>I think meditation might help me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't just,</v>

981
00:42:09.171 --> 00:42:10.790
<v Speaker 1>I can't shut my brain off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm like,</v>

982
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:16.190
<v Speaker 1>and then I go a tank for your man cave </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take off all of my man cave.</v>

983
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Joe Makes you man cave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a office,</v>

984
00:42:19.971 --> 00:42:22.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like half of this probably you fill</v>

985
00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:24.890
<v Speaker 1>a tank in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be really big in my man cave.</v>

986
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:25.820
<v Speaker 1>He'll be really big in there.</v>

987
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.090
<v Speaker 1>They get stuff that you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get one that big.</v>

988
00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:29.730
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll have a,</v>

989
00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:31.970
<v Speaker 1>they have a smaller one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

990
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.670
<v Speaker 1>to have like one that's like a six by </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven or four by seven.</v>

991
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Four by seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

992
00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:43.490
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather probably I'd rather </v>

993
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.490
<v Speaker 1>sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love salt.</v>

994
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I love those infrared Saunas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love those songs.</v>

995
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Great to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

996
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:47.780
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

997
00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about the house,</v>

998
00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.200
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about it this morning in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shower and I was like,</v>

999
00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:56.201
<v Speaker 1>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sober October we did was so helpful </v>

1000
00:42:56.201 --> 00:42:58.901
<v Speaker 1>because I learned how to cope and go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed with nothing with nothing.</v>

1001
00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.650
<v Speaker 1>No NYQUIL,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>

1002
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I was super helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I learned little tricks like </v>

1003
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.410
<v Speaker 1>drinking on planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still may have a few drinks before I </v>

1004
00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:08.410
<v Speaker 1>get on a plane or a couple of drinks on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the plane.</v>

1005
00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:10.340
<v Speaker 1>But the difference is if it's an early </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning flight,</v>

1006
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't need a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on the plane you don't need.</v>

1007
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't need it for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas of ways I just said I just gotTa</v>

1008
00:43:16.641 --> 00:43:17.630
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1009
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.270
<v Speaker 1>it was helpful for me to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1010
00:43:20.271 --> 00:43:24.130
<v Speaker 1>what's really interesting is it made me </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize what,</v>

1011
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:29.150
<v Speaker 1>what's happening to you dreams when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're smoking pot all the time because </v>

1012
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:31.760
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you stopped smoking pot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then your dreams become super vivid,</v>

1013
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.360
<v Speaker 1>like really vivid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like excrutiatingly,</v>

1014
00:43:35.361 --> 00:43:37.310
<v Speaker 1>vivid and strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre.</v>

1015
00:43:37.311 --> 00:43:37.790
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1016
00:43:37.791 --> 00:43:39.800
<v Speaker 1>what am I doing to myself with the weed </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time?</v>

1017
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably not good for my dreams.</v>

1018
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.810
<v Speaker 1>I want those dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vivid ones.</v>

1019
00:43:44.811 --> 00:43:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Crazy ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Take Alpha brain.</v>

1020
00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you actually you go to bed.</v>

1021
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:51.800
<v Speaker 1>I took out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife made me stop because I was.</v>

1022
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.800
<v Speaker 1>I was a lunatic on Alpha brain because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could feel it really immediately if you </v>

1023
00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.730
<v Speaker 1>take it before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I take a double dose.</v>

1024
00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:02.240
<v Speaker 1>So like if I'm like these packets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to take one packet,</v>

1025
00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll take two of these packets with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>water before I go to bed.</v>

1026
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:11.120
<v Speaker 1>And then you know like maybe an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you go to bed and with no pot and</v>

1027
00:44:11.121 --> 00:44:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain you will have lucid intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking dreams.</v>

1028
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Like they're intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in,</v>

1029
00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:22.290
<v Speaker 1>they're durable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you realize your dream and they </v>

1030
00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:25.310
<v Speaker 1>don't wake up like they get lucid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the middle of them.</v>

1031
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.050
<v Speaker 1>You know the way I described lucid </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams,</v>

1032
00:44:27.051 --> 00:44:31.720
<v Speaker 1>like lucid dreams or like a delicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble that a kid would blow it</v>

1033
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 2>and you can kind of almost catch it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your hand and then pop it pops.</v>

1034
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
<v Speaker 2>These were like basketballs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they weren't popping like it'd be </v>

1035
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.000
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1036
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a dream.</v>

1037
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we're in a dream.</v>

1038
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Let's just keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they.</v>

1039
00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:48.570
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't knock me out of the dream by</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizing that I was in a dream,</v>

1040
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.970
<v Speaker 2>which ordinarily would immediately do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1041
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.620
<v Speaker 2>Ordinarily I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

1042
00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:53.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1043
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:58.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm waking up and then you just wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could keep myself in that lucid dream </v>

1044
00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:00.570
<v Speaker 2>state for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lucid dream.</v>

1045
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Naturally and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have fucking insane.</v>

1046
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:07.940
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been sold a show to comedy central </v>

1047
00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:08.730
<v Speaker 2>based on my dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have insane dreams.</v>

1048
00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.950
<v Speaker 2>You should try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what Parasso Tim is?</v>

1049
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Never heard of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's another nootropic.</v>

1050
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:15.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a real potent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the.</v>

1051
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.360
<v Speaker 2>One of the interesting things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>nootropics is there's a ton of them.</v>

1052
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:23.480
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them they found recently is </v>

1053
00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:23.790
<v Speaker 2>creatine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found a creatine.</v>

1054
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Boosts your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1055
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.720
<v Speaker 2>your mental performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1056
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Creatines Kinda a lot of benefits men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you think about it,</v>

1058
00:45:32.371 --> 00:45:37.371
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Create team makes your body retain more </v>

1059
00:45:37.371 --> 00:45:37.371
<v Speaker 2>water as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1060
00:45:37.371 --> 00:45:37.770
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things that people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like about.</v>

1061
00:45:37.771 --> 00:45:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It kind of gives you like a chubby face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like get a little little bloated on it,</v>

1062
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:45.570
<v Speaker 2>but what that's doing is just retaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>more water.</v>

1063
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you have more water,</v>

1064
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:52.620
<v Speaker 2>it also makes you stronger like an APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's proven over time.</v>

1065
00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Taking creatine as a supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very effective.</v>

1066
00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:57.210
<v Speaker 2>It really does make you stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you bigger,</v>

1067
00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.370
<v Speaker 2>so you've got to think like all that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like all this tissue and all this water.</v>

1068
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:04.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's probably just </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's healthier.</v>

1069
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:09.830
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and probably the flow of everything's </v>

1070
00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:10.830
<v Speaker 2>healthier to the conductivity of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I'm not a scientist,</v>

1071
00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.890
<v Speaker 2>but I would think that all that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

1072
00:46:13.891 --> 00:46:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Like you're like your brain works </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible when it's dehydrated,</v>

1073
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:20.690
<v Speaker 2>like have you ever been dehydrated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to think it's.</v>

1074
00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Your brain is so weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible how much dehydration </v>

1075
00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:30.800
<v Speaker 2>affects the way your brain performs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the other side it should be that </v>

1076
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.200
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're really well hydrated,</v>

1077
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:37.650
<v Speaker 2>your brain would probably work better </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the only makes sense.</v>

1078
00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:42.270
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how important water is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck man.</v>

1079
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:47.410
<v Speaker 2>To everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this nutritionist when I started </v>

1080
00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:47.410
<v Speaker 2>doing the triathlon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like men's health covered it.</v>

1081
00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing a documentary on it.</v>

1082
00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.440
<v Speaker 2>What are they doing with the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>triathlon?</v>

1083
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.120
<v Speaker 2>They hit me up and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1089
00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:06.240

<v Speaker 2>as a sound,</v>

1090
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:11.270
<v Speaker 2>whatever we decided to do with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitions that God inspired and lost </v>

1091
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.900
<v Speaker 2>a ton of weight and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1092

<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lot of that.</v>

1093
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:14.860
<v Speaker 2>It's also an amazing man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has been.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And like guys hit me up and they're </v>

<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

<v Speaker 2>but we just wanted to.</v>

1101

<v Speaker 2>Twenty third.</v>

1117
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm assigned a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically have a month to figure it out.</v>

1118
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Add another thing inside sober October.</v>

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:14.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we can be sober and we could do </v>

1120
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:14.700
<v Speaker 2>the yoga classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could do it again,</v>

1121
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:19.330
<v Speaker 2>not getting time to do those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>yoga classes and those are amazing for </v>

1122
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:19.420
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1123
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.180
<v Speaker 2>That that was also amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did nine in a row.</v>

1124
00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:25.900
<v Speaker 2>I did nine days in a row just to whack </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out and when I did that I was like,</v>

1125
00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:30.960
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you just know that you have to </v>

1126
00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:30.960
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just do it.</v>

1127
00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't know you have to do it.</v>

1128
00:48:32.621 --> 00:48:34.690
<v Speaker 2>You find all sorts of reasons to not do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1129
00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll just go lift weights or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1130
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:38.310
<v Speaker 2>just go for a run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1131
00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:43.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll just go do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if feel like I have to get seven </v>

1132
00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:44.470
<v Speaker 2>more of these fucking things in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the next 14 days,</v>

1133
00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:46.130
<v Speaker 2>I just do them right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1134
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.970
<v Speaker 2>You know what's cool about them is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1135
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:51.880
<v Speaker 2>This sounds silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now I have hot yoga in my.</v>

1136
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:55.120
<v Speaker 2>You tell utility belt worth of workouts </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I go.</v>

1137
00:48:55.121 --> 00:49:00.121
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I'll go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'll come off the road and I'll be </v>

1138
00:49:00.121 --> 00:49:03.301
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comment on maybe I booze that weekend </v>

1139
00:49:03.301 --> 00:49:05.221
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monday I'm doing a hot yoga and I'll go </v>

1140
00:49:05.221 --> 00:49:06.090
<v Speaker 2>to a hot yoga and I know how the poses I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have.</v>

1141
00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:08.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I've got the Mat,</v>

1142
00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:11.470
<v Speaker 2>like doing your first hot yoga is </v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassing a little bit,</v>

1143
00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:14.740
<v Speaker 2>but when you go back in it and you do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>again and you just pour sweat and you're</v>

1144
00:49:14.741 --> 00:49:15.520
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

1145
00:49:15.521 --> 00:49:17.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming back tomorrow and then you of</v>
<v Speaker 2>course you don't,</v>

1146
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:22.291
<v Speaker 2>but it's courageous when you see people </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to those classes that are like </v>

1147
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:28.230
<v Speaker 2>really obese and they take that risk of </v>
<v Speaker 2>being almost naked in front of these </v>

1148

1151
00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:43.290

<v Speaker 2>This is probably like super nerve </v>

1152
00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:44.830
<v Speaker 2>wracking for her to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She took up ballsy chance.</v>

1153
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:46.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tough to do.</v>

1154
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:47.830
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to.</v>

1155
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:53.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tough to fucking take a kettlebell </v>

<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've gone there.</v>

1158
00:49:55.001 --> 00:49:56.920
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get weirded out.</v>

1159
00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:59.080
<v Speaker 2>When I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started the training and I had to</v>

1160
00:49:59.081 --> 00:50:01.480
<v Speaker 2>go to a pool and swim and getting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>speedo.</v>

1161
00:50:01.481 --> 00:50:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Now I wear speedos all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for real to where one,</v>

1162
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.730
<v Speaker 2>like for real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1163
00:50:06.731 --> 00:50:07.540
<v Speaker 2>for real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Real.</v>

1164
00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Like to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do you have to wear one?</v>

1165
00:50:09.311 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that much better than shorts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1166
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:16.830
<v Speaker 2>The drag is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you glide like a fucking dolphin </v>

1167
00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:18.130
<v Speaker 2>ever jagger off with too much lotion and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1168
00:50:18.131 --> 00:50:20.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't even feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to drive some of this off.</v>

1169
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:25.000
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's super specific to me.</v>

1170
00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.430
<v Speaker 2>But you swam in the ocean recently?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1171
00:50:27.431 --> 00:50:30.680
<v Speaker 2>was in Italy last week and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>swimming in the ocean.</v>

1172
00:50:30.681 --> 00:50:31.490
<v Speaker 2>I was realizing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1173
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:33.200
<v Speaker 2>it's so much easier to swim in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>

1174
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salt water to float.</v>

1175
00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.350
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1176
00:50:36.351 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 2>So it's like way easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little easier.</v>

1177
00:50:39.861 --> 00:50:44.861
<v Speaker 2>It's like ways your open water swimming </v>
<v Speaker 2>in saltwater in the Malibu.</v>

1178
00:50:45.231 --> 00:50:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Triathlon is coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one's tough.</v>

1179
00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:53.171
<v Speaker 2>It's a half mile swim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're in a wetsuit and you're </v>

1180
00:50:53.171 --> 00:50:53.240
<v Speaker 2>buoyant and you're in the saltwater </v>
<v Speaker 2>swimming near great white sharks.</v>

1181
00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing Malibu in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>White sharks.</v>

1182
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:59.840

<v Speaker 2>But when you're in a pack like that,</v>

1183
00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.570
<v Speaker 2>oh well what's the odds of you get bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just get into the center.</v>

1224
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:49.060
<v Speaker 2>You get on those sets for 16 hours a day</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone's depressed.</v>

1225
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's tired and everyone's on the </v>

1228
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:00.480
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>so I got on Lexapro and I'm on Zoloft </v>

1231
00:53:04.721 --> 00:53:07.480
<v Speaker 2>and I really find it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really balancing me out.</v>

1232
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:11.980
<v Speaker 2>And I started taking this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started taking that and Xanax a little</v>

1233
00:53:11.981 --> 00:53:14.350
<v Speaker 2>here and a little bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1234
00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:17.020
<v Speaker 2>everyone is on something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1235
00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:22.260
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to Columbia for eight weeks and </v>

1236

<v Speaker 2>you live in Columbia and do the.</v>

1237

<v Speaker 2>I know Mark Walberg do that mile 22.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just lived in Columbia.</v>

1238
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Eight weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

1239
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I'd much rather just to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't mind doing.</v>

1240
00:53:29.971 --> 00:53:33.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even joking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love my dream,</v>

1241
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:35.670
<v Speaker 2>my dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing what I'm doing right now.</v>

1242
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:39.840
<v Speaker 2>Like I like to expand span that if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do my own thing and expand that,</v>

1243
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:44.870
<v Speaker 2>that's my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you said part of the business </v>

1244
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:45.270
<v Speaker 2>easily like a news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1245
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:48.390
<v Speaker 2>like an ensemble cast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was hard to man.</v>

1246
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:53.720
<v Speaker 2>I would love a multicam well it's fun if</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody gets along but you've got to </v>

1247
00:53:53.881 --> 00:53:58.500
<v Speaker 2>rely on all those other people to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>their shit together and you know it goes</v>

1248
00:53:58.501 --> 00:53:59.660
<v Speaker 2>sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1249
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:04.820
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the scripts don't work and </v>

1250
00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:07.590
<v Speaker 2>sometimes when the show's not doing well</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have executives that chime in.</v>

1251
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I honestly think that like what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing with like somethings burning,</v>

1252
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:12.480
<v Speaker 2>that kind of shit.</v>

1253
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:17.510
<v Speaker 2>That's way better man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're the thing you're doing with </v>

1254
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.850
<v Speaker 2>all things comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the cooking show,</v>

1255
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:23.330
<v Speaker 2>that kind of fun shit where there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>real bosses is way better for a guy like</v>

1256
00:54:23.791 --> 00:54:26.140
<v Speaker 2>you are a guy like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great podcasts,</v>

1257
00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:31.160
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to be able to be </v>

1258
00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.680
<v Speaker 2>really authentically yourself with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these executives and producers and </v>

1259
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:39.740
<v Speaker 2>network notes and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what the fuck they're </v>

1260
00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:39.740
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1262
00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:45.330
<v Speaker 2>occasionally you'll get good advice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when something gets through with </v>

1263
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:47.070
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of system and becomes a hit,</v>

1264
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:50.190
<v Speaker 2>it's almost by luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like,</v>

1265
00:54:50.191 --> 00:54:51.090
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the odds?</v>

1266
00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like a salmon making its way up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>river.</v>

1267
00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:57.900
<v Speaker 2>It's why would it go up river the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>are you doing?</v>

1268
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.590
<v Speaker 2>This is a terrible way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to jump over a waterfall that is</v>

1269
00:55:01.591 --> 00:55:02.550
<v Speaker 2>so stupid.</v>

1270
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:04.500
<v Speaker 2>It makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so dumb,</v>

1271
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:07.290
<v Speaker 2>but the one that makes it and spawns </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1272
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:08.340
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is our system.</v>

1273
00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:09.960
<v Speaker 2>It works like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1274
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:12.660
<v Speaker 2>I guess this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost like that.</v>

1275
00:55:12.661 --> 00:55:15.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're doing something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like so counterintuitive.</v>

1276
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:20.930
<v Speaker 2>You're doing something creative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being judged and an ordered </v>

1277
00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:23.070
<v Speaker 2>around by people who have zero </v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity.</v>

1278
00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:25.140
<v Speaker 2>They're not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there were funny,</v>

1279
00:55:25.141 --> 00:55:26.850
<v Speaker 2>they'd be comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not funny,</v>

1280
00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:32.060
<v Speaker 2>but yet they're telling you what to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to think about their </v>

1281
00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:35.331
<v Speaker 2>notes and you got to bring in the gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>roommate and the fucking the black </v>

1282
00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:37.050
<v Speaker 2>neighbor and the hot chick on the street</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody wants to fuck.</v>

1283
00:55:37.051 --> 00:55:39.090
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's like tripping over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1284
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1285
00:55:41.491 --> 00:55:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Thanks man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we went into,</v>

1286
00:55:43.171 --> 00:55:45.090
<v Speaker 2>when we went and did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first something's burning me,</v>

1287
00:55:45.091 --> 00:55:47.820
<v Speaker 2>Bill and Tom and I walked on set and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1288
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm super difficult to work with.</v>

1289
00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:53.100
<v Speaker 2>Just want everyone to know that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't anyone stop me.</v>

1290
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:58.130
<v Speaker 2>Don't anyone do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you know when we starting to </v>

1291
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.130
<v Speaker 2>let you know when we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1292
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.880
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1293
00:55:58.881 --> 00:56:03.881
<v Speaker 2>just cover everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't ever ask me to stop and do </v>

1294
00:56:03.881 --> 00:56:03.881
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just cover everything.</v>

1295
00:56:03.881 --> 00:56:04.410
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they go stop,</v>

1296
00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.420
<v Speaker 2>rewind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say that again.</v>

1297
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:07.350
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1298
00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:12.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a camera on me and stay out of the </v>

1299
00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:12.440
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just sleeping alone.</v>

1300
00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.120
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand that every time </v>
<v Speaker 2>you break that momentum,</v>

1301
00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:18.390
<v Speaker 2>now I'm thinking about you and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about that camera and I have to</v>

1302
00:56:18.391 --> 00:56:19.980
<v Speaker 2>reset again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1303
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:21.060
<v Speaker 2>we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did.</v>

1304
00:56:21.061 --> 00:56:23.950
<v Speaker 2>Me and Tom and bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did that first one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1307
00:56:28.661 --> 00:56:30.220
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see we've got it all.</v>

1308
00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:31.650
<v Speaker 1>They got up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they are arid.</v>

1309
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then everyone loved it and then </v>

1320
00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:01.060
<v Speaker 1>you have to kill him in a humane way in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to do it.</v>

1321
00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.490
<v Speaker 1>In order to kill a crab legally.</v>

1322
00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Especially on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to kill you main way.</v>

1323
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and arrow.</v>

1328
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Don't even have to be careful with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crab.</v>

1329
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:23.010
<v Speaker 1>All I know is that the one note we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't even have senses.</v>

1330
00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

1331
00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.240
<v Speaker 1>cal take care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he?</v>

1332
00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:32.610
<v Speaker 1>He was so fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you start by lifting up their Dick </v>

1333
00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:33.850
<v Speaker 1>and they have a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1334
00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:38.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you jam it in and then when I'm it </v>

1335
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:38.880
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

1336
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:39.040
<v Speaker 1>The knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1337
00:57:39.041 --> 00:57:40.660
<v Speaker 1>well what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about you bring that up?</v>

1338
00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Lift up that Dick and you jam it in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking you're jamming their dick </v>

1339
00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:48.080
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you putting it?</v>

1340
00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:48.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take the knife.</v>

1341
00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:50.320
<v Speaker 1>He laid the crop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck them to death,</v>

1342
00:57:50.321 --> 00:57:51.850
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lift up the Dick,</v>

1343
00:57:51.851 --> 00:57:56.851
<v Speaker 1>you pop the knife in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got to hit the other </v>

1344
00:57:56.851 --> 00:57:57.670
<v Speaker 1>side of it within like six seconds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a humane death for the crab.</v>

1345
00:57:57.910 --> 00:58:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they're suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I show that to Brenda and Brenda's </v>

1346
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:02.910
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bro,</v>

1347
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not fucking doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Brian just goes,</v>

1348
00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:09.030
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And literally like the Barbara Seville </v>

1349
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:10.210
<v Speaker 1>goes through and kills 20 fucking crabs </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

1350
00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I made them Chia Pino and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither of them thought they'd like it </v>

1351
00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:16.240
<v Speaker 1>and they loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's Chia Pino?</v>

1352
00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.770
<v Speaker 1>That's like a soup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like A.</v>

1353
00:58:17.771 --> 00:58:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a fucking Brian.</v>

1354
00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:22.450
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely fucking dead.</v>

1355
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:23.690
<v Speaker 1>He's cutting half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1356
00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.000
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's this?</v>

1357
00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Why is that humane?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what a weird thing.</v>

1358
00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to kill them humanely as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to boiling them alive.</v>

1359
00:58:31.211 --> 00:58:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Is that the idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1360
00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:34.720
<v Speaker 1>So I guess I'm not really surveil them </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>

1361
00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:37.420
<v Speaker 1>but like with lobsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always boil them alive.</v>

1362
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll tell you you're supposed to </v>

1363
00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:43.080
<v Speaker 1>boil them alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm always like,</v>

1364
00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:43.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

1365
00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Supposed to like says who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what happens if you don't boil them</v>

1366
00:58:45.131 --> 00:58:45.760
<v Speaker 1>alive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1367
00:58:45.761 --> 00:58:50.761
<v Speaker 1>Magic doesn't know what magic leaves </v>
<v Speaker 1>their body where they don't taste as </v>

1368
00:58:50.761 --> 00:58:52.110
<v Speaker 1>good if you don't boil them alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1369
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come.</v>

1370
00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:58.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't just cut their fucking head </v>
<v Speaker 1>off and then they're dead and then you </v>

1371
00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:58.120
<v Speaker 1>throw them in the boiling water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is,</v>

1372
00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.530
<v Speaker 1>what's happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do they need to be kept alive?</v>

1373
00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:03.520
<v Speaker 1>That's a well where you want them to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh,</v>

1374
00:59:03.850 --> 00:59:04.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1375
00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a big difference in </v>
<v Speaker 1>seafood,</v>

1376
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:08.920
<v Speaker 1>seafood and freshness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's huge.</v>

1377
00:59:08.921 --> 00:59:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't see dry age seafood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1378
00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:17.040
<v Speaker 1>like if you get a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get a piece of beef from a </v>

1379
00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:17.040
<v Speaker 1>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a steak,</v>

1380
00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:21.100
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times aged because the bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the meat actually starts,</v>

1381
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 1>break it down</v>

1382
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:27.340
<v Speaker 2>and it makes it more tender and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually gives it a lot of that mold </v>

1383
00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:31.330
<v Speaker 2>that they cut off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever see dry age beef before they </v>

1384
00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:31.330
<v Speaker 2>slice it up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1385
00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Whole ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1386
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Show him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1387
00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy</v>

1388
00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:37.530
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1389
00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.690
<v Speaker 3>I follow on instagram that was doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something insane.</v>

1390
00:59:40.691 --> 00:59:45.691
<v Speaker 3>Like I think they had like a 200 day dry</v>
<v Speaker 3>age beef,</v>

1391
00:59:47.291 --> 00:59:50.560
<v Speaker 3>which is just like even hearing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1392
00:59:50.561 --> 00:59:50.750
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1393
00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it looks like.</v>

1394
00:59:52.771 --> 00:59:54.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what dry age beef look like.</v>

1395
00:59:54.811 --> 00:59:59.811
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it's rotten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like rotten meat and you lose some of </v>

1396
00:59:59.811 --> 01:00:04.131
<v Speaker 2>the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's really wasteful in a way </v>

1397
01:00:04.131 --> 01:00:04.950
<v Speaker 2>because the outside edge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that black shit,</v>

1398
01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:07.220
<v Speaker 2>they cut all that off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're losing you.</v>

1399
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Can you find a video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

1400
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Of Trimming?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just google trimming dry aged beef and </v>

1401
01:00:14.011 --> 01:00:16.590
<v Speaker 2>look up youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you the guy that turned me onto the</v>

1402
01:00:16.591 --> 01:00:20.340
<v Speaker 2>guy that had his own fridge and was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it his own fridge in his garage?</v>

1403
01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a bunch of guys who do that.</v>

1404
01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:27.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was doing with elk dry aging </v>

1405
01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:27.090
<v Speaker 2>out maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1406
01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:28.260
<v Speaker 2>if you guys do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is dry aged meat.</v>

1407
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.020
<v Speaker 2>So look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

1408
01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:30.720
<v Speaker 2>The outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1409
01:00:30.721 --> 01:00:32.070
<v Speaker 2>it looks rotten man.</v>

1410
01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:36.960
<v Speaker 3>Hey takes the outside and you cut into </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and then he,</v>

1411
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
<v Speaker 3>I guess he's going to cut all the fat </v>
<v Speaker 3>off and he's gonna turn it into steaks.</v>

1412
01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.790
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't going to do with all that fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

1413
01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.800
<v Speaker 2>It was thrown into the garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this fat has he one easy thrown that </v>

1414
01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:54.640
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's just got a.</v>

1415
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:57.760
<v Speaker 2>It seems like he's thrown that fat away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1416
01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:01.190
<v Speaker 2>So he keeps a lot of the fat on and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fan on top?</v>

1417
01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dry aged beef on top.</v>

1418
01:01:05.031 --> 01:01:07.040
<v Speaker 2>He's just losing the sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Yeah,</v>

1419
01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:08.210
<v Speaker 2>you're losing the outside of that</v>

1420
01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:11.820
<v Speaker 3>just in this particular cut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on some steaks,</v>

1421
01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:14.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on how long he's dry aging it</v>

1422
01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:18.770
<v Speaker 3>to like when some people go really ham </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that shit though,</v>

1423
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:19.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1424
01:01:19.621 --> 01:01:21.450
<v Speaker 3>they'll dry age for hundreds of days.</v>

1425
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:27.750
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of experimental stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing now where I'm find this </v>

1426
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:29.140
<v Speaker 2>dude on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you do that with elk?</v>

1427
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1428
01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I got to get you and cam on something's </v>
<v Speaker 2>burning.</v>

1429
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll do it.</v>

1430
01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:35.500
<v Speaker 2>I would love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tam.</v>

1431
01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Can't cook though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know Dudley.</v>

1432
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Dudley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can cook his ass off.</v>

1433
01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the cook.</v>

1434
01:01:39.941 --> 01:01:41.290
<v Speaker 2>I'll cook for you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1435
01:01:41.291 --> 01:01:42.670
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how to cook?</v>

1436
01:01:42.671 --> 01:01:43.960
<v Speaker 2>I know how to reverse here,</v>

1437
01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:46.030
<v Speaker 3>but if you ever fucked around with wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>game,</v>

1438
01:01:46.031 --> 01:01:51.031
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you some today and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could fuck around with it and then </v>

1439
01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.020
<v Speaker 3>if you get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1440
01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.330
<v Speaker 3>we'll figure out a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you some recipes and stuff,</v>

1441
01:01:55.570 --> 01:01:58.300
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that difficult,</v>

1442
01:01:58.301 --> 01:01:59.860
<v Speaker 3>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1443
01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:03.730
<v Speaker 3>it's more tricky than beef.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beef is hard to fuck up,</v>

1444
01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.420
<v Speaker 3>especially like a fatty beef because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much moisture,</v>

1445
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:10.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas a elk is basically,</v>

1446
01:02:10.871 --> 01:02:12.490
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're basically eating a bodybuilder,</v>

1447
01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:14.680
<v Speaker 3>you're eating an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1448
01:02:14.681 --> 01:02:19.681
<v Speaker 3>and it's just a richer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>darker meat and has very little fat in </v>

1449
01:02:19.681 --> 01:02:19.681
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1450
01:02:19.681 --> 01:02:19.810
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1451
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.470
<v Speaker 2>if you do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fantastic.</v>

1452
01:02:22.471 --> 01:02:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Have you had it before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>

1453
01:02:24.571 --> 01:02:26.520
<v Speaker 2>I've had your ground elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1454
01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:30.060
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's hard to like the right way to</v>

1455
01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:35.061
<v Speaker 2>do it is to do an elk stake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to fucking set up that God damned </v>

1456
01:02:35.061 --> 01:02:39.251
<v Speaker 2>grill out here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know how to have proper </v>

1457
01:02:39.251 --> 01:02:39.251
<v Speaker 2>ventilation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got one of those,</v>

1458
01:02:39.251 --> 01:02:41.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yoder pellet grills in the back there,</v>

1459
01:02:41.101 --> 01:02:43.920
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know how to get the proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>ventilation.</v>

1460
01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:47.820
<v Speaker 2>We might need to get some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>permit.</v>

1461
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Put like a vent like they would do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a kitchen.</v>

1462
01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:52.200
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't find.</v>

1463
01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:56.420
<v Speaker 2>This guy's got this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm no rare gourmet meats.</v>

1464
01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does he got going on?</v>

1465
01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:04.620
<v Speaker 2>See if you find like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just google try 500 day dry age beef on </v>

1466
01:03:06.901 --> 01:03:08.190
<v Speaker 2>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1467
01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys don't fuck around.</v>

1468
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Can I tell you one of them?</v>

1469
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:14.910
<v Speaker 2>One of the coolest things you turned me </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto what?</v>

1470
01:03:14.911 --> 01:03:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Adam Green Tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1471
01:03:16.741 --> 01:03:21.120
<v Speaker 2>use an animal due to his insta stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I get bummed when I,</v>

1472
01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:26.240
<v Speaker 2>when I skip them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when he's on one of those epic </v>

1473
01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:26.490
<v Speaker 2>haunts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1474
01:03:26.491 --> 01:03:27.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1475
01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.520
<v Speaker 2>he does not fuck around dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>

1476
01:03:29.521 --> 01:03:34.521
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes out by himself by himself for </v>

1477
01:03:34.521 --> 01:03:36.360
<v Speaker 2>months at a time of extreme age steak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it say in there for 20 days?</v>

1478
01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one's 400 on this one.</v>

1479
01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to 400.</v>

1480
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what that looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably looks terrible when they </v>

1481
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:46.130
<v Speaker 2>start cutting it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back it up a little bit so we can say,</v>

1482
01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.920
<v Speaker 2>just saw this online the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I saw I saw this and I didn't click</v>

1483
01:03:49.921 --> 01:03:51.150
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

1484
01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:53.430
<v Speaker 2>it's real weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1485
01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:58.460
<v Speaker 2>you're basically letting it rot and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're relying on the bacteria to not </v>

1486
01:03:59.371 --> 01:04:00.570
<v Speaker 2>completely flourish.</v>

1487
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to have a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature.</v>

1488
01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:06.630
<v Speaker 2>I think they keep it somewhere around </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 40 degrees or something like that.</v>

1489
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:09.140
<v Speaker 2>And it's drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1490
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:10.740
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks terrible.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you've got a vacuum seal and beat them </v>

1514
01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:13.320
<v Speaker 2>and then you can just let them sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to overcook them.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it doesn't gross me out at all.</v>

1536
01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Like nothing grosses me out like eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>bugs or anything.</v>

1537
01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Throw up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember your wife threw up in her car</v>

1538
01:06:12.311 --> 01:06:14.320
<v Speaker 2>one time I think I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came up either.</v>

1539
01:06:14.321 --> 01:06:17.320
<v Speaker 2>I came over there and you were cleaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>out your wife's car.</v>

1540
01:06:17.321 --> 01:06:17.900
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

1541
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:19.600
<v Speaker 2>You were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my wife threw up all over car,</v>

1542
01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:20.920
<v Speaker 2>one of those green drinks and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1543
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:23.890
<v Speaker 2>bring up.</v>

1544
01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Like in brought up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing up the other day.</v>

1545
01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Just brought up throwing up and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started gagging on his podcast.</v>

1546
01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm immune.</v>

1547
01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:38.460
<v Speaker 2>I saw so many people throw up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen hundreds of people throw up </v>

1548
01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.200
<v Speaker 2>right in front of me and I had to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them while they're puking and I it,</v>

1549
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:43.810
<v Speaker 2>this is a learned skill because when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>first started doing the show,</v>

1550
01:06:43.811 --> 01:06:45.910
<v Speaker 2>I would gag when I would see other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people do it,</v>

1551
01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:49.270
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then after awhile it just went away.</v>

1552
01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Like that part of me is dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dead.</v>

1553
01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.280
<v Speaker 2>So when my wife threw up in her car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1554
01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:55.630
<v Speaker 2>I'll clean it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can give a fuck.</v>

1555
01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:57.760
<v Speaker 2>That's cleaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot do that.</v>

1556
01:06:57.761 --> 01:06:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when my kids throw up,</v>

1557
01:06:58.871 --> 01:07:00.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry you're on your own.</v>

1558
01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:02.650
<v Speaker 2>Clean up all the puke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If my kid's Puke,</v>

01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:04.450
<v Speaker 2>I am the designated puked cleaner.</v>

1560
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:05.950

<v Speaker 2>100 percent of the time.</v>

1561
01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:09.040
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent of the time someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>throws up in the bed or somewhere else.</v>

1562
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:10.060
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cleaned it up,</v>

1563

<v Speaker 2>not cleaning it up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>care of the chicken sometimes,</v>

1586
01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:08.100
<v Speaker 2>especially when we're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll,</v>

1587
01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:09.880

<v Speaker 2>have to.</v>

1588
01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.640
<v Speaker 2>Chickens are a little bit of effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1589
01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:15.010
<v Speaker 2>you've got to up the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta collect the eggs every day.</v>

1590
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.700
<v Speaker 2>We had some squirrels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steel and eggs.</v>

1591
01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.090
<v Speaker 2>We had a real issue with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a squirrel that I have to hose out</v>

1592
01:08:20.091 --> 01:08:21.580
<v Speaker 2>of our chicken coop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1595
01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Marshall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is the sweetest dog of all time and </v>

1596
01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:32.600
<v Speaker 2>less your squirrel then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the devil.</v>

1597
01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never seen a dog so determined to kill</v>

1598
01:08:35.391 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 2>a squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1599
01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:42.340
<v Speaker 2>He goes out now and he looks for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He runs to the chicken coop and then he </v>

1600
01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:46.391
<v Speaker 2>circles the chicken coop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look and see where these motherfuckers </v>

1601
01:08:46.391 --> 01:08:46.391
<v Speaker 2>are getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if anybody's around there,</v>

1602
01:08:46.391 --> 01:08:49.130
<v Speaker 2>see if anybody's slipping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was on the road.</v>

1603
01:08:49.131 --> 01:08:52.700
<v Speaker 2>My wife sent me a picture of Marshall </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a squirrel in his mouth.</v>

1604
01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:55.100
<v Speaker 2>And she's so happy because she doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like squirrels.</v>

1605
01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:59.480
<v Speaker 2>The squirrels are fucking up all the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they steal all the chicken food.</v>

1606
01:08:59.530 --> 01:09:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

1607
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.480
<v Speaker 2>I like squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're cute.</v>

1608
01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:04.400
<v Speaker 2>So like for me I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>

1609
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.050
<v Speaker 2>They deal the chicken food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

1610
01:09:06.051 --> 01:09:08.780
<v Speaker 2>make more chicken food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they start stealing the eggs.</v>

1611
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.310
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1612
01:09:10.311 --> 01:09:14.120
<v Speaker 2>you push up and he can't steal my food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my food.</v>

1613
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:19.480
<v Speaker 2>You can't steal the eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me find this for our chickens or </v>

1614
01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:19.480
<v Speaker 2>family members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1615
01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:19.520
<v Speaker 2>they are right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1616
01:09:19.530 --> 01:09:21.180
<v Speaker 2>When I came home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it was like,</v>

1617
01:09:21.181 --> 01:09:23.630
<v Speaker 2>you remember it was like 120 and all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trees were dying.</v>

1618
01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:28.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I walked in and Leanne had chickens </v>

1619
01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:28.700
<v Speaker 2>in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

1620
01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:28.700
<v Speaker 2>they can't be out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too fucking hot.</v>

1621
01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:29.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they do.</v>

1622
01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.400
<v Speaker 2>They have to be out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1623
01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's all happy.</v>

1624
01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:38.950
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is ingrained in his DNA soft.</v>

1625
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:40.730
<v Speaker 2>So he doesn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1626
01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:44.330
<v Speaker 2>I want to bring it back to you a fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>intact so that you can't.</v>

1627
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.940
<v Speaker 2>So that if you need this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that blood on his chest?</v>

1628
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:47.750
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1629
01:09:48.690 --> 01:09:50.630
<v Speaker 2>That's blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1630
01:09:50.631 --> 01:09:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Well he brings things to you always </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's a retriever.</v>

1631
01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:58.180
<v Speaker 2>So like he has a little box of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>toys that he has in the house and he's </v>

1632
01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:02.921
<v Speaker 2>the only dog that I've ever had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mangle every toy you give them </v>

1633
01:10:02.921 --> 01:10:05.540
<v Speaker 2>because I've had pit bulls and mastiffs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you give them a toy and they just,</v>

1634
01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.690
<v Speaker 2>they just start tearing apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has carries him around.</v>

1635
01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.190
<v Speaker 2>He carries him around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He brings to you.</v>

1636
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:12.170
<v Speaker 2>So like when I see him in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1637
01:10:12.171 --> 01:10:13.910
<v Speaker 2>good morning sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good morning.</v>

1638
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:16.190
<v Speaker 2>And he's wagging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his tail is happy and the first thing he</v>

1639
01:10:16.191 --> 01:10:20.180
<v Speaker 2>does is run over to his pilot toys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grabs one and comes over with.</v>

1640
01:10:20.181 --> 01:10:21.380
<v Speaker 2>It brings you a president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1641
01:10:21.381 --> 01:10:23.090
<v Speaker 2>he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well he has it in his mouth.</v>

1642
01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.590
<v Speaker 2>He always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a retriever.</v>

1643
01:10:24.591 --> 01:10:29.591
<v Speaker 2>Like if you see retrievers running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times they're carrying their </v>

1644
01:10:29.591 --> 01:10:32.291
<v Speaker 2>leash in their mouth as they're running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love to hold on to things in their </v>

1645
01:10:32.291 --> 01:10:32.291
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>

1646
01:10:32.291 --> 01:10:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he dive in underwater?</v>

1647
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:36.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fucking swims like a motherfucker do.</v>

1648
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:38.690
<v Speaker 2>That dog is always in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

1649
01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:43.780
<v Speaker 2>he will die from the deep end of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if the kids are playing in the </v>

1650
01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:44.120
<v Speaker 2>pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he and I'll let him out the door.</v>

1651
01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:49.210
<v Speaker 2>He runs to the pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stands on the edge and then leaps into </v>

1652
01:10:49.210 --> 01:10:51.220
<v Speaker 2>the water splashes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can loves it?</v>

1653
01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:53.150
<v Speaker 2>Does he dive underwater though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>

1654
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:58.330
<v Speaker 2>That's what we used to have A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to have a black lab and you can </v>

1655
01:10:58.330 --> 01:10:58.760
<v Speaker 2>throw one of those rings under water and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she dived to the bottom,</v>

1656
01:10:58.761 --> 01:10:59.750
<v Speaker 2>grab it and pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1657
01:10:59.751 --> 01:11:00.660
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1658
01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:03.250
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you he will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you he will have.</v>

1659
01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Betty would if I taught them how to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1660
01:11:04.821 --> 01:11:07.810
<v Speaker 2>but he swims like it's instinctual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those fucking dogs.</v>

1661
01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.440
<v Speaker 2>That's my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my bullmastiff.</v>

1662
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:11.360
<v Speaker 2>I cannot get her in the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1663
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:13.410
<v Speaker 2>She looks at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1664
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 2>like you're trying to</v>

1665
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:15.450

<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

1666
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.320
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We both know how this is going to go.</v>

1667
01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:20.560
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1668
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.240
<v Speaker 3>Johnny cash and people always asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1669
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:27.630
<v Speaker 3>to have pictures of my other dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're actually both passed away now.</v>

1670
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:33.250
<v Speaker 3>I had to put them both down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both your bull mastiffs stiff in the </v>

1671
01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:34.040
<v Speaker 3>English of the English bulldog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

1672
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:34.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mix.</v>

1673
01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:39.750
<v Speaker 3>They were uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were both 13 years old and I'm.</v>

1674
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Johnny couldn't walk anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1675
01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:49.160
<v Speaker 3>it was really rough the last few days of</v>
<v Speaker 3>his life.</v>

1676
01:11:49.570 --> 01:11:50.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

1677
01:11:50.521 --> 01:11:55.521
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to bring him in for dinner and when </v>

1678
01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 3>I would try to bring them in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he literally couldn't make it.</v>

1679
01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.170
<v Speaker 3>It was a small yard where he was at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're talking about like,</v>

1680
01:12:01.171 --> 01:12:03.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 yards.</v>

1681
01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.450
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't make it 15 yards to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

1682
01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:11.900
<v Speaker 3>He would like take a couple steps and </v>
<v Speaker 3>his body would shake and he'd take a </v>

1683
01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:15.291
<v Speaker 3>couple steps and he was just sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>all day and he was also having a really </v>

1684
01:12:15.961 --> 01:12:19.020
<v Speaker 3>hard time shifting and he would </v>
<v Speaker 3>occasionally shit in the house.</v>

1685
01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:24.050
<v Speaker 3>Like he couldn't hold his bowels and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't go outside when he wanted to </v>

1686
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.050
<v Speaker 3>look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd see them trying.</v>

1687
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:28.881
<v Speaker 3>But his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his body was so old from massive 13 </v>

1688
01:12:28.951 --> 01:12:30.480
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His crazy old,</v>

1689
01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:35.720
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of them died at like eight or</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine and he was 13 and he was sweet,</v>

1690
01:12:36.451 --> 01:12:39.570
<v Speaker 3>sweet dog up until the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he just,</v>

1691
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:41.160
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1692
01:12:41.161 --> 01:12:43.410
<v Speaker 3>he was suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1693
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:49.130
<v Speaker 3>it was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard when you know them when </v>

1694
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:52.071
<v Speaker 3>they're a puppy and then 10 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're kind of the same and they're</v>

1695
01:12:52.261 --> 01:12:53.940
<v Speaker 3>not men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gone,</v>

1696
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:59.030
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think about that with Marshall </v>

1697
01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:00.060
<v Speaker 3>because he's only a year and a half and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so full of life and he's so fun.</v>

1698
01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:04.110
<v Speaker 3>He's so silly and playful and happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1699
01:13:04.111 --> 01:13:06.630
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna be a day where Marshall's,</v>

1700
01:13:06.631 --> 01:13:09.870
<v Speaker 3>this old old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old dog and I'm going to have to put him</v>

1701
01:13:09.871 --> 01:13:11.100
<v Speaker 3>down to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1702
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:12.360
<v Speaker 3>it was depressing.</v>

1703
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:14.750
<v Speaker 3>And the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brutus the boot,</v>

1704
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:16.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>English bulldog mix.</v>

1705
01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:18.900
<v Speaker 3>He was better than Johnny for a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1706
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Still I've known for the last two years </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't have much time left.</v>

1707
01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:23.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

1708
01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:28.791
<v Speaker 3>they were both struggling hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but brutus took a real hard turn over </v>

1709
01:13:28.831 --> 01:13:31.260
<v Speaker 3>the last few months where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1710
01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:37.190
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't even come in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I tried to get them to come in and </v>

1711
01:13:37.190 --> 01:13:40.640
<v Speaker 3>somebody you want to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to put a little food in front of </v>

1712
01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:43.011
<v Speaker 3>his face and he would try to stand up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and his legs would be shaking so hard,</v>

1713
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:47.400
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard watching them fade away,</v>

1714
01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:50.700
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then also watching them suffer,</v>

1715
01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:52.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last,</v>

1716
01:13:52.170 --> 01:13:54.840
<v Speaker 3>the last days where you have to decide </v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1731
01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:40.480
<v Speaker 2>a female pit bull that had two acl </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconstructions.</v>

1732
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:42.280
<v Speaker 2>She had her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of her back legs done.</v>

1733
01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.040
<v Speaker 2>She blew one out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it fixed,</v>

1734
01:14:45.041 --> 01:14:48.880
<v Speaker 2>blew the other one out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to get that fixed to a dog.</v>

1735
01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:53.910
<v Speaker 2>They shave the bone down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't like reconstruct it where </v>

1736
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:57.370
<v Speaker 2>they add like another ligament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shave the bone down so it doesn't,</v>

1737
01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:02.400
<v Speaker 2>so it sits on the it differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it locks in place so it doesn't pop </v>

1738
01:15:02.801 --> 01:15:03.590
<v Speaker 2>off and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1739
01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:07.120
<v Speaker 2>and go like at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a socket or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1740
01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:12.010
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking like 10 grand a pop.</v>

1741
01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1742
01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

1743
01:15:13.730 --> 01:15:18.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to tell everyone how much </v>

1744
01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:18.730
<v Speaker 1>because I stopped liking me into minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

1745
01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:19.400
<v Speaker 1>what kind of fucking Hollywood idiot are</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

1746
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:24.430
<v Speaker 1>You just killed a dog like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she got one acl and then we fixed </v>

1747
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:24.430
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the uh,</v>

1748
01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.720
<v Speaker 1>then while this one's healing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning good,</v>

1749
01:15:26.721 --> 01:15:29.180
<v Speaker 1>the other acl goes out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we fixed that one.</v>

1750
01:15:29.181 --> 01:15:29.540
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

1751
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:31.370
<v Speaker 1>we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as this one ceiling,</v>

1752
01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:33.800
<v Speaker 1>this one goes out again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1753
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:35.630
<v Speaker 1>and that's when they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to put it down?</v>

1754
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:36.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1755
01:15:36.651 --> 01:15:38.480
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking,</v>

1756
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:40.940
<v Speaker 1>it was like five grand a pop I think and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1757
01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:46.300
<v Speaker 1>and then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it even adds up more because then </v>

1758
01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:46.300
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should keep her here while this,</v>

1759
01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:49.930
<v Speaker 1>while she's healing to do it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>feed her diamonds and then they realize </v>

1760
01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:52.880
<v Speaker 1>they're doing this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that something's wrong with her kneecap.</v>

1761
01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:54.830
<v Speaker 1>And then they realize she's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1762
01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:58.330
<v Speaker 1>it's overbreeding in her bra and her </v>
<v Speaker 1>breed that are kneecaps are bad.</v>

1763
01:15:58.331 --> 01:16:03.331
<v Speaker 1>So they fixed this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one replaced both her kneecaps and </v>

1764
01:16:03.331 --> 01:16:05.940
<v Speaker 1>then one more goes out and they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I feel comfortable knowing there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 40 pound animal that will </v>

1776
01:16:40.301 --> 01:16:42.230
<v Speaker 1>give its life for my daughters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the.</v>

1777
01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:44.090
<v Speaker 1>One of our dog sleeps on one of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughters beds,</v>

1778
01:16:44.091 --> 01:16:49.091
<v Speaker 1>one of our dogs sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Priscilla sleeps in George's bed and I </v>

1779
01:16:49.091 --> 01:16:49.091
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

1780
01:16:49.091 --> 01:16:50.390
<v Speaker 1>No one's coming in anywhere and no one's</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking in anything.</v>

1781
01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1782
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:55.470
<v Speaker 2>I got a buddy who was a German shepherd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a police dog and uh,</v>

1783
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:57.240
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1784
01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:02.420
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those dogs that he has to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all the time and train all the </v>

1785
01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:04.200
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this dog,</v>

1786
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:09.590
<v Speaker 2>it's disturbing thing to have because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you basically have an assassin that </v>

1787
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:11.420
<v Speaker 2>lives with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just waiting for orders.</v>

1788
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Just waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1789
01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.070
<v Speaker 2>my buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my buddies got a German shepherd that he</v>

1790
01:17:16.071 --> 01:17:18.250
<v Speaker 2>hasn't quite figured out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1791
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:19.390
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1792
01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:23.810
<v Speaker 2>you can't work a full time job and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave that thing alone in the yard.</v>

1793
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:26.180
<v Speaker 2>You just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're intense dogs.</v>

1794
01:17:26.181 --> 01:17:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Their intent and their smartest fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a weird way,</v>

1795
01:17:28.971 --> 01:17:30.800
<v Speaker 2>it's like dealing with a complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>chick.</v>

1796
01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:34.100
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you have daddy issues,</v>

1797
01:17:34.101 --> 01:17:36.280
<v Speaker 2>but I can't really figure him out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not spending a lot of time,</v>

1798
01:17:36.281 --> 01:17:37.480
<v Speaker 2>enough time with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1799
01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:38.570
<v Speaker 2>you can't fix them.</v>

1800
01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:43.010
<v Speaker 2>You could train a dog training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A woman can't add in here.</v>

1801
01:17:43.011 --> 01:17:44.330
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you meet someone,</v>

1802
01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:49.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't hear a woman or a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You meet someone who's completely </v>

1803
01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:49.340
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta get Outta there.</v>

1804
01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:50.330
<v Speaker 2>You gotta go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just.</v>

1805
01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:55.760
<v Speaker 2>I want to fix them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know a lot of people that try to fix </v>

1806
01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:55.760
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Bryan County,</v>

1807
01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:59.200
<v Speaker 2>when I first met him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was always trying to fix these crazy </v>

1808
01:17:59.200 --> 01:17:59.200
<v Speaker 2>girls and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1809
01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.710
<v Speaker 2>you gotta save yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to save yourself,</v>

1810
01:18:00.711 --> 01:18:01.940
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't fix someone.</v>

1811
01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:07.300
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the day I decided I would </v>

1812
01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.881
<v Speaker 2>never fix a chick again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a one night stand and I came in </v>

1813
01:18:09.881 --> 01:18:10.310
<v Speaker 2>like 15 seconds.</v>

1814
01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:14.350
<v Speaker 1>She and I told her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1815
01:18:14.351 --> 01:18:16.900
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came and then I was about to say,</v>

1816
01:18:16.901 --> 01:18:18.490
<v Speaker 1>give me a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me reboot.</v>

1817
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go back at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was on top of me.</v>

1818
01:18:21.551 --> 01:18:23.350
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking kidding me?</v>

1819
01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And she punched the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1820
01:18:25.301 --> 01:18:27.250
<v Speaker 1>you got to learn how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to learn how to fuck,</v>

1821
01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.650
<v Speaker 1>you need to read a book and get online </v>
<v Speaker 1>and learn how to fuck.</v>

1822
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:31.270
<v Speaker 1>And I gently rolled out of bed and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1823
01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I think you need to go home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1824
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:36.280
<v Speaker 1>this isn't happening anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she was like,</v>

1825
01:18:36.281 --> 01:18:37.540
<v Speaker 1>excuse me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1826
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:42.990
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not your boyfriend and I'm not your </v>

1827
01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:44.050
<v Speaker 1>fucking husband and what I just saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be able to help.</v>

1828
01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can see it in her eyes.</v>

1829
01:18:46.511 --> 01:18:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Like I gotta get on a train and go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

1882
01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Those were the days I lived those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you,</v>

1883
01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:03.120
<v Speaker 1>would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could go back to one point in </v>

1884
01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.061
<v Speaker 1>your standup career for one year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a live one year in your standup </v>

1885
01:21:05.061 --> 01:21:08.361
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't pick right now where you are </v>

1886
01:21:08.361 --> 01:21:10.551
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to go back to one point </v>

1887
01:21:10.551 --> 01:21:11.700
<v Speaker 1>when one year everyday you show up into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the store.</v>

1888
01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:16.720
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 97 when you're meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orient everyone and you and Duncan </v>

1889
01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Duncan's living on your couch or what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what year that was,</v>

1890
01:21:17.641 --> 01:21:21.390
<v Speaker 1>but around then or you go to the part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is that?</v>

1891
01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean probably one of the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting parts is when you get banned</v>

1892
01:21:24.991 --> 01:21:28.770
<v Speaker 1>from the store from them and see a shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like literally like fuck it.</v>

1893
01:21:28.890 --> 01:21:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a man on a mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1894
01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Like that's one of the more interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts in your story and your life in my </v>

1895
01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:40.050
<v Speaker 1>opinion is when everyone fucking backed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out on you and you were like,</v>

1896
01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:41.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't go on like that.</v>

1897
01:21:41.791 --> 01:21:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Motherfuckers and you just start fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

1898
01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:47.730
<v Speaker 1>What year would you pick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would pick the early days.</v>

1899
01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I pick like when I was just starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get work when I'm in Boston.</v>

1900
01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a Middle Act.</v>

1901
01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I picked those days doing weird shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>road gigs,</v>

1902
01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early twenties.</v>

1903
01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Careless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1904
01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:03.540
<v Speaker 1>no responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>

1905
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:07.260
<v Speaker 1>No nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't even have credit card,</v>

1906
01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:08.820
<v Speaker 1>had nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1907
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:14.510
<v Speaker 1>those were the good days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of ways it's not the today's </v>

1908
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:17.661
<v Speaker 1>not awesome tastes way better for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what was good about those days is </v>

1909
01:22:17.661 --> 01:22:18.030
<v Speaker 1>that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1910
01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:21.030
<v Speaker 1>there's so much wild and freeness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much,</v>

1911
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:27.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I remember one time I did this Gig </v>

1912
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:28.530
<v Speaker 1>in Maine and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the gig he met this girl who had a</v>

1913
01:22:28.531 --> 01:22:29.160
<v Speaker 1>couple drinks.</v>

1914
01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.990
<v Speaker 1>We're hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're both like the same age.</v>

1915
01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:35.040
<v Speaker 1>I think I was probably 22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>23.</v>

1916
01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:36.810
<v Speaker 1>She's probably somewhere around the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

1917
01:22:36.811 --> 01:22:41.811
<v Speaker 1>22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>23 and we're just young and it's the </v>

1918
01:22:41.811 --> 01:22:45.210
<v Speaker 1>summertime and we hung out and we wind </v>
<v Speaker 1>up banging in my car.</v>

1919
01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:50.300
<v Speaker 1>I had like a Honda accord and one and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even go in the back seat because </v>

1920
01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:51.840
<v Speaker 1>it was really barely a backseat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1921
01:22:51.841 --> 01:22:56.841
<v Speaker 1>We like folded down the front seat flat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the windows rolled down and </v>

1922
01:22:56.961 --> 01:22:58.680
<v Speaker 1>we're just sitting there hanging out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

1923
01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:03.810
<v Speaker 1>And I remember having this unique moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I realized like,</v>

1924
01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 1>this is not going be my life forever.</v>

1925
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:11.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be 22 years old with </v>

1926
01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:14.050
<v Speaker 3>like $100 in the bank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not knowing what I'm doing,</v>

1927
01:23:14.051 --> 01:23:17.380
<v Speaker 3>not knowing where I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not knowing what the future holds,</v>

1928
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:22.830
<v Speaker 3>but yet okay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can only be okay with that for </v>

1929
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:27.061
<v Speaker 3>a certain amount of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're 45 and you have $100 in the </v>

1930
01:23:27.061 --> 01:23:31.441
<v Speaker 3>bank and you don't know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing and your career is not really </v>

1931
01:23:31.441 --> 01:23:32.020
<v Speaker 3>established.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't really have a clear path.</v>

1932
01:23:32.230 --> 01:23:34.300
<v Speaker 3>That's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's dangerous.</v>

1933
01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:35.920
<v Speaker 3>It feels like you're a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1934
01:23:35.921 --> 01:23:40.921
<v Speaker 3>you feel like you feel pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel like you haven't done what you </v>

1935
01:23:40.921 --> 01:23:44.161
<v Speaker 3>need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like a certain amount of </v>

1936
01:23:44.161 --> 01:23:45.481
<v Speaker 3>discipline that you haven't taken part </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and because of that your life is </v>

1937
01:23:45.481 --> 01:23:49.020
<v Speaker 3>chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas when you're 22 and that's </v>

1938
01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:49.780
<v Speaker 3>happened in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like that Bob Seger Song,</v>

1939
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:52.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what was that rambling man?</v>

1940
01:23:53.230 --> 01:23:54.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1941
01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:58.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember which one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1942
01:23:58.801 --> 01:24:00.360
<v Speaker 3>he's got a lot of songs about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

1943
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:02.490
<v Speaker 3>He was like a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's night moves,</v>

1944
01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:07.880
<v Speaker 3>but the idea of that you're recognizing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is a unique moment in your </v>

1945
01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:12.870
<v Speaker 3>youth that it's all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what can happen.</v>

1946
01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:15.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might die in a car accident tomorrow.</v>

1947
01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:17.910
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might never make it as a comedian.</v>

1948
01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:21.300
<v Speaker 3>You might take a job somewhere and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>might always have regret,</v>

1949
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:23.270
<v Speaker 3>but right now you're having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now you're,</v>

1950
01:24:23.370 --> 01:24:28.370
<v Speaker 3>you're basically just a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of high school and you know you're </v>

1951
01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:32.930

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:41.151
<v Speaker 3>a good time and it's summer and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>windows rolled down and the air is warm </v>

1954
01:24:41.581 --> 01:24:45.210
<v Speaker 3>and it's just something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was something amazing about it.</v>

1955
01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Those days were fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men and Greg and I fitzsimmons and I did</v>

1956
01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:54.501
<v Speaker 3>a shit ton of gigs together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We worked together a lot back in those </v>

1957
01:24:54.501 --> 01:24:56.280
<v Speaker 3>days because we started out within a </v>
<v Speaker 3>week of each other.</v>

1958
01:24:56.850 --> 01:25:00.750
<v Speaker 3>We were open mic or is it the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and we did a ton of gigs together.</v>

1959
01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:01.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we basically,</v>

1960
01:25:01.651 --> 01:25:05.880
<v Speaker 3>we traveled all over the place together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did a lot of gigs in Rhode Island and</v>

1961
01:25:05.881 --> 01:25:09.300
<v Speaker 3>all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the Massachusetts hell gigs.</v>

1962
01:25:09.301 --> 01:25:11.940
<v Speaker 3>We did all those things together and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we,</v>

1963
01:25:11.941 --> 01:25:15.720
<v Speaker 3>we still do this day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll look back and laugh at those days.</v>

1964
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.500
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Tell Jeff to get on the ball.</v>

1967
01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1968
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:27.860
<v Speaker 3>those days were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>

1969
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:31.130
<v Speaker 3>they're just really unique in that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really have no idea.</v>

1970
01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:36.490
<v Speaker 3>You have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no idea what the fuck the </v>

1971
01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:36.790
<v Speaker 3>future holds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a completely different experience.</v>

1972
01:25:36.791 --> 01:25:41.791
<v Speaker 3>You like your life is a completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>different experience than it will ever </v>

1973
01:25:41.791 --> 01:25:43.550
<v Speaker 3>be ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just remember that.</v>

1974
01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:48.610
<v Speaker 3>I remember that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why it's at one night with </v>

1975
01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:51.110
<v Speaker 3>one girl that I never talked to again </v>
<v Speaker 3>now because back then you'd have to call</v>

1976
01:25:51.111 --> 01:25:53.840
<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd have to be home like in,</v>

1977
01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:56.360
<v Speaker 3>in 1990.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be home.</v>

1978
01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You call them on the phone if they </v>

1979
01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:01.720
<v Speaker 3>weren't home and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1980
01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:01.720
<v Speaker 3>I guess they're not home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1981
01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.310
<v Speaker 3>it's like it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like today,</v>

1982
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:09.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can text someone or you can email </v>

1983
01:26:09.610 --> 01:26:09.890
<v Speaker 1>them or nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to call them at their house.</v>

1984
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:12.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a few of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>few of those that are a member.</v>

1985
01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1986
01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the idea that you didn't have </v>

1987
01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.981
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember road trips with Tom and we </v>

1988
01:26:22.981 --> 01:26:24.250
<v Speaker 1>just would talk for fucking hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right hours.</v>

1989
01:26:24.251 --> 01:26:25.440
<v Speaker 1>We've talked to a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked,</v>

1990
01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:28.330
<v Speaker 1>we drove to Sacramento one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked for five hours there.</v>

1991
01:26:28.331 --> 01:26:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Five hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 hours.</v>

1992
01:26:29.351 --> 01:26:31.240
<v Speaker 1>You spend with a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's on their phones.</v>

1993
01:26:31.241 --> 01:26:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something real about that.</v>

1994
01:26:34.751 --> 01:26:39.751
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're definitely missing </v>

1995
01:26:39.751 --> 01:26:41.911
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely missing something with these </v>

1996
01:26:41.911 --> 01:26:42.550
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were gaining something to where</v>

1997
01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.740
<v Speaker 1>we're gaining a lot more information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>

1998
01:26:44.741 --> 01:26:48.640
<v Speaker 1>my kids haven't lived anyone on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we did that when we were kids.</v>

1999
01:26:48.641 --> 01:26:53.641
<v Speaker 1>There's no phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We a kid on fire one time just because </v>

2000
01:26:53.641 --> 01:26:53.641
<v Speaker 1>we were bored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2001
01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2002
01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's good and bad.</v>

2003
01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:04.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like it balances out I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you had to go back to anytime in </v>

2004
01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:04.020
<v Speaker 1>your comedy career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when would you go?</v>

2005
01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.670
<v Speaker 1>When I just want to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I first started headlining,</v>

2006
01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:10.120
<v Speaker 1>like right when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that first time I just had kids,</v>

2007
01:27:10.450 --> 01:27:15.450
<v Speaker 1>they were young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was making 1300 bucks a week on the </v>

2008
01:27:15.450 --> 01:27:16.580
<v Speaker 1>road and I was so passionate about </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup.</v>

2009
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of pretty hacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

2010
01:27:18.730 --> 01:27:23.730
<v Speaker 1>But like I just would give everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>every night they do a six shows Thursday</v>

2011
01:27:24.791 --> 01:27:29.791
<v Speaker 1>through Sunday and I'd fly in early for </v>
<v Speaker 1>press and I get excited to do press and </v>

2012

<v Speaker 1>I come in and I just be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have my notebook with me all the </v>

2013
01:27:34.081 --> 01:27:34.081
<v Speaker 1>time and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2014
01:27:34.081 --> 01:27:36.400
<v Speaker 1>every idea was like a brand new field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you felt like you were really.</v>

2015
01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:41.600
<v Speaker 1>It was not like you just discovered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet and every page had so much to </v>

2016
01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:41.600
<v Speaker 1>offer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

2017
01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.230
<v Speaker 1>And then I think I got into when I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oddly enough,</v>

2018
01:27:44.231 --> 01:27:47.830
<v Speaker 1>when I got into travel channel stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda just to Kinda,</v>

2019
01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:52.360
<v Speaker 1>it Kinda took a second backseat and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was headlining and I was like,</v>

2020
01:27:52.361 --> 01:27:52.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can do this competently.</v>

2022
01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:59.160
<v Speaker 1>And I think I'm there now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like right now I feel like I'm back to </v>

2023
01:27:59.160 --> 01:27:59.160
<v Speaker 1>this place where I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2024
01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm just writing so fucking much where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2025
01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything.</v>

2026
01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that happens when you </v>

2027
01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:09.710
<v Speaker 1>have to do a special every couple years </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

2028
01:28:09.711 --> 01:28:12.940
<v Speaker 1>when you're filming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing that definitely happens is</v>

2029
01:28:12.941 --> 01:28:16.090
<v Speaker 1>you're forced into this creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're forced to.</v>

2030
01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Whereas we're both aware of those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't.</v>

2031
01:28:18.971 --> 01:28:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

2032
01:28:20.190 --> 01:28:25.190
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sit around for a long time but the </v>

2033
01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:27.301
<v Speaker 1>same material and then it goes year </v>
<v Speaker 1>after year after year and then it gets </v>

2034
01:28:27.301 --> 01:28:29.830
<v Speaker 1>stale or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and staler and flatter and other kind of</v>

2035
01:28:29.831 --> 01:28:31.900
<v Speaker 1>people that write the exact same job </v>
<v Speaker 1>next year,</v>

2036
01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:34.210
<v Speaker 1>their hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same hour.</v>

2037
01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:35.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just say it differently.</v>

2038
01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:40.660
<v Speaker 1>For me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took this hour so fucking seriously,</v>

2039
01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.480
<v Speaker 1>I took it like I was saying to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day,</v>

2040
01:28:43.481 --> 01:28:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I did a hundred and 50 sets.</v>

2041
01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:50.310
<v Speaker 1>I performed that our 150 times before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it on Netflix or before I did it in </v>

2042
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:52.210
<v Speaker 1>the truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it a hundred and 50 times.</v>

2043
01:28:52.211 --> 01:28:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I do the math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

2044
01:28:53.290 --> 01:28:53.800
<v Speaker 1>wow man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2045
01:28:54.010 --> 01:28:56.530
<v Speaker 1>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I arranged it like that,</v>

2046
01:28:56.531 --> 01:29:01.531
<v Speaker 1>working in our and figuring out where to</v>
<v Speaker 1>play stuff and figuring out why we're </v>

2047
01:29:01.531 --> 01:29:02.910
<v Speaker 1>stuffs you go of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessive about that.</v>

2048
01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you film at the Trocadero?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2049
01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:06.780
<v Speaker 1>night two shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking,</v>

2050
01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:09.660
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the second show was a dream.</v>

2051
01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:14.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a great spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lowered the stage so that I'm in the </v>

2052
01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:14.720
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a half moon in there.</v>

2053
01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:17.130
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't just a little plank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no smoke machine.</v>

2054
01:29:17.131 --> 01:29:19.470
<v Speaker 1>I'd seen everyone had smoke machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want a smoke machine.</v>

2055
01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:24.740
<v Speaker 1>And I think it really paid off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sounds silly and you won't notice </v>

2056
01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:26.700
<v Speaker 1>this when you watched your special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because that place is so old,</v>

2057
01:29:26.701 --> 01:29:30.360
<v Speaker 1>there's little particles of dust </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and you can almost see him in</v>

2058
01:29:30.361 --> 01:29:30.660
<v Speaker 1>the back.</v>

2059
01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:32.550
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's like little stars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back.</v>

2060
01:29:32.551 --> 01:29:34.770
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love because of dust.</v>

2061
01:29:34.771 --> 01:29:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2062
01:29:35.281 --> 01:29:37.650
<v Speaker 1>it looks bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks fucking bad ass.</v>

2063
01:29:37.710 --> 01:29:41.010
<v Speaker 1>What is your writing process like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you write stuff out on paper?</v>

2064
01:29:41.011 --> 01:29:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Do you write it on a computer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do it?</v>

2065
01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:48.010
<v Speaker 1>I write it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't sit and longhand anything </v>

2066
01:29:48.010 --> 01:29:48.110
<v Speaker 1>anymore because it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2067
01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I end up losing so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2068
01:29:50.491 --> 01:29:53.370
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I do is if I see something or if</v>

2069
01:29:53.371 --> 01:29:55.890
<v Speaker 1>something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually something happens to me and</v>

2070
01:29:55.891 --> 01:29:56.340
<v Speaker 1>then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2071
01:29:56.341 --> 01:30:01.341
<v Speaker 1>that's the bit and I'll write it in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone and I'll just put it in my phone </v>

2072
01:30:01.341 --> 01:30:04.520
<v Speaker 1>or I'll write and I'll also write it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my book because I bring my book with me </v>

2073
01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:05.720
<v Speaker 1>on stage and I'll go to my book and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the one more thing and I,</v>

2074
01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:10.860
<v Speaker 1>and I say I tell stories and I know I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>known for telling like 12 minute </v>

2075
01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:12.840
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like most of my stories are a little</v>

2076
01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:15.330
<v Speaker 1>tighter now and what I'm writing is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little tighter.</v>

2077
01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:18.360
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of work it out on stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly.</v>

2078
01:30:19.230 --> 01:30:22.040
<v Speaker 1>But I record every set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think go through the recording,</v>

2079
01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in a lot on stage and I'll write </v>

2080
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:27.050
<v Speaker 1>down all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2081
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:27.330
<v Speaker 1>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like even stupid silly lines.</v>

2082
01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:30.000
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the part where I.</v>

2083
01:30:30.001 --> 01:30:30.900
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

2084
01:30:30.901 --> 01:30:32.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I get it like that,</v>

2085
01:30:32.610 --> 01:30:37.610
<v Speaker 1>then I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I recorded again and I find the </v>

2086
01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:38.850
<v Speaker 1>parts where the silences or where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>lazy,</v>

2087
01:30:38.970 --> 01:30:39.540
<v Speaker 1>where I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2088
01:30:39.541 --> 01:30:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I need something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't just go suck my Dick.</v>

2089
01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:44.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's the punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2090
01:30:44.670 --> 01:30:45.900
<v Speaker 1>I record it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write it,</v>

2091
01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:48.690
<v Speaker 1>but I don't long hand write it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had worked for me.</v>

2092
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:50.850
<v Speaker 1>So when you say you write it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how you're writing it,</v>

2093
01:30:50.851 --> 01:30:53.360
<v Speaker 1>you just writing like bullet points?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2094
01:30:53.370 --> 01:30:54.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll write,</v>

2095
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll write bullet points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2096
01:30:56.941 --> 01:30:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think of.</v>

2097
01:30:57.630 --> 01:31:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I have the joke at my best joke </v>

2098
01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:02.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you right now without a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt is about,</v>

2099
01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:05.850
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not about you at all.</v>

2100
01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:11.120
<v Speaker 1>But the opening thing was just some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only part I'll tell you is I went </v>

2101
01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:15.131
<v Speaker 1>into a starbucks and I thought I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting recognized and the young black </v>

2102
01:31:15.131 --> 01:31:15.131
<v Speaker 1>kid behind the counter came up to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2103
01:31:15.150 --> 01:31:16.170
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2104
01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:16.980
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2105
01:31:16.981 --> 01:31:17.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2106
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of Joe Rogan's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2107
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:26.030
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then so then me and him had an </v>

2108
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:27.840
<v Speaker 1>interaction and I made them laugh and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>

2109
01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:29.130
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was funny.</v>

2110
01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:33.360
<v Speaker 1>So then the next day I came back and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>made them laugh again and I went,</v>

2111
01:31:33.570 --> 01:31:35.640
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know where this is.</v>

2112
01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:38.300
<v Speaker 1>So then I ride it out and I figured out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I,</v>

2113
01:31:38.301 --> 01:31:39.330
<v Speaker 1>and then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next,</v>

2114
01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.370
<v Speaker 1>that other interaction was so big I </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized,</v>

2115
01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:42.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need three of those,</v>

2116
01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:44.280
<v Speaker 1>so then I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll punch it out.</v>

2117
01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:49.280
<v Speaker 1>But I and I and I find the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it rhythmic and the things like for</v>

2118
01:31:49.831 --> 01:31:54.831
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that catch and audiences like I </v>

2119
01:31:54.831 --> 01:31:55.430
<v Speaker 1>go and then he fell down and then when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he the moment said something,</v>

2120
01:31:55.470 --> 01:32:00.470
<v Speaker 1>he gets up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leans up like it's almost the rhythm of </v>

2121
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:01.450
<v Speaker 1>the way they say it for me before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with the joke,</v>

2122
01:32:01.451 --> 01:32:03.160
<v Speaker 1>if that makes any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The case,</v>

2123
01:32:03.161 --> 01:32:04.740
<v Speaker 1>like if someone's a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>storyteller,</v>

2124
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:06.310
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's a whole thing going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

2125
01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:09.610
<v Speaker 1>that physical thing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a rhythm thing going on.</v>

2126
01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Like Stan hope is really good at rhythm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when jokes he says like it's easier</v>

2127
01:32:15.131 --> 01:32:18.010
<v Speaker 1>for me to talk about Stan hope then </v>
<v Speaker 1>about myself,</v>

2128
01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:23.460
<v Speaker 1>but like when he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's talking about Isis and how </v>

2129
01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:24.040
<v Speaker 1>they recruit people and it's identical </v>
<v Speaker 1>to how he recruits people.</v>

2130
01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:27.540
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isis,</v>

2131
01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm working this corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that phrasing a good phrase for me.</v>

2132
01:32:31.991 --> 01:32:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Bird does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazingly bird does it amazingly.</v>

2133
01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:37.690
<v Speaker 1>What does he say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does it similar to isis.</v>

2134
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:39.850
<v Speaker 1>The they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was watching a video.</v>

2135
01:32:39.851 --> 01:32:43.000
<v Speaker 1>This is on his special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not putting any jokes out.</v>

2136
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:48.030
<v Speaker 1>This is on a fast special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talks about how isis goes online and </v>

2137
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:52.801
<v Speaker 1>finds like pathetic young men who can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get laid and have drinking and drug </v>

2138
01:32:52.801 --> 01:32:57.180
<v Speaker 1>problems and then they bring them in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they show them a good time and they get </v>

2139
01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:57.840
<v Speaker 1>them drunk and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2140
01:32:58.010 --> 01:33:01.120
<v Speaker 1>that's how I recruit people and if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line is so great,</v>

2141
01:33:01.121 --> 01:33:03.040
<v Speaker 1>he's like Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working this corner.</v>

2142
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Such a great old barker's technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got the weirdest fucking life ever.</v>

2143
01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:14.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a little cult going on and he </v>

2144
01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:16.960
<v Speaker 1>wants to do sober October.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we give them incentive to come here.</v>

<v Speaker 2>here forever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing with your little cult</v>

01:37:48.490 --> 01:37:50.230
<v Speaker 3>never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally,</v>

01:37:50.231 --> 01:37:53.710
<v Speaker 3>one out of 100 times I'll be like taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>a leak and I'll go,</v>

01:37:57.901 --> 01:38:02.901
<v Speaker 2>Like Neal Brennan said it best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that he thinks of his notebook </v>

2282
01:38:02.901 --> 01:38:04.470
<v Speaker 2>as like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a net for catching ideas.</v>

<v Speaker 2>on accident.</v>

2300
01:38:41.690 --> 01:38:43.830

2353
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Not having these bosses and be on </v>
<v Speaker 2>rollercoasters every weekend.</v>

2354
01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Biting your tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>

2355

<v Speaker 2>I used to smoke weed in here and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys have to move the cameras to hide </v>

2356
01:40:50.781 --> 01:40:51.540
<v Speaker 2>the weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't remember that God.</v>

2357
01:40:51.541 --> 01:40:56.541
<v Speaker 2>That was so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what happens with one of </v>

2358
01:40:56.541 --> 01:40:56.541
<v Speaker 2>those gigs.</v>

2359
01:40:56.541 --> 01:40:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Howie Mendell went on stage at the laugh</v>

2360
01:40:56.861 --> 01:41:01.660
<v Speaker 3>factory once and he was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>how scared he was that uh,</v>

2361
01:41:01.810 --> 01:41:06.810
<v Speaker 3>he could say something on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone could tell his bosses because he</v>

2362
01:41:06.971 --> 01:41:09.940
<v Speaker 3>does a family show and then he could get</v>
<v Speaker 3>fired.</v>

2363
01:41:10.770 --> 01:41:12.640
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:16.330
<v Speaker 3>like you're a comic.</v>

2365
01:41:16.331 --> 01:41:21.331
<v Speaker 3>When I was just coming up just starting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he already had specials and they were </v>

2366
01:41:22.001 --> 01:41:26.290
<v Speaker 3>really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was really fucking funny back then,</v>

<v Speaker 3>saying something on stage,</v>

2374
01:41:45.731 --> 01:41:50.731
<v Speaker 3>like saying fuck in his act or talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about something in his act that someone </v>

2375
01:41:50.731 --> 01:41:54.600
<v Speaker 3>deems to inappropriate for a family show</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he can lose this gig.</v>

2398
01:42:48.901 --> 01:42:50.730

<v Speaker 1>I don't mind shooting content,</v>

2399
01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:53.070
<v Speaker 1>making free content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting it out on my own watch,</v>

2400
01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:56.640
<v Speaker 1>like going to swim with the orcas in </v>

2406
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:14.750
<v Speaker 1>but to do something with someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giving me notes and telling me how I </v>

2407
01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:14.750
<v Speaker 1>should behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well not only that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's killing it in their own way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's true autonomy.</v>

2446
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.670
<v Speaker 1>It's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you and showing up at your house.</v>

2449
01:44:50.210 --> 01:44:52.190
<v Speaker 1>The little things we'd see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd be like,</v>

2450
01:44:52.450 --> 01:44:54.890
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I remember Tom was saying something</v>

2451
01:44:54.891 --> 01:44:56.390
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember sitting on that couch.</v>

2452
01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still on the couch.</v>

2453
01:44:57.731 --> 01:45:01.490
<v Speaker 1>She's be back in it and you'd be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sunken and highest terrible,</v>

2454
01:45:02.150 --> 01:45:07.150
<v Speaker 1>terrible couch for doing podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was [inaudible] couch at his house </v>

2455
01:45:07.150 --> 01:45:07.400
<v Speaker 1>for a really long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2456
01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I gave it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2457
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I've started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got it out of my podcast studio.</v>

2458
01:45:10.861 --> 01:45:15.861
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had shipped over to Ari and then he </v>

2459
01:45:15.861 --> 01:45:15.861
<v Speaker 1>used it as his couch.</v>

2460
01:45:15.861 --> 01:45:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And then I think he sold it online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really sold it online.</v>

2461
01:45:18.591 --> 01:45:23.591
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's parts of that old podcast I </v>

2462
01:45:23.591 --> 01:45:26.851
<v Speaker 1>missed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember your landline would ring </v>

2463
01:45:26.851 --> 01:45:26.851
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

2464
01:45:26.851 --> 01:45:27.380
<v Speaker 1>How about my kids when they were real </v>
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>

2465
01:45:27.381 --> 01:45:29.600
<v Speaker 1>when they were like two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be screaming in the background,</v>

2466
01:45:29.601 --> 01:45:34.601
<v Speaker 1>like someone would stub their toe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be crying and you would hear in </v>

2467
01:45:34.601 --> 01:45:35.930
<v Speaker 1>the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was an evolution one fucking time.</v>

2468
01:45:35.931 --> 01:45:39.380
<v Speaker 1>And I had a lot of people come to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>house though and it was weird,</v>

2469
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:43.100
<v Speaker 1>like it was cool with like Bourdain was </v>
<v Speaker 1>over or you know,</v>

2470
01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Jim Jeffries is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But every now and then I'd have someone </v>

2471
01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:48.400
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

2472
01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:51.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if I liked this guy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my house for some fucking Weirdo who I </v>

2473
01:45:51.501 --> 01:45:54.530
<v Speaker 1>brought on the podcast and now they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been to my house.</v>

2474
01:45:54.531 --> 01:45:55.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like she was too intimate.</v>

2475
01:45:55.640 --> 01:46:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I just want my podcast is still at my </v>
<v Speaker 1>house and we're talking about a Tom's </v>

2476
01:46:01.281 --> 01:46:02.710
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2477
01:46:02.711 --> 01:46:07.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't just have these people in my </v>

2478
01:46:07.711 --> 01:46:07.711
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2481
01:46:07.711 --> 01:46:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't want to tell everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom's business,</v>

2482
01:46:09.411 --> 01:46:13.280
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's probably pretty open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's gonna like he's going out,</v>

<v Speaker 1>certain amount of rent per month.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's fun for me.</v>

2496
01:46:51.181 --> 01:46:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Like I shot the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just went around and set up a camera,</v>
