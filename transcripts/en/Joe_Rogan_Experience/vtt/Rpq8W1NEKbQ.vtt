<v Speaker 2>always felt bad.</v>

108
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I had him call on the podcast and I apologize to him and I always call him up</v>

109
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 2>and I called him the other day and we were talking and they told me,</v>

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 2>not that night gave me a hug and I always go on the bottom of one.</v>

149
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 2>That felt really bad and I talked to him and Danny and he started telling me</v>

150
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:52.290
<v Speaker 2>he's 50 he was,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He had a heart attack.</v>

153
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.871
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

154
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I could tell when I talked to him on his pictures on Facebook that he had a</v>

155
00:03:58.661 --> 00:03:59.494
<v Speaker 2>stroke,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that was off from the blow bro.</v>

158
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when he calls me and I can tell he's drinking,</v>

159
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

160
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes I feel real guilty.</v>

161
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.081
<v Speaker 2>Did I do this?</v>

162
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>

163
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't play that shit.</v>

166
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

167
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't play that shit at all.</v>

168
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.640
<v Speaker 2>He was fucked up when I get in that though,</v>

169
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 2>a couple of weeks before,</v>

170
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 2>you know how we got hot,</v>

171
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing started was because he got a Dui fucked up some cars,</v>

172
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 2>went to bold the hospital on North Hospital,</v>

173
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.553
<v Speaker 2>older general.</v>

174
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 2>And while he was in there,</v>

175
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:26.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 2>boulder,</v>

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.331
<v Speaker 2>he was hurt.</v>

178
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 2>They left them in a room by himself when he stole a ball,</v>

179
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 2>liquid cocaines and jumped out the window.</v>

180
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.011
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

181
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 2>And they caught him and I laid on the other side of the boat.</v>

182
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 2>When you steal a bottle of liquor,</v>

183
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:38.640
<v Speaker 2>cocaine from the hospital you already got proud of.</v>

184

185
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:40.460

189
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.170
<v Speaker 2>It makes me feel blank.</v>

190
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I contribute to that,</v>

191
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:45.900
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't.</v>

192
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 2>He had his own doom.</v>

193
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't I get fucked up?</v>

194
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.570

197
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:55.060

198
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:55.894
<v Speaker 2>destroyed me.</v>

199
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.770
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

200
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.760

00:04:57.761 --> 00:04:57.941
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

202
00:04:57.941 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 2>I could do something bad if somebody harms me.</v>

203
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 2>But even with Jujitsu,</v>

204
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I just can't put my forum in somebody's face.</v>

205
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

206
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 2>I hate when I have to lay on somebody.</v>

207
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll check on him and go,</v>

208
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:07.511
<v Speaker 2>you okay bro.</v>

209
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:08.550
<v Speaker 2>You know I love you right now.</v>

213
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:12.251
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>

214
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>

215
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 2>seeing him in that corner,</v>

216
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 2>I always had that guilt that I tied him up.</v>
