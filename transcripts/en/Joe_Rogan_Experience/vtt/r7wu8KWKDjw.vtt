Yeah.
Has Always,
and you came here with great news.

14
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:53.580
As you pulled up,
you said that you,
uh,

15
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.320
you were a correspondent on the daily show.
Yeah.

16
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.930
That happened and actually I did my first piece,

17
00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:01.760
I think it was like two weeks ago.
That's awesome.
And,
uh,
it was a one of them,

18
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.380
one of the most incredible things because you want to be on that show,

19
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.270
<v 2>that,
and part of something you really like.
I mean,
it's like you at the UFC,</v>

20
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:12.930
this is something you enjoy and so you're a part of it and say,
now I'm,
I'm on.

21
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.360
<v 0>Um,
I,
I go both ways on the daily show for,
in one way.
I love it.</v>

22
00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:21.230
I think it's a great show.
I love,
it's so smart.
You know,
some of his,
uh,
those,

23
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.600
the,
the breakdowns that he does and stories and news is,

24
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:26.710
they're just so brilliant and he's so good at it now and so comfortable at it

25
00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:29.420
now.
He's my favorite talk show hosts.
Bye.
Bye.
Yeah,

26
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.330
it's him and Jimmy Kimmel credibly to favorites.
Yeah.
Come on as well.

27
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.550
But he's so Jon steward,
so fucking smooth and he's so good.

28
00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:40.690
It's sits like that show is like,
you know,
it's like,
it's,
to me,

29
00:01:40.691 --> 00:01:44.720
it's like way better than being on Saturday night live.
And um,
in terms of like,

30
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.830
did him being,
it's loose and having a good time,
that's it.
I didn't want to.
Yeah,

31
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.220
we'll tell you.
Always tell you that when we stand up,
have a good time.
Right.

32
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.920
If you're just really,
yeah,
that's an important part of it.
I've done,

33
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.860
I did his show once and it was really cool I think at least once,

34
00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:02.350
but I did it once when a fear factor was coming out and it was,

35
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:06.640
she was really funny.
He's just,
uh,
he's,
he's so fucking smooth and good at it,

36
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.670
you know,
the,
to be on that show is like,
God,
you just nailed an honor.
Yeah.

37
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.480
<v 2>It,
it really is one of the coolest things.</v>

38
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:17.740
It's like in to considering the past comics they've had on and comic actors,

39
00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:20.490
Rob Riggle Cordrey sure.

40
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.710
And the people that they have on now and you know,

41
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:28.050
just go on and Lewis Black and a white Sanuk and just,
uh,
Larry Wilmore.

42
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:31.900
And so here are all these comics and it does an incredible amount for your

43
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:32.620
career.

44
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.740
And I'm still at the point we stand up is not a lot of people know me cause I

45
00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:37.840
haven't been on anything that's really stuck.

46
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.890
<v 0>Yes.
Oh,
a friend of mine went to see you a few years ago.
My Buddy David Hurwitz,</v>

47
00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:45.090
who's one of the producers a fear factor and he didn't know you.
Uh,

48
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.920
he went to see a,
there was a bunch of people,
some sort of a benefit.

49
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.730
I don't remember who the comics war,
but it was,
you see yours back.

50
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:53.860
You went up and I remember he called me up and he goes,
God,

51
00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:57.760
I forget this fucking guy's name.
But he was so good.
He goes,

52
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.830
he was doing all this shit.
His kids,
I go,
Al Magical.
He goes,
yes.
Oh yes.
Yeah.

53
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:06.220
So he was,
he in this was,
you know,
this was years ago.

54
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.360
You're one of those guys to me that your,
your talent and like your,

55
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:13.060
your ability and how funny you are on stage it.

56
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.440
People haven't caught up to it yet.
You're,
you're,
you're fucking hilarious dude.

57
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.500
You're really,
really fun.
I really appreciate that because it's a,

58
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:23.590
I chose to take on doing longer stories.
Yeah.

59
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.330
And that's what I really enjoy doing.

60
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.810
What it takes a while to was you know what the bigger chunk,

61
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.530
like one line or is it common with the bigger chunk and they're hard to keep

62
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:35.800
people in the hook and then to say goodbye to him because you don't want to do

63
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:40.110
them anymore in new,
you're always hoping that another story comes off like,

64
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.410
oh like I'm posting,
Shit happens to me.
Quick stuff is so fun man.

65
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:47.980
It's really good.
It's really good.
Solid standup.
That's why I'm like,
you know,

66
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.950
you're where you are in the public eye.
It's a,

67
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:52.840
your talent far exceeds dot I think.

68
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:56.250
And I think a show like this is just going to let people see your stuff.
Yeah.

69
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.830
It already it comes,
come see our live.
Okay.

70
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:03.520
Cause God damn employee TV sets,
TV sensor like a commercial.

71
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.790
It's a commercial for the live show.
The live show is the real deal.
Sure.

72
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:08.140
And I do tend to,

73
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:11.200
I've been sort of snapping on people a little bit by interacting the audience.

74
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.673
Nothing

75
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.570
<v 2>simple.
I'm the other day,
it's a,
you know,</v>

76
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:20.010
and I insist on being a glutton for punishment and going to the store and

77
00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:24.780
there's just a black girl on her phone.
Oh No.
And I address it right away.

78
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.450
She's not even looking up and I say,
hey,
Hey dawn,

79
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.640
she refuses to get off it.
So I'm talking to her the whole time,

80
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:35.310
but she's gonna make a point and be stubborn.
Oh my God,

81
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.190
I'm going to be stubborn at the same time and I'm not going to let her off the

82
00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:41.100
hooks puts me like version and I can't help but address it.

83
00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:46.020
So I think when you get in the live show is,
yeah,
that loose atmosphere where,

84
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.790
I mean,
and you've had me had a couple of these sounds.

85
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.890
<v 0>Yeah.
Shows,
messages to that woman's phone was,
by the way,
this is your doctor.</v>

86
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.440
You have breast cancer and your child's on fire.

87
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.080
They tried to say that a lot of times it was

88
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.780
<v 2>sometimes when you catch me on the phone,
the girl,</v>

89
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.270
well I don't have a sitter and I have my kid.

90
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.590
<v 0>So we try to make you feel bad.</v>

91
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.120
[inaudible] shit up fake kids.
They have to have,

92
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.450
you do have kids,
you should know you're being annoying to other people.
Yeah,

93
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.860
I have no problem.
People go outside.
I got in a big beef and

94
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.970
<v 2>in south by southwest because some asshole head his iPad to out the day after it</v>

95
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:24.620
came out.
Yeah.

96
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.850
<v 0>Well he's sorta showing everybody.
Right.
Like got an iPad too and check it out.</v>

97
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.700
Yeah.
So is he filming front row?
Oh

98
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.481
<v 2>no,
he's not filming.</v>

99
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:36.481
He's tweeting and we found out that he was tweeting to 32 people in the front

100
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:40.570
row and I go to and put away your iPad to everybody else.
He iPad.
It's nice.
I go,

101
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:43.180
if you're a reporter or a journalist and you were on an iPhone or iPad in the

102
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:44.830
back,
you're in the front row.

103
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.060
There shouldn't be this disconnect between Adi.
You know,

104
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.090
you're at a live show.
Quit look me in the face.
You know,
and don't,

105
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.070
I hate it when I'm at the laugh factory and people look into hung and monitors

106
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.260
that are on the side.
And so now there's this guy with his iPad two.

107
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.140
And so I had to be,
I told him I was going to put my foot through it.

108
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.940
Now he's going to put my foot through his face because he got shitty with me.

109
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.790
You have temper,
I forgot about that.
A huge temper.

110
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.260
You wanted him to hurt this person physically?
Uh,
yeah,
a little bit.
I mean,

111
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:19.550
I was trying,
then I tried to [inaudible] crazy man.
It was crazy.
He did jump us.

112
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.330
He did jump up.
Really?
Um,
I feel like I'm in a good position.

113
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:25.610
I don't think I thought at that point,

114
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.510
but I love the vantage point of a comedian.
Like I said,

115
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.120
why don't you and I need to be able,

116
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.880
they'd have to go down low and then immediately you would get the first shot
off.

117
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:38.780
Yeah.
Yeah.
So it was a big crazy guy.
You said he was big.
No,

118
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:43.160
you should little foreigner.
They little four around at fucking IPAD.

119
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:46.370
That's what it was for.
This is Al Madrigal.
Yeah.
Oh,

120
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:47.800
I pretty much get lumped into the,

121
00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:51.050
the Latino comedy thing that you did for a little while.
I was still,

122
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:54.260
I mean they're getting a lot of those shows and the opportunities that,

123
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.900
because I feel like it's like with Greg Geraldo who I loved as a comic and I

124
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.390
thought she's incredible.
Um,
you know,
he was a comic period.
Just calming.
Yeah.

125
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.740
That's why I didn't even know I was Latino comic until I fucking moved to La.

126
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.630
Like all this chocolate Sundaes shows of

127
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.880
<v 3>Guido Guido show a few times and um,
at the comedy store.
But it's like,
man,</v>

128
00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:18.940
I don't want to be on the show at these fucking guys just because we share some

129
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:20.500
patch of dark where our grandparents,

130
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.850
<v 2>I just,
uh,
yeah.
I,</v>

131
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.030
I just think comic first and those guys also a lot of Latino comps,

132
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:32.900
she ended up doing those same Latino shows over and over and over again.

133
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:36.230
And then when you finally get to put in a situation that they're ill prepared to

134
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.590
handle regular people,
you know,
they can't,
that aren't specifically Latino.

135
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.440
<v 3>I was so glad that there's a lot of different styles though.</v>

136
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.190
I'm glad that there's black comedy.
I'm glad there's Latino comedy.

137
00:07:47.191 --> 00:07:50.100
I'm glad because it's all,
it's very interesting seeing,
you know,

138
00:07:50.101 --> 00:07:54.060
with different cultures and different,
you know,
different sections of society,

139
00:07:54.061 --> 00:07:56.040
what they laugh at and what they think is funny.
And when they,

140
00:07:56.041 --> 00:07:57.810
when they cross over when they don't,

141
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.430
cause this is a lot of really funny white comics that go up in black rooms and

142
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.050
eat dicks.
Yeah.
And it's just,
it's a different fucking thing.
They don't,

143
00:08:07.051 --> 00:08:08.640
first of all,
they don't want,
it's,
it's a,

144
00:08:08.641 --> 00:08:11.760
it's very hard to pull out of a hole in a black audience.

145
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.650
Like once you go into that hold,
the booze start coming and the get off,
get off.

146
00:08:16.651 --> 00:08:18.450
It's like you,
if you're not prepared for that,

147
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.720
if you haven't done a lot of black shows,
like if you bomb one of those shows,

148
00:08:22.721 --> 00:08:23.380
like

149
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.210
<v 2>good thing.
It's like everybody's grew up watching the Apollo.
Yeah.</v>

150
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.790
And they at stand up and they're waiting for the guy with the clown and the cane

151
00:08:30.791 --> 00:08:35.200
to come out because horrible.
So they're not shy about going,
oh my God,

152
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.450
<v 3>it's in a weird,
like a whole group of people.</v>

153
00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:40.960
We'll collectively decide to be haters.
You know,
like that's,

154
00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:42.430
that's the most ridiculous thing ever.

155
00:08:42.431 --> 00:08:45.970
That you're all bullying and his and get off,
get off and they'll attack.

156
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.010
Like they want dudes to fail.
They want dudes to fail.
It's part of fun.

157
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.960
Wesley Snipes,
hypes

158
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.640
<v 2>movie.
I was watching it.
It wasn't new Jack City.</v>

159
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.010
It was something like he was a drug and he was

160
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.980
<v 0>going to court,
I think it was Robin givens.
So we need to look this up.</v>

161
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.820
He goes wrong,
gives me,
he goes,
I just want to hang out with you baby.

162
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.830
How I want to go to the Apollo and Buddha comedian,
you know,

163
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.060
that's what we'll do.
And so that was his pickup line.
He goes,

164
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:13.740
we'll do fun things like who?
The comedian?
Yeah.
Yeah,
the comedy store.

165
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:18.540
It was a fun place for us all because there's no one watching that place,

166
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.500
you know,
in,
in,
it's good and it's bad.
It's good in that,
you know,

167
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:27.090
you're forced to deal with this chaotic world.
That is,

168
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:30.860
that place is an police comedy club.
I ain't died Paris at one point.

169
00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:35.190
I heard the stories about him having chicks on stage.
It's got a naked women.

170
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.433
I've seen that.

171
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.150
And then there's no manager at that point or shout where the manager's D's do

172
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.300
drinking an hour ago.

173
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.290
Nobody gives a fuck or didn't at one point in time in that place.

174
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.920
There was one time when Joey Diaz took his pants down and the,
you know,

175
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:52.710
the original room has a curtain behind it.
I told this story before,

176
00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:55.880
there was a girl named Judy,
since Yachty,
oops,
shouldn't have said her name.
Damn.

177
00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:01.020
And she was on stage and Joey was behind her and every time she would hit her

178
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:01.620
punchline,

179
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.620
Joey would open up the curtain and show his balls and the fucking place she was

180
00:10:07.891 --> 00:10:11.130
killing and she was on stage like so confident.

181
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:13.080
All of a sudden you could see like light up,

182
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:17.620
like it was the best set she's ever had.
She was just fucking nailing every Joe.

183
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.380
She's going crazy because of Joey's balls are sticking out of the curtain.

184
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.530
That's as you can go through the backbone and sneak up behind you to those

185
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:27.180
curtains.
You could,
you could go,

186
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:31.380
there's a total back way to get on stage there because you know the old days

187
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.690
they didn't go on stage through the room like we do.

188
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.960
They would go on stage through the back door here.
Yeah.
That was,
you know,

189
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:41.340
there was like a serious nightclub that Ciro's nightclub when an awful feeling

190
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:44.250
though finding out it was Joey Diaz,
his balls and night.
Your comedy though.

191
00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:47.160
Can you imagine that?
That's a gut feeling will sort of,
yeah,

192
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.000
but together it was really funny.
You know like I've heard joke was a four,

193
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.360
you know Joey Diaz has brought it up to nine balls.

194
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.650
All of a sudden it was like one of the best jokes ever.
Yeah.
I don't know.

195
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.970
I don't know if you heard,
are we allowed to talk about what Jody is just got?

196
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.580
I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about what is that?
[inaudible]

197
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.300
has got a role for a kid's show,
like a live action kid show.

198
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:07.880
And I don't want to go too much into,

199
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.200
cause I'm not allowed to know if I'm allowed to say it,
but I was thinking,

200
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:14.070
what if he becomes like this huge celebrity in the kid world?

201
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.730
So now he's like at the airport called,
what the fuck?
I got a little kid come up.

202
00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:20.430
What's our Ah,
hey tracking is and ponies.

203
00:11:20.431 --> 00:11:25.170
Can you imagine having him having to act like shift gears,
shift gears.

204
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.510
He's gotta Watch out to signing autographs for eight year olds.
Wow.

205
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.240
The idea is this,
it makes me laugh.
Thinking about that though,

206
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.230
he did these great and you don't want to,

207
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.840
I'm not sure how much time he spends around your kid,
but he was great.

208
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.050
I ran into him on a lot when we were both filming a TV show and my son was two

209
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.060
maybe at the time and he goes,
come via a little red zone.

210
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.410
Uncle Joey's got take care of you.
Come on.
My son looked up at her and he goes,

211
00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:53.770
this guy's hilarious.

212
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:58.030
Like he looked at her and went right to him and Joey was holding him and it was

213
00:11:58.031 --> 00:12:01.420
like the,
the cutest things.
Like he'd let go uncle Joey like,
damn,

214
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:05.470
my son is playing with it.
And just,
it was like,
oh my God,
he's great with kids.

215
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.150
And he'd perfect for a kid show nine capsules.
Joey has nine cats.

216
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.450
How many are you allowed to have?
Right.

217
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.870
He lives in an apartment you shouldn't have mentioned busted.
He is.
He did.

218
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:19.990
He did move to a house or is he still in an apartment now?

219
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:23.070
He's in an apartment and I think he got to where?
Cats or something like that.

220
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.370
Yeah,
he got 11 wow.
That is nuts man.

221
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.160
That is nuts.
I was just talking to these guys.

222
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.880
I'm allergic to check my worst nightmare.
Crazy.

223
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.750
You,
you telling me that you had to take a allergy,

224
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.990
allergy medication before you came to my house?
I only have two.

225
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.410
And you have to and the end,
then we shave them and then take them to a groomer.

226
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.560
So the gets less hair in the,
in the ward.
And the last time I was here,

227
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.710
I didn't take an allergy medication and it wasn't actually even that bad.

228
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:55.480
But 11 cats for certain God,
six and I think it's a one is a two bedroom,

229
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.280
two bedrooms.
I think it's two bedroom.
Yeah.

230
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.740
You know how everyone's allergic to cats,
right?

231
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.870
And like every single person in the road is allergic to cats.

232
00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:06.510
It's six different levels.
It's the Dander.
But here's a Whoa,
whoa,

233
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.290
everyone's allergic.
Everybody.

234
00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:11.950
You sure you were saying allergic like as an allergic reaction to everyone.

235
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.100
If you take a scoop of a cat dander,
no matter who it is,

236
00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:18.880
if you somehow collected cat dander and you put it in your eye or something like

237
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:22.510
that,
you would have in the allergic reaction to it and you real.
Yeah.
But I,
I,

238
00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:24.680
you know,
those are little hairballs once in a while we'll,

239
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.110
that will fall off a cat when they,

240
00:13:26.111 --> 00:13:30.220
it hasn't been shaved recently I had one on my pillow and I slept on it and I'm

241
00:13:30.221 --> 00:13:33.520
not allergic to cats too to any extent really.

242
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:38.380
But I had that and I slept on it right in my eye.
My eye swolled up for two days.

243
00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:41.440
I,
it looked like I got punched in the eye over the week,
over the weekend.

244
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.940
And it's just now coming down.

245
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:45.520
I don't know if it's still looks at when you decided you'd better calling a

246
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:49.720
professional.
Yeah,
exactly.
I call it an it professional.

247
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.450
I'm trying to find this cat dander thing online to see if that's true,

248
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:55.530
but it just be nasty.
Anyway.
It would give you,
if it got in your eye,

249
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.780
you don't necessarily think you could call that an alert.
There's definitely,

250
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.260
there's definitely different degrees in your iPhone and I think almost

251
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:04.450
everything would fuck your idea,
but isn't allergic.

252
00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:07.510
Like it gets in your skin and you have a reaction.
Look at me.
I can't breathe.

253
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.800
I mean,
that's why I'm holding this up.

254
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:13.500
Throat swells up and my eyes start to really water and um,
you know,

255
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.620
I'm screwed in my mind.
He starts hearing welts.

256
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.090
We had a real issue once on fear factor and one of the very few we did where we

257
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:24.040
found out that if you're allergic to shellfish are also allergic to roaches and

258
00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:26.080
we,
yeah.
And we fed these people,

259
00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:30.300
these giant Madagascar hissing cockroaches and a one dude,
his,

260
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.490
his throat started closing up.
Shit got really scary.

261
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.310
He imagine if that was the wrong person,
you could have easily killed somebody.

262
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.400
They monitor them,
you know,
they have medics and they also,

263
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.310
I don't know how that could have slipped by though.

264
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.770
What it sounds like you have to know,

265
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.200
you have to find out what is the latest on that you were on Perez Hilton

266
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:50.050
yesterday or today or something like that.
If president and said something nice.

267
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:53.900
I appreciate it.
Thanks dude.
Um,
yeah,
uh,
they,
uh,

268
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.510
fear factor is going to come back.
It's going to come back for 10 episodes.

269
00:14:56.511 --> 00:14:59.480
So I don't know if I'm doing on the chill network is then no,
no.

270
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:00.820
It's going to be on NBC saying,
Oh wait,

271
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.820
I heard that they're thinking about getting rid of the bees stunts though.
No,
no,

272
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.590
no,
no.
That's not true.
So if they do it,

273
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:09.200
I'm sure they're going to do it the way we did it.
It's all the same team.

274
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.220
It's a CUNY and Dave Herwitz sin and Rupert Thompson,
the director,

275
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:18.221
they know exactly what the fuck they're doing the reruns for doing so well dad,

276
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.630
what they did,
they just got it down to a science.

277
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:24.770
Rupert is a bad ass director and and and [inaudible] is an awesome producer.

278
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.550
They've been doing those shows like dog eat dog and you know he does like all

279
00:15:28.551 --> 00:15:29.030
those,

280
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.780
you know like what does that wipe out and like they have those shows down to a

281
00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:33.860
science.
They wouldn't fuck with it.

282
00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.160
What they would do with fear factors just make the stunts were cooler looking

283
00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:39.320
now,
now that there's HD,

284
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.020
I mean you can do some shit with cameras that we can never do back then.

285
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.280
It have to do that show though.

286
00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:45.950
That fear factor to a lot of people I think is you.

287
00:15:45.951 --> 00:15:50.270
I think that's what made the show that's very flattering but a sort of just had

288
00:15:50.271 --> 00:15:51.770
fun with it and helped it along.

289
00:15:51.771 --> 00:15:53.570
It would have been crazy weather I was there or not.

290
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.670
If somebody else was there that was fun.
It would have been there kind of crazy.

291
00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.753
But you can never,

292
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.340
you can always speculate what shows would be like without the original house,

293
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:02.570
but it's like,
yeah,
you know,

294
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:08.230
and they'll probably get somebody that looks kind of like [inaudible] his new

295
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:13.190
album.
It would bring up Mario Lopez is what we always said.
Mario Lopez.
Yeah,

296
00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:17.240
totally.
But he's one of those do is it can host anything.
Yeah,
handsome bastard.

297
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.770
I don't know.
I don't know what if I'm going to do it.
I,

298
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.390
I'll tell you what though.
I,
if you had asked me after fear factor was over,

299
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.560
like what?
I thought I would been like,
God,
I'm done.
I want to do other shit.

300
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.120
But having a few years off of it and then all this talk about doing it,
I'm like,

301
00:16:32.121 --> 00:16:33.950
wow,
that might be kind of fucking crazy.

302
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.400
That might be crazy to just do still a few episodes.
I think it's,

303
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.310
I love this shot and then near the end I got kinda tired of it.

304
00:16:40.311 --> 00:16:41.750
But now I crave it again.

305
00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:44.330
I will see it on TV and I will rewatch it and it's like watching it for the

306
00:16:44.331 --> 00:16:47.780
first time.
I think it's fun.
Yeah,
I think it could be huge.
Yeah,
I think so.

307
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.890
I think it's,
and I think you know a lot of staff there do as well.

308
00:16:51.891 --> 00:16:55.490
I mean you've gone off and done other things.
It has attracted is a lot.

309
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.580
I mean do you probably have a lot more people coming to the show and you'll

310
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:02.960
bring a lot to it as well.
It's not just that the show is iconic,
it's a,
you know,

311
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.420
I think you've done a lot of shit since then.

312
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.560
Dad would have a new audience looking at.
Yeah,
maybe.
But you know what the show,

313
00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:12.860
the difference in the show in anything else that I do is that everyone can watch

314
00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:17.720
it.
One of the appeals of the show was that is ridiculous.
You know,
for an adult,

315
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.960
it's a ridiculous show.
You know,
you'll be watching going,

316
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.730
this is fucking ridiculous.
Well.
It's ridiculous.
The little kids too.

317
00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:25.790
It's fun to them too,
so it's fun for like old people.

318
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.970
Like you can watch it with your whole family.
That's it.
That's what wipeout is.

319
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.580
She said,
my kids love themselves.

320
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.190
Overweight lady do it for the podcast.
It's second you do that for the podcast.

321
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.700
The podcast would blow the fuck up.
Maybe we'd get too much scrutiny.

322
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.660
Maybe that's the issue because I'm under scrutiny right now for the,

323
00:17:44.661 --> 00:17:46.560
my use of the word country.
Yes.

324
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.150
It's called Cunty Gate 2011 nice.
Putting

325
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.240
<v 3>her why on anything really sweet.
I thought it was sweet.</v>

326
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.130
I look at the word as if it's like the word bitchy and I realize from the

327
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:03.300
reaction of all these different people that other people do not share my
opinion.

328
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.530
Do we have a kid visit from England?
It he dropped it.
I mean seriously.

329
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.640
Many times.
Yeah.
They just,
they won't stop throwing the Y on it.

330
00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:16.170
It's like saying somebody,
well it's like her writing is what I was describing.

331
00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:18.130
The,
the writing is country on it,
but I said she,

332
00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:19.440
I said she's all kinds of country.

333
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:24.570
I meant what is representative of her is all I know of her is her writing.

334
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.270
You know,
she is a human being.
She might be a very nice person.

335
00:18:27.271 --> 00:18:28.880
She might just be misguided in the way,

336
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.590
this type of style of insulting writing that she does.

337
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.380
But it's bitchy and I don't,

338
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.720
and I don't like it and I should have used the word bitchy cause that's what I

339
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:40.430
meant.
But I wrote the word country and everybody said,
Oh,
you're calling a cunt.

340
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.040
I'm like,
that's not what I did.
But it Kinda is,
but it's not.

341
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.551
You know what I mean?

342
00:18:44.551 --> 00:18:48.060
To my circle of friends and the way the people that I hang out with,

343
00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:50.430
we throw country around like a beach ball,
right?
I mean we are,

344
00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:53.620
we're always using the word country testy.
It's like,
to me like wouldn't,

345
00:18:53.621 --> 00:18:57.500
they would never say that,
but I don't think that's,
he's my list.
There's not,
not,

346
00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.920
it doesn't make molesta getting cuter.
I'm sure she's called worst things in bed.

347
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.760
The whole thing,
it's she what,
what she's doing is negative.

348
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.450
But what I did was negative too.
There was probably a better way of handling.

349
00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.430
It's a message board by the way.
Calling your content.
Yeah.

350
00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:15.660
It wasn't like I did an interview,

351
00:19:15.661 --> 00:19:18.060
I would just wrote something on a message board and what I was,

352
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.670
the only reason why I wrote it is because this one guy,
um,

353
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.610
I think he calls himself the Skywalker who's on this uh,

354
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:29.610
mixed martial arts.com message board had this very eloquent way of describing

355
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.740
what was wrong with this woman and her style of writing.
And it was just Bingo.

356
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:35.970
And so I wrote boom.

357
00:19:35.971 --> 00:19:40.230
And the whole thing was all about an interview that Quentin rampage junior did.

358
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.850
Is he a junior?
Did I just make that up?
Jackson?
Shit.
Why did I say junior?

359
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.530
Oh cause I was watching Roy Jones all day today.

360
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.740
It's like what the fuck would that come from?
Quintin Jackson,

361
00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:53.900
Quentin Rampage Jackson.
Not fucking God damn it.

362
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:57.690
Eventually is this going to happen?
So this doesn't diminish my point.
Consulting,

363
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.170
not by choice,
but anyway,
a rampage is doing an interview with this woman and he,

364
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.700
he jokes around about a motorboating or like getting his head between her tits

365
00:20:05.701 --> 00:20:09.300
and I didn't even see it.
It's fun.
You know,
I'm,
I'm sure it's ridiculous.

366
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.490
We probably should watch it to see how ridiculous it is.
But um,

367
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.520
what I was responding to is just this woman in her writing and wasn't really,

368
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.680
and,
but I could have done it a better way.

369
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.500
I you're calling someone country is not the real,
you know,

370
00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:25.110
sometimes I get lazy dude when I respond to something.

371
00:20:25.111 --> 00:20:26.610
I just wanted it as chicks,
all kinds of country.

372
00:20:26.611 --> 00:20:29.520
I don't think I'm going to have to explain myself.
I don't think,
you know,

373
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.980
I just feel like I'm just posting something on a message board.

374
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:35.310
We're all just hanging around.
It's like a virtual street corner.

375
00:20:35.311 --> 00:20:37.650
When you do post something on a message,
boy,
you expect that.
I mean,

376
00:20:37.651 --> 00:20:40.790
who's look how many people are really looking at that as well.

377
00:20:40.791 --> 00:20:43.980
There's mixed martial arts was a very popular message board.

378
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.500
Take it out of the message board and then use it against you in other bodies and

379
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:53.470
call for me to be fired.
Call for me to be suspended,

380
00:20:53.471 --> 00:20:55.930
call for me to be fine people.
I don't know.

381
00:20:55.931 --> 00:20:59.560
And I did apologize before any of the shit hit the fan.
I actually went,

382
00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:01.240
a few people started getting upset at me.

383
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:04.270
I actually apologize for these use of the word country cause I said,

384
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:05.150
you know what,
I,

385
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:09.610
it's probably something from my standup comedian vernacular that I don't

386
00:21:09.611 --> 00:21:12.870
perceive how it,
how you're perceiving it and I don't mean it how you are.

387
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.610
You're perceiving it from me.
So that's what I tried to explain.

388
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.270
But I also tried to say in the same,
uh,
apology that,
listen man,

389
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.220
you're putting some negative shit out there.

390
00:21:21.221 --> 00:21:23.290
There's a reason I'm responding to you like this.

391
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:27.130
I'm responding to you like this cause I've read disrespectful things that she's

392
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:28.030
written to fighters.

393
00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:31.330
She will just disrespectful thing to Tim Silvia after we lost.

394
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.120
And that kind of shit really pisses me off.

395
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.820
That snarky rude.
You know,

396
00:21:36.821 --> 00:21:40.450
that that style of insulting journalism.
I don't like it.

397
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.210
If you don't take it as a place in mixed martial arts,

398
00:21:43.211 --> 00:21:46.780
cause mixed martial arts is a crazy fucking sport.
And in this sport,

399
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.010
a person literally risks their health.
They get out there,
they train.

400
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:54.430
It becomes the focal point of six to eight weeks of their fucking life.

401
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.630
And then they get out there and in front of everybody in,
you know,

402
00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:59.820
these little shorts,
they,

403
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.410
they'd go out and they throw their fucking bones at each other.

404
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.380
And to win is the most incredible thing ever.

405
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:09.160
And to lose is the most devastating thing imaginable.

406
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:13.660
It's like to lose is like the death of a dog.
That's what it's like.

407
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.890
It's like that kind of pain.
It's like this unstoppable pain,

408
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.450
emotional pain.
So a lot of these guys,
these guys get,
they get their ass kicked.

409
00:22:22.451 --> 00:22:24.760
Maybe they didn't train so hard,
maybe it didn't go so well,

410
00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:29.770
but then they have to read some disrespectful bullshit by someone who's never

411
00:22:29.771 --> 00:22:34.390
fucking competed by someone who's never put their ass on the line by someone

412
00:22:34.391 --> 00:22:39.391
who's never thrown their body into a cage for everyone else's entertainment.

413
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.190
I think if you make fun of that and you,
you,
you mock them,
fuck you.
You know,

414
00:22:45.191 --> 00:22:46.930
fuck you.
You're not getting it.
There's a,

415
00:22:46.931 --> 00:22:50.410
there's a way to say that someone's doing something wrong.

416
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.380
There's a way to say this guy,
here's the bottom line.
He's a very talented,

417
00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:56.800
but he needs to get in shape.
He's,
he's fat.
That's,
let's be realistic about it.

418
00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.420
There's that,
which is just,
you're,

419
00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:02.140
you're making an assessment of someone's ability and what they need to change

420
00:23:02.141 --> 00:23:03.670
and what they're doing wrong with their diet are there.

421
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.900
But when you just get snarky and shitty and insulting,

422
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:13.090
that shit drives me fucking crazy.
It just drives me nuts.

423
00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.280
Cause only douchebags do that.

424
00:23:15.281 --> 00:23:18.550
And they only do it because no one's ever told them that they're being douche

425
00:23:18.551 --> 00:23:19.870
bags,
you know?

426
00:23:19.871 --> 00:23:24.430
So I feel like it causes more negative energy to let shit like that slide than

427
00:23:24.431 --> 00:23:25.510
it does to bring up.

428
00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.630
And I make these judgment calls and I just call someone cunty.

429
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.550
I really probably shouldn't do it.

430
00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.190
And I did apologize to her because like I said,
I don't,

431
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.260
I don't mean it the way they're perceiving it.

432
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.540
I mean [inaudible] the guy can be country too.
We can all be cunty countries.

433
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.830
Just like your net talk.
It's so different.
That's five years.
In five years,

434
00:23:41.831 --> 00:23:46.070
the president will be saying in speech,
you know constantly,
if you run

435
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.430
<v 4>for brethren,
fuck.
Maybe after Sarah Pailin does standard.
Yes.</v>

436
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:51.770
Solo president,

437
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:55.640
Red Band 2024 look at that and get that dude from New York that accidentally

438
00:23:55.641 --> 00:23:58.960
tweeted out a picture of his cock.
Did you see that shit?
I mean,

439
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.940
we're going to have presidents saying conti on the fucking TV.

440
00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:02.990
This is ridiculous.

441
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.390
<v 3>It's going to get to a point with the transparency of the world right now that</v>

442
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.780
one of two things is going to have to happen.

443
00:24:07.781 --> 00:24:12.730
Either people are going to actually have to actually become real nice people or

444
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.390
they're,
you know,
or no one's going to be president.
I mean,

445
00:24:16.391 --> 00:24:19.480
if you're going to be able to see and to a person that's very fucking soul,

446
00:24:19.481 --> 00:24:22.420
eventually you know,
you're,
you're going to know everything about them.

447
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.860
It's like as we get closer and closer to each other with Twitter and Facebook

448
00:24:26.861 --> 00:24:30.490
and facetime and we're getting closer and closer to each other and it's going to

449
00:24:30.491 --> 00:24:34.210
eventually reach some fucking crazy point where we're all sharing each other's

450
00:24:34.211 --> 00:24:37.450
minds.
And when that happens,
you know,

451
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:40.960
we find out what creeps we all are,
you know,

452
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.560
who the fuck is going to be president then who the fuck is going to be president

453
00:24:44.561 --> 00:24:46.240
then?
No one's going to want it.

454
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.700
What to think about the shit that Kennedy got away with,
right?

455
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.630
Everybody knows that Kennedy was banging Marilyn Monroe and he was a womanizer

456
00:24:52.631 --> 00:24:55.390
and his family came from moonshine running.
I mean,

457
00:24:55.391 --> 00:24:58.130
they had like this crazy fucked up pass.
They were there,

458
00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.430
basically had an organized crime past their,

459
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.250
their whiskey runners back during the,
you know,

460
00:25:03.251 --> 00:25:05.960
that's where they made their money.
They made their money during,
uh,
uh,

461
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:10.690
the prohibition.
So we,
if that was today,
cause you imagine,

462
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.320
could you imagine some womanizer who's,
you know,

463
00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.480
whose family was an organized crunch.

464
00:25:16.481 --> 00:25:20.030
Do you imagine for a second that guy like Kennedy would have a,

465
00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:22.860
a brief chance of being the president?
I mean,

466
00:25:22.861 --> 00:25:25.510
while he was probably one of our best presidents ever,
right?

467
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.140
I mean as far as everybody loves to Romanticize it because he died,
but God,

468
00:25:29.141 --> 00:25:30.640
he made some brilliant speeches.
Matt,

469
00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.780
<v 4>we were friends we're talking about the other day.
It's like,</v>

470
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:37.930
do you really think the CIA hasn't learned how to turn on somebody's camera on

471
00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:40.310
their Mac book pro?

472
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:46.130
They knew how to look at that,
that hacking group that did the PS three,

473
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:50.540
the lust sec guys or whatever they're called.
They hacked into like,

474
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.000
they've been hacking into all these websites lately.

475
00:25:53.001 --> 00:25:56.330
Like you'd be followed their Twitter.
It's kind of scary how awesome.

476
00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.070
He's our mean,
uh,
how talented these guys are,

477
00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.790
are they are fucking with the FBI.

478
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:06.260
They fucking Hack Nintendo the other day and they loved Nintendo so much that

479
00:26:06.261 --> 00:26:08.600
they didn't want to do anything.
So they just said,
hey,

480
00:26:08.601 --> 00:26:11.850
we love you too much to do anything.
Really.
Here's how we got.
Okay.

481
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:16.040
How do you not respect that?
I'm not saying I'm pro hacker on entirely,

482
00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:21.040
but I respect the fuck out of that move.
Yeah,
but what's up with tendo?

483
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.160
They make awesome shit out.
Keep them in business.
No,
but that's crazy.

484
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.250
And then the apple today announced all this cloud based Shit,

485
00:26:28.251 --> 00:26:31.790
which is scaring me to death because now what they're pretty much saying is

486
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.940
everything like you're late,
all your photos,
your all your music,

487
00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:38.390
all your documents.
The last time you saved something on your computer,

488
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.910
you can do it on one computer and then go to another computer,

489
00:26:40.911 --> 00:26:44.730
have the exact same shit on your computer and it's all based on the cloud

490
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.380
wireless data system.

491
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:51.150
What if you accidentally lose your laptop and somebody gets to turn it on and

492
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:53.550
sees all your documents,
your photos,
your videos.

493
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:58.380
We're going to see some fucking crazy shit coming up now.
I mean they,

494
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.270
apple,
if apple was smart,

495
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.810
they would have some kind of window that's on your computer that shows how far

496
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:08.310
away each one of your devices is at all times that I was using that the other

497
00:27:08.311 --> 00:27:12.630
day.
On Your iPad you can get,
you can lock everything and crack everything.
Yeah,

498
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:13.111
you track,

499
00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:16.530
but have it be a part of the operating system where it has some kind of security

500
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:18.810
issues like that build in is so just in case,

501
00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:22.950
if you don't realize your iPads in Mexico right now,
that you know,

502
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.710
you could see it kind of like a graph.
You know what it means,

503
00:27:25.711 --> 00:27:26.910
some kind of meter or something.

504
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:30.260
It was telling me about these yesterday about this,
uh,

505
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.020
this guy has my PC or this guy has my laptop.
Did you know about that at all?

506
00:27:34.021 --> 00:27:34.291
It's like,

507
00:27:34.291 --> 00:27:38.520
this guy has my laptop and there's software that you can put on anything that

508
00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.540
you did a PC or Mac where somebody steals your shit and then they go on to log

509
00:27:42.541 --> 00:27:45.410
on and go to the Internet in your camera comes on and they take a picture of,

510
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.631
yeah,

511
00:27:45.631 --> 00:27:48.820
there's a whole website about this guy that lost his camera and it shows like,

512
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.230
like it's a whole story book of like this Indian guy or something like that.

513
00:27:52.231 --> 00:27:53.610
And he's like never wearing shirts.

514
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.840
<v 0>Oh.
So it didn't seem to be a girl lost her.</v>

515
00:27:55.930 --> 00:28:00.250
She lost her cell phone and she had a bunch of naked pictures on it and the guy

516
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.520
texted those naked pictures to everyone and our contacts.

517
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.270
I knew her about that.
This one?
Yeah.
This is really recently.

518
00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.110
This is really recently.
Some girl,
uh,
I think it was a droid phone.

519
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.580
I don't remember.
Don't sue me.
George Bush and Dick.
What an asshole.

520
00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.060
<v 4>You know what the attacker should've done?</v>

521
00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:22.530
It's fucking hacked MTV and stop that whole movie award.
Shit.
Have you been,

522
00:28:22.531 --> 00:28:27.000
did you watch that?
That bullshit.
Nowadays they MTV movie awards.

523
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:31.770
Every single movie was twilight,
Best Kiss,
best actor,
best comedy or best,

524
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:36.420
but it was,
it's pretty much listen to mother fucker watching MTV.

525
00:28:36.421 --> 00:28:41.070
So surprised it's for little girls.
It's like how old are you son?
No,

526
00:28:41.071 --> 00:28:42.930
but I do like movies.

527
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.800
<v 0>Okay.
Listen,</v>

528
00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:48.790
the Oprah movie club would be completely different than the Joe Rogan movie
club.

529
00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.680
You know what I'm saying?
Oh Shit.
That I would love.

530
00:28:50.681 --> 00:28:54.040
She would hate shit that she would love to.
I would hate,
it's all 14 year olds,

531
00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:57.110
bro.
You're talking about empty fucking fee.
Oh,

532
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.900
I absolutely agree with such bullshit.

533
00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:01.930
You know we need the good hackers don't there?
We should nuke them.

534
00:29:01.931 --> 00:29:03.880
The alien should come in and invade.

535
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.020
<v 4>I didn't even know it was on.
I just turned it on and watch it,</v>

536
00:29:07.021 --> 00:29:08.630
but it's pretty ridiculous.

537
00:29:08.631 --> 00:29:13.610
I went to the Party for that MTV movie.
He worked at the after party.

538
00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:17.910
Sweet.
How much the case sex did you have?
Quite a bit

539
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.333
from me.

540
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.940
<v 0>The best part about that was you struggled.
Struggled through the word a little.</v>

541
00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:28.440
Oh,
I was thinking of it.
Perfect case.
It was like,
it was like,

542
00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:31.140
is he slipping here and you got to fall through.
That was awesome.

543
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.010
<v 4>Me and my wife and then her boyfriend to,</v>

544
00:29:35.011 --> 00:29:39.530
she Brodie talking to a Rod.
That was exciting.
Oh really?
He's been in his glory.

545
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.040
It was wonderful.
He was a really,
did you see

546
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.720
<v 5>me talking to a Rod?</v>

547
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:48.640
So he knows me and then a red is easy,
was here.

548
00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:51.250
So we were all,
uh,
and I,
but it was,

549
00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:54.430
it was funny seeing sandy celebrities and it gossip and yeah,

550
00:29:54.431 --> 00:29:57.790
we saw those twilight people who were at a party and we left pretty early.

551
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:01.000
It was weird.
W The one toilet guy,
Edward,
or I don't even know his real name,

552
00:30:01.001 --> 00:30:02.020
I just know his character's name,

553
00:30:02.021 --> 00:30:05.860
but he kind of went off on Reese Witherspoon in a weird,
creepy way.

554
00:30:05.861 --> 00:30:09.940
He like said something about how he was in her when he was a kid.

555
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:13.780
He was in a movie with her and she was directly responsible for getting his park

556
00:30:13.781 --> 00:30:17.230
cut from the movie while giving her an award for like best chick of the year

557
00:30:17.231 --> 00:30:18.910
award or something like that.

558
00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:22.360
So he kind of like called her out on being an ass in a movie together.

559
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.940
And then there were seven years later they were in a movie.
But she's like,

560
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:28.240
he's like,
she doesn't know about this,
but that's so silly because like,

561
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:32.590
you know what if he sucked,
what do you mean she's directly responsible?

562
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.600
How could be really good?

563
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.380
He's probably just trying to be funny and he really went together or something.

564
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.160
I mean,
oh,

565
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.940
maybe it's an inside joke or it's just one of the bad writing that was done for

566
00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:46.750
somebody who writes all the in betweens,
you know?
And for the movie awards,

567
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.730
that's a gig where somebody has to write.

568
00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:51.300
Some people do like to be victims of God.
Damn.

569
00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.710
I've talked to so many guys that you know,
I went out for that.
Oh,

570
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:57.400
I got fucked over by the casting director.
Like what?
You know,

571
00:30:57.401 --> 00:31:00.680
like you get a dwell on the negative shit dudes will tell you.
No,

572
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:04.500
I got in his fucking casting directors.
Yeah.
It just never really liked me.

573
00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:08.110
Just really,
it was my time.
The other guy totally chases her ass,
so I get fucked.

574
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.213
Like whoa.

575
00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.910
Same people who are just making external courses for everything bad that happens

576
00:31:12.911 --> 00:31:16.930
to him was never your fault.
It's always the casting.
It's always my,
you know,

577
00:31:16.931 --> 00:31:21.310
the car or train or they always have some sort of a person or thing to blame.

578
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:24.940
Yeah.
Those guys are brutal.
Those guys are so brutal to have conversations with.

579
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.690
You don't realize that they're that guy until it starts and then you're stuck.

580
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:31.870
You know,
like,
oh Jesus.
Like what do I say?
Do I disagree with him?
Well,

581
00:31:31.871 --> 00:31:36.610
what do I say?
Come on man.
You know,
own up to yourself.
Stuck in annoyance.
Never.

582
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.590
Yeah,
I do the opposite.
It's always me.
Like some of my dad would go on to school,

583
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:44.500
would yell at us and we ever gotten in trouble at school or there was a problem.

584
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:49.420
It was definitely our fault and the teachers,
right.
100% of the time.

585
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:53.500
And I was at,
and it was always the line.
That's what I was raised with is like,

586
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:58.370
yeah,
it's probably me.
That's better.
Yeah,

587
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.910
that's better when I'm playing.
It's like any Sebastian's,

588
00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:03.970
I just watching Sebastian had a nice like,
um,
you know,

589
00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:07.630
he goes talking about going to pink berry and then he goes in and he goes,

590
00:32:07.631 --> 00:32:08.270
he goes to Sam

591
00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:11.630
<v 6>[inaudible].
He goes,
if I,
if I got the wrong fucking ice cream,</v>

592
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.790
I fucked up.

593
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:17.300
<v 5>Let me,
I'm going to fucking sample of green tea.</v>

594
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.540
He has a great bit and everything.
All of his bits or just like,

595
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:24.650
<v 6>I fucking just get everything on my fucking sandwich.
If I don't like it,</v>

596
00:32:24.651 --> 00:32:25.910
I throw it out the window.

597
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.870
<v 5>What the fuck?
My pickle</v>

598
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.070
take the allotted amount.
You still a fan of easy?
Yeah.

599
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:37.010
Have you had him on the show?
No.
Oh yeah.
He's hilarious.

600
00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.940
It's way in all of you know of this bit's okay.

601
00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:42.070
<v 4>But anyway,
but this is back to that.
It's like,
okay,</v>

602
00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.880
<v 3>you don't blame other people and happy people are so fucking nitpicky and it</v>

603
00:32:45.881 --> 00:32:50.010
gets us back to this whole country thing.
Yeah.
Um,
because people loved,

604
00:32:50.011 --> 00:32:53.740
it was Snape.
And also as for a critic or any reviewer,

605
00:32:53.741 --> 00:32:57.400
it's much easier to be a critic and say something back.

606
00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:59.200
Those things write themselves.

607
00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:02.980
It's also people really enjoy being in a conflict where they don't have any

608
00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:07.450
stake is almost like a grand distraction that we have with a lot of gossip.

609
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.800
People get really deep into other people's lives and other people's fuck ups and

610
00:33:11.801 --> 00:33:14.080
other peoples.
And what it seems to me is like,

611
00:33:14.081 --> 00:33:18.520
I think it's a basic human nature that we have where our real life is.

612
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.570
It's very uncomfortable to focus on,
especially if we're not happy with it.

613
00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:27.610
So we spend a lot of time focusing on other people's lives and a lot of time and

614
00:33:27.611 --> 00:33:31.700
it actually becomes like there's a,
there's a whole industry behind it,
you know,

615
00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:36.040
the TMZ style industry or there's like MMA has like similar sites that do

616
00:33:36.041 --> 00:33:39.910
stories like this and make this a big deal and try to get everybody involved in

617
00:33:39.911 --> 00:33:43.610
it.
It's like they love like controversy.
They love like they love like the,

618
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:49.220
the Shit disturber yeah.
Shit.
Disturber but it is,

619
00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:54.280
but I support them because it is an interesting thing to watch.
It is.

620
00:33:54.281 --> 00:33:57.760
I like watching reality TV.
I like watching the mob wives.

621
00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:00.790
I like watching the real housewives of New Jersey.
I know what they're doing.

622
00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:04.990
I know that they're showing me crazy shit and locking me into this.
Nothing,

623
00:34:04.991 --> 00:34:07.780
but you know,
if I like it,
I like it.

624
00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.490
She works for Geo City sports or what?
Yahoo Sports.
Right.

625
00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:13.600
I don't care.

626
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.690
I don't care where she works is that she works for one of those places.

627
00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:21.170
It's not even about her being silly.

628
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.510
He's being silly.
It's,
um,
the,
the whole thing behind it all is,

629
00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:30.670
you know,
people,
not people not like recognizing someone's intent.

630
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:32.470
You know,
people making this,

631
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:37.030
this hot button word such a big issue and people getting so politically correct,

632
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:41.440
you know,
it's God,
it's so weird.
Everybody wants everybody,
you know,

633
00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.860
in trouble for saying the wrong thing,
which is like a,

634
00:34:44.861 --> 00:34:49.030
can we just be nice to each other and just don't be cunty can we just do that

635
00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:52.000
instead of worrying about the word Conti and someone's saying it,

636
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.490
sending everybody with any words instead of that.

637
00:34:54.491 --> 00:34:57.010
How much is stop being Kentucky?
Can we just,

638
00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.370
then there'll be no need for the word [inaudible] if nobody was being conti.

639
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.630
No men,
no women.
Just get it together.
We're

640
00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.950
<v 4>getting there though.
Don't you think?
I mean like I just heard a tap a tio.</v>

641
00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:09.880
I think it was commercial or something like that on,
on,
on the way here.

642
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.980
And it was just like an old conti.
There's this old lady Capulet to his old lady.

643
00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.750
Like I put that shit on everything,
but they'd beeped out shit.

644
00:35:16.751 --> 00:35:19.560
But it was like I put that shit on everything,
but it was like,
oh,

645
00:35:19.561 --> 00:35:23.110
that's so close.
Yeah,
I know,
right.
It's so close.

646
00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.040
I always wanted to have that as a website are rated commercials where you could

647
00:35:27.041 --> 00:35:31.850
go to my website and I would do like fucking lever 2000 like you should probably

648
00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.280
like shit,
hey this,
you know,
and just really nice and candid,

649
00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:38.010
candid commercials where it was just

650
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.670
<v 3>swearing.</v>

651
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:43.670
I think eventually the world will be accessing the Internet on television's on

652
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:48.240
radio's,
on car radios.
So you will be able to have those commercials.
I mean,
look,

653
00:35:48.241 --> 00:35:51.510
we do a commercial for the fleshlight at the beginning and the end of every show

654
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:55.470
and it's,
it's,
I mean that is a,
it's,
it's a commercial,
you know,

655
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.430
I mean we can say whatever we want.
Go Fuck it,
shoot loads in it.
It's awesome.

656
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:03.090
I mean that is the r r rated commercial and it's on the Internet and because

657
00:36:03.091 --> 00:36:05.790
it's on the internet,
nobody can tell me,
you know,

658
00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:07.370
you can't tell me it's offensive.
Will you?

659
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:09.240
Eventually everything will be the internet.

660
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:12.510
It's these little regulatory bodies that are hanging in there now.

661
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.000
They're not going to be able to hold this fucking thing together.

662
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.430
Stick your fingers in the dam.
That is the Internet.
Good luck.
Fuck.
Oh,

663
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.100
you got no goddamn chance.

664
00:36:20.101 --> 00:36:23.010
They can't even keep this fucking Sony playstation shit in line.

665
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.640
These mother fuckers,
there's a little geniuses out there and they can,

666
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.940
they can find their way through anything connected online,

667
00:36:29.941 --> 00:36:31.380
anything that's got a network,

668
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:36.530
they can find a hole and creep in and send a picture of some guy pulling apart

669
00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:41.270
his ass hole and make that your desktop.
Okay.
If you don't have to,
can you?

670
00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:45.360
You're silly.
You're a silly person.
There's some crazy motherfuckers out.

671
00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.360
<v 4>No,
no.
Right.
I mean,
so I remember early days of the computer,</v>

672
00:36:48.361 --> 00:36:51.500
somebody sent me an email and I accidentally opened it up.
You know,

673
00:36:51.501 --> 00:36:56.410
I had an earthlink account,
those and uh,
uh,

674
00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:01.460
hairy vagina just plaguing my computer at work.
The hairiest vagina.

675
00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:05.170
That was a thing.
That was a thing.
It was a virus,
a virus.

676
00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:06.230
It was a well known virus.

677
00:37:06.231 --> 00:37:10.940
The hairy vagina for up virus came out and just hit space.
More hairy vagina.

678
00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.530
Thought you got rid of it,

679
00:37:12.531 --> 00:37:16.480
he'd let you get rid of it and then you restart your computer.
Hairy Vagina Gig.

680
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:20.270
So you would like would a few like re installed windows.

681
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:23.470
That's what he had to do.
You had to just take everything and shot.
Wow.

682
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:27.490
Do you remember that program that I think I sent it to you.
Joe Wants Mike.

683
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.700
My favorite program I used,

684
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:31.600
I used to have this on my website was like this program you would like Cindy,

685
00:37:31.601 --> 00:37:32.930
your friend.
Like hey,
check this out.

686
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:35.630
And he opened it up and it doesn't do anything and they're like,

687
00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:36.830
what the fuck was that about her?

688
00:37:36.831 --> 00:37:39.230
So like a pitcher and then every time you type though,

689
00:37:39.231 --> 00:37:42.980
cause I like to suck big Dick.
I liked the SEC.
You couldn't stop it.

690
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.770
The only way to stop it was like the hit the escape button.

691
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.720
But what I did is I put that on my website.

692
00:37:47.721 --> 00:37:50.150
Once I got all these people pissed off at me,

693
00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:53.400
emailing me like I like to suck big cock,
I like to suck because it's,

694
00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:56.220
I'm like shit,
I need to tell them how that term.

695
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.500
So you put this virus on the answer?
No,
it was,

696
00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.360
it was something that people like passed around before.
It was like,

697
00:38:02.361 --> 00:38:07.250
people didn't think of it as a virus,
but I forgot.
So I,

698
00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:10.460
then I got,
I got worried and then I put it on my website.
They,
oh you know,

699
00:38:10.461 --> 00:38:11.600
hit escape.
They do it.

700
00:38:11.601 --> 00:38:14.590
But for a while I got all of these messages all saying the same thing.
Yeah.

701
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.890
You should have worn people

702
00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.240
can use on other people.
You just chose to use it on all your

703
00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:22.791
<v 3>band.</v>

704
00:38:22.791 --> 00:38:26.120
A lot of people from the message board for putting up those links where when you

705
00:38:26.121 --> 00:38:27.430
click on one,
it opens up.

706
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.800
<v 4>Remember those more?
I don't think those work anymore.</v>

707
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:36.010
The blocked up different kind of browser or the pop

708
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:39.310
<v 0>up window sill.
It's like we're just barely hanging on.</v>

709
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:44.760
It's all coming together into one big soup man.
I don't,
I just hide.

710
00:38:44.761 --> 00:38:47.050
Your kids don't trust that that slap on her.

711
00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.880
Don't trust trusting the cloud sits the way to go.
Well,
um,
you know,

712
00:38:51.881 --> 00:38:56.410
it seems a little tricky.
I use it for writing so that a,
you know,

713
00:38:56.411 --> 00:38:59.230
like sometimes I'll update something on my laptop so I save it,

714
00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:02.020
but I also want to make sure that I save it on the cloud.

715
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.130
I don't want to lose my,
uh,
the chapter,
so then want to go back to it at home.

716
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.700
I do it that way,
so I'm not using the cloud at all.
I do use the mobile me,

717
00:39:09.701 --> 00:39:14.110
which I like and that's what I'm talking about.
Yeah,
I guess that's dead.

718
00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:16.660
Did you hear about that?
It's done.
Yeah.
There they killed it.

719
00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:17.980
That's killed mower me.
Yeah.

720
00:39:17.981 --> 00:39:22.360
The cloud is the new version of be and now it's free.

721
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.440
Uh,
and so mobile me for current subscribers,

722
00:39:26.441 --> 00:39:31.440
it's going to last till 2012 but it's just been a turn into the cloud to

723
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.690
skynet's going like,
fuck yeah dude.

724
00:39:34.691 --> 00:39:37.800
Did you hear the creative dude dude bro,

725
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:40.540
it's just a preemptive strike against people in the message board.

726
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:45.190
So you do know the toy moon?
Um,
they are,
they've created an artificial brain,

727
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:48.920
real artificial brain that exhibits 12 seconds of short term memory.

728
00:39:48.921 --> 00:39:52.810
Isn't that awesome?
It's fucking nuts,
man.
I think that 12 seconds.
It's just like,

729
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:57.490
you know,
old school battery life.
So it's kind of bio diesel car,
right?
Yeah.

730
00:39:57.491 --> 00:39:59.560
Al Pulls up in this fucking ancient car.

731
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.930
Like he's in a Goddamn Charles Bronson movie from the 70s,
right.

732
00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:05.341
<v 2>Car.</v>

733
00:40:05.341 --> 00:40:10.100
Then I have this hobby car and I'm trying to fix it up and I bought it from some

734
00:40:10.101 --> 00:40:14.810
Old Lady in Florida and I actually bought it on Ebay and had it sent out.
Wow.

735
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:19.370
And it's great.
I love it.
And it's an old,
it's an old Mercedes station wagon.

736
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:23.150
Yeah.
1985 the last year.
So they do a one,
two,
three series.

737
00:40:23.151 --> 00:40:26.750
And then if you research a cars are most reliable cars ever made?

738
00:40:26.751 --> 00:40:31.550
I think it was a Volvo to 40,
and this car are really just incredibly reliable.

739
00:40:31.551 --> 00:40:34.850
Anyone he knows that he's like diesel engine.
I think.
Um,
you know,

740
00:40:34.851 --> 00:40:38.750
dodge has his great diesel engine that they use in a Mercedes had these one,
two,

741
00:40:38.751 --> 00:40:41.900
three series and you can go and get them bio diesel converted.

742
00:40:41.901 --> 00:40:45.110
So when all the shit hits the fan and people are fighting at the gas stations,

743
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:45.650
I'll be,

744
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:50.650
remember this lockbox co op that can make their own shit and I can go in and

745
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:55.990
preparing for the apocalypse and the family then puts our handguns shotguns in

746
00:40:56.061 --> 00:40:59.960
our car and all of our water and we drive away and go kill each other.
Sure.

747
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.910
<v 0>There's this guy in la that I don't know.</v>

748
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:06.450
What's that shit that if they can take that bulk chemical from water,
uh,

749
00:41:06.451 --> 00:41:10.350
in a fluoride from no,
no,
no.
For cars it's a,
Oh,

750
00:41:10.351 --> 00:41:13.800
there's some hot hydrogen.
There's hydrogen fuel Mercedes.

751
00:41:13.801 --> 00:41:17.790
Who's doing those and then Mercedes and a Toyota Toyota's doing,
I'm also like,

752
00:41:17.791 --> 00:41:20.280
they're all coming out in like 2012 or something like that.

753
00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:24.900
But there's this guy in la that we'll put a kit in your car now that like if you

754
00:41:24.901 --> 00:41:29.760
get like 30 gowns,
whatever,
or 30 miles a gallon it,

755
00:41:29.761 --> 00:41:33.710
we'll take it up to like 45 why aren't we on that?
Really?
It's so,

756
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:37.520
it just supplements it with hydrogen.
It makes it a hydrogen hybrid.
I I,
yeah,

757
00:41:37.521 --> 00:41:38.600
I think it makes it a hybrid.

758
00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:42.140
The height of them mother fuckers going to blow sky high one day you're going to

759
00:41:42.141 --> 00:41:42.710
be speeding.

760
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:46.000
Hold on the four oh five and that shit's going to blow up behind you.

761
00:41:46.001 --> 00:41:50.570
You see your car flying over other cars before you realize what happened.

762
00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:53.680
Thinking about trading my new car or my aunt.
Not new,
but yeah.

763
00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:56.840
Caryn just cause I get 15 miles a gallon.
Yeah,

764
00:41:56.841 --> 00:42:00.140
you got a big SUV but it's nice we get in an accident.
Suv.

765
00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:04.820
It's medium outlines of it causes an accent though.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I Dunno man.

766
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:07.700
That's why this thing is said outside is the tank.
It's made with,
you know,

767
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:08.690
all steel.

768
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.440
Just explain to me where you're going to get your bio diesel for folks that

769
00:42:11.441 --> 00:42:13.850
don't know you can make bio diesel with what kind of food?

770
00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.830
Well you go onto the crops,
right?

771
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:19.900
<v 2>No,
it's just all day.
Um,
Greece,
it's all it can be.</v>

772
00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:21.100
<v 0>He can do it with cooking.</v>

773
00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.140
[inaudible] our buddy Tony from Columbus had a car that he had running,

774
00:42:26.141 --> 00:42:27.920
I think it was an old Mercedes as well.
There's different

775
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.920
<v 2>percentages of it.</v>

776
00:42:28.921 --> 00:42:33.921
And so you go by [inaudible] 99 99% 20% and then you can look on and there's all

777
00:42:34.441 --> 00:42:36.100
these groups we're can,

778
00:42:36.101 --> 00:42:41.101
you could search for biodiesel and a map comes up and there's one over in Sun

779
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:43.650
Valley I think called a,
I'd create that.

780
00:42:43.651 --> 00:42:47.280
And then there's one in echo park that just reopened their membership.

781
00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.280
<v 0>Wow.
So you pay for,
I'm paying.
I can be.
So how are they not do it?</v>

782
00:42:50.281 --> 00:42:51.990
I'm not running.
What are they doing?

783
00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.720
<v 2>Manufacturing process with a,
I know that they use,</v>

784
00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:01.640
they can use vegetable oil and convert it to diesel and in Burns,

785
00:43:01.641 --> 00:43:05.300
this sort of clean diesel.
So not only is for the atmosphere,
it's better.

786
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:07.310
It burns clean.
Yeah.
It burns clean.

787
00:43:07.311 --> 00:43:11.780
That's all the TDIS cars that are coming out with Volkswagen and burn.

788
00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:16.100
Mercedes and Volkswagen are burning clean diesel.

789
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.340
And so

790
00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.760
<v 0>what does that mean?
Vapor?
Yeah.</v>

791
00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:21.250
<v 2>Yeah,
I believe that.
Yeah.</v>

792
00:43:21.251 --> 00:43:23.860
Cause when my car and I kicked back and I'm running regular diesel,

793
00:43:23.861 --> 00:43:26.440
I mean a smoke cloud shoots out behind me.

794
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:28.750
I'm not sure if you've ever been stuck behind a diesel car,

795
00:43:28.751 --> 00:43:31.900
but any like Boston's running diesel that's received black smoke going in the

796
00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:36.970
atmosphere with clean diesel,
a doesn't admit that at all.
There's no,
you know,

797
00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.640
it's not as toxic.
I'm not sure how they're making him.

798
00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.410
And I'm probably a little bit over my head.

799
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.040
<v 0>So is this,
um,</v>

800
00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.180
is this an engine issue or a just wait,

801
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.150
we'll in the same engine.
Yeah,
same,
same

802
00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:53.710
<v 2>diesel fuel is,
they're putting it through these newer engines.</v>

803
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.720
Newer diesel engines are admitting sort of,

804
00:43:56.410 --> 00:44:00.340
<v 0>it's an engine thing.
It's not like your car though.
The 85,
you know,</v>

805
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.150
and this is the old style and the new ones are burning clean.

806
00:44:03.151 --> 00:44:06.060
That's 2011 is all CDI was clean diesel.

807
00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:09.510
So they figured out how to do it just by justice adjusting something in the,

808
00:44:09.511 --> 00:44:12.880
in the engine.
Yeah.
I'm sure that they can back it up with gasoline.
That's,

809
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:16.250
that's crazy.
Well,
there's natural gas cars that are now coming out and yeah,
you

810
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:17.940
<v 2>mentioned the hydrogen.
I mean,
I,</v>

811
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:20.570
anybody buying a car that wants to buy a new car,

812
00:44:20.571 --> 00:44:24.770
I think now because you have a lot of the cars to the United States and um,

813
00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:29.480
you know,
get your V12 on now,
that's a high look at it.

814
00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:32.100
And it's like people don't want to get a car,
a lot of gas by

815
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.880
<v 5>a challenger now because when it's semi affordable,</v>

816
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:38.160
because you're not going to be able to do that five years from now,

817
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:40.020
they're not going to going to be an extinct thing.

818
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:43.910
And gas costs are just going to be ridiculous.
So you,
you,

819
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:48.730
<v 3>are you a proponent of peak oil?
Do you believe that without even know,</v>

820
00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:51.040
you don't know what peak oil is?

821
00:44:51.041 --> 00:44:55.480
The theory that there is a certain amount of oil of finite amount and that once

822
00:44:55.481 --> 00:44:57.820
you hit it,
you hit like the,
uh,

823
00:44:57.821 --> 00:45:01.900
the peak of the production process until the well starts giving out as the well

824
00:45:01.901 --> 00:45:02.734
starts giving out

825
00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:05.170
<v 5>diminishing returns.
That's bullshit.</v>

826
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:09.940
I think it's unlimited supply of oil.
I mean you think there is,

827
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:14.770
I don't think there is no.
Oh,
but by saying that's bullshit.
What are you saying?

828
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.340
I don't believe that there's a peak or,
I don't believe that.
I,

829
00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:21.250
I don't believe that that documentary,
it's been so long since I've seen you.

830
00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:22.270
I know what you're talking about,
right?
Yeah.

831
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:24.320
<v 3>You're talking about collapse.
Yeah.
Collapse.
Yeah.</v>

832
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:28.350
Well collapse is a very extreme take on things.
I don't know what that is.
His,

833
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:30.810
it's his take.
Cause this Guy Michael Rupert,

834
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.740
who is a guy who was a cop and he,
uh,

835
00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:39.660
allegedly caught some CIA agents dealing drugs in the ghetto,

836
00:45:39.661 --> 00:45:44.490
arrested them,
tried to,
tried to prosecute them too.
He was told to drop the case.

837
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.060
And so he was appalled by,
and he went public with it and he went to,

838
00:45:48.061 --> 00:45:50.610
there was some,
some big meeting and he gets in the,

839
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:52.280
he's in the back of the room and he,
uh,

840
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:57.660
testifies and says that he was a cop and a,

841
00:45:57.661 --> 00:45:59.590
that he was a cop in Los Angeles.
And then he,

842
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.100
he personally witnessed the CIA selling drugs.

843
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:05.440
And then it's been something they've done forever and everybody goes to get

844
00:46:05.441 --> 00:46:09.510
screams and goes crazy.
And this,
so this guy has been like,
from that moment on,

845
00:46:09.511 --> 00:46:13.290
he's been like the sort of like a beacon of truth to a lot of people.

846
00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:18.120
And he wrote a book about peak oil a few years ago that I started to read.

847
00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.950
I started to read,
but I couldn't get into it.
It was like,

848
00:46:19.951 --> 00:46:21.630
so God damn doom and gloom.

849
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:26.190
And then I watched his documentary and that's collapsed and it's the same thing.

850
00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.610
So there's a lot of doom and gloom and Brian had a real good point.

851
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.760
It's like he's not being honest about what's happening.

852
00:46:32.761 --> 00:46:37.740
He's like only talking about things that fit into his little version of the

853
00:46:37.741 --> 00:46:38.820
world falling apart.

854
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:42.570
Like especially what you were talking about him lying about cell phones.

855
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.150
That's there's more cell phone towers and they're better than ever and the

856
00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:48.150
constantly upgrading and upgrading everyone to four g as well.

857
00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:51.080
<v 5>Yeah,
I,
yeah.
I don't even remember.
That was so long ago.</v>

858
00:46:51.081 --> 00:46:54.230
That was the one red flag for you.
Yeah.
Were like,
this is stupid.
He's,

859
00:46:54.231 --> 00:46:55.840
this guy is saying that they're there,

860
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:57.870
that cell phones are shutting off and everything.

861
00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:01.190
The people or the companies are going under this isn't,
that's totally bullshit.

862
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:02.130
It's not true at all.
Yeah.

863
00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.120
There's a crazy amount of towers and you know the comedy store just got a tower

864
00:47:05.121 --> 00:47:08.110
the other day.
Finally.
How many stores have cell phone?
What?
No,

865
00:47:08.111 --> 00:47:10.040
I mean you don't have the,
I don't know if you've been to the comedy store.

866
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.520
He was always the worst.
Yeah.
Dead Zone.
Now I have five bars the whole time,

867
00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:18.170
so soul sucking apocalypse.
That's why that plays all the fucking bad.

868
00:47:18.171 --> 00:47:22.510
Who Do in the air and that joint just sucking those cell phone signals away and

869
00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.150
you've got to think about it.

870
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:25.910
The amount of data that's now like especially with these four g towers,

871
00:47:25.911 --> 00:47:29.560
how much data's now it's at cloud now we're on the cloud too and this how much

872
00:47:29.561 --> 00:47:32.260
data is actually ain't shit though.
There's this four g shit.

873
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:35.710
The stuff that's going to kill the bees off finally for good.
No,

874
00:47:35.711 --> 00:47:39.040
it's just caused autism.
That's all it does.
Is this killing bees.

875
00:47:39.041 --> 00:47:41.630
Do you believe that?
Have you looked into the,
I know dead.

876
00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:44.140
We have a lot of bees in our backyard and my son,

877
00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:47.730
she came in the other day and goes dad a quarter.
If they're not,
I'm saying,

878
00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.530
all right,
let's be careful with it.
It's like five and a half.

879
00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:56.740
I am more bringing to the conservatory I think twice before smacking one.

880
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:59.950
Do you believe that?
Do you think that a cell phone signals are killing bees?

881
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.900
I don't know what's killing bees for someone's killing bees?

882
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.810
There's a couple articles right away when I look out,

883
00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.510
when I looked up cell phone signals killing bees,

884
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:12.220
the first two things are saying cell phone signal's not killing me.
I mean,

885
00:48:12.221 --> 00:48:15.310
it's all that shit's just headlines.
It's scare tactics.

886
00:48:15.311 --> 00:48:19.390
It's one person with a theory and then people jumping on that theory and sure.

887
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:24.250
But is there a good possibility that in 20 years there'll be no bs or oil left?

888
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.650
Maybe.
I mean,
yeah,

889
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:29.890
there's a good chance 20 years from now possibly,

890
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:33.180
and then the cloud will take over.
And you know why?
Why wouldn't it?

891
00:48:33.181 --> 00:48:38.080
Cell phones killed nats first.
Okay,
this is saying
kill bees,

892
00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:41.890
but they fuck up their life.
Why wouldn't it fuck up fleas then?

893
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.190
Why wouldn't I fuck up?
Fuck come.
Maybe a dance.
Maybe it does.
We just don't know.

894
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:48.860
<v 3>The bees are super complicated.
I mean,
I talked to you guys about this.</v>

895
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:50.720
I said this story on the podcast once of a,

896
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:54.790
a thing that we did on fear factor where we covered people in bees covered them

897
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.190
head to toe with bees.
And then,
um,
we,

898
00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:02.480
we had this like guy who had this huge hive with him and he carries these things

899
00:49:02.481 --> 00:49:04.370
around with them.
He's a professional beekeeper.

900
00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:09.700
And his bees all were met in the middle of the sky by another local group of

901
00:49:10.551 --> 00:49:12.050
bees.
And they had it.
Yeah.

902
00:49:12.051 --> 00:49:15.530
And they had to talk it out through the air and everybody had a back off.

903
00:49:15.531 --> 00:49:16.700
We had to stop the stunt.

904
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:20.840
They remove the bees off this person's body and it's cloud of bees.

905
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:25.740
And it was fucking surreal man.
And what was surreal about it was first of all,

906
00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:30.040
high as fuck.
Highest Fuck.
So hot back then.
Whew.

907
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:31.370
That one,
that one,

908
00:49:31.371 --> 00:49:34.820
because it was like quite a while before the stone was about to start,

909
00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.930
was a lot of time this,
uh,

910
00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.300
this cloud of bees was like an alien horde.

911
00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.620
It's like these two groups of aliens and we're just,
you'll,

912
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.170
the reason we're not completely freaked out by them is that they're only that

913
00:49:48.171 --> 00:49:52.130
big.
But bees are fucking fascinating man.

914
00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:54.710
And if bees were enormous,
you know,

915
00:49:54.711 --> 00:49:59.240
they would be like the worst monster movie ever would be giant beat.
Sure.

916
00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:02.270
<v 5>No,
they're scary looking at,
we have a wasp again of the kids,</v>

917
00:50:02.271 --> 00:50:05.090
we have all these magnifying glasses in the backyard.

918
00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:10.290
Where am I insect think you catch an insect and then you immediately screw down

919
00:50:10.291 --> 00:50:12.230
to kids.
Look at it under a microscope.

920
00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:17.500
I hadn't finding these grubs and beetles in our backyard and if there is alien

921
00:50:17.751 --> 00:50:19.490
life on earth it,

922
00:50:19.491 --> 00:50:24.491
they just decided to be small and genius and they're down there and we don't

923
00:50:24.681 --> 00:50:28.220
know how they're fucking communicating because this was so

924
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:32.360
<v 2>weird.
I've never seen it.
Have you seen a grub up close?</v>

925
00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.673
It's disgusting.

926
00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:38.250
<v 0>Who was a big praying mantis the other day in the bushes and I was hanging out</v>

927
00:50:38.251 --> 00:50:40.230
with this thing,
try to check it out because I just,
you know,

928
00:50:40.231 --> 00:50:42.670
wanting to like look at him,
move around and everything.

929
00:50:42.671 --> 00:50:46.920
And when I was looking at him like this is such a strange little fuck an animal.

930
00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:51.690
Like it's life.
Just like,
you know,
it's,
we're alive and it's alive,
but God damn,

931
00:50:51.691 --> 00:50:53.950
could it be more removed from the person,

932
00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:59.040
this green armor on its body and this is,
it's fucking hands as Jack and things.

933
00:50:59.100 --> 00:50:59.840
Yeah.

934
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:04.630
<v 2>Even stranger to meet the horse.
Oh yeah.
Just solas are.
Yeah.</v>

935
00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:08.270
Very strange.
How bizarre they,
I've never been a horse guy.
I've never,

936
00:51:08.271 --> 00:51:09.920
I grew up in the city my entire life,

937
00:51:09.921 --> 00:51:13.190
so I've never been around a bunch of lung and horses,
so I don't even know that.

938
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:17.870
But whenever I walk up to I'm like,
how is this?
This is okay.
Like look at it.

939
00:51:17.871 --> 00:51:19.130
This is unbelievable.

940
00:51:19.131 --> 00:51:22.460
Like the teeth on them and just like give them one an apple,
you know,

941
00:51:22.461 --> 00:51:24.950
like somebody who's been around them their entire life to probably laughing at

942
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:29.060
this because you know they have a pet horses,
a pet.
But I don't even,

943
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.460
I mean you have a lot of neighbors.
Of course.

944
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:34.280
<v 0>Yeah.
I've never sold horses.
Neighbors.
One lady on a street loves horses.</v>

945
00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:36.560
You didn't a baby horse?
No,
my neighbors,

946
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.980
I live in a question district and my neighbor's got this little baby horses and

947
00:51:39.981 --> 00:51:43.790
they walking around like dogs,
you know,
so the horse things a weird thing.

948
00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:46.640
But people get this very strange connection with their horse.

949
00:51:46.641 --> 00:51:49.550
I mean they ride that thing a respond,
but it's a different sort of,

950
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:51.950
horses are not that smart.
They're not,
no,
not really.

951
00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:55.640
Horses that were like the cell phones of the 18 hundreds it's like when you're,

952
00:51:55.641 --> 00:51:58.490
when you're riding them there,
it's,
you know,

953
00:51:58.491 --> 00:52:01.790
it's like you're connected to this animals,
animals taking you around.

954
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.900
It's very intimate and for women I think,
oh,
it always feels like it's sexual.

955
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.990
It is.
Yeah.
I just have a girl.

956
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:11.810
I always ask that question to girls and they all say it feels good.
Yes.
Yeah.

957
00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:15.230
It feels good to ride that thing on your pussy and line it up,
right?
Yeah.

958
00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.040
There's this lady who lives up the street.

959
00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:20.180
She looks like she just gets off on that horse every day,

960
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:23.420
their boots and then they give up on the,
the one of the surest signs.

961
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.540
A lot of those horse ladies give up on looking good for men.

962
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:31.010
They just give the fuck up flannel shirts and boots.
I don't give a fuck.

963
00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:31.881
I don't give a fuck.

964
00:52:31.881 --> 00:52:34.940
If you want to do is I'm going to just go ride my horse and get an orgasm.

965
00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:38.550
If that's where they do.
Come on fellows,
let's go down a cobblestone Rolo.

966
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:42.380
They always have really rough skin.
Those horse girls,

967
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:46.370
I don't have a lot of sun damage,
a lot of sun,

968
00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:47.480
lots of sun damage,

969
00:52:47.481 --> 00:52:50.870
and they have strong hands from holding onto that fucking bridal while they come

970
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:55.910
and they're all a little country,
a little country.

971
00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.870
If there's anything that came out of this,
I talked about this on Twitter.

972
00:52:59.871 --> 00:53:00.704
That's good.
Is it?

973
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:04.190
I think more people are going to use the word cunty countries and it's a fun

974
00:53:04.191 --> 00:53:08.810
word.
It's not that bad.
And you can be Conti.
You'd be counting and recover.
Okay.

975
00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.520
And if I was at Denny's,
that's how it looks.

976
00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.060
<v 2>See you had a problem with a waitress and she comes over and she said,</v>

977
00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:16.260
can I speak to the manager please?
And that's what you choose to save.
Say,
sir,

978
00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.020
I'm thanks for coming over.

979
00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:20.510
I just wanted you to know that I feel like your waitress,

980
00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:22.790
when she took our order,
she's a little bit continue

981
00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.710
<v 0>and he'd say,
I'm sorry about that.
We known she was of,</v>

982
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.760
and this is your last warning for continuous

983
00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:35.800
country is trending right now on Twitter.
That's awesome.

984
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.170
And use it as a Hashtag.

985
00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:38.010
<v 4>Uh,</v>

986
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:41.790
I went to a hash bar in La the other day was the closest thing to feeling like

987
00:53:41.791 --> 00:53:44.970
you're an Amsterdam.
Like you actually that exists.
Yeah.

988
00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:49.290
The front part was where you bought the weed and then the back was a bar with a

989
00:53:49.291 --> 00:53:52.260
stage and they have to copy the name of this before you go any further.

990
00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:55.360
Let's not say the name,
but the thing I,

991
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:59.340
I did comedy there that night and it was packed and I thought that would be like

992
00:53:59.341 --> 00:54:03.840
the most ideal situation.
No,
no,
that's,
that's an awful idea.

993
00:54:03.841 --> 00:54:05.880
After two hours of smoking Hash,

994
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:10.440
they're audience is pretty much fucking gone.
Like I was like,

995
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.740
it was so weird,
dude.
It was like,
even the people I came with,

996
00:54:13.741 --> 00:54:15.390
they were just fucking gone.
And I'm like,

997
00:54:15.391 --> 00:54:19.020
you don't even know what anyone's talking about right now would be a situation

998
00:54:19.021 --> 00:54:20.640
where I would yell out again,

999
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:25.240
<v 0>hi.
Yeah,
I did pipe wait from the mouth,
come on,
pay attention.</v>

1000
00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:30.400
<v 4>Did my rape joke and immediately everyone who was raped in the audience thought</v>

1001
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:35.390
and I brought them back to their bad place.
Rape joke isn't the best example.

1002
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:39.650
Is that something that you have to think about?
Yeah,
I didn't think about that.

1003
00:54:39.651 --> 00:54:42.890
Like the hash jokes are more poop and fart jokes.

1004
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:47.090
I in the future for me a favor and do that.
If they were a you a,
you know,

1005
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:47.950
you wouldn't get it

1006
00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:48.820
<v 0>really high.</v>

1007
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:52.480
Especially if you get really high on edibles or hash or anything super strong,

1008
00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.140
you really start to think about things that you're doing that are negative.

1009
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:58.930
You start to think about things that you're doing that affect people in a

1010
00:54:58.931 --> 00:55:00.700
negative way and that you don't have to do them,

1011
00:55:00.701 --> 00:55:03.130
but sometimes you just get addicted to do them.

1012
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:07.740
It's easy to do them to get used to doing it.
You get conti.
Yeah.

1013
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:09.083
So what it is,

1014
00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.890
I can't believe that's a problem with the why.

1015
00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.680
It seems like you do to,
there's people calling for me to get suspended.

1016
00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:19.460
All sorts of stuff.

1017
00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:21.200
<v 2>I mean,
when you look in the scope of the Internet and it's,</v>

1018
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:26.000
somebody else told me something great is about his,
I stopped.
I will not,

1019
00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.950
uh,
Google myself.
Like just because it's wasting my time and I'm still,
I'm not,

1020
00:55:30.951 --> 00:55:32.210
I don't look at anything.

1021
00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:36.310
And there was a while when I did and it just makes you feel bad.
But see,
cat,

1022
00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:37.910
there's always people saying negative shit.

1023
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:42.700
So these people that have calling for you to be fired or suspended or did you

1024
00:55:42.701 --> 00:55:45.680
always going to be a handful of people that dwell on the negative like this

1025
00:55:45.681 --> 00:55:46.880
woman did in the first place?

1026
00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:49.730
We'll look up your most favorite thing on the Internet.

1027
00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:52.550
I mean like Eddie Murphy delirious,
you know,

1028
00:55:52.551 --> 00:55:54.800
ice cream man or something that you know is good.

1029
00:55:55.490 --> 00:56:00.410
There is 232 people dislike it.
You know,
there's always going to be,

1030
00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:05.560
so look up your most favorite thing and then the on youtube and look how many

1031
00:56:06.651 --> 00:56:07.484
people dislike.

1032
00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.280
<v 0>There's man,
everyone's knocking.
I like the same thing.</v>

1033
00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:14.810
We have to accept that it's not a matter of not liking something.

1034
00:56:14.811 --> 00:56:17.270
It's a matter of continuous.
Yeah.

1035
00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:19.720
There's a lot of things that I don't like and I'm not mean about them.

1036
00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:22.550
They're just the larger,
it's not my thing man.

1037
00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:27.100
I acknowledge that there's different types of comedians can so that I don't

1038
00:56:27.101 --> 00:56:29.810
necessarily want to be.
So there's all types of comics.
I know that they,

1039
00:56:29.811 --> 00:56:32.410
people appreciate him.
Like we were just talking about the opening of the show.

1040
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:36.670
There's um,
people that are just church comics.
Sure.

1041
00:56:36.671 --> 00:56:40.990
Those guys and that they fulfill a need and there's someone and there's nothing

1042
00:56:40.991 --> 00:56:44.260
wrong with that at all.
Black comics,
Mexican common,
whatever it is.

1043
00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.430
That's fantastic.

1044
00:56:45.431 --> 00:56:48.760
Cause there's people that really like that specific brand and there's so much of

1045
00:56:48.761 --> 00:56:52.420
it that is going to niche out and there's going to be different types.

1046
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.510
But that being said,
you know,

1047
00:56:55.511 --> 00:57:00.511
it's like you can't dwell in the negativity of it all and get caught up in all

1048
00:57:01.721 --> 00:57:05.260
of this.
I mean there's certain people that just love to fucking snap,
snap,
snap,

1049
00:57:05.261 --> 00:57:09.250
snap.
Some people just love to just,
they just do this all day online.

1050
00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:11.960
I mean there's Internet flames for a lot of people.

1051
00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:14.230
It was one of the ways they get out aggression.
You know,

1052
00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:17.200
some people have like really boring ass fucking crappy jobs,

1053
00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:21.280
but they're in front of a computer all day and so they just get online on

1054
00:57:21.281 --> 00:57:26.281
message boards during the day and just get conti just gets cunt cunt tastic left

1055
00:57:26.561 --> 00:57:31.470
and right.
That sounds really nice actually.
That sounds fantastic.

1056
00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.010
Better contact stick.

1057
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.770
We can do better folks.
I know I can do better too.

1058
00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:40.870
I'm saying all of us together,

1059
00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:45.170
<v 4>uh,
our podcasts and mine and yours were both on the BBC the other day.</v>

1060
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:47.060
What was it?
I,

1061
00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:51.320
this guy was talking about how easy nowadays is to take your iPhone and put it

1062
00:57:51.321 --> 00:57:54.110
in your car and having it connected to your stereo.

1063
00:57:54.111 --> 00:57:57.470
And he was talking and he was like showing the stitcher app and he's like,
oh.

1064
00:57:57.471 --> 00:58:01.490
And then there's the stitcher app and he went and he loaded up death squad as

1065
00:58:01.491 --> 00:58:05.240
the,
the sample and it's just so now I'm thinking,
wow,

1066
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:08.200
do they know that's like a Hitler,
that cat on BBC.

1067
00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:11.450
<v 0>Yay.
The Hitler Cat with a suicide bomber.</v>

1068
00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.550
Shit on him is your cat has what?

1069
00:58:14.551 --> 00:58:16.910
When we're going to make a t shirt or that it's make a tee shirt.
That cat.
Yeah,

1070
00:58:16.911 --> 00:58:18.860
I need to,
I've been,
Dunkin has my stylist,

1071
00:58:18.861 --> 00:58:21.500
so I need to just clean it up a little.
Okay.
Yeah,

1072
00:58:21.501 --> 00:58:24.770
let's make a t shirt or that sweet.
I'll wear one of those.
Um,
but yeah,

1073
00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:25.850
so that was on the BBC will.

1074
00:58:25.851 --> 00:58:29.000
That obviously must be somebody who listens to the podcast.
So whoever you are.

1075
00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:32.660
Thank you.
That's awesome.
That's pretty fucking,
that's a pretty sweet,

1076
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:37.970
but you have a podcast now too.
You just got it.
Got It.
The,
that's awesome.

1077
00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.730
So we're just doing all,
it's me,
you brawny and Chris Spencer.

1078
00:58:40.731 --> 00:58:43.040
We just had actually had to put our first episode up today.

1079
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:44.060
We're going to try it.

1080
00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:46.310
We're going to do it on a weekly basis where I've tried to do it on a,

1081
00:58:46.311 --> 00:58:50.690
what's it called?
Minivan men.
We don't,
we don't minivan men.

1082
00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:55.640
Minivan men.
Okay.
Minium minivan,
men.com.
Nobody owns a minivan.

1083
00:58:55.850 --> 00:58:59.990
But anyway,
it's just all dad stuff.
Like I said.
Right.
So it's a jack.
It's all,

1084
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:05.120
you know,
my wife,
you the van so bad.
You want to advance too.

1085
00:59:05.121 --> 00:59:06.170
That's so funny you said that.

1086
00:59:06.171 --> 00:59:09.740
I was just talking to Mrs Rogan about maybe getting a custom van.

1087
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:14.050
He's serious dope.
The family wagon like you know like,

1088
00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:17.600
cause it's tough to get like a lot of seats in a car,
you know,

1089
00:59:17.601 --> 00:59:20.180
unless you go minivan but minivans are whack.

1090
00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:23.960
But if you get a right like a real event and inside of it you make it cool.

1091
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:27.950
Have you seen him lately?
Nowadays?
Yeah,
there was,

1092
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:29.940
it was like,
you know,

1093
00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:33.920
a late night in Vegas watching television when I should be asleep.

1094
00:59:33.921 --> 00:59:35.120
And it was uh,

1095
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:39.550
there was a commercial years ago for some guy did custom vans and inside he

1096
00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:43.010
would show all this like crazy shit that he's got of,
sparked that interest.

1097
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:45.860
But I never looked at it again.
Have you seen a sports mobile that fan?

1098
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:48.200
What's that type in sportsman would be,
we'll take a look at this.

1099
00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:50.840
I just remember as a kid,

1100
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:53.630
like my friend's parents always had like the really nice vans with like,

1101
00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:58.040
you know,
like just high deluxe chairs and Oh my God,
this is amazing.

1102
00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.310
That bad ass.
Look at this.
Oh my God,

1103
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.210
it's fucking huge.
I think this might have been one that was checking that.

1104
01:00:05.211 --> 01:00:08.840
Like what?
I see,
you can trick those out any way you want.
That's incredible.

1105
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:13.140
And people just love it.
These are huge.
That's more end of the world shit too.

1106
01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:17.290
That's some apocalyptic shit.
It's a three d job so you can trick them out.

1107
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:22.450
You could trick that on any one you want out of this thing man.
Yeah.

1108
01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.870
Yeah.
It's got a fucking kitchen.
See,
I don't need all kitchen.

1109
01:00:26.871 --> 01:00:30.080
I just want a big water bed in the back of Marie.
We're going to look at that.

1110
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:31.710
Yeah.
These are crazy,
Matt,

1111
01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.400
to having a water bed in the back of your van and a TV.

1112
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:38.570
So that's all brand new is trick down like you can.
Wow.
So,

1113
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.900
so getting back to that man,
with all this biodiesel talk,

1114
01:00:41.901 --> 01:00:45.620
are you one of those uh,
end of the world guys?
No,
not really.
I'm just,
I'm,

1115
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:50.760
I'm not,
I just really want to be safe.
Well,
and also,
you know,
it's economics.

1116
01:00:50.761 --> 01:00:55.250
It's like,
I wonder if the gas gets crazy,
which it has like um,

1117
01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.120
you know,

1118
01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.450
it's amazing how they went and had that conversation with all of the oil

1119
01:00:59.451 --> 01:01:02.030
companies and said they're going to stop getting gas subsidies.

1120
01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:05.810
And then the prices went down a lot.
Do you notice that we were up about four,

1121
01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.620
four 50.
Right.

1122
01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:10.280
And then they had to talk with them saying we're gonna get rid of your subsidies

1123
01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:13.460
and then the price went down.
Like just lay office.
We'll keep it around here.

1124
01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:18.520
Do you believe that they manipulate the oil and gas prices in accordance with a

1125
01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:23.510
world events and elections and it's totally fine.
I really think they do.

1126
01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:28.310
And I think it's like it's six people and what they do is they just all sort of

1127
01:01:28.311 --> 01:01:32.900
hover around the same price.
So if somebody starts bringing their prices up,

1128
01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:37.760
everybody will just follow suit but isn't a directly based on just totally just

1129
01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:41.660
playing devil's advocate here.
Isn't it directly based on production though?
No,

1130
01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:45.860
no,
I think it is.
I think basically it's supposed to be.
I think so.

1131
01:01:45.861 --> 01:01:47.810
I think it's like all about resilience.
How is it?

1132
01:01:47.811 --> 01:01:50.440
I think it's based on whatever they think they can get away with.
Yeah,

1133
01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:54.390
I think so too.
I need to read an article on this for talk further.
Well,

1134
01:01:54.391 --> 01:01:57.680
I don't think you'll ever find the exact truth.
That's what the problem is.

1135
01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:02.570
You're right,
you're dead right.
But I remember when Bush was leaving office,

1136
01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.010
remember how high the gas got?

1137
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:07.460
It got fucking bad where I know people who were like,

1138
01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.420
who didn't want to leave the house because they needed to be able to get to work

1139
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:16.020
and home two days in a row before they ran out of gas money.

1140
01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:20.250
There was no traffic for a long time.
Like when gas were really

1141
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:23.890
<v 5>high,
because I got to drive from Eagle Rock,
I had to just drive to Glendale.</v>

1142
01:02:23.891 --> 01:02:28.140
And so I got on this stretch of the one 34 where it was packed all the time.

1143
01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:28.580
Right.

1144
01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:32.130
I have to take it the same time every single morning and I could know in schools

1145
01:02:32.131 --> 01:02:34.290
and in schools down,
I can really regulate that shit.

1146
01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:37.770
And I remember getting on when gas prices were high and I just float.

1147
01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:42.270
I didn't have to get in the Carpool lane or anything because that's how few

1148
01:02:42.271 --> 01:02:43.780
people were driving.
What do you think

1149
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:48.820
<v 3>20% down if you've got a gas 10% down,
you've heard her say a number,
right?</v>

1150
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:52.230
<v 5>Oh No,
I think it was 30 40% down.
Yeah,</v>

1151
01:02:52.231 --> 01:02:55.980
because it would just completely clogged up in the same area at the same time

1152
01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:59.490
every single morning.
And I remember hearing him discuss it at the time as well.

1153
01:02:59.491 --> 01:03:01.800
It's like gas prices really went down.
It's amazing.

1154
01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:05.540
<v 3>Well,
you know my,
my real issue with the end of the world is that,
you know,</v>

1155
01:03:05.541 --> 01:03:08.480
whenever anybody starts talking about what could happen,
what could it,

1156
01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:13.130
what the re the real issue to me is gasoline and especially in Los Angeles

1157
01:03:13.131 --> 01:03:17.210
because we are totally unsustainable.
You know,
this is like,

1158
01:03:17.211 --> 01:03:20.870
did the mass of people all in one area absolutely.

1159
01:03:20.871 --> 01:03:25.310
Completely depend on their ability to move around and bring things in.

1160
01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:28.910
I mean there's 20 million people in La and no one's growing anything other than

1161
01:03:28.911 --> 01:03:29.744
weed

1162
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.270
<v 5>hippy out as well.</v>

1163
01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:35.630
A little bit because bill burr came over the house and he was just cracking up.

1164
01:03:35.631 --> 01:03:37.880
Ally.
It's like you ready for the end of the world here.

1165
01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.070
Grown all kinds of shit.
Everybody's going to be trying.

1166
01:03:43.071 --> 01:03:45.570
If you're going to have fighting people off with a shotgun,
that's good.

1167
01:03:45.571 --> 01:03:46.820
That's good.
That's good.

1168
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.500
Shoot everybody get away from my fucking apricot's asshole.

1169
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:56.150
Your RSS feeds RSS got me on BBC.
So,

1170
01:03:56.170 --> 01:04:00.520
um,
oh.
Anyway,
so I grow,
I have guava,
apricot and my wife just made April.

1171
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:04.430
Look man.
I'm not saying that.
That's not what I'm saying.

1172
01:04:04.431 --> 01:04:08.840
Like I do like that idea as well.
Smarter.
They have a bunch of shit going.
Yeah.

1173
01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:12.530
And I'm gone,
you know,
tomatoes and my wife just for the hell of it.

1174
01:04:12.531 --> 01:04:13.340
We're playing,
you know,

1175
01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.610
little house in the prairie over there and Eagle Rock and she's canning shit.

1176
01:04:17.170 --> 01:04:17.680
Awesome.

1177
01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.320
<v 3>Yeah.
You know,
you can have chickens and shit to chickens are really easy.</v>

1178
01:04:20.321 --> 01:04:24.330
But yeah,
go go.
If you want to kill a goat,
yeah,
kill a couple of girls.

1179
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:26.530
You also should switch to solar power.

1180
01:04:26.531 --> 01:04:28.750
If any place is a good place for solar power.
It's here.

1181
01:04:28.810 --> 01:04:33.220
I want to switch to that eventually.
It's so they should have that as a law here.

1182
01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.120
Why you should tell him it's difficult.
It's difficult.
We had it in,
in Colorado,

1183
01:04:37.121 --> 01:04:41.020
in this cabin,
this cabin that we had and there's issues with that solar.

1184
01:04:41.021 --> 01:04:43.810
First of all,
those batteries are finite.
They have to be swapped out.

1185
01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.790
I don't think they can last forever.
And you know,

1186
01:04:45.791 --> 01:04:50.560
it's like you gotta have like real cloud free days over and over and over to the

1187
01:04:50.561 --> 01:04:53.130
charge it does in la.
It probably won't be a problem,
sir.

1188
01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:56.510
That you should probably get even go to a battery does even go to pay.

1189
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:59.830
I thought it just went from solar collector to back into the grid.

1190
01:04:59.890 --> 01:05:03.420
Like you're paying that the grid is going to be operable,
right?

1191
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:05.440
We're talking about some end of the world.
Shit.
If you're going to have,

1192
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:10.390
so it could really,
I mean yeah,
you sell,
you can sell back power.

1193
01:05:10.391 --> 01:05:13.630
I know a guy with a windmill cells back power and it lives in Oregon.

1194
01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:17.140
But I mean if the grid goes,
you have to think,

1195
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:20.260
well now you're relying totally on solar power,
right?

1196
01:05:20.261 --> 01:05:22.420
So it has to go to some sort of a battery backup.

1197
01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.750
And that's what happened at this cabin.
The cabin that we had in Colorado,

1198
01:05:25.751 --> 01:05:26.260
there was,

1199
01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:30.220
it was all solar powered and it went to some sort of a battery backup sort of a

1200
01:05:30.221 --> 01:05:33.670
thing.
So it stores the electricity from the sun

1201
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:37.680
<v 4>with the being the only house with solar power.
Let's hate August cause you shit,</v>

1202
01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:42.110
it's fucking zombies going to see the lights.
Fuck.

1203
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:45.870
And they'll know that you're the guy.
There'll be fires everywhere.
Fires.

1204
01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:50.130
<v 3>Nope.
Man.
That whole Zombie thing.
It's very possible.
It's,
it's,</v>

1205
01:05:50.131 --> 01:05:52.070
it's a funny thing that it's such a,
a,

1206
01:05:52.071 --> 01:05:56.050
a theme over and over again and movies walking dead.
That's great.
Sean.

1207
01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.740
I just got into it.
That's the only watched the first episode,

1208
01:05:58.741 --> 01:06:00.470
but it was fucking bad ass.
It's incredible.

1209
01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:03.060
I've been looking for time to catch the second one,
but I've been busy.

1210
01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:04.260
It's good show.
It's great.

1211
01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:07.290
But you know that that's sort of a thing that we get infected by some sort of a

1212
01:06:07.291 --> 01:06:09.600
horrible parasite or some sort of a,
you know,

1213
01:06:09.601 --> 01:06:12.300
like look our rabies sort of a thing.
Rabies for people.

1214
01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.090
That's fucking real possible man.
How is that not possible?

1215
01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:19.720
<v 4>Oh No.
Anything with a epidemic,
I'd totally buy into that as well.
28 days later,</v>

1216
01:06:19.721 --> 01:06:23.360
easily be the first guy.
Did you ever see like 28 days later the house?
Yeah,

1217
01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:27.440
and that same thing where they or any of the resident evil movies.

1218
01:06:27.441 --> 01:06:28.550
I'm a big fan of resident evil.

1219
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.210
I ended the idea for a show that I thought it was funny,
but no one wanted to do.

1220
01:06:32.211 --> 01:06:35.720
I pitched it as a cartoon where was a Prequel to resident evil.

1221
01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:39.410
You know how they're all in the hive.
There are underground and he start there.

1222
01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:40.400
It's like these guys,

1223
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:44.570
I got a great job opportunity so everybody knows what's going to happen and

1224
01:06:44.571 --> 01:06:48.140
these guys are just living their little mundane lives in the hive like that.

1225
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:48.980
There's a gym.

1226
01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:52.810
I think we should do it like talking to his friend even to moving 85 miles under

1227
01:06:52.830 --> 01:06:55.110
ground or whatever it is,
and we know they're all gonna die.

1228
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:58.850
It's just think of it as the Zombie outbreak as being like herpes and just

1229
01:06:58.851 --> 01:07:01.670
imagine that all these people with herpes being zombies.

1230
01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:06.440
<v 3>Yeah,
right.
It's your right.
If zombies was a disease that you can,</v>

1231
01:07:06.441 --> 01:07:09.560
it's just like herpes is a diseases,
right?
Yeah,
exactly.

1232
01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:11.670
You have your main way worse cause zombies eat people.

1233
01:07:11.671 --> 01:07:15.030
So there'd be no one left that 28 days later to me was one of the scariest

1234
01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:20.090
horror movies and most realistic ever when that chick hacked up her friend with

1235
01:07:20.171 --> 01:07:23.400
the machete,
when he got bitten and he tried to say he was okay,
I'm okay,

1236
01:07:23.401 --> 01:07:27.030
I'm okay.
And she hacked him up with a fucking machete.
Do you remember that shit?

1237
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:30.960
Yo,
that was real.
That was real shit.

1238
01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:35.040
That was a scene in a movie where that we're a real rare where there was no

1239
01:07:35.041 --> 01:07:39.360
Hollywood bullshit where someone had to make a split second life or death

1240
01:07:39.361 --> 01:07:43.440
decision.
I mean,
there was no romantic here.
I hate to do is to Bobby,
do it.

1241
01:07:43.441 --> 01:07:44.560
Go ahead and do it.
No,
no,
no.

1242
01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:49.440
It was extreme denial and extreme violence.
The guy's like,
no,

1243
01:07:49.441 --> 01:07:52.890
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
And she fucking hacks into depth with that machete.

1244
01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:57.660
That's a real scary.
Those fucking zombies where they're that scary.

1245
01:07:58.050 --> 01:08:00.960
She knew it was coming.
So she hacks them to death with a fucking machete.

1246
01:08:00.961 --> 01:08:03.360
She'd been hanging around with them power.
That was her boy.

1247
01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.010
It floods zombies together.

1248
01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:08.260
<v 4>Every Zombie movie has that.
You've got to kill somebody.
You care about moment.</v>

1249
01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:11.400
Every single one.
You got it.
That standard.

1250
01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:16.400
And what I'm seeing in terms of zombies,
have you thought about that?
We'll just,

1251
01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:21.380
<v 5>I mean,
any like you have a secure job,
really thought about zombies.</v>

1252
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:22.430
No,
not zombies,

1253
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:26.150
but I'm talking about people getting in the next time someone says they don't

1254
01:08:26.151 --> 01:08:31.060
want to get high,
I'm going to listen to them.
That's true on the worst.
Um,

1255
01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:35.940
so I'm talking about people.
Let's not talk about what I've just had.

1256
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.400
Well,
for me in the tiny,
you know,
I have a little place and Eagle Rock where,

1257
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:43.490
where's Eagle Rock?
That is just so if someone wants to stock to you,

1258
01:08:43.491 --> 01:08:47.770
what's the best way to go about to do is go to?
No,

1259
01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:51.280
I am right before the Rose Bowl.
Right where the Pasadena.
Right,

1260
01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:53.930
right before you get there.
North East La.
All right.
Anyway,

1261
01:08:53.931 --> 01:08:58.840
so I think about fortifying my joint,
like I want it to be tight.

1262
01:08:58.841 --> 01:09:02.750
Like I got you lock on my fence so my dog can't get out and nothing get in.

1263
01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.540
Are you in an area where there's a lot of population?

1264
01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:08.750
I'm not familiar with that area.
I have a lot of population.
Decent amount.

1265
01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:10.120
It is nice.
Yeah.

1266
01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:14.300
Jody's their town or used to I think in Marin lives not too far away.

1267
01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:16.630
You did this podcast and this place.
Okay,

1268
01:09:16.690 --> 01:09:20.690
so he's at Mount Maria Bamford.

1269
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.310
He lives more,

1270
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:26.720
a little bit more south of me over on the hill and it's a little more country up

1271
01:09:26.721 --> 01:09:30.940
there,
but it's a country.
Whereas Mexican country country,
is that what you meant?

1272
01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.770
Mexican country,
what you just said?
Country country.

1273
01:09:33.771 --> 01:09:36.560
It's a little more because he's in the hills and there's a lot of open space.

1274
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:38.960
Not like you have,
but for la,
yeah.

1275
01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:43.070
It's actually empty lots and stuff like that.

1276
01:09:43.071 --> 01:09:45.920
In my neighborhood.
Every single lot has a house on it,

1277
01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:50.440
every single one,
and we're all packed next to each other.
I love the kids.

1278
01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.220
It's an interesting area though.

1279
01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:55.940
It was a lot of cool people that live in that area.
You know,
that whole area.

1280
01:09:55.941 --> 01:09:58.860
It's like there's so many creative types are in that area.

1281
01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:02.720
Maria Bamford is right next to like where my kids go to play.
Um,

1282
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:05.040
so it's a bonus stalking zone.
Yeah.

1283
01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:09.080
You get three copies for this kind of hippie little bit.

1284
01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:13.550
I think it's really important to to live near trees and shit.
You know,

1285
01:10:13.551 --> 01:10:15.620
I think you've got to have at least some of that in your life.

1286
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:20.000
I don't know how people live like in like a full city,
like full Manhattan.

1287
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:23.150
I mean unless you live near the park and you can go to the park all the time.

1288
01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:26.630
For me,
that would kind of freak me out.
I like seeing trees.

1289
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:31.660
I don't like being jammed in on top of people in box on box stacked on top of

1290
01:10:32.481 --> 01:10:34.700
each other.
To me that just freaks me out.
Well there's something,

1291
01:10:34.701 --> 01:10:36.920
but also I agree and I like all that.

1292
01:10:36.921 --> 01:10:40.400
It sounds like I have all the fruit trees and everything and I like being,

1293
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:43.610
you know,
have all the gardening space and I have all the shit I grow.

1294
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:46.970
But I do like the life like,
uh,
the like the,

1295
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.680
of a Bohemian like in a penthouse,
you know,
in a cool,
um,

1296
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:52.740
like,
uh,

1297
01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:57.290
Tribeca hug and run this facility saying so there is the appeal on both sides.

1298
01:10:57.291 --> 01:11:00.260
I think you mix it up so you can go when you can vacation or whatever.

1299
01:11:00.261 --> 01:11:03.800
You can have that city lifestyle.
There is something about the,

1300
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:07.620
the intellectual New York,
the intelligent New York.
Like there's a,

1301
01:11:07.621 --> 01:11:11.090
there's a group of people that live in New York that really wouldn't want to

1302
01:11:11.091 --> 01:11:14.430
live anywhere else in the world.
And you know,
some of our,
a little snooty

1303
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:15.480
<v 3>about it and it's,</v>

1304
01:11:15.481 --> 01:11:19.560
but it's because they're proud of being in an extremely unusual city when

1305
01:11:19.561 --> 01:11:21.840
there's no,
there's no city in America like New York.

1306
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:25.440
There's a few that are close.
But Youngstown,
like if you live in New York,

1307
01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:28.110
the only place you could really live where it would feel like a city.

1308
01:11:28.111 --> 01:11:31.860
You got like a cobbler choices.
You've got Chicago,
maybe part of San Francisco,

1309
01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:34.920
but it's still not really going to be New York.
New York is one

1310
01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:38.750
<v 5>mass of it.
It's so intimidating to people when you go there.</v>

1311
01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:41.330
And I feel like when you attain a certain amount of wealth,

1312
01:11:41.331 --> 01:11:45.500
when you're in a bad ass penthouse with your cocktail and a Tuxedo and your wife

1313
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:49.400
was on your arm,
you feel like,
I run this shit.
You have a rebel.
It took off.
Like,

1314
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:52.070
I don't want to say that it happened to me.
I'm in the 1300 square foot house,

1315
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:57.140
but I'm saying to somebody like Jay z standing with fucking beyond say on his

1316
01:11:57.141 --> 01:11:59.910
arm,
they are looking out into the city and to,

1317
01:11:59.911 --> 01:12:03.410
he's gotta be thinking [inaudible] I can run the world,
you know,

1318
01:12:03.411 --> 01:12:08.411
or some shit like that where he feels so and command because it is such a doggy.

1319
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:09.390
Yeah,

1320
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:11.700
<v 3>Buddy of mine's dad has a really rich and uh,</v>

1321
01:12:11.710 --> 01:12:16.480
we went to his house once and he's got this fucking bad ass apartment in New

1322
01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.950
York City with this sick view.

1323
01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:22.930
It's so ridiculous is this guy's got loads of cash.
I don't know how rich he is,

1324
01:12:22.931 --> 01:12:24.100
but he's,
he's,
he's,

1325
01:12:24.190 --> 01:12:28.750
he's rich and I'm walking through his living room and his living room is just

1326
01:12:28.751 --> 01:12:33.190
like one giant building to the left and one to the right and like,

1327
01:12:33.490 --> 01:12:38.080
he's looking at this spectacular like man created artwork.

1328
01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:41.890
But his view,
it was stunning.
It was like,
you know,

1329
01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:45.100
I appreciate the view of the mountains.
To me that's my favorite view,

1330
01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:46.990
but everybody's got their own favor of you.

1331
01:12:47.290 --> 01:12:52.290
But that view that that New York City in the heart of everything view is pretty

1332
01:12:52.571 --> 01:12:54.450
fucking spectacular.
Yeah.

1333
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:57.190
If you could afford an apartment on one of those buildings,
dude,

1334
01:12:57.191 --> 01:12:59.890
I was blown away just walking around this guy's place,

1335
01:12:59.891 --> 01:13:02.020
but it was like $7 million or something.

1336
01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:04.520
<v 5>I'm just saying be nice to,
you can do both.</v>

1337
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:08.450
You can appreciate both and then go like all those guys probably go to Montana.

1338
01:13:08.690 --> 01:13:10.380
<v 3>I bet it's cheap.
I bet 7 million.</v>

1339
01:13:10.381 --> 01:13:13.770
It's cheap too because he got it in the fucking fifties or something,
you know?

1340
01:13:13.771 --> 01:13:16.470
I mean,
I don't really know how,
I mean,
I don't think this guy's tried to sell it,

1341
01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:20.070
but I mean some of those like crazy Donald Trump ones that they have.
I didn't,

1342
01:13:20.071 --> 01:13:23.940
didn't they sell one recently in New York was like the most expensive real

1343
01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:25.380
estate transaction ever.

1344
01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:30.560
<v 5>Was that a house on top of penthouse house?
Yeah,
it was like a whole house.</v>

1345
01:13:30.561 --> 01:13:33.470
It was like 60 million bucks or something fucking stupid like that.

1346
01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:38.540
<v 3>There's a few of those Bernie Madoff style style setups in New York that you</v>

1347
01:13:38.541 --> 01:13:42.620
don't realize.
You know,
it's kind of quiet,
you know,
it's Kinda weird too,
right?

1348
01:13:42.621 --> 01:13:46.160
Because people can just walk by and just touch your house,
you know,
you know,

1349
01:13:46.161 --> 01:13:50.240
on a regular basis people are walking by and touching your house,
but inside,

1350
01:13:50.241 --> 01:13:50.421
you know,

1351
01:13:50.421 --> 01:13:55.421
you've got this fucking insane 40,000 square foot mansion,

1352
01:13:55.571 --> 01:13:55.840
right?

1353
01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:59.740
<v 5>Private elevators,
butlers,
and a full staff.
You know,</v>

1354
01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.040
they have staffs and shit.
I on San Francisco,

1355
01:14:03.041 --> 01:14:06.640
one of my friend's dads had the car elevator where you drive it,

1356
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:12.100
do you see driving this bad ass building in Russian hill and you pull

1357
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.680
<v 0>your car and your car gets in an elevator with you in it.</v>

1358
01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:18.770
Earthquake happens and you fucking get stuck in this tunnel.

1359
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:23.140
Families crushed underneath.
That's like some Terminator Terminator.

1360
01:14:23.141 --> 01:14:27.430
What's his name?
He was the Batman.
There was,
sorry,
what was the punisher?

1361
01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:28.120
The punisher.

1362
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.420
Punisher has names like you would have that sort of a set on a chateau drive his

1363
01:14:31.421 --> 01:14:35.740
car elevator,
go to the top.
Floor's got LIGO rifle range set up.

1364
01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.520
Robert Urich in Vegas.
He used to drive his car into his garage.

1365
01:14:39.521 --> 01:14:44.230
Then how comedy movies where there of dudes that were like Badass rebel guys who

1366
01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:45.430
lived in lofts,

1367
01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.080
they all lived in this weird like sort of an industrial,

1368
01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:54.550
no comfort area.
You know,
it's all just,
I'm just here for business,

1369
01:14:54.551 --> 01:14:57.910
not for pleasure,
you know?
Right.
It's amazing piece of water.

1370
01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:02.170
A waterfront real estate.
Do I at doc cleaning guns blade,

1371
01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:06.490
he's got a warehouse on a career.
Remote Control curtains

1372
01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.070
responding,
funding this.

1373
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.700
I wonder if there really are dudes out there that are rocking it as like some

1374
01:15:12.701 --> 01:15:16.450
sort of a mass.
I mean some sort of a vigilante character.

1375
01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:20.710
I just watched the mechanic and as a good select a new one.
Yeah,
I liked it.

1376
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:23.290
I just liked the,
I've never watched that out of respect.

1377
01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:25.120
Respect for Charles Bronson.
I just write the,

1378
01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:29.020
has Jason shade them stayed on what the fuck his name is.
Get out of here.

1379
01:15:29.021 --> 01:15:34.021
You fucking Momo ideas wore his hat of the new movie out of respect for the old

1380
01:15:34.421 --> 01:15:37.840
movie,
but he won't watch the new movie.
He goes to his,

1381
01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:42.610
I love somebody going into their living room and hitting a thing and having the

1382
01:15:42.611 --> 01:15:46.090
secret panel open up all it.
Yeah.

1383
01:15:46.091 --> 01:15:49.900
Cause that's how he plans out his shit.
And it'd be like if you haven't,
you're

1384
01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.020
right.
Okay.
I thought you were talking about Joey Diaz.
Ah,

1385
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:57.820
what are you talking about?
The punisher?
I got a secret panel.

1386
01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:00.310
It isn't in the funny thing.
Those guys,

1387
01:16:00.311 --> 01:16:03.820
they all had like warehouses with motorcycle up there,
you know,

1388
01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.150
and a dummy where they would practice throwing knives at it.
Sure,
sure,
sure.

1389
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:09.010
Who automated all this stuff?

1390
01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:14.170
I got dragged to the star wars and concert at the Hollywood bowl.
What is that?

1391
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.500
It's Joey was telling me something about it that it was like $300 a ticket.

1392
01:16:17.670 --> 01:16:20.910
<v 4>Uh,
yeah.
I don't know.
My girlfriend's a huge star trek nerd.</v>

1393
01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:24.120
Star Trek or star wars?
Star Wars nerd.
I'm sorry.
Star Wars nerd.
And she's like,

1394
01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:26.130
she wanted to go but I think it was sold out.

1395
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:29.580
But so she's been checking in the other day.
They release some tickets.

1396
01:16:29.610 --> 01:16:32.800
What is it?
It's a,
uh,
it's the,
the original,
the music.
Yeah.

1397
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:36.330
The original guy that did all the music for a star wars.

1398
01:16:36.331 --> 01:16:38.840
He's there and the boys to c three Po narrates,

1399
01:16:38.841 --> 01:16:42.150
his whole like kind of like journey through the star wars and university using

1400
01:16:42.151 --> 01:16:43.500
all the music,
uh,

1401
01:16:43.530 --> 01:16:47.070
from star wars and there's like lasers and the journey through the Star Wars

1402
01:16:47.071 --> 01:16:51.720
universe.
It's kind of like watching a wrap up of all the star wars movies,

1403
01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:56.220
like live with the whole orchestra and they have this huge like HD screen and

1404
01:16:56.221 --> 01:16:58.980
these lasers that are coming out of every,
I mean it's trippy.

1405
01:16:59.130 --> 01:17:02.100
It's really like what are,
what are you seeing on the stage?

1406
01:17:02.101 --> 01:17:05.640
And you've seen them act things out.
No,
no stages.
The orchestra.

1407
01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:09.530
And then you got this guy that played c three Po walking around going now let's

1408
01:17:09.531 --> 01:17:13.230
go into star was [inaudible] you know,
he's like,

1409
01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:17.270
and then like they'll show like a part from the movie and then the orchestra

1410
01:17:17.271 --> 01:17:20.960
plays a crowd cheer towards the music.
You know,

1411
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:25.430
like it's kind of like you're watching clips of the movie while a real orchestra

1412
01:17:25.431 --> 01:17:26.120
is going through.

1413
01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:30.680
Like playing the soundtrack to star wars while there's a laser show and wow,

1414
01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:32.000
I don't know,
all this crap is going on.

1415
01:17:32.001 --> 01:17:35.200
So you're watching the movie at the same time?
Not The whole movie.

1416
01:17:35.230 --> 01:17:39.100
Just like parts of it.
Like you know they took the music from shooting?
No,
no,
no,

1417
01:17:39.101 --> 01:17:42.470
not $300 a ticket.
I don't think so.

1418
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:47.120
I think we got $70 a ticket and so we're thinking Ohio.
Yeah.

1419
01:17:47.150 --> 01:17:49.520
Wow.
We're thinking we're super high up.
Right.

1420
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:53.150
But we took emergency exits dicey in our pocket just in case if we weren't,

1421
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:57.200
we get in,
we're fucking front row of the fucking Hollywood bowl.

1422
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:58.550
$70 ticket.

1423
01:17:58.610 --> 01:18:02.480
What's c three Po is sitting right in front of me as close as me.

1424
01:18:02.481 --> 01:18:06.500
And you are to here just doing the whole race and like walking and then coming

1425
01:18:06.501 --> 01:18:09.180
back and sitting down right in front of me.
So we both like at,
you're like,

1426
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:12.740
all right,
we're doing this.
We went deep.
But that was amazing.

1427
01:18:12.741 --> 01:18:16.160
If you can check it out,
if you're a star star wars fan and if it's in your city,

1428
01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.770
fucking check that shit out.
It's a so basically what you're saying,

1429
01:18:18.771 --> 01:18:23.420
you enjoyed it cause you were on drugs.
Yeah.
For half of it I was,
no,

1430
01:18:23.421 --> 01:18:26.680
but it is.
It was pretty appreciate data if it wasn't,
if you aren't yeah,
yeah,

1431
01:18:26.681 --> 01:18:31.190
yeah,
yeah.
I'm,
I'm a,
I'm a star wars fan,
but if I was a hardcore star wars fan,

1432
01:18:31.191 --> 01:18:33.290
I would have just all over the place.
Joey Dia saw me.

1433
01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:35.840
He couldn't find any tickets other than a $300 tickets.

1434
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:40.580
I don't think it's be a Honda.
No,
because the tree bills,

1435
01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:43.400
most of the tickets were 14 weeks.
I don't know.

1436
01:18:43.401 --> 01:18:45.350
I just think he was probably looking for something to do that day.

1437
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:50.390
I probably cookied up to the hills looking at something else.

1438
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:54.060
He says,
God damn cookies all day,
man.
He's not fucking around these days.
Yeah.

1439
01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:57.890
Every time I see him,
he's chewing on one of those pot cookies.
Yeah,
he must,

1440
01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.860
he must have an insane tolerance.
You can never trust him.

1441
01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:05.340
Don't ever trust him with the dosage.
Never.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I had to,

1442
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:08.030
I did a live podcast where he gave me some and I fucking,

1443
01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:12.230
it was halfway through it.
I had to excuse myself because I was,
I became a mess.

1444
01:19:12.231 --> 01:19:14.270
I couldn't do with it.
The banana bread.
Yeah.

1445
01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:16.640
It was the last junk [inaudible] magical.
You ever,
uh,

1446
01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:19.190
ever fuck up with banana bread?
No,

1447
01:19:19.191 --> 01:19:20.980
I haven't had any of the banana bread is at the stud.

1448
01:19:20.981 --> 01:19:22.850
It's really packed in and what everyone's scared of.

1449
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:26.830
Everyone's scared of the banana bread,
but definitely do the joint ventures.

1450
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:29.320
Do you ever have that?
Oh yeah.
When I would go to the nine or games and sometimes

1451
01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.690
<v 5>they have uh,
uh,
tailgating,</v>

1452
01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:34.000
they have a bunch of this stuff out because one of the guys that goes to the

1453
01:19:34.001 --> 01:19:37.660
tailgate owns one of the bakeries up in northern California.
Man,

1454
01:19:37.661 --> 01:19:41.590
out of those guys not worry constantly about and getting ripped off.

1455
01:19:41.591 --> 01:19:43.740
It happened more.
It got,
they all busted into,

1456
01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:46.240
they think it was employees busted in a place.

1457
01:19:46.241 --> 01:19:50.430
He's got Doberman pinschers in there now,
but they busted in,
took everything.

1458
01:19:50.431 --> 01:19:54.640
He had to be an inside job and then he went and camera digital the whole place

1459
01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:57.700
and uh,
put an extra security and dogs.

1460
01:19:57.970 --> 01:20:01.390
So it was one of his employees and his employees came in and took everything.

1461
01:20:01.391 --> 01:20:04.480
Yeah.
Does he know which one now they,
I mean they're,

1462
01:20:04.481 --> 01:20:07.080
they had cameras but he knew exactly how to take them all out.

1463
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:08.100
So the person's might still

1464
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.440
<v 0>be working there?
No,</v>

1465
01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:14.600
I mean they had a couple of disgruntled people and he bought it from another

1466
01:20:14.730 --> 01:20:18.920
guy.
There's something about things that are illegal man,
that just to you,

1467
01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:22.800
you can't have a smooth operation.
It's like,

1468
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:27.860
even though marijuana is helpful and beautiful and should be legal and is legal

1469
01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:31.230
according to state law,
even though you know,

1470
01:20:31.231 --> 01:20:34.980
there are medical patients are legally growing it under state law,

1471
01:20:34.981 --> 01:20:37.830
the federal government can still come in and raid you at anytime.

1472
01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:40.020
And because of that,
the only the people,

1473
01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:42.870
the people that are willing to get into that,
like a lot of them,

1474
01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:47.420
a good percentage of them,
they're a little wild.
You know,
it's,
it's tricky.
Yup.

1475
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:50.190
I mean there's a lot of money to be made there.
Is this your new,

1476
01:20:50.191 --> 01:20:54.600
I got a card now,
35 bucks for energy for a doctor.
You have a card now,

1477
01:20:54.970 --> 01:20:59.550
the new thing.
Yeah.
So they give you weed us and I purposely splinted my,

1478
01:20:59.551 --> 01:21:02.580
I made myself like a stone just possible because she had pulled over.

1479
01:21:02.581 --> 01:21:05.390
So driver's license stupid.
But the doctor,

1480
01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:08.540
the doctor quote unquote ticket.
Oh yeah,

1481
01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:12.600
the doctor quote unquote was very cool.
But this time they actually tested my,

1482
01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:15.570
my uh,
blood pressure where they put the thing in there and then,

1483
01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.250
and they checked my heart and stuff like that,

1484
01:21:17.251 --> 01:21:19.430
which it was a little bit more intense than normal.
Uh,

1485
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:22.360
but the funny thing is she didn't write any numbers down.
Did you shouldn't,

1486
01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:24.060
you shouldn't say that.

1487
01:21:24.061 --> 01:21:26.550
That it was more intense than normal because you're kind of given up the whole

1488
01:21:26.551 --> 01:21:28.980
thing.
So do they,

1489
01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.680
is there a certain shit they're supposed to do?

1490
01:21:31.681 --> 01:21:34.560
Like check your heart rate and your blood pressure?
I mean it's literally,

1491
01:21:34.710 --> 01:21:38.070
it's supposed to be according to state law,
a legit medical visit.

1492
01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:39.120
Cause those all look the same.

1493
01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:42.350
Is it like a driver's license is different pictures let's this motherfucker.

1494
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.330
That's great.
It's great.
They let you do it.

1495
01:21:44.331 --> 01:21:46.660
Like if you come with a person like me and my girlfriend gave me,

1496
01:21:46.690 --> 01:21:49.320
they did it together and then were like asked her what it,

1497
01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:53.910
what do you need it for?
And she goes,
ah,
pms and shit.
Okay.
Yeah.

1498
01:21:53.911 --> 01:21:57.480
I mean there's a,
you know,
in other states though it's,
it's tight.
Like in Jersey,

1499
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:58.620
they're trying to make it real tight.

1500
01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:00.750
They really Arizona and they want it to be really tight.

1501
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.190
They wanted to be like aids,
you know,
wasting disease,
stuff like that.
Cramps,

1502
01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:08.440
severe arthritis.
But that's the beauty of it.

1503
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:12.060
Mean what I said is it's completely true.

1504
01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:15.540
I like using marijuana instead of using pills.
I don't want to take Tylenol.

1505
01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:17.670
If I have a headache,
I don't want to take this.
If I have this,

1506
01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:20.940
I could just take a plant.
You know,
people die from Tylenol.

1507
01:22:20.941 --> 01:22:23.850
People don't die from weed.
Yeah.
I mean,
look,
there's no,

1508
01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:27.510
there's no logical argument against weed in 2011 and so silly.
The,

1509
01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.990
the strongest one that anyone can come up with is the gateway one.

1510
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:35.880
And which is just a,
that's just a silly thing.
They're not related.
You know,

1511
01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:36.750
if you're,

1512
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:41.750
I think the gateway is much more dangerous if you're not honest about pot.

1513
01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:44.280
Because if you are honest about pot,

1514
01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:48.060
if the government and the law enforcement and teachers and everyone was honest

1515
01:22:48.061 --> 01:22:50.190
and said,
listen,
if you're going to do a drug deal,

1516
01:22:50.191 --> 01:22:51.780
a drug that's not going to hurt you or kill you,

1517
01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.930
there's a few that are not going to hurt you.
The natural ones,
marijuana,

1518
01:22:54.931 --> 01:22:57.960
it's not going to kill you.
Okay?
And you know,
if you want to try something,

1519
01:22:57.961 --> 01:23:02.340
try that.
But you have to be very careful of very addictive drugs.
Opiates,

1520
01:23:02.341 --> 01:23:05.370
you got to here be very careful of synthetic ones like methamphetamine.

1521
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:06.010
So they're

1522
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:09.640
<v 3>very,
very addictive.
So just scary.
Yeah.
So just be honest about it,
man.</v>

1523
01:23:09.641 --> 01:23:10.780
I'd be honest with kids,

1524
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:14.920
stop fucking playing this game that everything is all in the same group.

1525
01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.480
Because when you say that,

1526
01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:21.600
and then kids smoke pot and have a fucking fantastic time and enjoy the shit out

1527
01:23:21.641 --> 01:23:26.390
of some food and laugh their ass off at a movie and hug and say,
man,
I love you.

1528
01:23:26.391 --> 01:23:28.540
It's so much fun hanging with you.
I'll see you tomorrow at school.

1529
01:23:28.541 --> 01:23:32.800
Do they had the best fucking time?
Why?
Because they were high.
Okay.

1530
01:23:33.010 --> 01:23:37.750
You know they're 1920 years old.
Who the fuck?
Leave him alone.

1531
01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.810
Leave him alone.
It should be legal.
It should be legal.

1532
01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:45.160
You can't get some high school kid who's experienced something like that or,

1533
01:23:45.161 --> 01:23:49.000
or college kid has experienced something like that and then tell him that it's

1534
01:23:49.001 --> 01:23:49.510
wrong.

1535
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:53.290
You can't tell them that it's bad because you run the risk of everything that

1536
01:23:53.291 --> 01:23:56.860
you are saying that it's valid is going to be discounted because he's going to

1537
01:23:56.861 --> 01:23:58.870
know you're full of shit about this whole weed thing.
Well,

1538
01:23:58.871 --> 01:24:01.600
this guy's got this crazy,
stupid,
radical opinion about weed.

1539
01:24:01.601 --> 01:24:05.770
It's not based in facts or studies or any results that I've ever seen in my

1540
01:24:05.771 --> 01:24:08.540
fucking life.
So why should I listen to him when it comes to heroin?

1541
01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:11.950
Why should I listen to him when it comes to Meth,
that's the real gateway.

1542
01:24:11.951 --> 01:24:14.860
The gateway is not marijuana.
It's bullshit.

1543
01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.090
The gateway is keeping people from reality.
If you're just told kids,

1544
01:24:19.091 --> 01:24:20.740
what the fuck pot does to you,

1545
01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:25.120
you know all this nonsense about withdrawal symptoms and all this fucking

1546
01:24:25.121 --> 01:24:28.150
silliness that you hear from people who've never smoked a day in their life.

1547
01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.690
If some patient tells you is going through withdrawals from weed,

1548
01:24:31.691 --> 01:24:36.190
he's a fucking pussy.
You weak bitch.

1549
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:40.000
You can't even fucking recover from weed.
You know,

1550
01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:44.560
just get up you lazy,
fuck and take an aerobics class or right,

1551
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:46.690
go do yoga,
come something.

1552
01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:51.310
Go fishing you fuck head to do something.
You're not addicted to pot.

1553
01:24:51.311 --> 01:24:54.220
Stupid.
Maybe you are.
I don't really know.
I'm not really a doctor.

1554
01:24:54.221 --> 01:24:56.230
I'm just talking shit.
Maybe you're the one.

1555
01:24:56.710 --> 01:25:00.610
You're the only the one guy with massive withdrawals and fucking Joe Rogan until

1556
01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:01.463
you were funny.

1557
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:06.470
Hello shaking because I had read in 20 minutes or it's some weird things with

1558
01:25:06.761 --> 01:25:07.630
some people that are like,

1559
01:25:07.631 --> 01:25:10.450
like people who are in alcoholics anonymous where they feel like they have to

1560
01:25:10.451 --> 01:25:14.590
quit.
We'd also,
you know,
and it's like,
why don't you quit red bull too?

1561
01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:15.970
Why are you lumping that?

1562
01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:19.790
I think there's people that are compulsive about taking in is not in
necessarily,

1563
01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.940
maybe it's,
and there's gotta be marijuana.

1564
01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:26.910
I have a friend who was sober for 20 years and when we were kids,
when we,
uh,

1565
01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:30.640
we both started out doing a standup around the same time as well,
and he was,
uh,

1566
01:25:30.670 --> 01:25:34.000
he was drinking and he realized that he couldn't drink anymore,

1567
01:25:34.001 --> 01:25:38.110
so he quit drinking and then 20 years later he started smoking pot and he's so

1568
01:25:38.111 --> 01:25:41.770
happy,
so happy about it.
Like,
yeah,
it's fucking crane.
I don't,

1569
01:25:42.010 --> 01:25:45.010
I don't feel like I need it.
It's not like I feel like a fuck up my life with it,

1570
01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:49.360
but I'm like,
that's a crazy risk to take.
But a lot of people like,
you know,

1571
01:25:49.361 --> 01:25:52.410
we have some friends that are,
there are friends of bills,
you know,

1572
01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:55.640
that are in the alcoholics anonymous program and they know,
he's like,
you can't,

1573
01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:59.480
you know,
tape can't take it that marijuana,
he can't do anything.

1574
01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:03.380
Tate says the same thing.
He doesn't want to smoke pot.
He said he would to,

1575
01:26:03.381 --> 01:26:06.160
but he thinks if he did,
he would just start doing everything else.
Yeah.

1576
01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:10.380
<v 5>I used to do and just go fucking crazy.
And I mean I'd known him for a long time.</v>

1577
01:26:10.381 --> 01:26:13.800
He's one of the first people I met when I was down in the end it came down to La

1578
01:26:13.890 --> 01:26:18.720
and I think that he just seeing him with,
you know,

1579
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:20.850
his act I think is better.
It's amazing.

1580
01:26:20.851 --> 01:26:25.410
I just had a regular at the comedy store is insane.
Oh,
that's ridiculous.

1581
01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:26.410
Well,
but anyway,

1582
01:26:26.410 --> 01:26:29.530
<v 3>but sales every time we can.
But yeah,
teams,
he's a smart guy.
You know,</v>

1583
01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.360
TV is a smart,
funny guy and he's been around a long time.

1584
01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:35.720
It's nice to see him get his shit together.
Yeah.
There's certain people that,

1585
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:39.980
look,
it's all,
look,
marijuana to me is not fun.

1586
01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:41.720
If I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing,

1587
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:44.000
if I have a lot of issues in my life,

1588
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:47.120
if there's some unresolved things in my life and I smoked pot,

1589
01:26:47.150 --> 01:26:51.620
I don't enjoy it because all I get is this,
this bad feeling of,
you know,

1590
01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:55.460
trying it that I'm not doing what I should be doing and not on a positive

1591
01:26:55.461 --> 01:27:00.461
frequency that I'm not avoiding drama and creating as much as I can and always

1592
01:27:01.071 --> 01:27:04.070
moving in the positive direction.
Like if I have a,

1593
01:27:04.071 --> 01:27:09.071
if I don't follow all the right paths in my life and go with my,

1594
01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:14.480
my good instincts and then I get high,
I feel terrible.
Yeah,
just,

1595
01:27:14.481 --> 01:27:17.480
I just feel awful.
And I think a lot of people they would,

1596
01:27:17.481 --> 01:27:20.090
they do is they medicate themselves and they,
they,

1597
01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.780
they revel in that feeling awful.
They revel in that.

1598
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:28.810
Just the extreme extreme procrastination where they never get anything done.

1599
01:27:29.781 --> 01:27:33.050
They just jerk off.
And especially comics,
you know,

1600
01:27:33.051 --> 01:27:35.930
they don't clean their house ever.
They don't do shit.

1601
01:27:35.931 --> 01:27:39.740
They sit in front of the computer and play with themselves and,
and watch movies.

1602
01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:40.890
<v 5>People don't really,</v>

1603
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:43.500
a lot of people out there listening to probably this and that,

1604
01:27:43.501 --> 01:27:48.300
just smoke pot and do just waste away and just say those are people which,

1605
01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:52.720
hey,
yeah,
I'm just saying if you really do accomplish something,
like he's,

1606
01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:54.150
you'd go to the gym and you get into some,

1607
01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:57.270
a bunch of other shit done and you feel really accomplished with your day and

1608
01:27:57.271 --> 01:28:01.920
then he spoke upon is feeling there is you feel like even the feeling of

1609
01:28:01.921 --> 01:28:05.310
accomplishing something and really having a great day where you get a bunch of

1610
01:28:05.311 --> 01:28:09.270
shit done.
Unmatched.
Yeah.
The feelings that you've earned it,
you know,

1611
01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:11.200
it's a very important thing,
man.
You,
you,

1612
01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:14.480
<v 3>you have to have discipline.
There's a yin and a Yang to human beings.</v>

1613
01:28:14.481 --> 01:28:16.340
If you are completely,
totally impulsive,

1614
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:19.580
you're not going to be as happy as if you are.

1615
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:21.980
You have impulses mixed in with

1616
01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:23.430
<v 5>care of your responsibilities.</v>

1617
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:27.090
That's why I was thrilled with that book and I found out you liked as well and

1618
01:28:27.091 --> 01:28:30.450
you were handing out to people [inaudible] Yup.
Yeah.
It says things the best,

1619
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:34.950
the thing,
it's just getting shit done.
Yeah.
Getting shit done,
doing the work and,

1620
01:28:34.951 --> 01:28:36.560
and,
and,
you know,
then do whatever you want.

1621
01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:38.610
<v 3>Yeah.
And then enjoying things,
you know,</v>

1622
01:28:38.611 --> 01:28:41.610
and then realizing that there's something that's keeping you from working and

1623
01:28:41.611 --> 01:28:44.660
it's called resistance and it's all your ego.
It's all,
you know,

1624
01:28:44.670 --> 01:28:48.300
it's all the procrastination that every artist feel faces.

1625
01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:50.280
I was talking to a guy recently that,
uh,

1626
01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:53.070
he wrote a book on pool cues a hung out with him this weekend.

1627
01:28:53.071 --> 01:28:57.060
He's one of Mack's Eberly's buddy.
He wrote the Big Blue Book of pool cues.

1628
01:28:57.061 --> 01:28:59.280
It's like really like labor intensive,

1629
01:28:59.281 --> 01:29:04.140
like marking all these different pool cues or like collected as a form of art,

1630
01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:04.741
you know,

1631
01:29:04.741 --> 01:29:07.830
and there's guys that are some guys who considered like masters in these pool

1632
01:29:07.831 --> 01:29:11.630
cues and this guy took photos and created this book of all these pool cues.
Yeah.

1633
01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:15.520
And he's like the hardest part about it was sitting down and doing the work.
She,

1634
01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.120
the hardest part about it.
And it's the hardest part for everybody.

1635
01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:18.421
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1636
01:29:18.421 --> 01:29:21.330
For now on yourself to get in there and write and it's like I keep making these,

1637
01:29:21.331 --> 01:29:25.290
um,
I just had an office built,
you know,

1638
01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:28.830
in my garage is detached garage where I can write and sit down and really get
an,

1639
01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:32.640
I knew in the back of my mind,
okay if I was procrastinating by saying,
okay,

1640
01:29:32.641 --> 01:29:34.770
if I don't build that space and I have a space to write,
you know,

1641
01:29:34.771 --> 01:29:38.730
I was just putting shit off and I would force myself to go to a coffee bean up

1642
01:29:38.731 --> 01:29:41.640
in and I was getting distracted up there and I think,

1643
01:29:41.641 --> 01:29:45.720
and I'm that asshole on a lot lamp pomp and fucking coffee bean.
I wouldn't,

1644
01:29:45.721 --> 01:29:48.510
right.
Because the headphones idiot.

1645
01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:51.240
Did you imagine if you had these headphones on,
on your laptop?

1646
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:54.420
And I saw somebody bring their full on desktop,
two stars,

1647
01:29:54.421 --> 01:29:58.350
big noise canceling headphones and before and just sat there because I would

1648
01:29:58.351 --> 01:30:00.580
always go to,
what's it called,

1649
01:30:00.610 --> 01:30:05.210
lock Kenyatta or away from my house because I knew no one was there and I wasn't

1650
01:30:05.211 --> 01:30:10.050
gonna see anybody ever knew I was that asshole on the laptop and I was fine with

1651
01:30:10.051 --> 01:30:12.960
it because I was never going to be self conscious without anybody running into

1652
01:30:12.961 --> 01:30:14.250
me because I know no one over there.

1653
01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:17.730
But it was still a waste of time for me to go up there and I put it off and put

1654
01:30:17.731 --> 01:30:22.110
it off.
Now I built this office and uh,
I'm getting in there and writing.

1655
01:30:22.111 --> 01:30:25.020
I feel fantastic about myself because I'm really doing,

1656
01:30:25.021 --> 01:30:27.090
if I can write four to six hours a day,

1657
01:30:27.150 --> 01:30:30.170
that's a fantastic day for writing.

1658
01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:34.360
<v 3>Yeah.
I,
um,
I don't do well after four hours.
I,
uh,</v>

1659
01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:39.410
I write in these big crazy energetic bursts and then as it gets towards the end

1660
01:30:40.691 --> 01:30:41.261
of the burst,

1661
01:30:41.261 --> 01:30:45.430
I always kind of know when the ride is over and it's usually around four hours.

1662
01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:49.330
I've had some like longer more disciplined days where I'll sit down for six or

1663
01:30:49.331 --> 01:30:50.020
eight,

1664
01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:54.700
but I feel like I write my best shit and he's four hour runs and then I always

1665
01:30:54.701 --> 01:30:56.050
write my best shit when I write.

1666
01:30:56.051 --> 01:31:00.160
Like I'll write one draft of it and then I'll come back and I won't do anything

1667
01:31:00.161 --> 01:31:02.620
but read the second draft for like an hour.

1668
01:31:02.710 --> 01:31:05.330
Just go back over it and wait for the part of it.

1669
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:08.740
Wait for the weed to kick in the rewriting to two.

1670
01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:12.070
And then do you find yourself when you're in your best form,
when you're writing,

1671
01:31:12.071 --> 01:31:14.970
where you don't even know where the fuck the words are coming from?
Yeah,

1672
01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.400
<v 5>that's what it says.
Like all that music stuff.</v>

1673
01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:20.490
It's like the muses come in and all of a sudden you just sort of put pen to

1674
01:31:20.491 --> 01:31:22.950
paper and make sure you're going to write and make the French press thing,

1675
01:31:22.951 --> 01:31:27.390
play a coffee and go out there and just start attacking it and put the pen in

1676
01:31:27.391 --> 01:31:29.910
your hand and stuff will come.
And it's just amazing.

1677
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:31.500
<v 3>I think that,
you know,</v>

1678
01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:34.800
this is a topic of discussion on my message board that has sort of like,
um,

1679
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:37.920
some spiritual,
airy fairy bullshit thinking.

1680
01:31:37.921 --> 01:31:40.350
The idea of the muse and it's really just your imagination.

1681
01:31:40.351 --> 01:31:42.310
Your imagination is just,
uh,
you know,

1682
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:46.410
I'm a product of the synapses firing in your brain and you know,
your,

1683
01:31:46.411 --> 01:31:49.680
your memories and all the knowledge and the information that you've acquired all

1684
01:31:49.681 --> 01:31:52.800
throughout your life and the calculations you're making with that information

1685
01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.950
due to your own personal circumstance.
And Boom,
you create something.

1686
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:58.140
And at the same as,
as you're sitting down and writing it,

1687
01:31:58.141 --> 01:32:00.970
all you're doing is sort of recounting everything that you've learned and making

1688
01:32:00.971 --> 01:32:05.380
some rational,
uh,
calculations now,
organization of it.
And Boom,

1689
01:32:05.381 --> 01:32:07.480
you're calling that the muse,
you calling that creativity.

1690
01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:12.490
But I think what it represents to me at least,
is there's a mind of no mind.

1691
01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:16.950
There's a zen thing that you're always trying to find in martial arts and uh,

1692
01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:20.650
that that is moving without even thinking about what you're doing.

1693
01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:25.920
You train yourself to the point where the movements become so second nature.

1694
01:32:26.351 --> 01:32:30.040
It's like tying your shoe.
You know,
when you tie your shoe,
you don't think,
okay,

1695
01:32:30.041 --> 01:32:32.800
I'm going to loop this under there and do this.

1696
01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:36.610
And then you just bang.
And you remember when you were a little kid,

1697
01:32:36.611 --> 01:32:39.910
and I'm noticing it now because my three year old,
and you're sure you have kids.

1698
01:32:40.330 --> 01:32:43.410
My three year old is just learning how to tie her shoes.
And it's,

1699
01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:45.940
it's crazy to try to teach her like to her,

1700
01:32:45.941 --> 01:32:50.290
it's like this massive puzzle to be able to tie your shoes and put this through

1701
01:32:50.291 --> 01:32:52.930
that.
And then what happens?
And then you make a loop.

1702
01:32:52.931 --> 01:32:55.570
And how do you hold onto the lube oil?
You wrap it around,
you know,

1703
01:32:55.571 --> 01:33:00.130
but to you right now then with Marshall,
with martial arts,

1704
01:33:00.131 --> 01:33:02.220
it has to be that way as well.
You know,
you,

1705
01:33:02.221 --> 01:33:07.221
you have to be able to utilize techniques in a a manner where you are,

1706
01:33:07.601 --> 01:33:10.930
there's no way you could think about it.
You're moving so fast,

1707
01:33:10.931 --> 01:33:13.840
so much that it's just in sync as basketball.
It's football.

1708
01:33:13.870 --> 01:33:17.440
You slipped that punch in before you even know it.
The right hand has landed.

1709
01:33:17.441 --> 01:33:20.140
You didn't even know you through it.
It's all just zen.
Well,

1710
01:33:20.141 --> 01:33:22.440
I think with writing there's a zen to writing.
Yep.

1711
01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.730
That's what we're tacking tapping into.
I mean,

1712
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:28.330
you can call it the muse and it may very well be that there's some sort of

1713
01:33:28.331 --> 01:33:31.120
antenna and we're tuning into it all or it may very well be,

1714
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:35.080
there's a state of mind where you don't feel responsible for things.

1715
01:33:35.081 --> 01:33:37.600
And that state of mind is when you're at your most creative,
well,

1716
01:33:37.601 --> 01:33:41.380
that zone of the practice professional.
Yeah.
That's what it is.
It's like,

1717
01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:42.990
you're so good at this.

1718
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.480
<v 5>Do you just instinctually going to acting?
I mean as a,</v>

1719
01:33:46.481 --> 01:33:50.440
I like that when you're really doing a good job as an actor and you're so in the

1720
01:33:50.441 --> 01:33:52.810
character or anything.
And then as standups,

1721
01:33:52.930 --> 01:33:54.940
I don't know if you've done a fair amount of acting

1722
01:33:55.370 --> 01:33:58.190
<v 3>well even,
you know,
with fear factor there was,
that was a,</v>

1723
01:33:58.191 --> 01:34:03.191
that was a job where are really sort of fell into a sort of a,

1724
01:34:03.501 --> 01:34:06.290
a practice method for dealing with everything.

1725
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:10.040
Because I was constantly dealing with people involved in competition,

1726
01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:13.280
constantly dealing with all these different little social things that were going

1727
01:34:13.281 --> 01:34:14.510
on the sec,
you know,

1728
01:34:14.511 --> 01:34:17.270
constantly dealing with monitoring their little stunt and making sure they're

1729
01:34:17.271 --> 01:34:20.720
doing it correctly and running on it,
not running on a time.
And you know,

1730
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:24.700
doing that became a real like,
uh,
like a,
uh,

1731
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:28.220
like I would go and punch in,
you know what I'm saying?
Like,
I knew that it was a,

1732
01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:31.790
this is something,
you know,
this is,
it's not a simple,
just sat around talking.

1733
01:34:31.791 --> 01:34:36.200
It was like,
it was,
uh,
you know,
it was like,
like a management position.

1734
01:34:36.230 --> 01:34:39.200
Like I had a go to go manage this thing and here we go.

1735
01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.060
And Punch is a real art to that shit,
to everything,
to everything to baking.

1736
01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:48.540
That can become a bet.
There's some fucking bakery at the um,

1737
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:51.470
one of the uh,
coffee places.
It's not a Starbucks.

1738
01:34:51.471 --> 01:34:53.540
One of the alternative ones in lax,

1739
01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:58.520
they got this chocolate croissant that is so bad ass.

1740
01:34:59.330 --> 01:35:02.660
Is that what it is?
Is it Oban?
Are you sure?
I think so.
I don't know if it is.

1741
01:35:02.661 --> 01:35:05.510
I don't think it is.
I think it's one of those generic ones.

1742
01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:08.900
It's a name that I've never heard the name before.
It's not Oban Pan.

1743
01:35:08.901 --> 01:35:11.540
It's a different one.
It's like if some other ones,
but it's in La Anyway,

1744
01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:13.110
the fucking chocolate croissant,

1745
01:35:13.150 --> 01:35:17.780
whoever makes this chocolate croissant is an artist there as zen master.

1746
01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:19.700
They got just the right amount of butter.

1747
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:23.480
The chocolate is just the right amount of chewy and the right amount of mushy

1748
01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:28.370
and he's,
the pastry is so delicious and moist dude.

1749
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:32.230
I mean it's all rockin chocolate croissant and the difference she that and some

1750
01:35:32.231 --> 01:35:35.930
crappy ass chocolate croissant.
That's just been sitting around on the shelf.

1751
01:35:35.931 --> 01:35:39.960
A Dunkin donuts.
Yeah,
there's,
there's,
it's like everything else man.
There's a,

1752
01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:44.480
there's a way to,
to do everything with that sort of a zen,

1753
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:47.900
finding the right frequency motion,

1754
01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:50.290
<v 5>really caring about it and dad.
Right.</v>

1755
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:53.920
And spending the time on it and practicing it and then it comes back and

1756
01:35:53.921 --> 01:35:55.980
instinctually,
I don't know if I ever told you a story,
uh,

1757
01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:58.600
but we put my son who's now eight years old,

1758
01:35:58.930 --> 01:36:01.840
put them in Jujitsu when he was four and a half and they were calling him the

1759
01:36:01.841 --> 01:36:05.350
natural.
Oh Wow.
Cause they put them out there and they said at four and a half,

1760
01:36:05.351 --> 01:36:06.490
let's just see what he does.

1761
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.690
And they put them up against this five year old and then immediately my son got

1762
01:36:10.691 --> 01:36:14.700
on his back right away and they like the Brazilian guys who are around the
place.

1763
01:36:14.701 --> 01:36:15.760
Who was,
he took the book.

1764
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:19.890
<v 7>He's the natural.
We don't tell them.</v>

1765
01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:21.890
That's hilarious.

1766
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:24.320
<v 5>Then of course,
then my son had his,</v>

1767
01:36:24.321 --> 01:36:26.810
he did it for a while and he liked it a lot because there was always a kid that

1768
01:36:26.811 --> 01:36:30.570
he matched up with.
But then,
um,
some highway patrolmen,

1769
01:36:30.571 --> 01:36:34.010
his kid who older,
like the kid didn't want was my son's age dropped out.

1770
01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:37.910
So then my son always had a match up with this kid that was a year and a half

1771
01:36:37.911 --> 01:36:42.911
older than him and just was super intense and beat the shit out of him and he

1772
01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:44.030
<v 3>got lost interest here.</v>

1773
01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:47.790
That's unfortunate for the little kid to the other little kid.
Would you,

1774
01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:49.730
you're supposed to teach kids like that,

1775
01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:53.720
that it's better to relax when you're better than someone instead of just

1776
01:36:53.721 --> 01:36:56.860
running through them,
work on stuff that you're not that good at.
But the guy,

1777
01:36:57.510 --> 01:37:00.180
I take it back like it's,
it's hard to,
um,

1778
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:03.110
there's two different philosophies when it comes to Jujitsu.

1779
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:07.100
One of them is the sink or swim philosophy that a lot of guys use.
And you know,

1780
01:37:07.130 --> 01:37:09.710
we've used it.
I've used it.
It's a,
you know what,
man,

1781
01:37:09.711 --> 01:37:11.000
if you can't handle getting tapped,

1782
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:12.560
you know you don't belong here in the first place,

1783
01:37:12.561 --> 01:37:15.500
so I'm just going to use you as a grappling dummy.
And so,
you know,

1784
01:37:15.501 --> 01:37:18.350
the idea is to take some guy who was just starting out or as a blue belt and

1785
01:37:18.351 --> 01:37:21.440
just,
and just tap them left and right.
But I think the way better way to do it,

1786
01:37:21.441 --> 01:37:25.010
for me at least the way it's always helped me is whenever I role with someone

1787
01:37:25.011 --> 01:37:28.160
and I think that there I'm way stronger than them or I'm way better than them.

1788
01:37:28.161 --> 01:37:31.400
I put myself in a little bit of a deficit and I'll let them get on top of me.

1789
01:37:31.401 --> 01:37:32.960
I'll let,
I'll try to work from my guard.

1790
01:37:32.961 --> 01:37:35.810
I'll try to let them take my back and I'll try it.
Yeah.
You know,
when I'm,

1791
01:37:35.811 --> 01:37:40.730
when I'm doing it smart,
because that's how,
that's how you learn in that kid.

1792
01:37:40.731 --> 01:37:43.130
So much.
To pull that kid aside and say,
listen,
or they try to,
yeah.

1793
01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.220
Did they try to really bad and they wouldn't listen,

1794
01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:50.930
he gets each gift cards.
Well,
he's a little kid and now he's caught.
I might know.

1795
01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:53.340
Listen,
when I was 80 then was,
no,
we had another little little

1796
01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:56.220
<v 5>kid there was he got it and it will let Lorenzo practice</v>

1797
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.950
<v 3>on him all day.
Oh that's cool.
Yeah,
it was crazy.
Well,
you know,</v>

1798
01:37:58.951 --> 01:38:01.710
drilling is really important for kids too and that's something that doesn't get

1799
01:38:01.711 --> 01:38:04.770
done a lot in Jujitsu but gets done a lot in wrestling.
You know,

1800
01:38:04.771 --> 01:38:06.420
in wrestling you go,
you know,
you'll,

1801
01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:10.110
you'll have a big percentage of your practice before you ever get to live

1802
01:38:10.111 --> 01:38:14.310
sparring.
A big percentage of practices going through different moves,
you know,

1803
01:38:14.311 --> 01:38:17.220
going through different arm drags going through different takedowns and you,

1804
01:38:17.221 --> 01:38:17.521
you know,

1805
01:38:17.521 --> 01:38:21.420
you drill in wrestling way more than a lot of people drill in Brazilian Jujitsu

1806
01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:23.450
because wrestling in America,
you know,

1807
01:38:23.451 --> 01:38:27.120
it's been more of an organized sport than Jujitsu.
As you know,
Jujitsu classes,

1808
01:38:27.121 --> 01:38:27.841
like a lot of them,

1809
01:38:27.841 --> 01:38:30.510
they'll show you a couple of techniques and then everybody will roll for the

1810
01:38:30.511 --> 01:38:32.940
remainder of the class.
So a lot of little kids.

1811
01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:35.430
I think that's one thing that's missing.
But the thing is,

1812
01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:38.160
it's that the rolling part is so much fun.

1813
01:38:38.190 --> 01:38:41.100
You don't want to waste all that time doing,
doing the,

1814
01:38:41.101 --> 01:38:43.170
the boring stuff of learning the moves.

1815
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:45.260
Like you won't learn a couple of moves and everyone's like,
oh,

1816
01:38:45.261 --> 01:38:47.970
it's just sparks his bar.
You know,
because it's fun.
It's like,

1817
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:52.380
it's natural chimpanzee fund.
You know,
your kit for kids too.

1818
01:38:52.410 --> 01:38:55.480
For a young boy,
a special,
it's like one of the best things to know.

1819
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:57.860
I mean that's his big thing of it.

1820
01:38:57.861 --> 01:39:01.020
When I come home from a road trip or when I've gone out and do stand up comedy,

1821
01:39:01.021 --> 01:39:04.770
he can't get enough of,
uh,
he,
his first request,
what do you want to do?

1822
01:39:04.771 --> 01:39:09.080
And he goes,
let's wrestle.
That's really,
yeah.
So you've got to get them back in.

1823
01:39:09.670 --> 01:39:12.660
Getting back involved I think instinctually also he remembers some of the stuff.

1824
01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:14.790
He was in it for a pretty significant amount of yeah.

1825
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.180
And then he did well before we leave.
Man,
I'll talk to you.

1826
01:39:18.181 --> 01:39:20.250
I'll find some place for him that he should have like a,

1827
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:24.870
like a foreign planet of her little kid.
Yeah.
It's not a bad idea.
Yeah.
It's hard,

1828
01:39:24.871 --> 01:39:26.830
man.
Teaching children's classes is difficult.

1829
01:39:26.850 --> 01:39:30.350
I used to watch a John Jacques Machado,
a teacher he used to have,

1830
01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:31.770
I think he brought it back recently,

1831
01:39:31.771 --> 01:39:34.500
but he had a children's class for a long time before he discontinued it.

1832
01:39:34.501 --> 01:39:37.260
And it was just hard,
man,
it's hard to get them to pay attention.

1833
01:39:37.261 --> 01:39:38.850
That's half of it as babysitting,
you know?

1834
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.160
Especially when they're like five and six.
They're nutty.

1835
01:39:41.161 --> 01:39:45.120
They're running around screaming and kicking things and then it distracts the

1836
01:39:45.121 --> 01:39:45.691
other kids.

1837
01:39:45.691 --> 01:39:48.470
And you're trying to get everybody's attention to teaching each other.
Yeah.

1838
01:39:48.490 --> 01:39:52.170
Actually poking and the kids get sad when they lose,
when they get tapped out,

1839
01:39:52.171 --> 01:39:55.710
they cry and you know,
it's like,
yeah,
yeah.
You know,

1840
01:39:55.711 --> 01:39:59.820
I've seen kids get really upset when they,
when they got tapped out and training,

1841
01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:00.301
you know?

1842
01:40:00.301 --> 01:40:04.140
And then other kids were laughing and giggling about it and those kids like did

1843
01:40:04.141 --> 01:40:08.400
better.
But it's such a good thing to learn as a young boy to deal with,
you know,

1844
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:11.520
other kids fucking with them to have some confidence.

1845
01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:15.750
Give me my security within the end of the world comes from teaching how to shoot

1846
01:40:15.751 --> 01:40:18.970
guns yet.
Yeah.
Now no gun in the house.
No one else can ever,

1847
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.700
you're going to teach,
you're done attitude gun run away.

1848
01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:25.560
I think it's a good idea in a hush should have gun.
Yeah.
This is what I think.

1849
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:27.930
I don't think everybody should have access to a gun,

1850
01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.860
but I think you should never be in a situation where a gun may save your life,

1851
01:40:31.861 --> 01:40:34.380
but you don't know how to fucking use it.
You look at and you're like,

1852
01:40:34.381 --> 01:40:38.310
or how does it work?
And then you're dead.
If you leave a gun around with me,

1853
01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:41.430
I know how to use it,
you know,
um,
no marksman.

1854
01:40:41.431 --> 01:40:44.490
But I know what the fuck is going on and I think you should know what the fuck

1855
01:40:44.491 --> 01:40:46.530
is going on too.
I think you should know when the safety's on.

1856
01:40:46.531 --> 01:40:48.150
I think you should know one.
There's one in the chamber.

1857
01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:50.880
I think you should know how to,
how to fucking shoot something.

1858
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:54.580
You should know how to do it.
I think it's better to be better to have it.

1859
01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:57.070
And not to need it.
You know,
you look,

1860
01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:01.270
I would hope that the singularity comes first and that what happens is we all

1861
01:41:01.271 --> 01:41:05.410
realize that we're all this one crazy consciousness that's somehow or another

1862
01:41:05.411 --> 01:41:09.460
connected through this new science and this new technology and that,
you know,

1863
01:41:09.461 --> 01:41:12.820
we should treat each other better because we actually do suffer when others

1864
01:41:12.821 --> 01:41:16.990
suffer and we do gain when others gain and that we all together collectively can

1865
01:41:16.991 --> 01:41:20.290
work together for a much more perfect version of the future and for reality and

1866
01:41:20.291 --> 01:41:22.810
for,
for life and for human beings.
That's very,

1867
01:41:22.811 --> 01:41:25.450
very possible that that's what's going to happen to us.

1868
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:29.920
Or the shit could hit the fan,
either one could happen.
The thing is,

1869
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:33.340
my first scenario,
the beautiful one has never taken place before.

1870
01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:35.180
As far as we know,
we,

1871
01:41:35.190 --> 01:41:39.940
we've always known that there's some potential untapped for human behavior and

1872
01:41:39.941 --> 01:41:42.490
we've looked at it as Valhalla,
we'd looked at it as heaven.

1873
01:41:42.491 --> 01:41:46.000
We've looked at it as,
you know,
the idea that at one point in time,
you know,

1874
01:41:46.001 --> 01:41:47.320
the great ones had it right.

1875
01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:50.530
You know that maybe there's some place in another dimension where everybody has

1876
01:41:50.531 --> 01:41:51.430
it right.
You know,

1877
01:41:51.431 --> 01:41:55.240
we know that there's something that could be done better than what we're doing.

1878
01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:58.390
We know that there are times when we interact with each other where it's just

1879
01:41:58.391 --> 01:42:00.940
absolutely beautiful and perfect and human beings.

1880
01:42:01.150 --> 01:42:04.480
If we were all like friends when we're having our best moment together,

1881
01:42:04.690 --> 01:42:08.620
the life would just be one awesome fucking collaboration.

1882
01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.740
And then there's the other times when you probably should know how to bust a
cap.

1883
01:42:12.230 --> 01:42:13.720
She got to know how to fuck somebody up.

1884
01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:16.420
But you also have to realize that that there's,

1885
01:42:16.421 --> 01:42:21.130
there's a lot of nature involved in this whole thing and that there seems to be

1886
01:42:21.131 --> 01:42:26.131
some sort of a race and the race is between people getting stupider and society

1887
01:42:27.131 --> 01:42:30.400
and civilization getting more and more ridiculous and more and more out of

1888
01:42:30.401 --> 01:42:34.750
control and hyper technology at the same time,

1889
01:42:35.190 --> 01:42:37.930
getting smarter.
People are getting much smarter,

1890
01:42:37.931 --> 01:42:42.230
but there's also way more dumb people to know about it.
We'll do it.

1891
01:42:42.231 --> 01:42:44.860
How about what the Detroit statistic is the one that kills me?

1892
01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:49.660
What's in Detroit right now?
47% of the population is functionally illiterate.

1893
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:54.990
47% of the population in a major city in the United States of America.

1894
01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:57.340
That's fucking terrifying.

1895
01:42:57.410 --> 01:43:01.480
It's scary because those people are only as smart as the people they know.

1896
01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:02.373
How about that?

1897
01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:06.910
How about they get all their information from the people around them so they've

1898
01:43:06.911 --> 01:43:10.720
lost everything that everyone else has learned.
They've lost everything.

1899
01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:13.480
That's helped.
Everyone who can read books,

1900
01:43:13.630 --> 01:43:15.280
they don't have any connection with that.

1901
01:43:15.370 --> 01:43:18.970
They have to get all their information from I herds.
They have to.
Someone say,

1902
01:43:18.971 --> 01:43:21.430
I heard this.
I heard they're going to do that.
I heard they're going to do this.

1903
01:43:21.970 --> 01:43:26.970
47% need that 47% could you imagine if you could go back in time to a time when

1904
01:43:28.751 --> 01:43:32.140
there was no internet and no one knew and you,
you,
you would,

1905
01:43:32.170 --> 01:43:35.200
you would try to communicate with people and tell them how ridiculous this is

1906
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.891
that,
you know,

1907
01:43:35.891 --> 01:43:38.800
one day we're going to have things written down in books and you're going to be

1908
01:43:38.801 --> 01:43:41.980
able to access knowledge and then you're going to be able to go online and ask

1909
01:43:41.981 --> 01:43:44.770
questions.
You know,
looking at you,
you look,
you're out of your fucking mind.
Like,

1910
01:43:44.771 --> 01:43:49.450
what are you even saying?
Well,
there's people living like that in 2011.

1911
01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:54.890
That's amazing.
It was a funny sketch.
47% dude.

1912
01:43:56.150 --> 01:43:59.270
When is that going to end?
How do you stop that?

1913
01:43:59.271 --> 01:44:01.220
How do you even fix that Thursday?
How,
what,

1914
01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.410
what does it feel like to be a teacher in Detroit?

1915
01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:07.800
<v 5>No,
it just a teacher in general.
I mean,
you're just overwhelmed.
My White,</v>

1916
01:44:07.801 --> 01:44:10.410
you know,
my wife is a teacher and uh,

1917
01:44:10.530 --> 01:44:15.180
there's kids that have such horrible home situations.

1918
01:44:15.181 --> 01:44:18.360
She was in an energy that you can't like a parent teacher night.

1919
01:44:18.361 --> 01:44:20.790
When my wife was teaching first grade,

1920
01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:23.580
I would go and help out and go to the classroom.

1921
01:44:23.850 --> 01:44:25.230
And then it's another thing when we first met,

1922
01:44:25.231 --> 01:44:29.610
my wife was teaching at homeless kids school.
Wow.

1923
01:44:29.670 --> 01:44:34.120
So that shit who doesn't turn up every day,
they have no consistency.

1924
01:44:34.121 --> 01:44:38.430
And as Americans,
we go to school in middle of the boat,
Emmy,

1925
01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:40.193
every other,

1926
01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:43.200
so many other nations are going to have more school days than we are.

1927
01:44:43.201 --> 01:44:45.930
So we're disadvantaged anyway.
So then you take a kid,

1928
01:44:45.931 --> 01:44:49.380
he put them in a motel or wherever he's living and you take some horrible home

1929
01:44:49.381 --> 01:44:53.760
life and like a Detroit situation where parents are doing drugs,
you know,

1930
01:44:53.761 --> 01:44:56.550
or whatever is happening.
And then he tried to send somebody to school,

1931
01:44:56.551 --> 01:45:01.480
you're just fucked.
You have no ability.
And these kids aren't getting meals,
um,

1932
01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:04.520
straight every day and they're taken away chocolate and strawberry milk in

1933
01:45:04.521 --> 01:45:07.080
schools too.
Why is that?
I don't know.

1934
01:45:07.290 --> 01:45:08.730
They just sit there announced that the other day

1935
01:45:10.810 --> 01:45:12.570
when politicians come on and they do,

1936
01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:15.720
there are cutbacks and saying that we're going to cut school lunches and stuff

1937
01:45:15.721 --> 01:45:16.260
like that.

1938
01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:20.400
So many kids relying on that lunch for their main meal every single day.

1939
01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:23.000
And then like I was saying,
when we had parent teacher conferences,

1940
01:45:23.001 --> 01:45:27.660
like in a rich school,
everybody shows up.
Everyone's eve super involved.

1941
01:45:27.870 --> 01:45:32.550
These,
we had nobody show up.
We had five parents and of the 25 kids that she had,

1942
01:45:32.551 --> 01:45:36.030
five parents showed up as ridiculous.
You can't win.

1943
01:45:36.450 --> 01:45:39.090
So now we're all screwed because now we're going to have generations and

1944
01:45:39.091 --> 01:45:41.550
generations of kids that have just horrible education

1945
01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:45.820
<v 3>parent.
Doesn't that really hurt your feelings
with that?</v>

1946
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:47.180
When you see kids that are abandoned,
right.

1947
01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:49.120
<v 5>Oh my God,
it makes me cry.
There was a,</v>

1948
01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:54.070
there was a documentary on the motel,
kids of Orange County.

1949
01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:58.120
You look that up,
motel Kidd's Orange County.
No,
no,
you don't want to watch it.

1950
01:45:58.150 --> 01:46:01.240
Well,
and I stumbled across it and I saw this little kid in a dumpster.

1951
01:46:01.530 --> 01:46:05.580
I'm trying to get toys out of it and then he just sat in a dumpster at one
point.

1952
01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:08.550
Started playing with these toys.
Having a son or is any,

1953
01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:12.850
you can't help but empathize with that little kid or would his situation is and

1954
01:46:12.851 --> 01:46:14.620
it's like if you're not human,

1955
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:19.570
<v 3>so horrible man,
it makes me so sad,
so sad.</v>

1956
01:46:20.050 --> 01:46:24.550
There's nothing to me like watching a kid who's fucked,
who's got no dad,

1957
01:46:24.551 --> 01:46:26.350
who's got no mom was got no,
you know,

1958
01:46:26.351 --> 01:46:31.351
no one who's worth anything in their life or some kid was parents are yelling at

1959
01:46:31.361 --> 01:46:32.194
them.
I've seen them.

1960
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:34.200
<v 5>I try,
I try to do flips again.</v>

1961
01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:38.060
I start volunteering through the La Education partnership just recently and I

1962
01:46:38.061 --> 01:46:42.650
just went out to speak to a high school class at Sun Valley high school is all

1963
01:46:42.651 --> 01:46:44.000
Latino kids live in is,

1964
01:46:44.010 --> 01:46:47.380
it's not the best neighborhood up there and I'm just tell him,

1965
01:46:47.381 --> 01:46:51.420
cause my mom used to clean houses for dollars an hour and then bought this

1966
01:46:51.421 --> 01:46:54.840
company and it's not like I'm doing any motivational speaking or anything like

1967
01:46:54.841 --> 01:46:57.630
that.
I'm just saying,
hey,
my mom cleaned houses for $6 an hour,

1968
01:46:57.870 --> 01:47:02.700
I have my own job now and I get to,
I'm here during the day wearing shorts.
Right.

1969
01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:06.120
There's a way to get his way out of here.
Yeah.

1970
01:47:06.121 --> 01:47:07.740
And if you work really hard and stuff like that.

1971
01:47:07.741 --> 01:47:12.000
So I mean people can do that and businessmen and people that are successful

1972
01:47:12.001 --> 01:47:16.560
could,
should go show these kids.
Especially if you came out of a rough situation,

1973
01:47:16.830 --> 01:47:20.930
say hey,
just so you know,
came from the exact same spot you're in and also plan.

1974
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:23.970
It's like I used to be that kid with the hoodie up in the back,

1975
01:47:23.971 --> 01:47:25.710
not paying attention.
How are you doing?

1976
01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:29.800
He used to be you and say like that and now he went to jail.

1977
01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:33.600
Angry that when you were a kid that no one ever gave her the option of standup

1978
01:47:33.601 --> 01:47:37.050
comedian.
Does that ever annoy you when you look back and think about that?

1979
01:47:37.051 --> 01:47:40.320
All the time.
That's why I was sort of using quiet class clown.

1980
01:47:40.321 --> 01:47:43.320
And I think about that all the time because that's why I went out to these kids

1981
01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:46.800
and it was like,
hey you guys,
there's a lot out of the jobs.
Like I write jokes,

1982
01:47:46.890 --> 01:47:50.370
I get paid a lot for,
uh,
and you know,
I just got this other Gig,

1983
01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:54.240
that's my dream gig and it's all because of what hard work is through
everything.

1984
01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:57.030
So,
um,
we had career day at our school.

1985
01:47:57.031 --> 01:48:00.240
I remember we had Bob Sar lot who's a comedian here and he played his

1986
01:48:00.241 --> 01:48:05.010
letterman's and he was one a letterman's buddies and he would my high school.

1987
01:48:05.011 --> 01:48:06.180
So he played those.

1988
01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:10.260
But I still didn't put two and two together that there was comedy writing.

1989
01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:13.770
He can pay a fortune,
be a comedy writer,
you mean Sitcoms,

1990
01:48:13.771 --> 01:48:16.440
us sitcoms and stuff like that.
And being a showrunner and stuff like that.

1991
01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:18.140
No one jam be intrusive.

1992
01:48:18.150 --> 01:48:21.690
Writing jobs that sort of exists and the ability to be creative and a joke

1993
01:48:21.691 --> 01:48:23.240
writer,
like my buddy Joe Barton,

1994
01:48:23.241 --> 01:48:28.170
nick writes roast jokes for people and stuff like that and he writes dirty
jokes.

1995
01:48:28.230 --> 01:48:28.441
You know,

1996
01:48:28.441 --> 01:48:33.410
do you know Joe Joe Barnett and he makes a good amount of monitoring.

1997
01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:36.630
Hard to do that though.
That's difficult.
But they're artsy mean.

1998
01:48:36.631 --> 01:48:38.790
Even being a show runner mean top down.
That's hard to do.

1999
01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:39.840
Jobs where you can be funny.

2000
01:48:39.841 --> 01:48:42.730
I don't think any Mexican kids know that showrunner exists.

2001
01:48:42.731 --> 01:48:45.660
The possibility because there are very few nobody's dad was.

2002
01:48:46.050 --> 01:48:48.870
That's one of the cool things obviously about Hollywood though is that you can

2003
01:48:48.871 --> 01:48:49.990
get an a,

2004
01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:55.090
a position as like a PA on a set and see like the whole thing like how it all

2005
01:48:55.201 --> 01:48:56.590
works and you know,

2006
01:48:57.190 --> 01:49:01.560
do people intern and they get pa positions and then they slowly move up the

2007
01:49:01.561 --> 01:49:04.170
ladder.
You know that was one of the cool things about fear factor.

2008
01:49:04.171 --> 01:49:06.000
Seeing gods that were based Floyd's in the beginning.

2009
01:49:06.001 --> 01:49:10.350
They were like level the abusers and there's the executive producer.
Yeah.

2010
01:49:10.590 --> 01:49:13.990
That's fantastic.
There's a ladder of you know,

2011
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:16.290
success that you can climb out here.

2012
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:19.170
Not necessarily even dependent on degrees.

2013
01:49:19.230 --> 01:49:22.110
Same thing with everything is when we were talking about is the guy works their

2014
01:49:22.111 --> 01:49:25.800
ass off though.
Yeah.
Yup.
With everything.

2015
01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:29.310
It all can be traced back to that.
Yes,
the effort,
effort,

2016
01:49:29.311 --> 01:49:33.270
intensity at focus slight.
That's a,
the main things about life.

2017
01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:35.700
Get your fucking mind right.
Put your effort,

2018
01:49:35.701 --> 01:49:38.670
your intensity and your focus into some sort of a positive direction.

2019
01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:41.910
But God damn,
that's hard to manage.
That's like,
you know,

2020
01:49:41.911 --> 01:49:46.911
we are all born with the super complicated fucking computer and not up manual to

2021
01:49:47.411 --> 01:49:48.130
be seen

2022
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:48.963
<v 3>anywhere.</v>

2023
01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.270
And so the only way we knew how to use a super fucking complicated computers

2024
01:49:52.271 --> 01:49:55.840
talk to these other people that are using the computer and function on the very

2025
01:49:55.841 --> 01:50:00.160
minimal builtin software that it has to be afraid of dogs and shit like that.

2026
01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:01.720
Yeah.
Look out for snakes.
You know what I mean?

2027
01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:04.390
And I think the knowledge that's built in,
it's like so minimal.

2028
01:50:04.391 --> 01:50:05.680
It's like the bare bones.

2029
01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:09.170
<v 5>So it is very helpful to have that guy who's five years ahead of you,
10 years,</v>

2030
01:50:09.290 --> 01:50:12.780
fuck the mentor.
Like not enough people are doing that anymore.

2031
01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:17.220
<v 3>Even that he might be five years ahead of you in a fucking idiot and leading you</v>

2032
01:50:17.221 --> 01:50:21.560
down a same stupid road that he went down.
Sure.
Bad Mentor.
Yeah,
that's an essay,

2033
01:50:21.570 --> 01:50:24.750
but I'm saying,
oh,
many of us.
That's the real problem.
You're,

2034
01:50:24.751 --> 01:50:28.230
it's so likely they got to trust the right person would be advice and who to

2035
01:50:28.231 --> 01:50:30.120
look up to and shit like that.
It's very important.

2036
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:33.750
I think that's a number one problem that a lot of people have in life and I have

2037
01:50:33.751 --> 01:50:35.550
had at one point in time in my life,

2038
01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:39.090
is that you get stuck in some sort of a situation where you don't relate to

2039
01:50:39.091 --> 01:50:42.600
anybody in your world.
You don't relate to anybody at your job.

2040
01:50:42.601 --> 01:50:46.110
You don't relate to anybody you know that you're friends with still from high

2041
01:50:46.111 --> 01:50:46.531
school.

2042
01:50:46.531 --> 01:50:49.770
You just feel real disconnected from them and you don't know anybody that thinks

2043
01:50:49.771 --> 01:50:52.410
the way you do this fucking before the Internet,
man,

2044
01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:56.160
some guys would live quiet lives of,
of despair and desperation.

2045
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:59.100
It's not a fucking quote that someone said about most men,
I forget.

2046
01:50:59.101 --> 01:51:03.540
This is an author that said most men live quiet lives of desperation and that is

2047
01:51:03.541 --> 01:51:04.650
so fucking true.

2048
01:51:04.850 --> 01:51:08.880
<v 5>Well,
I think that's what I was so relieved when I met all my fellow comics.
Hey,</v>

2049
01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:12.290
these are my guys,
if I'm ever out,

2050
01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:16.450
<v 3>if I'm ever out somewhere having dinner and I run it to you,
you know,</v>

2051
01:51:16.451 --> 01:51:17.670
I'm so happy

2052
01:51:17.710 --> 01:51:21.310
<v 5>it's that happened in Vegas.
Yeah.
I walked down and I saw you in any,</v>

2053
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:26.230
<v 3>yeah.
Yes.
It's like,
you know,
it's like you're,
you're,
you know,</v>

2054
01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:29.910
you,
you run into like,
it's like people that are,

2055
01:51:29.911 --> 01:51:33.670
that no one else is like that,
you know,
it's like running into a comic,

2056
01:51:33.730 --> 01:51:35.140
front to another comic is like,

2057
01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:39.070
this is for someone who's the only people I know that we're going to get me 100%

2058
01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:43.000
you know,
the only people that I know that I'm like that I'm 100% honest with,

2059
01:51:43.150 --> 01:51:45.490
and that is 100% honest with me.
I can trust comics

2060
01:51:45.610 --> 01:51:46.421
<v 5>in a Vegas.</v>

2061
01:51:46.421 --> 01:51:50.110
They and my friend Mickey Joseph started doing this thing where they were

2062
01:51:50.111 --> 01:51:55.090
meeting,
all comics were meeting over to Hooters casino Friday nights late.

2063
01:51:55.091 --> 01:51:56.530
So if you were working Vegas,

2064
01:51:57.090 --> 01:52:00.220
Hawaii and all the comedians from all the shows all over Vegas,

2065
01:52:00.221 --> 01:52:03.250
the word got out and you would go meet at Hooters in a zoo and they had,

2066
01:52:03.490 --> 01:52:06.850
you know,
but like deal and some wings up there,
but

2067
01:52:08.770 --> 01:52:11.850
they do it late night.
So 1130 you still doing it?
Yeah,

2068
01:52:11.890 --> 01:52:14.440
I think they do it every Friday.
Every Friday.
Every Friday.

2069
01:52:14.441 --> 01:52:16.390
And can we and comic comedy fans,

2070
01:52:16.391 --> 01:52:20.330
he didn't go and whoever wants to go like people then they have a deal on pub

2071
01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:21.173
the heights.

2072
01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:26.260
<v 3>I'm doing,
um,
Vegas during the Mandalay Bay theater with Joey Diaz,</v>

2073
01:52:26.261 --> 01:52:30.670
Ari Shaffir and I think Doug Benson is going to stop into and do a set that's a

2074
01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:34.780
June.
What is it,
18th or assumption?

2075
01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:39.910
I thought that it was July,
July 1st Charlie first until I first,
it's June 18th.

2076
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:42.690
Uh,
didn't even know where the fuck I'm going every week,
man.

2077
01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:45.690
How much do you know you're a no,
I show because

2078
01:52:46.590 --> 01:52:47.460
<v 5>I might be going to</v>

2079
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:52.880
Montreal and then I might be going on tour with Tosh.

2080
01:52:52.910 --> 01:52:56.660
I'm going to figure out that.
Oh,
nice.
And then,
uh,
for a little bit.

2081
01:52:56.690 --> 01:52:59.870
I think he's just split it up and then I start work on that show.

2082
01:52:59.871 --> 01:53:03.320
I started working,
I got an NBC show picked up.
Oh really?
What's that?

2083
01:53:03.321 --> 01:53:05.090
All about free agents with Hank area.

2084
01:53:05.730 --> 01:53:09.470
Me and Natasha Leggiero cause I love her and it's just like being able to see

2085
01:53:09.471 --> 01:53:10.580
her at work every day.
It's me,

2086
01:53:10.581 --> 01:53:15.240
her hand area is comedian moment in Dell and whatnot.
And B,

2087
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:17.310
c eight 31 says,
wow,

2088
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:21.230
maybe we'll be seeing each other at functions.
Like I said,

2089
01:53:21.231 --> 01:53:23.210
I don't know what's happening with the fear factor of thing.

2090
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:24.290
I don't know if I'm going to want them doing it.

2091
01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:27.900
July 1st is the date that we're at Vegas.
So maybe we'll have towards,

2092
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:31.690
we'll go to the suitors thing.
It depends on who's in town and also,
yeah,

2093
01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:35.640
you can see cool people.
Comedians are happy running into on the road.
You,

2094
01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:36.740
you don't have,

2095
01:53:36.741 --> 01:53:39.770
they'd be thrilled if he went by and he just stopped by for a second and say

2096
01:53:39.771 --> 01:53:43.130
hello to some people that would go.
But anyway,
it's nice to see fellow comics.

2097
01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:48.160
It's like God to soldiers passing on the battlefield to familiars head nun.

2098
01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:52.430
Yeah.
It's like very few people understand what a weird life it is.

2099
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:55.700
You know what a weird dance we would go through,
you know,
and,

2100
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:57.430
and we go through it together.
You know,

2101
01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:00.410
that's one of the more fascinating things about comedy is that you get to watch

2102
01:54:00.411 --> 01:54:04.280
a guy in the beginning and then watch them develop and grow over the years.

2103
01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:07.830
You know,
and I saw you for the first time is San Francisco.

2104
01:54:08.130 --> 01:54:12.590
I was at like 2000 I think.
So anyways,
I know exactly what it was.

2105
01:54:12.591 --> 01:54:15.790
Is your very first year of fear factor when you were in the floods are really,

2106
01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:20.000
what was that 2001 I think?
Yeah.
I don't remember.
And then we worked a bunch.

2107
01:54:20.001 --> 01:54:24.110
Shannon,
you brought a heady up to next time and that was the old cops.
Yup.

2108
01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:27.080
That was the cobs by the water and it was this tiny ass.

2109
01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:30.700
So 150 seats or something like that.
Yeah,
it was amazing.
Great little space.

2110
01:54:30.710 --> 01:54:31.220
So it's amazing.

2111
01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:35.090
It's like doing those fun clubs where it's on almost underground a little bit

2112
01:54:35.091 --> 01:54:39.200
where it's like DC Improv.
It's like that where it's underground.

2113
01:54:39.230 --> 01:54:40.610
It's just how it should be.

2114
01:54:40.850 --> 01:54:44.930
Comedy works in Denver is like that where you go under and it's a nice little

2115
01:54:44.931 --> 01:54:47.150
space.
That place is gorgeous.
Perfect.

2116
01:54:47.450 --> 01:54:51.170
But even that it's bigger than this San Francisco.
Oh it was tiny.
Yeah.

2117
01:54:51.770 --> 01:54:54.950
People tops and then anyway it was,
it wasn't even that many men.
Yeah,

2118
01:54:54.951 --> 01:54:57.650
that's he pack them in there.
Really.
You got 200 people in that room.

2119
01:54:57.651 --> 01:55:01.580
100 and 200 people tops and then he um,

2120
01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:03.860
match me up with you a bunch of times,
but you're right.

2121
01:55:03.861 --> 01:55:07.490
Like I'm such a different comic then.
I was then,

2122
01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:10.430
well you were fighting back then.
Oh thanks.
So I was still,
you know,

2123
01:55:10.431 --> 01:55:14.630
you have a lot of stuff to figure out and we still do it,
dude.
I still do.

2124
01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:18.320
I learned a lot slapping it all together and pulling it apart and looking at it

2125
01:55:18.321 --> 01:55:21.380
sideways.
And you never done it.
Never done with comedy man.

2126
01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:24.290
I went and opened up with completely new.

2127
01:55:24.291 --> 01:55:27.320
I thought it was like I'm going to put some stuff away just this last week I go

2128
01:55:27.321 --> 01:55:30.770
in,
I just,
I'm going to do 100% knew from the very beginning.

2129
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:32.833
Brutal.

2130
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:37.280
Probably should start with one that I know works and works.

2131
01:55:37.930 --> 01:55:40.480
Then let them build confidence and then I'll launch into the new and they'll

2132
01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:44.010
probably go better and sure enough,
yeah,
always a better idea to start with.

2133
01:55:44.011 --> 01:55:46.650
One that's you know is good,
especially when the,

2134
01:55:46.651 --> 01:55:49.110
the audience doesn't know what to expect.
You know,

2135
01:55:49.111 --> 01:55:50.690
they might not have ever seen you before.
No,

2136
01:55:50.691 --> 01:55:54.360
no one has and that's the other thing about the daily show in his TV shows a co

2137
01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:57.790
now people are going to actually coming out for me when it,

2138
01:55:57.810 --> 01:56:02.640
it'll be sure and Twitter to al magical m a.
D.
R.
I.
G.
A.
L.

2139
01:56:02.670 --> 01:56:06.480
Last time I was on the show juggle.
Yeah,
my Twitter and you did that.

2140
01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:10.770
It's going to blow up.
It really did even more.
What's your new show about?

2141
01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:16.100
The new show is Hank is area and it's actress Kathryn Hahn are now just recently

2142
01:56:16.321 --> 01:56:17.370
separated,
divorced.

2143
01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:20.970
Her husband died and he got divorced after 15 years and then he started hooking

2144
01:56:20.971 --> 01:56:25.590
up in the office.
So the free agents and I'm,
you know,
guy at work.

2145
01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:29.730
We,
have you ever had any problems working with actors?
Um,

2146
01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:34.140
a little bit here.
I've been in some pretty difficult situations.

2147
01:56:34.141 --> 01:56:36.330
You know what I think is,
and I can sum them all up without,

2148
01:56:36.630 --> 01:56:40.320
I've been pretty bad about naming names on some of these actors have had.

2149
01:56:40.321 --> 01:56:44.790
And so to come back and bite me in the ass,
it,
they,
all these guys,

2150
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:47.820
they make so much fucking money cause you know how much money are these?

2151
01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:50.160
I mean per week and acted,

2152
01:56:50.161 --> 01:56:52.950
it's been on TV for a long time.

2153
01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:57.150
It has got a quote could just go skyrocket.
So when you start on acting may,

2154
01:56:57.151 --> 01:56:58.770
let's see,
you get paid $20,000 a week,

2155
01:56:58.771 --> 01:57:01.410
which seems like just an incredible amount.
But then that quote,

2156
01:57:01.411 --> 01:57:03.660
as you get more and more into your seasons,

2157
01:57:03.661 --> 01:57:06.180
are you get job after job after job builds and builds.
And builds.

2158
01:57:06.181 --> 01:57:09.930
So here you had these spoiled brats that have had people catering to them

2159
01:57:09.931 --> 01:57:13.350
constantly.
I've got your Rogan,
Joe Rogan is going to be coming this way.
Okay,

2160
01:57:13.351 --> 01:57:14.850
I've got Joe and their head,

2161
01:57:14.851 --> 01:57:18.840
you know on headsets and there's food everywhere and everything's catered and

2162
01:57:18.841 --> 01:57:22.170
your makeup is getting done in seven weeks.
He's going,
are you good Joe?

2163
01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:24.360
How are you?
Good.
You know,
can I get you anything are here,

2164
01:57:24.361 --> 01:57:27.900
we get some pizzas coming in to treat you and your dog got tree like a god

2165
01:57:27.901 --> 01:57:28.231
constantly.

2166
01:57:28.231 --> 01:57:31.380
So there's people like a Charlie sheen or anything like that on the highest

2167
01:57:31.381 --> 01:57:35.700
level are getting treated incredibly well all the time.
And then they lose,

2168
01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:36.510
you know,

2169
01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:40.590
take for granted the fact that I was making in one week what my dad was making

2170
01:57:40.591 --> 01:57:42.990
in a year and a half at one point.

2171
01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:48.020
And if you haven't lived real life prior to going into all of this shit,

2172
01:57:48.301 --> 01:57:49.680
I think you lose that perspective.

2173
01:57:49.681 --> 01:57:53.100
So you wind up working with some real fucking assholes who are mean to the

2174
01:57:53.101 --> 01:57:58.101
makeup lady and say this soup is shit and can are going around in his defense.

2175
01:57:58.261 --> 01:58:00.830
I'll take trow sheen is over like that.
I think Charlie Sheen was all,

2176
01:58:00.831 --> 01:58:04.860
I just use it as a name of the people that are making an incredible amount of

2177
01:58:04.861 --> 01:58:09.500
money that and also,
um,
you know,
his quote was wider.

2178
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:13.680
He's getting $2 million an episode and as more than people making a lifetime,

2179
01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:16.650
well he was obviously,
he's obviously got some problems.

2180
01:58:16.990 --> 01:58:21.690
What I'm seeing at the highest level of TV work,
you make an incredible,

2181
01:58:21.691 --> 01:58:24.810
incredible moment money.
And even along the way,
most people,
you know,

2182
01:58:24.811 --> 01:58:26.340
they're just,
uh,
you know,

2183
01:58:26.341 --> 01:58:29.880
one person in an ensemble cast makes there make ridiculous amounts.

2184
01:58:30.530 --> 01:58:33.870
Average lottery shit.
Like,
so excited.
But if you haven't like,
uh,

2185
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:35.940
it's all the TV stuff.
Yeah.

2186
01:58:35.941 --> 01:58:38.760
You end up working with people that lose sight of that.
Just psychologically.

2187
01:58:38.761 --> 01:58:41.770
I think that thing that you were talking about how when everyone your ass,

2188
01:58:41.771 --> 01:58:42.040
it's just,

2189
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:45.790
<v 3>you get confused and you start thinking that somehow or another you deserve
that.</v>

2190
01:58:45.850 --> 01:58:50.560
I am great.
It's strange to watch of from the outside as well.
Um,

2191
01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:54.490
you know,
uh,
I just did a,
this Kevin James Movie,
uh,
were Kevin James [inaudible],

2192
01:58:54.491 --> 01:58:59.230
he's an MMA fighter called here comes the boom and I'm on the set with him.
Man.

2193
01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:03.700
Kevin's a great guy.
He's got a,
he's very down to earth.
Like he's not,

2194
01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:08.280
he doesn't have any,
what are you doing on your phone?
It's mine.
Somebody.

2195
01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:12.420
Anyway,
he's very down to earth.
He doesn't have any like,
uh,

2196
01:59:12.490 --> 01:59:14.380
problems with wanting to be the man,
you know,

2197
01:59:14.381 --> 01:59:17.530
he's like super friendly to everybody.
Just there to work,
get things done.

2198
01:59:17.770 --> 01:59:19.820
But everybody,
like when he's around,
yeah

2199
01:59:19.890 --> 01:59:23.460
<v 5>man,
they're like the king.
The king is here,
you know,
like they,
you know,</v>

2200
01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:28.170
like Kraft service people,
people around the setup.
Here it comes.
Here it comes.

2201
01:59:28.350 --> 01:59:33.060
I Kevin,
Hey Kevin.
I'm so my brother,
I think it was telling Ya,

2202
01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:37.350
um,
and people were act weird around.
Yeah.
And that's what it is.
Yeah.

2203
01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:40.520
<v 3>It's,
and then they start thinking that they deserve that.
Yeah.
I've,
I,</v>

2204
01:59:40.530 --> 01:59:43.770
that's one of the things that I loved about doing fear factor was that I didn't

2205
01:59:43.771 --> 01:59:47.460
have to do any work with actors anymore.
I was like,
oh great,

2206
01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:51.240
let me do this fucking thing by myself.
And not that it wasn't,
uh,

2207
01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:55.880
an incredibly talented group of people doing news radio.
But even that,
like just

2208
01:59:56.210 --> 01:59:59.390
<v 5>all the other personalities,
it can be difficult and people to,
again,</v>

2209
01:59:59.420 --> 02:00:00.620
to take it for,

2210
02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:04.770
that's the only explanation I have for anybody acting shitty is just a judge is

2211
02:00:04.771 --> 02:00:06.980
taking it for granted.
They're not forgetting.
Yeah.

2212
02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:08.840
They're delusional or they're crazy,

2213
02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:12.530
<v 3>which is a lot of people that get into it.
In the first place I was reading,
uh,</v>

2214
02:00:12.990 --> 02:00:15.510
how many people are bipolar?
There was some sort of a,

2215
02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:20.280
a number online of people that are bipolar.
So I just started looking up bipolar,

2216
02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:24.030
uh,
in,
uh,
on Google.
I did some Google,
bipolar search at funnel,

2217
02:00:24.031 --> 02:00:26.730
these fucking famous people that are bipolar who,
oh,

2218
02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:30.860
I don't even want to name names,
but as,
but it's just,
it's,
it's just like what,

2219
02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:34.850
what exactly does that mean?
You know,
and how fucked up our Ya,
you know,

2220
02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:36.390
what's going on out here.

2221
02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:40.980
And I think as far as like Hollywood and like the need to have that kind of

2222
02:00:40.981 --> 02:00:45.210
incredible amount of attention to need to be under a spotlight,
they need to be,

2223
02:00:45.211 --> 02:00:49.140
you know,
worshiped.
Everywhere you go,
there's a,
there's the,
what is that?

2224
02:00:49.170 --> 02:00:49.930
You know,

2225
02:00:49.930 --> 02:00:52.860
<v 5>it's another hilarious thing had Duncan said last night and he was saying has to</v>

2226
02:00:52.890 --> 02:00:56.560
take,
he goes,
why are we making excuses for everybody?
He's just an asshole.

2227
02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:00.370
He goes,
oh,
he has Asberger's he's butthole or no,
that guy's fucking asshole.

2228
02:01:00.610 --> 02:01:01.443
Like it was just,

2229
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:06.100
now we're trying to create a condition to make it okay for that guy to be asked.

2230
02:01:06.101 --> 02:01:09.560
Well,
you know,
he's bipolar,
right?
Well I think it's a real thing though.

2231
02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:14.560
Funny Joke.
Yeah.
It's very funny.
It's a funny joke,
but you know,

2232
02:01:14.561 --> 02:01:17.290
like Asperger's and autism and everything.
That's a funny,

2233
02:01:17.530 --> 02:01:20.020
I mean that's real shit.
It's,
um,

2234
02:01:20.050 --> 02:01:22.540
what does Asperger's son has autism and so

2235
02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:26.530
<v 3>really hard.
It's incredibly hard.
Like you see the like,
you know,
and,</v>

2236
02:01:26.531 --> 02:01:29.020
and the stuff,
the stuff that he has to deal with,
it's just,

2237
02:01:29.021 --> 02:01:31.810
she talks about it and it's just hard to wrap your head around how much more

2238
02:01:31.811 --> 02:01:34.380
difficult it is.
Then having a regular kid,
you know,

2239
02:01:34.381 --> 02:01:38.260
our kid that doesn't have any issues,
it's,
um,
I wonder what it is though,
man,

2240
02:01:38.261 --> 02:01:42.380
when you see these kids and there's a bunch of 'em online of different examples

2241
02:01:42.381 --> 02:01:47.360
of children who have some incredible ability as well as being artistic.

2242
02:01:47.770 --> 02:01:48.441
Like there's a boy,

2243
02:01:48.441 --> 02:01:51.740
we've talked about him before who can look out the window of a plane as he's

2244
02:01:51.741 --> 02:01:56.210
driving over a city and then he draws the city in scale.
Perfect.

2245
02:01:56.690 --> 02:01:57.860
Yeah,
it's amazing.

2246
02:01:58.370 --> 02:02:02.510
And he's got autism and there's all sorts of other kids that have autism and,

2247
02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:06.650
and they also are amazing at something,
you know?

2248
02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:08.540
I mean there's,
there's a bunch.

2249
02:02:08.541 --> 02:02:11.450
So people were trying to figure out what the fuck that is.
You know,

2250
02:02:11.451 --> 02:02:16.070
I mean wonder if that is eventually what human beings are going to be like.

2251
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:21.110
I wonder if the autistic super genius mind that allows that little child to draw

2252
02:02:21.111 --> 02:02:24.920
that image looking out the window at a city maybe that is a hint of what the

2253
02:02:24.921 --> 02:02:29.270
future human is going to be capable of is in comparison to us in comparison to

2254
02:02:29.300 --> 02:02:31.790
the monkeys that were our ancestors.
You know,

2255
02:02:31.791 --> 02:02:36.380
our ape ancestors that were flipping over cow turds looking for worms to eat

2256
02:02:36.650 --> 02:02:40.410
their mind and compare it to the capabilities of our mind is just like us be

2257
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.620
compared to that autistic kid.
I mean it's like it could be that the,
you know,

2258
02:02:45.621 --> 02:02:50.330
what we're seeing is this one weird thing happens in this child's mind and all

2259
02:02:50.331 --> 02:02:53.780
the other stuff gets fucked up and frazzled because one side is like so much

2260
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:58.250
more powerful and one area has like so much more ability than the rest of the

2261
02:02:58.251 --> 02:03:00.980
mind that it's just not quite ready yet.
But it's like some,

2262
02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:04.160
some early versions of this new future,

2263
02:03:04.190 --> 02:03:08.030
incredible superhuman that were,
were eventually becoming,

2264
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:09.783
<v 5>yeah.
It's,</v>

2265
02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:14.410
it's difficult to see anybody with autism because there's all different levels.

2266
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:18.100
Sure.
Some of them are just completely in trouble.
That's another thing where I,

2267
02:03:18.101 --> 02:03:19.970
you're talking about seeing a kid that was,
you know,

2268
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:22.120
in the dumpster or anything like vandalism.
No.
Tell kids.

2269
02:03:22.250 --> 02:03:26.470
Some parents having to deal with a kid with autism or any severe handicap in any

2270
02:03:26.471 --> 02:03:30.790
sort of way.
It just,
yeah,
it does because they also feel for the parent too.

2271
02:03:30.791 --> 02:03:35.110
And it's like,
and the kid,
you know,
it was just completely sweet,
but just,
it's,

2272
02:03:35.111 --> 02:03:39.400
um,
it's tough and it must be difficult to see.
Also,
I mean,

2273
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:41.950
and I'm just assuming,
and I've never talked to anybody about it,

2274
02:03:41.951 --> 02:03:44.810
but it's kind of be hard to see you holding hands,
you know,

2275
02:03:44.830 --> 02:03:47.230
with your daughter and me playing with my son wrestling.

2276
02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:49.780
And then when you know their kid,

2277
02:03:49.781 --> 02:03:53.500
there's a kid that walks around our block and there's any,
he came up,

2278
02:03:53.501 --> 02:03:58.030
me and my son were playing catch in the front playing football and this kid,

2279
02:03:58.031 --> 02:04:00.970
you know,
went up to the ball and I go,
hey,
you want to,

2280
02:04:00.971 --> 02:04:04.750
you want to catch the ball?
And Dad said,
yeah,
he can't.
He can't hear you man.

2281
02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:10.960
And a dad was walking like 10 paces behind his kid and I go,
you want to try it?

2282
02:04:11.050 --> 02:04:11.381
You know?

2283
02:04:11.381 --> 02:04:15.130
And I gave him the ball and then he just should have dropped it and walked away.

2284
02:04:15.610 --> 02:04:19.020
And my son goes,
dad,
what's going on?
You know?
And I had explained apple,

2285
02:04:19.050 --> 02:04:23.830
just like I watched this guy walking 10 paces behind his kid with his backpack.

2286
02:04:23.831 --> 02:04:27.580
Just suck it up and dealing with it.
And it was just fucking brutal.

2287
02:04:27.581 --> 02:04:30.910
Like in here I am,
I can go and go deep.
Okay,

2288
02:04:30.911 --> 02:04:35.650
blue 42 all right,
cut at the car.
I want you to take a left and he's,

2289
02:04:35.651 --> 02:04:38.070
you know,
and I'm hitting my son,
my son's putting

2290
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:40.890
<v 0>his hands up in the air and celebrating.
And here,</v>

2291
02:04:40.891 --> 02:04:43.920
this guy's talking bill never have any of that.
Wow.

2292
02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:48.060
And I feel horrible about the chip [inaudible] I can't,
I don't know what it is,

2293
02:04:48.061 --> 02:04:50.850
why I was always pretty,
pretty big softy before.
But it was just,

2294
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.740
the kids really ruined everything.

2295
02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:56.280
I was always a big softie for kids just because I remember being a kid and being

2296
02:04:56.281 --> 02:04:57.480
fucked up and confused.

2297
02:04:57.510 --> 02:05:02.250
So when I see kids that are fucked up today and it kills me,
you know,
it's um,

2298
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:06.570
and having kids yourself just totally takes that to another level.

2299
02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:10.590
And you have this little human being you're responsible for raising and talking

2300
02:05:10.591 --> 02:05:13.880
to and kind of going through life with that all,

2301
02:05:13.890 --> 02:05:15.340
it takes everything to another level.
No,

2302
02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:19.050
and it's helped me to sort of make better choices as well.

2303
02:05:19.051 --> 02:05:22.020
Like I always think about then what I would tell them,
you know?

2304
02:05:22.021 --> 02:05:24.750
And if you're having too many drinks,
getting in a car and shit like that,

2305
02:05:24.751 --> 02:05:27.150
it's like you got it.
What would you tell your kid to do?
You know?

2306
02:05:27.151 --> 02:05:29.640
And it's like if they had a camera looking in,

2307
02:05:29.730 --> 02:05:34.230
maybe you should start with that passion in your future child.

2308
02:05:34.231 --> 02:05:35.520
It's going to be able to see everything.

2309
02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:37.860
Like are you ever going to have kids wine,

2310
02:05:38.890 --> 02:05:42.640
<v 4>uh,
thought about it at all?
I mean,
how do you want to ruin the world?</v>

2311
02:05:44.170 --> 02:05:47.950
Well,
my,
my whole thing with the kids is I can barely support myself,
you know,

2312
02:05:47.951 --> 02:05:50.880
so I don't think I need to bring a kid into that either right now.

2313
02:05:50.980 --> 02:05:52.540
But I'm just saying at some point in your life,

2314
02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:56.620
you never thought you were going to,
because I remember we talked about this,

2315
02:05:56.621 --> 02:05:58.930
cause I always had kids when we many years ago.
Yeah.

2316
02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:02.120
<v 0>And we are,
well,
when I first met you,</v>

2317
02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:05.930
your thing that you were always talking about was that you felt like you had a

2318
02:06:05.931 --> 02:06:10.820
team,
you know,
your,
your team,
which I kind of understand that,
but my,

2319
02:06:10.850 --> 02:06:12.740
my,
my issue was always,

2320
02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:17.830
especially then I was always worried about having to be responsible for somebody

2321
02:06:18.111 --> 02:06:18.710
else.

2322
02:06:18.710 --> 02:06:22.910
I was always worried about having to take care of somebody else and having to
uh,

2323
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:27.880
to uh,
succeed because I need to,
to keep them pure.
Responsible.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2324
02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:32.210
Missouri,
I mean,
especially,
you know,
15 years ago,
whatever,
it was very,

2325
02:06:32.270 --> 02:06:33.980
very much like that.
Like in my mind,

2326
02:06:33.981 --> 02:06:38.981
that was that having a child was the ultimate like parachute that would pull you

2327
02:06:39.381 --> 02:06:42.140
back.
Like there was no way you would escape it.
You know,
that I would,

2328
02:06:42.141 --> 02:06:44.820
there's no way I'll be able to do what I wanted to do if I had a child.

2329
02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:49.580
Very true.
There's,
it's a much harder,
like I go to do some of these sets,

2330
02:06:49.620 --> 02:06:51.230
you know what,
I'm fucking exhausted.

2331
02:06:51.260 --> 02:06:55.890
Like I really am like in terms of handicapping me,
I am severely handicap.

2332
02:06:56.090 --> 02:06:57.230
It requires a lot of time.

2333
02:06:57.231 --> 02:07:01.550
But what you get out of it as your unbelieving come such a different human
being.

2334
02:07:01.970 --> 02:07:06.080
You know what I said?
You know,
and I sub called someone country,

2335
02:07:06.110 --> 02:07:10.280
it would have been way worse 10 years ago.
Jesus Christ,
you know,

2336
02:07:10.281 --> 02:07:12.990
I would have said something horrible.
Oh yeah.
You know,
I would've,

2337
02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:17.590
I would've been so,
so much different in my,
I look at everybody now,

2338
02:07:17.591 --> 02:07:20.090
I swear to God,
and I've talked about this before,
but it is true.

2339
02:07:20.330 --> 02:07:24.140
I look at everybody as a baby that grew up,
everybody,

2340
02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:25.460
when I run into people,

2341
02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:28.460
when I watched that crazy lady who killed her kid in Florida,

2342
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:32.690
no matter who I look at it on television,
when beat me people in real life,

2343
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:36.250
because I've seen babies become little people.

2344
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:39.250
<v 3>And then those little people start talking to you and having conversations to</v>

2345
02:07:39.251 --> 02:07:42.850
you and you see their personality blossom.
Whenever I see somebody,

2346
02:07:42.851 --> 02:07:46.510
whether they're in they're kind or whether they're douchebags,
I always think,

2347
02:07:46.511 --> 02:07:48.430
what was this person like when they were a baby?

2348
02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:53.760
Changed my whole way of assessing human beings instead of assessing them as this

2349
02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:58.000
guy that I'm meeting that's Super Douchey and 30 and he,

2350
02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:02.500
he's squeezing my hand when he's shaking it and he keeps touching my neck and

2351
02:08:02.501 --> 02:08:05.920
come on,
stop being weird.
And instead of seeing that,
I'm like,

2352
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:11.310
look at this poor baby that grew up with some fucked up dad who was probably

2353
02:08:11.711 --> 02:08:15.700
ultra douchey.
And his mom probably used to scream at them and you know,

2354
02:08:15.730 --> 02:08:19.020
they probably smoked when he was in the womb and then,
you know,
I'm,

2355
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:22.000
I'm seeing them now and he's just a bundle of nerves and,

2356
02:08:22.001 --> 02:08:26.350
and insecurities and bullshit.
You know,
I,
I don't see people anymore.

2357
02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:31.320
I see people,
but I see a process.
It's weird.
I mean I see the,

2358
02:08:31.330 --> 02:08:36.010
I literally,
I just start going back.
I see someone,
I mean I'm,
this is Bob Bob.

2359
02:08:36.011 --> 02:08:39.280
This is Joe Rogan.
Hi Bob.
Nice to meet Ya.
Two,
two,
two,
two,
two,
two,
two.

2360
02:08:39.281 --> 02:08:41.860
What happened to Bob?
Why is you wearing that shirt?

2361
02:08:42.210 --> 02:08:45.690
<v 0>Why is he touching my neck?
Guys like to touch you.</v>

2362
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:49.050
Especially like some guys were like into UFC.
They want to fucking grab you.

2363
02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:53.150
Oh really?
Fill you up
sometimes guys.

2364
02:08:53.790 --> 02:08:56.480
Who had you been grappled to get an over hook on me?
I'm like,
Hey,

2365
02:08:56.481 --> 02:09:01.170
settle down while we were wrestling.
It's funny.
It's weird.
Yeah.

2366
02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:05.130
I don't know.
For the most part,
people are Super Nice.
You know what the thing,

2367
02:09:05.131 --> 02:09:07.740
one of the things about the,
the Nma crowd,

2368
02:09:07.890 --> 02:09:10.300
you would think there's just way more douche bags and they are the douchebags

2369
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:11.730
kind of get outed.
And there's some,

2370
02:09:12.090 --> 02:09:15.390
there's some peripheral ones that do venture in and out of the business.

2371
02:09:15.391 --> 02:09:18.960
But as far as like a lot of the people you run into pretty fucking cool.

2372
02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:21.720
Like as far as like the,
there's the sheer numbers of you ever,
ever,

2373
02:09:21.721 --> 02:09:25.320
ever taken you until you FCL I went to that one in Vegas was me and Tivo.

2374
02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:29.870
Marilyn t and that's right.
Who went?
It was me.
And

2375
02:09:32.170 --> 02:09:34.900
what's,
um,
Ari now?

2376
02:09:34.901 --> 02:09:39.900
I only was Joey.
That Shania Twain?
No,
no,
no,
no.
Either way.

2377
02:09:39.901 --> 02:09:42.930
Who fought?
Do you remember the UFC?

2378
02:09:42.931 --> 02:09:46.220
That TV show where they had the ultimate fighter?
The finals at the prom.

2379
02:09:46.270 --> 02:09:50.970
So we went to of those scare crow guy knocked out the cat.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2380
02:09:50.971 --> 02:09:55.290
Pablo Garza,
he's a bad motherfucker.
I want to do broke his hand.
Right.

2381
02:09:55.291 --> 02:09:59.130
He just flying triangled somebody in that was amazing.
And Montreal,
he's a,

2382
02:09:59.131 --> 02:10:01.940
he's a beast.
Our Kid,
I liked that.
What was the fight over the weekend?

2383
02:10:01.950 --> 02:10:04.940
Then some guy broke his hand.
Did I read that correctly?
That uh,

2384
02:10:05.190 --> 02:10:10.190
after the second round he broke his hand and he had to stop the fight.

2385
02:10:11.190 --> 02:10:14.520
No,
you talking about boxing?
Christy boxing,
Christy Martin,

2386
02:10:14.521 --> 02:10:18.150
that old woman that used to box back in the day when Mike Tyson was fighting,

2387
02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:20.580
she would find on the undercard norm that the coal miner's daughter,

2388
02:10:20.910 --> 02:10:23.210
well she's an old lady now,
she still fights.
She's still,

2389
02:10:23.250 --> 02:10:26.640
she just start fighting again and her husband tried to kill her last year.

2390
02:10:26.641 --> 02:10:28.710
He shot her and stabbed her.

2391
02:10:29.410 --> 02:10:32.520
So I mean this bitch recovered from that bit.
I shouldn't say this,

2392
02:10:32.521 --> 02:10:36.350
this fine late once this client to bitch.
I say with all due respect,

2393
02:10:36.410 --> 02:10:39.710
it's just the way I talk.
I apologize.
It's just the way I talk.

2394
02:10:39.711 --> 02:10:43.220
When you get shot and stabbed and you come back from it,
you are a bitch mother.

2395
02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:49.520
And She was light in this girl up and she dropped the girl and then she hit her

2396
02:10:49.521 --> 02:10:52.610
with a combination and broke her hand.
Like,
you could see her wince,
like,

2397
02:10:52.611 --> 02:10:56.150
and she hit her with it again and then turn and screen and they pull their glow

2398
02:10:56.151 --> 02:10:59.630
over.
Her hand was just a mouthful and it was horrible.
Look,
and it was shattered.

2399
02:10:59.900 --> 02:11:02.940
I mean,
it was so bad she couldn't,
she couldn't possibly go on Rye.

2400
02:11:03.070 --> 02:11:08.070
A favorite broke bolt is fucking hands in the second round of a five round war

2401
02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:13.640
that he had with Mike Brown,
broke bolt his fucking hands.
So for five rounds,

2402
02:11:13.730 --> 02:11:17.660
he's trying to grapple and punch with crunchy bones.

2403
02:11:17.690 --> 02:11:21.650
They're like snapping and moving inside of his hand and he's got an elbow.

2404
02:11:21.651 --> 02:11:25.640
The dude,
because he can't punch them anymore,
you know,
the whole fucking foot.

2405
02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:30.390
But meanwhile,
he never quit.
I mean,
he hunted me for fucking rounds.
Yeah,

2406
02:11:30.391 --> 02:11:32.960
there's a,
he broke his hand in his last fight too.

2407
02:11:32.990 --> 02:11:35.630
He had to go through a surgery court.
Mcgowan broke his hand.

2408
02:11:36.430 --> 02:11:39.960
I was saying court mechanic,
but there's a,

2409
02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:42.410
there's a fighter named Corby coun.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

2410
02:11:42.411 --> 02:11:44.300
He won the ultimate fighter.
What is his last name?
Hold on.

2411
02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:47.930
<v 4>UFC just announced today a that they have a new,
uh,</v>

2412
02:11:48.140 --> 02:11:51.620
Xbox channel where you can bet against your friends on it and you can like

2413
02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:56.640
gamble on the UFC channel and watch replays and kind of like fantasy baseball I

2414
02:11:58.581 --> 02:12:00.050
think,
but mixed with the UFC

2415
02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:03.650
<v 0>man.
It's just a matter of time.
Yeah,
of course.
That's going to be popular,
dude.</v>

2416
02:12:03.651 --> 02:12:05.930
I'm done.
Yes.
Got It confused with somebody else,

2417
02:12:08.710 --> 02:12:11.660
you know,
Corey and Google on it.
Um,

2418
02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:15.980
so that's what I ended up going with court McGee,
court McGee,
Jesus Christ.

2419
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:20.610
Anytime you get a Mugga Mugga growing up in Boston,
so many middleware,

2420
02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:23.560
so many McGough McGilvery macgyver,
but if we're going to eat,

2421
02:12:23.630 --> 02:12:26.720
they all blur the blur together.
Yeah.
What is it about the name court?

2422
02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:30.140
Because there's a court Macola,
well,
Colt Mccoy,
he's the quarterback.

2423
02:12:30.141 --> 02:12:35.141
There's a quarterback that to the court and Mick goes together for some odd

2424
02:12:35.631 --> 02:12:36.770
reason.
Anyway,

2425
02:12:36.771 --> 02:12:39.770
we sat and we watched and that was one of the first times I'd ever seen anything

2426
02:12:39.771 --> 02:12:43.400
USC.
And then t was down on the floor dressed up.

2427
02:12:44.110 --> 02:12:48.230
I was flying just dumb as what he just dressed up.
He had his Nice Dad's angst.

2428
02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:52.760
Studley yeah.
On a size on the floor,
like a manager who's texting me.

2429
02:12:52.761 --> 02:12:57.610
It's like rampage is behind me.
That's how good the seats.

2430
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.140
Yeah.
That's one of the coolest things about,
uh,

2431
02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:04.910
having the Gig of the UFC has been able to get people those suits.
It's fun,
man.

2432
02:13:04.911 --> 02:13:07.820
Being there live and watching it live is a very strange thing,
isn't it?

2433
02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:10.710
It's so people who haven't seen a live fight,
um,

2434
02:13:10.730 --> 02:13:13.010
you can get commentary where you can listen,

2435
02:13:13.011 --> 02:13:17.660
you can get a little radio and you plug it into your ear and you can listen to

2436
02:13:17.661 --> 02:13:20.660
the commentary wall,
the fights going on.
A lot of people like that.

2437
02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:25.670
But there's something about hearing the impact in real life as opposed to

2438
02:13:25.671 --> 02:13:29.900
through speakers.
But you only get that close.
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2439
02:13:30.110 --> 02:13:32.140
That's why though,
but even if you're,
you're

2440
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:33.900
<v 3>not that far away.
You know,</v>

2441
02:13:33.901 --> 02:13:37.020
you're like first tier and first tier like Mandalay Bay,

2442
02:13:37.230 --> 02:13:39.600
which is like not on the worth of it's way better.

2443
02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:42.750
First Year is actually better because you can,
like,
you look down,

2444
02:13:42.751 --> 02:13:45.360
you have a better view.
You kind of handicaps vantage point,

2445
02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:46.950
but you want to hear the impact.

2446
02:13:47.050 --> 02:13:50.560
<v 2>And what about,
uh,
any smack talk?
Think what goes on.</v>

2447
02:13:50.630 --> 02:13:55.310
<v 3>Tough to hear.
It's tough for me to hear while I'm right there.
I like Nick Diaz.</v>

2448
02:13:55.311 --> 02:13:58.070
Can,
you can,
uh,
he could smack talking.
You can hear what he's saying.

2449
02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:01.690
Nick Diaz once who's fighting Robbie Lawler.
And,
uh,

2450
02:14:01.730 --> 02:14:03.860
Robbie Lawler was a huge favorite going into this fight.

2451
02:14:03.861 --> 02:14:06.110
Robbie Lawler was knocking people out and he's a beast,
you know,

2452
02:14:06.410 --> 02:14:08.780
still to this day is a beast.
So,
uh,

2453
02:14:08.810 --> 02:14:13.810
Nick Diaz gets into the cage and just starts going stocked and mother Fucker

2454
02:14:14.090 --> 02:14:14.521
Stockton.
Oh,

2455
02:14:14.521 --> 02:14:18.500
she's like talking to two oh nine and Stockton and he's pacing back and forth.

2456
02:14:18.501 --> 02:14:21.260
He goes,
Stockton motherfucker.
And he was dead serious.

2457
02:14:21.710 --> 02:14:23.570
He was dead serious and he could see Robbie Lawler.

2458
02:14:23.810 --> 02:14:27.380
<v 2>No,
about Stockton.
Stockton is near Modesto,
California.</v>

2459
02:14:27.410 --> 02:14:31.760
And it's walking in place where that's actually from the joke that I have where

2460
02:14:31.761 --> 02:14:35.330
I got chased out over a fence and I ran to my car with my jacket over my head.

2461
02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:39.750
Stockton Fuck Two oh nine would be the same.
Like Burbank.
You man,

2462
02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:44.090
well stocked in when somebody,
if somebody looked at me and said Stockton Wolf,

2463
02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:48.830
I'd go,
okay,
all right.
You win whatever you want.

2464
02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:52.360
Kilowatt hours.
Yeah.
Calabasas.

2465
02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:58.150
<v 3>Yeah,
it's got all its,
there's a lot of crime.</v>

2466
02:14:58.230 --> 02:15:02.790
<v 2>I think it leads also,
uh,
American,
maybe a foreclosed homes,
you know,</v>

2467
02:15:02.791 --> 02:15:04.550
it's not a good area.
It's like

2468
02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:09.280
<v 3>it was the second highest crime rate in California or you go right after
Oakland.</v>

2469
02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:13.570
Oakland is the highest and then Stockton is number two.

2470
02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:15.580
And it leads the country.

2471
02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:19.030
Or at least the state rather in home repossession.
Yes.

2472
02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:23.200
It's tough action man.
Yeah.
But when he went in,

2473
02:15:23.201 --> 02:15:26.230
when Nick Diaz says stocked in to something behind that,

2474
02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:29.630
there's something behind that.
He's,
he's being very serious.

2475
02:15:29.631 --> 02:15:33.420
So that's what he was saying.
He was talking shit to him when he fights guys.

2476
02:15:33.421 --> 02:15:35.650
He calls them bitch all the time.
What bitch?
What bitch?

2477
02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:38.390
This bitch like you'll hit guys and talk shit to him.

2478
02:15:38.391 --> 02:15:40.750
And he was talking shit to Robbie Lawler the whole time they fought.

2479
02:15:41.260 --> 02:15:43.570
He was talking shit to him and Robbie Lawler didn't talk shit back.

2480
02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:45.940
I thought he would,
you know,
but I think,

2481
02:15:45.970 --> 02:15:50.020
I think that guy really flusters a lot of people with,
with his shit talking,

2482
02:15:50.290 --> 02:15:52.750
you know like when,
when he was fighting Frank Shamrock,

2483
02:15:52.751 --> 02:15:54.640
frank shamrock was said it best.
He was like,
I can't,

2484
02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:58.270
like he was doing it and he can't believe he's doing it while he's doing it.

2485
02:15:58.271 --> 02:16:01.320
Like is this guy really talking as much shit to me because nobody talks to them.

2486
02:16:02.410 --> 02:16:06.250
So that Guy Sake what?
Nobody talks shit to me and this guy talking shit to me.

2487
02:16:06.430 --> 02:16:09.610
He's a fascinating cat man because he does fucking triathlons.

2488
02:16:09.730 --> 02:16:14.110
Like he's really into doing like high endurance shit and he gets super baked and

2489
02:16:14.111 --> 02:16:19.111
then rides his bike and swims and runs his endurance is ridiculous.

2490
02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:21.640
He's got like iron man triathlon and Durrance.

2491
02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:23.950
That's why one of the reasons why he fucks guys up,

2492
02:16:23.951 --> 02:16:26.440
he just puts a pace on them that they can't keep up with him.

2493
02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:28.180
It's just like he's running with them.

2494
02:16:28.330 --> 02:16:30.820
He just makes run at his pace and then before you know it,

2495
02:16:30.821 --> 02:16:33.440
they're wilting and he's beating the fuck out of him.
You know,

2496
02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:35.590
he does that to everybody.
Man Did it to Paul Daley.

2497
02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:37.780
He's going to fight Nick Diaz now,
or excuse me,

2498
02:16:37.781 --> 02:16:40.780
he's going to fight George St Pierre now they're going to fight in October and

2499
02:16:41.310 --> 02:16:44.500
I'm sure it'll talk.
She's going to talk mad shit.
It's gonna be awesome.

2500
02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:48.250
And George is such a polite guy that it's going to be,
you know,

2501
02:16:48.251 --> 02:16:50.710
such an interesting contrast in styles.

2502
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:55.000
She's going to kill GSP is going to,
can you think so?

2503
02:16:57.700 --> 02:16:59.980
That's an easy one.
Oh,
you can't say that.

2504
02:16:59.981 --> 02:17:01.690
You don't know what you're talking about.
Listen,

2505
02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:04.350
when was the last time you saw Nick Diaz fight?
I haven't.
Okay.

2506
02:17:04.590 --> 02:17:06.130
You got to shut the fuck up.
That's ridiculous.

2507
02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:10.540
That's just given some crazy it and how much one of the 20 bucks.

2508
02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:13.960
I bet that it's a good fight.
That's what I bet.
I don't want to pick a winner,

2509
02:17:14.020 --> 02:17:15.310
but I think it's going to be a good fight.

2510
02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:18.460
It's all about whether or not nick and work off of his back because I don't

2511
02:17:18.461 --> 02:17:20.050
think George is going to want to stand up with nick.

2512
02:17:20.051 --> 02:17:24.250
Nick's got some serious fucking hands and he puts himself in danger to land

2513
02:17:24.251 --> 02:17:29.251
shots and he does some stuff that is just really atypical of a guy's trying to

2514
02:17:30.071 --> 02:17:31.870
play it safe and guys that are like champions.

2515
02:17:32.170 --> 02:17:35.830
Like a lot of times guys get to a certain point and they fight to win,

2516
02:17:35.950 --> 02:17:39.850
but when they can win and coast and not put themselves in danger,

2517
02:17:39.851 --> 02:17:43.620
they will sometimes,
you know,
this is GSP or talking GSPs done.

2518
02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:47.440
You're not listening to me.
Does that GSP does that.

2519
02:17:47.470 --> 02:17:49.510
Nick Diaz does not do that.
Now listen to me.

2520
02:17:49.770 --> 02:17:52.900
I think they know when Nick Diaz just fought his last fight,

2521
02:17:52.901 --> 02:17:55.450
he fought a serious fucking dangerous striker.
This guy,

2522
02:17:55.451 --> 02:18:00.240
Paul Daley and Paul Daley,
it does not have a good Jujitsu game.
Paul Daley is,

2523
02:18:00.241 --> 02:18:03.970
his defense is okay.
It's pretty good,
but his standup is wicked.

2524
02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:08.710
Nick Diaz went after him,
only would stand up,
didn't even try to submit him,

2525
02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:10.030
didn't try to take him down,

2526
02:18:10.090 --> 02:18:13.450
just banged it out with them and dragged them into deep water and then knocked

2527
02:18:13.451 --> 02:18:16.660
him out.
And it was incredible.
And it was,
it was in the way he did.

2528
02:18:16.661 --> 02:18:20.020
It was a way that George would never do it.
He threw himself into the fire,

2529
02:18:20.140 --> 02:18:21.700
even got clipped and knock down.

2530
02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:23.800
He's not supposed to be like a striking with this guy.

2531
02:18:23.801 --> 02:18:27.640
This guy is like one of the best strikers in the sport and he struck with him.

2532
02:18:27.641 --> 02:18:31.300
He hung in there with him and he'd beat him down and he's just,
he's a beast,
man.

2533
02:18:31.301 --> 02:18:35.650
You can not count out Nick Diaz.
So don't say that.
I'll see what I want.

2534
02:18:36.190 --> 02:18:39.850
You're being silly though.
I'm just trying to build up the fight.
Are you really?

2535
02:18:39.851 --> 02:18:41.260
That's what you're doing.
You're working for the company now.

2536
02:18:41.470 --> 02:18:43.660
You're the anti hype guy either behind the same time.

2537
02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:45.340
I don't like it when people say,

2538
02:18:45.341 --> 02:18:47.260
this guy's going to win and that's guy's going to win.

2539
02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:48.970
You know why I don't like it?
Cause you don't know.

2540
02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:51.560
<v 4>Yeah.
You know,
the only reason I say it's man,
GSP,</v>

2541
02:18:51.590 --> 02:18:54.830
there's only a couple of guys that I just would never bet against guys.
I mean,

2542
02:18:54.831 --> 02:18:57.650
the only thing that would ever ruined GSP in my opinion,
would be a woman.

2543
02:18:58.180 --> 02:19:00.300
<v 3>It's a good call.
Love GSPS a fucking beast.</v>

2544
02:19:00.330 --> 02:19:05.010
GSP is an amazing fighter and he's very smart and he's got great wrestling.

2545
02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:05.281
You know,

2546
02:19:05.281 --> 02:19:09.240
the key to GSP success is that he's always able to take guys down if he wants

2547
02:19:09.241 --> 02:19:12.870
him to.
His wrestling is fucking solid as shit.
And because of that,

2548
02:19:12.871 --> 02:19:15.240
because he's able to,
could dictate where the fight goes,

2549
02:19:15.450 --> 02:19:18.470
he's always got this advantage of being able to make the call,
you know,

2550
02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:22.230
so very few guys can stop him from taking them down and he's so hard to take

2551
02:19:22.231 --> 02:19:26.970
down himself.
Phikeia talk now.
Sorry,
I just saw it.
Like I said,

2552
02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:30.650
first one I was extremely impressed when I went out to,
when I was in Vegas.

2553
02:19:30.770 --> 02:19:32.390
It was,
uh,
there was incredible,
well,

2554
02:19:32.391 --> 02:19:35.660
George Saint Pierre is a perfect example of why the sport is so atypical because

2555
02:19:35.661 --> 02:19:38.690
as nick,
Nick Diaz is the Shit talker and Nick Diaz is the guy,

2556
02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:42.710
George Saint Pierre is one of the best pound for pound fighters on the planet.

2557
02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:44.630
And he couldn't be a nicer guy.

2558
02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:49.660
He's so friendly and so humble and so down to earth and so genuine.

2559
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:53.840
He's like a really nice guy and he's a very intelligent,
you know,
it's,

2560
02:19:53.841 --> 02:19:57.670
it's very unusual.
If I was going to have a man crush,
I might have to have it.

2561
02:19:57.710 --> 02:20:00.490
Yeah.
He's a handsome bastard.
He's a fucking superhero.

2562
02:20:00.530 --> 02:20:04.340
If you had to sleep with one UFC fighter ob GSBI but a smaller guy who could be

2563
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:08.630
the top.
I would want to dictate when the butt fucking happens.

2564
02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:12.830
It's funny,
you get some Bantam weight with a shitty work ethic.
I don't know.

2565
02:20:12.831 --> 02:20:17.600
A lot of the CSPS being my boyfriend,
you know,

2566
02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:22.460
I'll take some,
some lady,
boy,
Thailand,
dude,
decent leg kick,

2567
02:20:22.461 --> 02:20:25.220
nice little Asian boy.
Nothing that's going to really fucking hurt you.

2568
02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:30.320
Gotta be careful.
But uh,
you know,
it's just such a contrast in style.
You know,

2569
02:20:30.350 --> 02:20:34.430
he's a,
the most of these guys who we think of champions,

2570
02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:36.530
you think of champion fighter.
Just think of like real rough,

2571
02:20:36.531 --> 02:20:40.820
like Mike Tyson type characters.
You know,
like when Mike Tyson was the champion,

2572
02:20:40.970 --> 02:20:43.430
he was everybody's worst nightmare.

2573
02:20:43.580 --> 02:20:48.410
This kid from this terrible ghetto home that will punch you in a street fight

2574
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:51.280
that will rape you,
have you're alone in a hotel with them.
You know,
he's,

2575
02:20:51.281 --> 02:20:52.520
he's a fucking savage.

2576
02:20:52.521 --> 02:20:56.630
Should just go after you and he might be one of the very best heavyweight

2577
02:20:56.631 --> 02:20:59.780
fighters in history when he was in his prime.
I mean,

2578
02:20:59.781 --> 02:21:01.370
he didn't get to fight Joe Lewis.

2579
02:21:01.371 --> 02:21:04.460
He didn't get to fight Muhammad Ali when they were in their prime.
But God damn,

2580
02:21:04.461 --> 02:21:07.310
how exciting would that have been?
How exciting would have been Tyson,

2581
02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:10.010
the Tyson that fought Spinks that Tyson in his prime.

2582
02:21:10.011 --> 02:21:14.270
It was just a destroyer going against a guy like Muhammad Ali and people say,
Oh,

2583
02:21:14.330 --> 02:21:17.180
Muhammad Ali would have killed him.
Who the fuck knows you don't know?

2584
02:21:17.181 --> 02:21:21.140
You don't know.
Relate that stuff.
Just like they simulate Collagen is nonsense.

2585
02:21:21.141 --> 02:21:24.200
They did it with Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali and he had rocky Marciano

2586
02:21:24.201 --> 02:21:26.750
knocking Muhammad Ali out.
I'm going to Hameed Ali was like,

2587
02:21:26.751 --> 02:21:27.950
whoever knocked me out.

2588
02:21:28.100 --> 02:21:31.550
How is this hundred and 85 pound man going to knock me out who haven't knocked

2589
02:21:31.551 --> 02:21:33.490
me out before?
So they had this,

2590
02:21:33.491 --> 02:21:36.680
this silly computer thing that did this video games that do it,

2591
02:21:36.681 --> 02:21:39.260
but me on Muhammad Ali was like a legit heavyweight too.

2592
02:21:39.290 --> 02:21:41.390
Like the Rocky Marciano era.

2593
02:21:41.540 --> 02:21:46.120
People were really small market Marciano was smaller than me,
you know,

2594
02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:47.480
he might've been like a little taller,

2595
02:21:47.481 --> 02:21:52.100
he was like five 10 but he weighed 180 385 pounds.

2596
02:21:52.330 --> 02:21:52.670
I mean,

2597
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:55.700
you see basketball footage and it's the peach basket and guys are passing it

2598
02:21:55.701 --> 02:21:56.560
around like white guy.

2599
02:21:56.561 --> 02:21:59.060
I don't want to say small to me is actually you actually be bigger than me

2600
02:21:59.061 --> 02:22:02.450
because he wasn't like lean and you know,
and,
and fit for 185 pounds,

2601
02:22:02.451 --> 02:22:04.790
whatever the fuck he was.
But when you think of a heavyweight,

2602
02:22:04.791 --> 02:22:08.600
you don't think of anyone even remotely close to what I way you think of a guy

2603
02:22:08.601 --> 02:22:11.750
like Lennox Lewis.
You know,
that's a fucking heavyweight today.
You know,

2604
02:22:11.751 --> 02:22:14.870
and Rocky Marciano.
It wasn't that kind of a heavy weight.
He was a small guy.

2605
02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:18.140
He just was super fucking strong,
you know,

2606
02:22:18.141 --> 02:22:23.141
Italian peasant genes that could just fucking smash you and just tough his take

2607
02:22:23.361 --> 02:22:26.790
shots and come at you.
You know,
it's incredible like the sport of boxing,

2608
02:22:26.791 --> 02:22:30.210
how it's evolved over the years and you see like the guys that you know,

2609
02:22:30.211 --> 02:22:34.230
like we're in the olden days where they would like fight with like little tiny

2610
02:22:34.231 --> 02:22:38.520
ass gloves.
You ever watch those?
Like Jack Dempsey fights on youtube and shit.

2611
02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:41.370
They basically had speed bag gloves,

2612
02:22:41.460 --> 02:22:44.940
these little tiny knuckle pads and they would just beat the fuck out of each

2613
02:22:44.941 --> 02:22:48.750
other and sometimes they'd have like 20 round fights and shit maybe in there.

2614
02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:52.290
Every now and then.
Well guys get busted for that today.
Still.

2615
02:22:52.291 --> 02:22:56.790
Even Margarito got busted.
He got suspended for a whole year,
heavy gloves.

2616
02:22:56.820 --> 02:23:01.680
He had plaster inside of his gloves.
What he did was somehow or another,
yeah,

2617
02:23:01.681 --> 02:23:06.150
put plaster and his hand wraps and as his hands sweat and you know,

2618
02:23:06.151 --> 02:23:10.380
it gets water in there,
it packs tight and hard,
you know.
And he denies that.

2619
02:23:10.381 --> 02:23:12.690
He knew that it was in there,
but other people say you must have.

2620
02:23:12.691 --> 02:23:15.840
But either way he fucked a lot of people up before he had that.

2621
02:23:16.050 --> 02:23:19.320
And then once he had that in all of a sudden he like lost all that punching

2622
02:23:19.321 --> 02:23:20.820
power that he was stopping everybody with.

2623
02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:23.700
Which is really scary to think about the fact that this guy might have fought

2624
02:23:23.701 --> 02:23:27.780
like more than one fight through his career with loaded gloves,
you know,

2625
02:23:27.870 --> 02:23:30.000
it's kept fucking rocks in his gloves,
rocks,

2626
02:23:30.180 --> 02:23:33.350
just classroom sport rocky.

2627
02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:37.070
It's a hard sport.
It's,

2628
02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:40.980
it's a hard sport to watch those old time guys now when they try to talk,

2629
02:23:41.010 --> 02:23:44.640
I was talking to my pal Brian time and he's one of the producers and Spike TV

2630
02:23:44.970 --> 02:23:48.270
and he was talking about,
they had a,
uh,
an Ali,
a special,

2631
02:23:48.271 --> 02:23:51.840
all the different men who had faced Ali in his prime and that,
you know,

2632
02:23:51.841 --> 02:23:55.950
they had a show subtitles for a lot of these guys because it was very difficult

2633
02:23:55.951 --> 02:23:56.970
to understand what they're saying.

2634
02:23:57.260 --> 02:24:02.090
<v 5>There was a guy that showed up at the Improv when I was there and they explained</v>

2635
02:24:02.091 --> 02:24:04.340
to me that I guess he'd snuck in the showroom.

2636
02:24:04.930 --> 02:24:09.260
Somebody explained to me that this guy was the top athlete in his day and he got

2637
02:24:09.261 --> 02:24:13.600
in a car accident.
So he got this big Norton scholarship.
No,
it was just,

2638
02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:14.820
he never get became pro,

2639
02:24:14.821 --> 02:24:19.760
but he was going to be the shit baseball player and I'm gonna head on car

2640
02:24:19.761 --> 02:24:23.570
accident and some boosters took them out from the college that it was going to

2641
02:24:23.571 --> 02:24:27.260
go to and head on collision and brain the image.

2642
02:24:27.261 --> 02:24:31.700
So now there's big motherfucker comes in,
sits right in the front row.

2643
02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:33.830
They said he didn't know how,
they didn't know how he snuck in.

2644
02:24:34.190 --> 02:24:36.560
No one was going to move on and look,

2645
02:24:36.561 --> 02:24:40.370
just looked at me and just all he could say was that well she said,

2646
02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:44.020
ah,
ah,
ah,
ah.

2647
02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:48.530
And just kept doing that over and over again at the Improv Hollywood improv.

2648
02:24:49.550 --> 02:24:53.340
So I'm looking down,
I'm like,
there's no winning.
He was,
no,
it's,

2649
02:24:53.341 --> 02:24:57.920
somebody explained to me even before he snuck in the showroom that that's who

2650
02:24:57.921 --> 02:24:58.880
this guy is.

2651
02:24:59.180 --> 02:25:03.770
So this guy was going to be this the best baseball player of biggest hitter just

2652
02:25:03.771 --> 02:25:06.710
of all time.
How long ago was this crash?
I have no idea.

2653
02:25:07.250 --> 02:25:10.250
He was older at this point.
He's like 45 years old when I saw him.

2654
02:25:10.750 --> 02:25:11.541
So then he sneaks in,

2655
02:25:11.541 --> 02:25:14.240
the showrooms is right in the front row and they already explained who he was.

2656
02:25:14.241 --> 02:25:17.900
So I knew he was mentally handicapped and because he'd been this accident,

2657
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:21.440
but you know,
it was just poor guy who was six foot six or whatever.

2658
02:25:21.441 --> 02:25:22.700
And the same thing with the boxers.

2659
02:25:22.701 --> 02:25:26.750
When you see a box you can't really talk and their brain is just mush is another

2660
02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:28.930
thing.
Softy.
I agree.
I tell Ya,

2661
02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:32.430
<v 3>I feel for all these emotional,
as I'm getting older,</v>

2662
02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:36.180
I was never about me.
I was never a football fan growing up,

2663
02:25:36.181 --> 02:25:39.210
so I didn't really pay attention to it that much.
But as I get older,

2664
02:25:39.211 --> 02:25:41.900
I watch a football on TV,
you know,
every now and then.

2665
02:25:41.901 --> 02:25:44.850
And I watched some of these fucking collisions that these guys get hit and

2666
02:25:44.851 --> 02:25:46.140
knocked unconscious and taken off

2667
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:49.560
<v 5>the field.
I love it.
I'm a huge NFL fan.
I've grown up with in my entire life.</v>

2668
02:25:49.590 --> 02:25:52.110
I love NFL football does strike is killing me.

2669
02:25:52.250 --> 02:25:57.250
<v 3>Anybody who could say ever say that MMA is more violent than football,</v>

2670
02:25:57.410 --> 02:26:01.520
they're out of their fucking mind to be all these more personal.

2671
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:05.470
It's more personal because you're naked and you're kicking each other and sweat

2672
02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:07.160
on top of each other.
It's more primal.

2673
02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:12.640
But there's nothing like a 300 pound super athlete running and colliding with

2674
02:26:15.561 --> 02:26:17.450
someone at full speed.
It's fucking cool.

2675
02:26:17.710 --> 02:26:19.300
<v 5>Oh they got it be soon.
But the helmets,</v>

2676
02:26:19.301 --> 02:26:23.140
they were real sports with Bryant Gumbel that had a football player on it.
Just,

2677
02:26:23.141 --> 02:26:24.130
um,
I,

2678
02:26:24.131 --> 02:26:28.150
and he was handed a suction thing in his mouth and his wife had to suck cause he

2679
02:26:28.151 --> 02:26:32.350
couldn't even clear out his own fucking saliva from all of the impact that he's

2680
02:26:32.351 --> 02:26:33.250
had over the years.

2681
02:26:33.450 --> 02:26:36.360
<v 3>Well,
they had a bunch of guys that are,
that have Lou Gehrig's disease.</v>

2682
02:26:36.390 --> 02:26:37.223
There was a,
uh,

2683
02:26:37.230 --> 02:26:41.850
a bunch of football players that have come up with it and it's apparently super

2684
02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.160
common for like severe,
severe head trauma.

2685
02:26:44.430 --> 02:26:47.070
And that's one of the things that they're finding out about all these football

2686
02:26:47.071 --> 02:26:49.300
players.
Like guys who are young guys who,
you know,

2687
02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:52.050
I've only been playing pro ball for like a couple of years.

2688
02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:55.530
They die and then they do autopsies on them and like this poor guy was fucked,

2689
02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:59.220
you know,
he was already probably in stages of dementia and they're,
you know,

2690
02:26:59.221 --> 02:27:00.180
28 years old,

2691
02:27:00.181 --> 02:27:03.810
30 years old and there's nothing they can do about it other than completely

2692
02:27:03.811 --> 02:27:06.960
stopping the game in Raritan reassessing it and changing the rules.

2693
02:27:07.230 --> 02:27:11.490
They're going to install some sort of,
uh,
devices in Dude's head gear and their,

2694
02:27:11.491 --> 02:27:14.220
their helmets that's going to gauge their impacts.

2695
02:27:14.490 --> 02:27:17.340
And so when they find out like what levels of,
you know,

2696
02:27:17.430 --> 02:27:21.240
impact are tolerable and after at what time.
But man,

2697
02:27:21.241 --> 02:27:25.440
if they started doing like cat scans on shit on dude's while cancer getting

2698
02:27:25.441 --> 02:27:28.650
jacked up,
I wonder if they start doing cat scans.

2699
02:27:28.651 --> 02:27:31.770
How many guys in pro football would turn up to have like brain damage?

2700
02:27:32.940 --> 02:27:36.510
A lot probably.
Man,
it's a hard way to make a living.
You know,

2701
02:27:36.511 --> 02:27:39.480
people will talk about how you know,
you know man,
it's great.

2702
02:27:39.481 --> 02:27:41.880
The life of an athlete,
they're so lucky.
God Damn.

2703
02:27:41.881 --> 02:27:46.230
You know how hard it must be to be a professional football player in the NFL at

2704
02:27:46.231 --> 02:27:49.710
the top of the leap with the top of the league with all those super fucking

2705
02:27:49.711 --> 02:27:50.540
athletes.

2706
02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:51.131
<v 5>Yeah,
no,</v>

2707
02:27:51.131 --> 02:27:54.200
it's to see those guys who are on the practice squad who can't even make the

2708
02:27:54.201 --> 02:27:57.740
team in the first place and they're still getting hit and making $30,000 a year

2709
02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:00.930
to 20 semi-pro shit or anything like that.
Word

2710
02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.550
<v 3>judge.
And if you had to compete against Ray Lewis,</v>

2711
02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:07.300
do you imagine if you saw Ray Lewis chasing after you,

2712
02:28:07.540 --> 02:28:11.110
could you fucking imagine the terror that you would feel really running with

2713
02:28:11.111 --> 02:28:14.800
that ball loose moving at you?

2714
02:28:14.890 --> 02:28:16.550
<v 5>I always think about all the time,
like,
um,</v>

2715
02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:21.720
if I got hiked the ball right and I had a professional offensive line in front

2716
02:28:22.281 --> 02:28:26.240
of me,
how far I could actually make it.
Could I get a yard?

2717
02:28:26.630 --> 02:28:31.250
Can I get a yard?
One Yard?
No,
I don't think you're going to step off.

2718
02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:32.450
I don't think you'd get a step off.

2719
02:28:32.451 --> 02:28:35.510
I think you have to be a super athlete to just get the ball.

2720
02:28:35.511 --> 02:28:38.370
And I couldn't even run to the outside because someone would be on me and

2721
02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:41.640
depends on how good the defense is and how well they block.
I guess I'm not a,

2722
02:28:41.710 --> 02:28:44.090
you know,
like I said,
I'm not looking at a,
an expert in football,

2723
02:28:44.091 --> 02:28:47.790
but I would think that these guys are so fucking fast.
One Yard.
Yeah.

2724
02:28:47.830 --> 02:28:50.210
I was just all in one is when you are,
I don't think I could make,

2725
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:52.690
I get tackled and backfill to every fucking time.

2726
02:28:52.820 --> 02:28:55.190
Did you play any sports growing up?
No.
I want it to,

2727
02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:58.520
I was telling a story the other night and it's a new story and every time,

2728
02:28:58.521 --> 02:29:01.640
but I wanted to play sports so bad and I got caught.

2729
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:05.420
I was sort of good in everything.
Not good enough to make the teams.

2730
02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:06.590
What did you try to mind in high school?

2731
02:29:06.591 --> 02:29:09.110
I tried to play football and I should have gone back.

2732
02:29:09.111 --> 02:29:11.570
I think it was a mistake that didn't make the football team because I thought I

2733
02:29:11.571 --> 02:29:14.630
was good and I was tall enough and big enough to make the football team

2734
02:29:14.631 --> 02:29:18.260
shouldn't be.
So I think there was a clerical error and I just never thought it.

2735
02:29:18.470 --> 02:29:21.680
Yeah,
I know.
And then basketball,

2736
02:29:21.770 --> 02:29:26.180
I was good enough but not good enough to make like a B team or something like

2737
02:29:26.181 --> 02:29:30.780
that,
but not good enough to make the team.
And then a baseball did not,

2738
02:29:30.860 --> 02:29:34.610
nothing.
So I ended up doing track.
What did you,
when you went to college,

2739
02:29:34.611 --> 02:29:39.050
did you keep ending up in college now?
I didn't do anything in college.

2740
02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:40.490
I was just the worst.
I would be like,

2741
02:29:40.491 --> 02:29:44.510
I really wanted to be involved in activities,
but I didn't do anything.

2742
02:29:44.810 --> 02:29:46.820
I didn't really didn't do anything.
And especially in college,

2743
02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:51.230
what was your major would you want to do?
I wanted to be a business major.

2744
02:29:51.231 --> 02:29:52.550
I was going to go into advertising.

2745
02:29:52.551 --> 02:29:56.330
I ended up being graduating with human resources because that's where my
parents,

2746
02:29:56.390 --> 02:30:00.240
family business was.
I told you I used to fire people,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2747
02:30:00.260 --> 02:30:03.530
So I the job of the hatchet man.
So I knew I was going to do that.

2748
02:30:03.980 --> 02:30:07.970
And so I went to school for HR and knowing that I was going to go into my

2749
02:30:07.971 --> 02:30:10.220
parents' family business,
which was firing people.

2750
02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:14.920
And what made you get into stand up?
I hated firing people,
so I really,

2751
02:30:14.940 --> 02:30:15.773
I really did.

2752
02:30:15.890 --> 02:30:19.010
And so I was volunteering with the big brothers big sisters and I was trying to

2753
02:30:19.011 --> 02:30:22.460
do all this stuff to balance out the fact that I was firing single moms during

2754
02:30:22.461 --> 02:30:25.340
the day.
Then everyone always told me I should do stand up.

2755
02:30:25.341 --> 02:30:29.210
And I was watching like short attention span theater and all this comedy central

2756
02:30:29.211 --> 02:30:30.440
staff.
And the a list.

2757
02:30:30.441 --> 02:30:32.780
You remember that show ended up staying up with Wally Collins,

2758
02:30:32.781 --> 02:30:36.200
all these shows that would wow.
And I was like,
I got to do that.

2759
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:38.060
That's what I want to do.
And I gave a speech.

2760
02:30:38.061 --> 02:30:42.230
I was the Salutatorian of my high school class and I ended up,
um,
I killed.

2761
02:30:42.890 --> 02:30:47.090
So at 18 or 17 I knew that this is my thing,

2762
02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:51.320
but it just took me 10 years.
I started really late.
I started when I was 28.
Wow.

2763
02:30:51.350 --> 02:30:52.840
So I GI,
that's what,

2764
02:30:52.841 --> 02:30:56.000
another thing that I was telling those kids that I went to speak to,

2765
02:30:56.470 --> 02:31:01.100
it was like the choice to have me to do my own thing and work for myself was

2766
02:31:01.101 --> 02:31:05.250
hands down the best choice of ever made in my entire life.
Like without a doubt.

2767
02:31:05.390 --> 02:31:09.470
Like the chance to go away.
Cause I had some,
my parents,
you know,

2768
02:31:09.471 --> 02:31:14.471
offered me that company I was going to get offered a range rover $500,000 a

2769
02:31:14.811 --> 02:31:17.690
year,
something like that.
Really?
They're going to have your car.
Oh,

2770
02:31:17.691 --> 02:31:20.760
car at the end of the house.
The whole thing.
Really?
Yeah.
They,
you know,

2771
02:31:20.761 --> 02:31:25.080
this is a bigger company.
We had a lot of employees,
20 530,000 employees.

2772
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:26.460
So they were often,
you're all this stuff.

2773
02:31:26.490 --> 02:31:29.880
And I walked away from it because when things started going well,

2774
02:31:29.881 --> 02:31:32.220
I just sort of said,
you know,
I got to do to stand up.

2775
02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:36.740
How long have you been doing standup then?
Uh,
well sort of.
I got a Gig,
you know,

2776
02:31:36.760 --> 02:31:39.420
saying I went to Montreal and I got cast in my own TV show.

2777
02:31:39.421 --> 02:31:42.490
So it was easy for me to come to years.
Have you been doing standing by that?

2778
02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:47.370
Four years.
Four years.
So this was your 32.
What's that?
You did it from 28 to 32.

2779
02:31:47.371 --> 02:31:52.020
And that's when you quit 28 to 32.
Yeah.
Nice.
Yeah,
man.
Changes,

2780
02:31:52.021 --> 02:31:55.170
changes in risks.
You've got to take him and he's Jeff kids at this time.

2781
02:31:55.280 --> 02:31:59.240
One Lorenza was one that's scary.
Yeah.
Down in La with now.
I mean,

2782
02:31:59.490 --> 02:32:02.100
pretty much it was sort of written off,
you know,
it's like,
okay,

2783
02:32:02.610 --> 02:32:05.190
you're not getting anything.
Wow.
Yeah.

2784
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:08.850
And how risky does that feel when you,
you have a child?

2785
02:32:08.851 --> 02:32:11.420
And you take this move away from this,
you know,

2786
02:32:11.460 --> 02:32:14.820
guaranteed really high paying job.
Yeah.

2787
02:32:14.821 --> 02:32:16.410
That's the other thing you say you were always,

2788
02:32:16.411 --> 02:32:18.450
for a while I was sick of guessing it,
thinking,
oh my God,

2789
02:32:18.451 --> 02:32:22.200
I had this guaranteed income.
And now with any bit of standup or television work,

2790
02:32:22.201 --> 02:32:23.970
you don't know if your show is going to get picked up.

2791
02:32:23.971 --> 02:32:27.300
You don't know what's going to happen.
So you don't know where you get money.

2792
02:32:27.301 --> 02:32:30.540
It's like this feast or famine thing that goes along with being an actor or any

2793
02:32:30.541 --> 02:32:33.120
artist.
As I go,
I'm going to get paid a lot of money and,

2794
02:32:33.121 --> 02:32:35.580
or the paydays are going to start to come.
But in the meantime,

2795
02:32:35.581 --> 02:32:38.070
when you have a child,
you're constantly thinking,
oh my God,

2796
02:32:38.200 --> 02:32:41.660
I've got to provide for those people.
It's the same thing that scared,
you know,

2797
02:32:41.670 --> 02:32:46.650
the responsibility of it all.
It's like I can't fuck up.
Right.
I can't go.

2798
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:50.010
Yeah.
I don't know.
There's no fucking up from me.
And so yeah,

2799
02:32:50.011 --> 02:32:51.750
that was a lot of pressure,
you know?

2800
02:32:51.751 --> 02:32:55.470
And so do you have a final expense creatively stifling or do you think that it's

2801
02:32:55.471 --> 02:32:59.820
inspiring?
Um,
there are a lot of outside things for me to do Tai Chi,

2802
02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:03.300
a lot of shit that I need to get done and like I got to maintain my house.

2803
02:33:03.330 --> 02:33:03.901
That's another thing.

2804
02:33:03.901 --> 02:33:07.710
It's like I'm working on stuff around the house on a regular basis and I can't,

2805
02:33:07.711 --> 02:33:08.281
I don't,
you know,

2806
02:33:08.281 --> 02:33:10.890
I'm lucky enough and to make it a little bit of money where I can have some

2807
02:33:10.891 --> 02:33:12.910
people come in and help me with some drugs.
Well,

2808
02:33:12.911 --> 02:33:16.380
for the most part in terms of like,
I'm doing a lot of the date,

2809
02:33:16.381 --> 02:33:18.960
all the day to day maintenance,
you know,
where I'm,
you know,

2810
02:33:18.961 --> 02:33:22.620
maintain that my yard,
your wife,
she works,
no,
my wife doesn't,
she doesn't,

2811
02:33:22.621 --> 02:33:26.730
she has,
she takes care of the kids.
And um,
so you just do what you're saying.

2812
02:33:26.731 --> 02:33:29.610
You'd have a bunch of shit to do.
It's not like you have a wide open day.

2813
02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:31.770
Now why was everybody that owns a house,
right?

2814
02:33:31.771 --> 02:33:34.290
I mean that's what we need to find out when you have a house is fucking always

2815
02:33:34.291 --> 02:33:37.320
something going wrong.
So there's something going on.
Even if it's a new house,

2816
02:33:37.321 --> 02:33:40.710
shit breaks things crassly managing your,
so there's life's maintenance.

2817
02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:42.360
They'd always clutters what I meant.

2818
02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:44.820
What I meant is the responsibility of having children.

2819
02:33:44.821 --> 02:33:48.090
Do you find that inspiring or do you find that sometimes that stifles

2820
02:33:48.091 --> 02:33:51.000
inspiration cause it's so,
you know,
it was a lot of pressure as well.

2821
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:54.540
I haven't let it affect me either way.
I've just been just as inspired,
you know,

2822
02:33:54.541 --> 02:33:56.940
because I get it.
You know,
like I said,
a big,

2823
02:33:57.120 --> 02:33:59.250
when I create something and it works,

2824
02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:02.460
the rush I get from that is so great that,

2825
02:34:02.461 --> 02:34:06.840
I mean kids are not like I'd be doing this,
you know?
And even if I had the kids,

2826
02:34:06.841 --> 02:34:10.830
I'm not extra motivated doesn't give you any extra show.
That's great.

2827
02:34:10.831 --> 02:34:13.470
You have a healthy attitude about it so you don't have to worry about it over

2828
02:34:13.471 --> 02:34:17.800
time consuming you and worrying you are cool.
Like,
uh,
really made it clear.

2829
02:34:17.801 --> 02:34:20.960
Like you said,
all the great stuff that happens from kids.
You know,
I,

2830
02:34:20.980 --> 02:34:23.490
we go to the park and shit like that and like you and your,

2831
02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:26.950
I'm out in front saying blue 42 should I like that.

2832
02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:30.440
I love football so much that I always dreamed that I would be playing catch with

2833
02:34:30.450 --> 02:34:35.400
some kid out.
And so I love that Shit,
you know?
And so I want to spend more time.

2834
02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:36.101
That's why I ain't come.

2835
02:34:36.101 --> 02:34:39.250
Graham was so grateful for all this TV stuff that's happening because I get to

2836
02:34:39.251 --> 02:34:42.940
stay home.
I hate me.
I'm Miss Memorial Day weekend camping.

2837
02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:48.220
My wife calls me up and she's driving up to El Capitan.
That was in a,

2838
02:34:48.221 --> 02:34:52.690
it's in Santa Barbara says campground.
And she goes,
the kids are watching,

2839
02:34:52.691 --> 02:34:53.830
you're never going to believe this,
but guess what?

2840
02:34:53.831 --> 02:34:57.730
The kids are watching and a DVD player and they're watching Jim Gaffigan beyond

2841
02:34:57.731 --> 02:35:02.710
the Pale,
my four year old and an eight year old,
instead of any Disney movie,

2842
02:35:02.740 --> 02:35:07.700
they're watching beyond the Pale Gaffigan.
They love hot pocket bit.
They,

2843
02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:11.680
my son,
uh,
tells my wife he's going to do the talent show.

2844
02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:16.480
And he's going to do hot pockets and my wife and my wife goes,

2845
02:35:16.481 --> 02:35:18.940
I dunno what you should be more pissed about the fact that he's stealing other

2846
02:35:18.941 --> 02:35:23.630
people's material or not yours.
Thank God.
But that's like,

2847
02:35:23.770 --> 02:35:26.470
I can't believe I'm not there watching.

2848
02:35:26.471 --> 02:35:29.410
And he ended up not doing it and chicken out because everyone was singing songs.

2849
02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:30.250
It's like,

2850
02:35:30.250 --> 02:35:32.980
now I'm going to go up and tell him Hotpocket jokes that no one's eating a hug

2851
02:35:32.981 --> 02:35:34.900
and a hot pocket.
So anyway,

2852
02:35:34.930 --> 02:35:39.300
I missed that and I was away working at DC Improv.
It's hard.
And do you feel

2853
02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:42.410
<v 0>man,
you got to make that monthly Knutsen.
Yeah,
so there's,
yeah,</v>

2854
02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:45.170
but we're lucky to be doing it that way,
man.
It's the greatest job in the world.

2855
02:35:45.171 --> 02:35:47.450
I wouldn't,
wouldn't like to do anything if there's ever,

2856
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:49.670
if anybody ever said you have to choose one of the things you do.

2857
02:35:49.671 --> 02:35:51.860
I've been very fortunate that I've been able to do a lot of different things,

2858
02:35:51.861 --> 02:35:55.010
but they able to act and hosted shit like fear factor in the UFC.

2859
02:35:55.011 --> 02:35:57.440
But as Sony said,
you can only do one.
You have to get rid of the other ones.

2860
02:35:57.830 --> 02:36:02.200
There's not even a question stand up.
Yeah,
for sure.
Without a doubt,
right?
Yup.

2861
02:36:02.270 --> 02:36:06.910
Easy.
No,
it's not even,
it's not even a quick,
I mean it's,
it's not even a,
there's,

2862
02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:10.640
there's no,
there's no alternative.
Now I control everything was standard.

2863
02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:14.510
Not only that,
it's so fucking fun and it's so fun to watch.

2864
02:36:14.750 --> 02:36:16.370
Like to this day I still love watching it.

2865
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:19.210
<v 5>Yeah.
No,
I,
I just think it's,
I,</v>

2866
02:36:19.410 --> 02:36:22.330
I've gotten to a point also where I'm very comfortable.

2867
02:36:22.510 --> 02:36:25.200
I think it was I telling you this,
the difference,
uh,

2868
02:36:25.260 --> 02:36:28.510
Ryan was when I was talking about how being comfortable on stage,

2869
02:36:28.540 --> 02:36:29.620
I started walking up,

2870
02:36:29.621 --> 02:36:33.910
there was a turning point where I started judging the audience rather than

2871
02:36:33.911 --> 02:36:35.230
letting them judge me.

2872
02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:38.980
And that's how I knew I was really like I'd walk up and go,

2873
02:36:38.981 --> 02:36:41.210
are these people good?
I got it.
Cause I know I can do it

2874
02:36:41.230 --> 02:36:43.000
<v 0>this,
but how are these fuckers?</v>

2875
02:36:43.630 --> 02:36:46.150
And then I will say that there's no bad audiences.

2876
02:36:46.151 --> 02:36:50.020
Like fucking bill Cosby is to say that there's only bad comedians.

2877
02:36:50.021 --> 02:36:52.420
Like you need to go fast.
Eddie's and Huntington.
Yeah.

2878
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:55.623
Shitholes dude.

2879
02:36:56.010 --> 02:36:57.810
<v 5>The other night I looked out at everybody and go,
Hey,</v>

2880
02:36:57.811 --> 02:37:02.030
I just want to make it clear.
Did I've been doing this for a while and um,

2881
02:37:02.670 --> 02:37:04.560
you guys have a student of responsibility here.

2882
02:37:05.210 --> 02:37:08.830
<v 0>Your
teachers,</v>

2883
02:37:08.910 --> 02:37:11.740
golden eyes called Z.
I'll all sitting there slunched over winter

2884
02:37:11.850 --> 02:37:14.720
<v 5>arms crossed just looking at me like they were going to judge me.
I ain't going.</v>

2885
02:37:14.721 --> 02:37:16.010
No,
you are thinking you're going to fucking

2886
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:18.560
<v 0>judge me right now.
But it's the other way around.</v>

2887
02:37:18.650 --> 02:37:22.910
I don't think you guys are very good
working people.

2888
02:37:22.911 --> 02:37:25.160
See if they want to check you out.
What's your websites and Alan?

2889
02:37:25.161 --> 02:37:27.800
magical.com [inaudible] dot com I also am doing something with this,

2890
02:37:27.801 --> 02:37:29.390
my album than I've just put out.

2891
02:37:29.420 --> 02:37:32.760
It's let people pay whatever they want just because I'd rather people have it

2892
02:37:32.761 --> 02:37:33.830
and the minimum is five bucks,

2893
02:37:33.831 --> 02:37:38.831
but still I kick those people that I'm about to send them my hour from.

2894
02:37:39.141 --> 02:37:42.390
Did I just recorded in DC because they bought the previous album,

2895
02:37:42.391 --> 02:37:46.450
so I'll just you do it all through iTunes or just do it on my website.

2896
02:37:46.451 --> 02:37:49.610
I didn't go with the REC.
Paypal,
paypal.
Oh,

2897
02:37:50.030 --> 02:37:52.940
so you can sort of put in any dollar amount you want minimum five.

2898
02:37:52.941 --> 02:37:55.640
And I figured that's bargains.
So that's how you release your,
your CD.

2899
02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:59.690
Just my own self.
Yeah.
That's pretty fucking cool.
So cut out the middleman.

2900
02:37:59.691 --> 02:38:02.960
So if somebody wants to buy that,
they go to al magical.com album.
Yeah,

2901
02:38:03.030 --> 02:38:04.490
that's click on the outlook on the album.

2902
02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:09.330
And then the new podcast I'm doing with Mazda brawny that's minivan men.
And uh,

2903
02:38:09.350 --> 02:38:12.770
we just had our first episode.
It's on iTunes.
Not yet.
Not yet.

2904
02:38:13.370 --> 02:38:15.980
That's how new it is.
Sick.
That's weird.
I mean we just,

2905
02:38:16.090 --> 02:38:18.190
they go to minivan men.com.
Yeah,

2906
02:38:18.410 --> 02:38:22.250
I've put a link up on my website and we're going to crash your server sun coming

2907
02:38:22.251 --> 02:38:27.110
in right now.
Awesome.
Anybody see you next?
When's your next Gig?

2908
02:38:27.230 --> 02:38:29.240
Uh,
probably I haven't called him for spots,

2909
02:38:29.241 --> 02:38:31.850
but I'm going to be in La for a long time and then I think I might be going to

2910
02:38:31.851 --> 02:38:34.040
the Montreal comedy festival.
Oh,
so this summer.

2911
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:37.580
So you'd be over around doing your TV show stuff until then?
Yeah.

2912
02:38:37.581 --> 02:38:42.440
And I think you do a lot of sets at the Improv or the comedy store of sit up
now.

2913
02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:47.540
I mix it up quite a bit.
So Improv,
laugh,
factory comedy store,
all of them.

2914
02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:51.380
This a Thursday night,
the vogue theater in Vancouver.

2915
02:38:51.381 --> 02:38:55.190
I think there's only the only thing that's left is like single tickets but it's

2916
02:38:55.191 --> 02:38:56.610
uh,
me and uh,

2917
02:38:56.630 --> 02:39:00.560
Tom Segura and a possible guest star that I cannot mention cause he's under

2918
02:39:00.561 --> 02:39:04.100
contract with something else.
And then uh,
June 25th,

2919
02:39:04.101 --> 02:39:08.390
we're at the Carnegie Music Hall in Pittsburgh.
It's not the same Carnegie Hall.

2920
02:39:09.110 --> 02:39:11.420
Is that Tom as well?
It's Berg,
Bro Thompson.

2921
02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:16.100
That one is a Joey Diaz is kind of to what the fuck cock sucker.

2922
02:39:16.490 --> 02:39:17.660
I got to bring joy to Pittsburgh.

2923
02:39:17.830 --> 02:39:20.990
That's Pittsburgh is perfect for [inaudible] and then the Mandalay Bay theater

2924
02:39:20.991 --> 02:39:23.360
is July 1st and uh,
that's it.

2925
02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:28.450
Bitches cliffy be tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM 10:00 AM we're going to be live a

2926
02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:31.520
very special early edition podcast.

2927
02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:34.790
I'm going to get up and have breakfast on your side of town.
Yeah.

2928
02:39:34.791 --> 02:39:38.090
I'm going to get up real early because that traffic is motherfuckers,

2929
02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:39.980

2930
02:39:40.380 --> 02:39:44.600

2931
02:39:44.601 --> 02:39:47.480
anytime you've got to go somewhere la or on nine o'clock to 10 o'clock,

2932
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:51.230
it's just parking lot city.
So,
you know,
it's the real problem,

2933
02:39:51.260 --> 02:39:54.080
but it's also the real thing that's great about La.
There's so much here,

2934
02:39:54.081 --> 02:39:56.540
there's so much to so many different stores,
so many different people,

2935
02:39:56.541 --> 02:39:59.050
so many different influences,
you know,
so much different trucks.

2936
02:39:59.210 --> 02:39:59.901
But because of that,

2937
02:39:59.901 --> 02:40:02.720
there's so many fucking humans that whenever you want to get anywhere and it's

2938
02:40:02.721 --> 02:40:07.370
uh,

I'm just dragging shit out.

2939
02:40:07.510 --> 02:40:11.890
Um,

So fired up about doing that.
And uh,

2947
02:40:32.971 --> 02:40:36.960
so that's it.
Um,
that's all the deal.
Um,
the [inaudible] gate,

2948
02:40:37.710 --> 02:40:42.480
just use the word and with love only from now on,
I was thinking,

2949
02:40:42.481 --> 02:40:46.560
we were talking about the homeless kids and uh,
the kids,

2950
02:40:46.561 --> 02:40:47.910
he'd go on to school and all this stuff.

2951
02:40:47.911 --> 02:40:50.290
Then we were talking about the autistic kids and all this stuff too,
right?

2952
02:40:50.310 --> 02:40:53.880
Aren't you going in athletes that were all fucked up to sum everything up.

2953
02:40:54.450 --> 02:40:56.520
And then when you start,
I started thinking about,
okay,

2954
02:40:56.521 --> 02:41:00.840
and we started talking about Conti,
right?
Like with all this other shit going on,

2955
02:41:00.930 --> 02:41:02.190
it's ridiculous.

2956
02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:07.530
It is ridiculous that you would even be concerned with such a thing.
Yeah.

2957
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:11.820
Is Shamed yourself.
Well,
it's just the grand distraction of it all.

2958
02:41:12.510 --> 02:41:17.340
How magical is just dropped wisdoms on your bitches.
Wisdoms.
Yeah.
There you go.

2959
02:41:17.341 --> 02:41:21.480
That's it.
I'm going to take.
I'm talking about that next smartest fuck.
All right,

2960
02:41:21.900 --> 02:41:24.540
well that's it for this week.
Thank you to the flashlight.

2961
02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:27.480

2962
02:41:27.481 --> 02:41:31.650

2963
02:41:31.651 --> 02:41:35.220
And I'll give you one al Madrigal if you're allowed to take one home.
No,

2964

Don't be scared of running crazy magical.

2965
02:41:38.441 --> 02:41:40.020
Was afraid that he shoots one load and that thing.

2966
02:41:40.021 --> 02:41:43.400
He's just going to run a muck through the land.
Yeah,
become a fucking barbarian.

2967
02:41:43.410 --> 02:41:45.530
Give up all his responsibilities.
I mean,

2968
02:41:45.540 --> 02:41:50.070
when your daughter turns five eight.
I have a five year old now.

2969
02:41:50.570 --> 02:41:53.970
I can't,
I don't know more shoot loads in the plastic toys.
200 Square foot house.

2970
02:41:53.971 --> 02:41:56.340
Where do you keep that?
Every space is accounted for,

2971
02:41:56.570 --> 02:42:00.240
but you got to get them safe sun.
All right,
safe now I'm going to save.

2972
02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:02.640
We'll talk about the shit off the air.
Love you bitches.

2973
02:42:02.670 --> 02:42:04.440
