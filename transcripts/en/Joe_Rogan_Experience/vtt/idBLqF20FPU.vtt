three,
two,
one you just gave up.
I know.

4
00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:20.490
It is for us.
It's early for the rest of the world.
It's actually noon.

5
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.830
It's lunchtime,
right Brian?
That's,

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.190
that's how fucked up your lifestyle is.
You,

7
00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:31.020
Maniac noon is like super early.
Dude.

8
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:35.920
This is so wrong.
I had to be at work at noon.
Terrible.

18
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.220
Flashlight has been trying to get me to get one of their people in here.

19
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.060
Um,
I'm all for that.

Right.

22
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.880
But do you think it would be interesting on a podcast?

23
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.390
That's what I had most of them on a podcast.
They're re they got the good girls.

24
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.610
They don't have the,
the,
the,
the dumb stupid girls.
They have like the,

25
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.430
the high end intelligent,
smart business women girls.

26
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.510
And is that what your experience is that these girls?
Yeah.
For Reals?
Yeah,

27
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.830

Like building their empire.
Well,

28
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.980

29
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.130

30
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.300
And she's one of the you and love.

32
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.400
Tara Patrick,
Patrick's amazing.

33
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:05.280
And she's one of the flashlight girls and that's the cool thing about
flashlight.

34
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:09.250
They do,
they really molded pussy.
Other just fucking know.
I've dated two girls.

35
00:02:09.251 --> 00:02:14.010
They've had their pussies mold,
not,
yeah,
I have.
And this is dating pulls a mass.

36
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.030
That's terrifying.
They actually do it in the,
if you look online,
a lot of,

37
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.330
a lot of times they had,
they actually filmed the process,

38
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:24.570
which is pouring the shit all over their pussies.
Oh,

39
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.860
all these Asian guys are,
are out there just now.
I have to hide.

40
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:30.320
This podcast exists since

41
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.780
<v 1>from my mom.
I was worried about this and now it's like,</v>

42
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.130
well it's right away.
We haven't even gotten to the podcast yet.

43
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:38.580
This is just the commercial.
Janet Hayes,

44
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.560
we're also brought to you by on at.com makers of Alpha brain,

45
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.260
the cognitive enhancing supplement that,
uh,
I haven't taken mine yet.
I got it.

46
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.650
So I need to take,
I need to take some,
yeah,
it sounds great.

47
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.200
It sounds like something has to last.

48
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.540
So fake ticket right now we also have the kettle bells or in ladies and

49
00:02:55.671 --> 00:03:00.100
gentlemen,
and it's been a huge content.
I have try to get this,

50
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.940
<v 3>uh,
happening with the kettle bells.
Very difficult to make happen.</v>

51
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:05.770
It's hard to get fucking of Bell's,
first of all,

52
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:10.771
they're expensive as shit when shit really hard to sell or a rather to ship,

53
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.140
really hard to ship because it's like you're fucking sending cannon balls.

54
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.500
You're essentially sending Castile easy thing.
It's very,

55
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.730
I don't want to lift that shit in a box and go,

56
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.070
well we got a bunch of samples and every time we got samples they would get,

57
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.100
you know,
like they would come to the mailbox.
You know,

58
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.770
like I got like this fucking 50 pound Canon Bell,

59
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.850
55 pound actually cannonball shipped to the mailbox and he's poor little ladies

60
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:36.130
work at the best dog.
What the hell are you doing?

61
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:39.580
This little tiny box and it's heavy as fuck.
You know,

62
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:43.240
like what is this even you lifting it like that's the hidden meaning the handle

63
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.940
sucks to carrying that thing.
Yeah.
We wanted a farmer carry it all day.

64
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.950
Each one weighs 55 pounds,
85 pounds.

65
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.700
And you usually order one or do you get two of them?
Well,

66
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.350
there's a lot of workouts that you do with just one.
I have.

67
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:58.420
My favorite work that I do is just one kettle bell,

68
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.410
but lately I've been doing a lot of two kettlebell workouts.
Wow.

69
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.790
I like to describe you like two kettlebells.
Yeah,

70
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.580
there's an extreme kettlebell cardio workout.
It's a DVD that dragon door sells.

71
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.780
It's so fucking good.
I do one 35 pound kettle bell.

72
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.350
Those guys,
Matt and break.
You heard Adjacency Brown?
No,

73
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.900
he's Jew Jitsu guy and he does a kettlebell conditioning stuff.

74
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:24.330
I mean he's a guy online that I,
you know,

75
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.940
I don't know him or anything but yeah you do these workouts and I actually find

76
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:32.410
them to be destroyed.
Like it's more like a test of the Callen shape I am.

77
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.010
I don't feel like it cause it's so dead.
My wife,
when I got kettle bells,

78
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:36.844
my wife was like,

79
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.060
I think these kettlebells are ruining our marriage because you just get crushed.

80
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.060
I can flatline like staring the holes,
like

81
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.720
drain yourself,
don't talk to me.

82
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.320
I kettle bells on Friday and then I tried to do Jujitsu last night.
I mean,

83
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:54.290
I did you Jitsu,
but I got like three rolls in and I was like,
this is it.

84
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.720
This all again and I can,
I'm so,
I'm so glad.
I'm not like a real fighter.

85
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.200
He's actually keep training even though you don't want to.

86
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.310
I love the fact of I'm tired.
I can just go,
fuck this.
I'm going home.
So smart.

87
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:09.700
Come to my house and do some jingle bells.
It's a lot easier.
Okay.

88
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.600
That doesn't help you,
Brian.
You're missing the whole point in this conversation.

89
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.740
Um,
I also started doing,
I started doing a lot of body weight squats,
man.

90
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:18.690
I do a two hour,

91
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.810
200 bodyweight squats before every workout and I like Bruce Lee to body weight

92
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:27.700
squats.
My legs move better now.
My kicks are harder.

93
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:31.480
Everything just from these bodyweight squats,
10 or easy.

94
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:33.730
It's like the first tangled.
Like I could do these all day.

95
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.960
And then when you get to like 120 and you go,
oh Jesus,

96
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:42.340
I have to go to mental toughness to those that,
those kinds of work.

97
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.370
But my legs are like fucking springs now.
It's crazy.

98
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.520
I've been doing it over the last like four months and it's made a huge

99
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:51.190
difference.
Man.
Steve Maxwell got me into that.

100
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.420
I know that he's a great kettlebell guy and there's a,
so if you're,

101
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:58.190
if you're interested in kettlebells,
this like the cheap

102
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.070
<v 1>as you can sell them where they're super high quality deals.
He,</v>

103
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.980
these are your kettle bells to the best quality that we could find and the best

104
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:10.810
quality available.
Anything else is just commensurate.
And um,

105
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.840
the other thing about cannabis is like,
buy one,
even if it is kind of expensive,

106
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.800
the motherfucker will last you the rest of your life.
It'll be your,

107
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.840
you could pass it down to your grandparents kit,
your,
your,

108
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.680
your grandchildren rather.
And it,

109
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.160
you would have no problem buying shit once ever forever.

110
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:30.290
You can't break them.
Yeah.

111
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:33.900
I mean you'd have to like throw him off a fucking apartment building,
break them.

112
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.890
Even a lot of them were cast from one piece and they still would just going to

113
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.420
crater and beef be all right.
Yeah.
A lot of them.
Yeah,
they're these,

114
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.530
but these are the shit.
These York ones are fucking awesome and we're,

115
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:48.630
we're like basically selling them as cheap as possible.
Um,

116
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.440
go to [inaudible] dot com and check that out.

117
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:56.180
And there's also some new ingredients that have been added to Alpha brain.
Um,

118
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.240
and there's the original Alpha brain is available.
It's a,

119
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:02.430
I think it's just called Alpha,
not Alpha brain source.
What are they calling it?

120
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.750
I maybe they don't know because I had a bottle of the old stuff and about all

121
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:08.540
the new stuff and I was trying to look which one was the new stuff when I

122
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:09.231
couldn't figure it out.

123
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:12.170
And I was like looking straight at both of them at the same time because it say

124
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:13.004
anything different on,

125
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.400
I don't think it even says anything different on it unless this is just don't

126
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.480
know.
I gave you some of the new ones.
I think the most recent batch,

127
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.480
I think that's an Ale.
I Dunno,
I'm not sure.
Um,
but for,

128
00:07:24.481 --> 00:07:26.970
for those have been asking about the clinical trials in this,

129
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.440
we are 100% are going through with it.
We just got to alter a few things.

130
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:35.190
And since we just changed the formula,
we want to make sure that,
uh,

131
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.900
we get enough a date data on this setup before we move forward.

132
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.820
And we want to finalize,
um,
how,
uh,
what the actual ingredients list is.

133
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.710
Uh,
if you're interested in any of this stuff with Alpha brain is,
it's a,

134
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:48.800
it's called a nootropic.

135
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:53.900
Nootropics are there vitamins that enhance your brain's ability to produce

136
00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:56.120
neurotransmitters?
They make,
in my opinion,

137
00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:59.600
a significant difference on the way your brain functions,

138
00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:04.460
the way you can formulate sentences,
the way you can recall information.

139
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:09.020
I mean,
it's just,
to me it makes my brain feel smoother as does coffee,
as does,

140
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:14.000
I mean,
it's not a miracle drug.
It is.
They're essentially nutrients for,

141
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:17.660
uh,
creating neurotransmitters and it's a,
it's all fascinating stuff.

142
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:20.480
It's a lot of controversy behind it.
I believe in it.

143
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.740
I've been involved in nootropics and taking them long before I had anything to

144
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:28.790
do with this company and the way I want to do business,

145
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:30.260
the only way I want to do businesses,

146
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.420
the last thing I want is anybody to feel like they're getting ripped off.

147
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.291
So to me,

148
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:40.640
it's way more important that people feel like they're getting their money's

149
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:43.130
worth and they're not getting ripped off than it is to make money.

150
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.520
So we have a 100% money back guarantee on your first order of 30 pills.

151
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.480
You don't even have to return the product.
You don't have to say,
you know,
uh,

152
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.880
just say it sucks.
You don't have to have like a,

153
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.520
a valid x when error rather a detailed explanation.
Just say it's socks.

154
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.290
That's how confident I am that it doesn't suck and that's how much I want to

155
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:05.970
make sure that people don't ever feel ripped off.

156
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:10.080
So you have a 100% money back guarantee on every first order,

157
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:12.600
a 30 pills I use it.
That's why I'm behind it.

158
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:16.260
I also use shroom tech shroom tech sport,
which is the fucking shit.

159
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:20.980
If you have any heavy duty hardcore workout,
it's cordyceps,
mushrooms and B12.

160
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:26.490
All the information is available on on.com that's o n n I t used code name
Rogan.

161
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.470
Save yourself 10% off.
All right.

162
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:31.590
My friend Sam Sheridan is here and we're going to get down to business.

163
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.370
<v 3>We're going to figure out what the fuck is up.</v>

164
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.110
Author experience.

165
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:42.650
Joe Rogan podcast day
all day.

166
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:49.070
My friend writes her extraordinary Sam Sheridan also star of the movie warrior.

167
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.760
You're going to do some more acting?
I would.
Sure.
I didn't need the money man.

168
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:56.160
I didn't know you were in it.
I played Joe Rogan want to be,

169
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.690
I've tried to be Joe Rogan and I failed.
Well you,

170
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.410
you weren't you like the Mike Goldberg character and Brian was the Joe Rogan

171
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:02.411
Karen.

172
00:10:02.411 --> 00:10:07.411
I think Brian was more the color guy and I was the play by play.

173
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:12.470
No,
no,
no.
The more like I was the more expert guy.
Yeah,

174
00:10:12.471 --> 00:10:17.260
that would be well,
so I'm more like hands on what's in MMA.
We kind of do it.

175
00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:18.800
It's kind of wacky the way we do it.

176
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:23.780
<v 1>Like a lot of times in if it was boxing or in other sports,</v>

177
00:10:23.781 --> 00:10:27.510
the play by play guy would also sort of be like an expert.
Right.
You know,

178
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.540
<v 3>and you guys,
I mean I love a Goldberg does.
I think it does it,
you know,
it's,</v>

179
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.080
it's a tough job,
man.
That's not easy.
Was very hard.
Everybody who throws,

180
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:38.460
it's like just try very hard.
Not Easy.
I did it once and I was terrible at it.

181
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.130
Yeah.
He's,
he's really good at what he does.

182
00:10:41.131 --> 00:10:44.890
He's just so good and he makes it look so easy and people for those guys,

183
00:10:44.891 --> 00:10:47.880
how difficult seems easy,
but it's not at all.

184
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.380
<v 1>That guy has to keep the show running for a live event for six hours and he does</v>

185
00:10:54.441 --> 00:10:55.274
it on a regular

186
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:59.360
<v 3>all the time.
And my job is so much easier than Goldberg's.</v>

187
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.830
All I have to do is go,
he's gotta get his arm out of there.

188
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:04.220
I look at it as you're getting a triangle job.
Fuck,
he's fucked.

189
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.910
You want to say anything for a minute?
It's fine.
Yeah.

190
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.140
If he didn't say anything for a minute,
it's Lee's getting fired.

191
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.300
I think they'd probably,

192
00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:15.110
all the people at home too would all be happy if we just say nothing for one

193
00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:18.500
minute.
Just one minute to shut the fuck up.
I want to say watching that tough,

194
00:11:18.501 --> 00:11:19.041
whatever it was.

195
00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:22.460
Where they didn't have any commentating and it he's like Dana and what's his

196
00:11:22.461 --> 00:11:26.510
name or whispering or Riaa and the actually loved it.

197
00:11:26.511 --> 00:11:30.260
Here I'm poaching and like hear their feet cause usually the crowd is so loud

198
00:11:30.261 --> 00:11:33.380
too.
You can't hear the guy breathing and the kind of impact and stuff.

199
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.110
So you have the ultimate fighters.
Those are my favorite fights.

200
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.600
I love those fights.
They're great.

201
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.490
I wish we could have like super high level fights.

202
00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:44.840
I would love to see like people versus Anderson Silva in the tough house and I'm

203
00:11:44.841 --> 00:11:47.420
not front to eight people.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you put it on TV?

204
00:11:47.421 --> 00:11:51.020
So weird being credible?
It would be incredible.
Yeah.
You know,

205
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.700
I wish I could speak Portuguese too.
When they start shit to Raja.

206
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.080
I know afterwards,
what did they say?
No Man do.

207
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:03.280
I thought about learning Portuguese just to understand what kind of things

208
00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:08.130
presented fighters are saying to each other.
Go there,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

209
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.200
I'm going to Brazil this weekend.
Oh cool.
You've been in a lot of times.
Yeah.

210
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.430
You've been times they're the most passionate UFC fans of all time.

211
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.670
No one is as passionate as a Brazilian fans.

212
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.600
He's got a huge doing huge numbers in Brazil.
He knew the ultimate fighter.

213
00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:25.450
Brazil did 12 million people.

214
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:29.920
It's first episode like right,
what the fuck man?

215
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.060
Brazil is just going to like print money in the basement.
They love fighting men.

216
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:38.260
They love it.
They love it.
The crowds are insanely appreciative.
They're,

217
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:41.590
they're like,
they're so fucking fired up when you go there,
man,
it's,

218
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:44.710
it's really infectious.
Like from the moment the first fights,

219
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.030
the place was packed.
It was no like Casual Vegas,

220
00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:49.930
hipster

221
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.760
MTC ECOMAINE is let's get there.
They're going to lose your seat there.
You know,

222
00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:01.950
I went to a small show and a knit near Rio and it was like tons of little kids

223
00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:06.940
running around and raining and people,
it was fun.
You know,

224
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.300
it's amazing.
It's amazing.
It's like a paradise,
you know,

225
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:12.810
for all the things that people complain about of a,
you know,

226
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.470
the poverty and the crime and things like that.

227
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.620
What you don't see is like this really happy,

228
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:21.130
carefree lifestyle that we just can't appreciate any believable.

229
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.450
7:00 AM me and Ari were sitting out on my balcony Chelan and we're watching the

230
00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:26.830
kids running to the beach,

231
00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:30.790
playing soccer at 7:00 AM what fat American kids so sporty.

232
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.630
Do try to keep up with your Brazilian friends over the weekend and then we're

233
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:37.030
going to play this and this and then we're going to go beach volleyball and then

234
00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:39.480
we'll go on and hang gliding and we're going up the mountain.
You're like,
wait,

235
00:13:39.481 --> 00:13:43.510
what?
That's to that morning.
It's Sunday morning.
We're doing that.
Yeah.

236
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:47.440
It's a crazy culture.
I mean,
one of the greatest Jujitsu players ever.

237
00:13:47.441 --> 00:13:49.890
A Holst Gracie,
he died from a hang gliding

238
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.270
wild.
It's all that sports.
I mean,
sorry.

239
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.440
I was trying to describe it to my friends and I was like,
you know,

240
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.830
imagine Manhattan with like a beautiful beach instead of the river.

241
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.870
You know what I mean?
Like a beautiful deep water and it's,
it's,

242
00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.520
it's such an honor,
like a magical place.
That's a thing too,
man.

243
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:12.640
You are affected by your environment,

244
00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:15.370
by your physical environment where you live in a beautiful place.

245
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.410
There's a reason.
One of the reasons I think why people in Vancouver are so nice.

246
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.760
I really think that being up there,
when you're looking at whistler,

247
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.110
you see the mountains,
you see that the water and the the islands and shit.

248
00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:32.860
You're like,
God damn,
this is gorgeous.
It looks elegant.

249
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:38.620
It looks like it's CG.
It almost goes small cap mountains right down,

250
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.870
right down the alley,
the end of the alley.

251
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:44.860
There's this two buildings and then snow cap.
Yeah,
it's incredible.

252
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.550
It's so good for you.
Yeah.
I think of you like that.

253
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.640
Anything where you can see something,
some gorgeous nature.
Yeah.

254
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.890
You ever see those

255
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:58.510
<v 4>studies about what the Optum vista is for human being?
No.</v>

256
00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.681
So they had like,

257
00:14:59.681 --> 00:15:03.610
they have like hundreds and hundreds of photos and then that you rate the photo.

258
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.320
What makes you feel the most comfortable?
And it all goes back to like our,

259
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:10.620
our ancestry in the Savanna.
It's like you want to be,
you know,

260
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.310
a tree height or slightly elevated.
Um,

261
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:20.550
being able to see a long way with large animals in the mid ground and deep

262
00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:23.950
background.
Nothing close.
So nothing's threatening.
But there's like plenty,

263
00:15:23.951 --> 00:15:28.660
like there's hunting,
right,
right.
And that's the most comforting visuals.

264
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.080
And so like a big sculpture can stand in for that so that people will,
you know,

265
00:15:32.081 --> 00:15:34.080
a lot of these parks and stuff and you know,

266
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.330
we'll have a sculpture and that kind of is scratching that old,

267
00:15:37.331 --> 00:15:40.180
this digital itch you have as a cave.
Yeah.

268
00:15:40.181 --> 00:15:43.300
I mean look it up cause I don't know the specifics,
but it was a cool,

269
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.230
like what's the perfect view for what that most relaxes you?

270
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.450
<v 3>Well that really makes sense if you really stop and think about it because those</v>

271
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:54.410
reward systems are just hammered into our consciousness.
There's no,

272
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:58.250
or our DNA rather.
There's no way to sort of get that,
that,

273
00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.900
that did just a ghost of it out of the oh no.
The human consciousness.

274
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.250
And if you've been hunting,
yes,
I have.
Yeah.
Yeah.

275
00:16:05.251 --> 00:16:08.110
I went hunting for this last book and I,
and I loved it.
Yeah.
Great time.

276
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:11.780
I'm going hunting for the first time in October with the Steve Rinella
character.

277
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:15.200
He's nice.
Who's on this TV show called,
um,
uh,

278
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.730
the wild within and he's got a new one called meat eater.
Great.
And he goes,

279
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:23.550
these fucked up places in Alaska.
Are you going like bear?
No deer dear.

280
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.330
Cool.
I wanted to go after something that I would really be eating.

281
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.310
He mentioned bear first and apparently you can eat bears,
but it's,

282
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:32.270
I guess it's trickier.

283
00:16:32.271 --> 00:16:37.090
I just don't want them want to feel bad about eating something.
I went,
uh,

284
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.480
elk hunting and uh,
love elk.
I love it.
It's delicious.
Delicious,

285
00:16:41.481 --> 00:16:45.530
like crazy rocket fuel for your body.
So lean,

286
00:16:45.531 --> 00:16:48.210
you get a huge plate and you're hungry.
Like if that's all you eat your stuff.

287
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.910
But,
uh,
I didn't feel guilty and I thought I was going to.
Yeah.
And

288
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:54.071
<v 4>you know,</v>

289
00:16:54.071 --> 00:16:57.070
I think part of it was I was with a guy guy who was really kind of holding my

290
00:16:57.071 --> 00:16:58.350
hand and he was sort of like,
he,

291
00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.670
I was just pulling the trigger basically in holding the rifle.

292
00:17:00.671 --> 00:17:04.990
He was sort of teaching me to hunt,
but also,
yeah,
I thought,

293
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.270
I don't know why exactly.
I thought I was going to feel guilty,

294
00:17:07.271 --> 00:17:09.580
like I've been around hunts before and I've been like,
oh,

295
00:17:09.581 --> 00:17:10.540
I don't kill that thing.

296
00:17:10.541 --> 00:17:14.050
Or I was in the Amazon and I talked to his guys at a kill and a monkey,
you know,

297
00:17:14.051 --> 00:17:18.090
I was like,
don't kill a monkey,
you know,
I'm not that hungry.
And,
uh,

298
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.630
<v 3>they were going to kill a monkey to eat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,</v>

299
00:17:20.631 --> 00:17:23.970
were you doing in the Amazon?
I was just chilling for real.
Yeah,
I was,

300
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.070
I had a,
you know,
I had a,
I had a pill,
kill that monkey.
I'm not that hungry bag.

301
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.430
<v 4>I'm hungry too.
Uh,
these guys had two blocks.
Long Story.</v>

302
00:17:34.431 --> 00:17:36.530
They had two bullets and one of them was no good.

303
00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:39.320
We were there for like three weeks.
Whoa.
And it's like,
come on guys.

304
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:43.280
I would have sprung for it for a box of bullets.
Guys,
you know,
if he told me,

305
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:48.110
she's just so,
what'd you guys do?
Uh,
we caught fish and they,
the other boat,

306
00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:49.470
we did kill a bird,
like a,

307
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.920
it's like a Ptarmigan and kind of like a big jungle chicken.

308
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:57.330
They called in and yeah.
Ate Fruit and got a little skinny.
Wow.

309
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.900
That must've been kind of spooky.
It was,
it was fun.
I mean,
I was,
I had just got,

310
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:01.051
you know,

311
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:03.720
my wife had just had a baby and then we sort of gotten through the first eight

312
00:18:03.721 --> 00:18:07.310
months and then I was like,
you know,
peace,
this is,
I'm going to go back to my,

313
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.170
like,
you know,
exist.
And so they used to travel and write.
That's what I did.

314
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.900
And uh,
so you went down to the Amazon flex six weeks.
Wow.

315
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:20.640
And did that and uh,
when we hiked and built a raft,
I fault people.

316
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:25.010
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I had a like two guides and they brought their friends.

317
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.550
It was like these,
it ended up being like,
it kind of guides.

318
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.990
You didn't go with any of your friends?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Really.

319
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:38.570
So you just decided you don't have any friends?
No,
no.
I do have friends.
I mean,

320
00:18:38.571 --> 00:18:42.730
sort of.
You decided to hire some guys,

321
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.710
take it to the Amazon.
You'll appreciate this.
You know why?
We know why,

322
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.610
how it went down.
Oh,
I was going to go see Tony D'souza.
Oh,
okay.
And Peruse.

323
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:54.300
Who's go,
where's that?
[inaudible] it's high.

324
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.180
It's like 11,000 feet.
It's a beautiful place,
by the way,
if you ever,

325
00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:01.620
it's awesome.
But Tony had been getting into all this.
You don't,
Tony's like,

326
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:02.733
Ooh,

327
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.840
he's been getting into all this crazy stuff in the jungle and he was going to

328
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:10.020
show me,
you know,
he's going to show me these like sites and burial sites.

329
00:19:10.021 --> 00:19:12.540
And so I was like,
cool.
You know,
I want to go down and never been to Peru.

330
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.250
But Tony,
his wife was having a baby in Argentina,
so he was,
he skipped out on me.

331
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.550
So then I was trying to entertain myself and I was like,
I know what I'll do.

332
00:19:20.551 --> 00:19:23.740
I'll go and never been in the Amazon.
And so I went,
um,

333
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.140
kind of in the northern part of the Amazon,
which starts the headwaters in Peru.

334
00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.730
Um,
and I was in a,
like a little,
you know,
they call an unexplored.

335
00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:34.770
It's not unexplored.
It's hunting trails everywhere,

336
00:19:34.771 --> 00:19:38.100
but it just means a botanist hasn't been there.
Um,
so the,
you know,

337
00:19:38.101 --> 00:19:39.650
there's potentially a new plan.

338
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.330
<v 1>Wow,
that's fascinating.
So it was really cool.
Yeah.</v>

339
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.870
So you went to a pretty rare area though.
Yeah.
Yeah.

340
00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:50.220
I wish I have you seen those?
Um,
a recent documentaries,

341
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.130
and I don't know recall the name of them,

342
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.160
but there's been some recent studies and trips where they've uncovered some

343
00:19:58.501 --> 00:20:01.830
ancient civilizations inside of the,
of the Amazon.
They,

344
00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.210
they've uncovered some ancient structures and some planning,

345
00:20:06.211 --> 00:20:08.760
like some city gridding and stuffs and they,
they're,

346
00:20:08.761 --> 00:20:12.780
they're really not exactly sure who,
who did it or for how old it is.

347
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.540
<v 4>I'm not,
I don't know much about it.
I mean,</v>

348
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.090
that's kind of what Tony was getting at.
I think,
you know,

349
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.000
and I know this is a lot of satellite imagery.

350
00:20:20.001 --> 00:20:23.720
They're finding stuff because they can see the tags rates from a distance,

351
00:20:23.721 --> 00:20:26.720
you know,
and there's a lot of stuff in that jungle,
you know,

352
00:20:26.721 --> 00:20:30.560
that jungles deep and,
and they don't know.
They don't know.
Yeah.

353
00:20:30.561 --> 00:20:33.170
There's like drug dealers in there.
Yeah.
You know,

354
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.500
people that are hundreds of miles from,
I mean there's,

355
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.230
there's undiscovered tribes.
I don't know if there are still there are no,
no,
no.

356
00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.310
I know because I was actually part of this TV show pitch that didn't happen,

357
00:20:43.311 --> 00:20:48.190
but there's like a couple thousand mostly in the Mardi gras on one,

358
00:20:48.191 --> 00:20:51.700
which is in Brazil.
It's in sort of south of the,
uh,
of the Amazon.

359
00:20:51.701 --> 00:20:56.590
But yeah,
like to estimate,
you know,
two or 3000 people.

360
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.900
Wow.
Just living in the jungle and contacted.

361
00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:02.740
<v 1>Yeah,
that's crazy.
Cause you know,
there was a recent,
there was footage of,</v>

362
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.830
there was film footage and there was photos of an uncontacted tribe in the

363
00:21:06.831 --> 00:21:10.460
Amazon that turned out to be a hoax.
I'm sure there's plenty of that,

364
00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.640
but you think they're,
they're really still are.

365
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.900
<v 4>That's what they say.
You know,
they say there's a couple thousand,</v>

366
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.770
that's the big group.
There's a couple,
I want to say,

367
00:21:20.771 --> 00:21:23.530
there might be something in Indonesia as well or like,
you know,

368
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.080
pop into Guinea or something,
but it's a much smaller group.

369
00:21:26.081 --> 00:21:27.940
So what a crazy lifestyle.

370
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.390
They're in the middle of the jungle living just living off the land and they're

371
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:32.620
people like you or I,

372
00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:37.330
they could have gone to Harvard to get their brain is exactly or just exactly as

373
00:21:37.331 --> 00:21:38.050
smart as us,

374
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.890
just like you and they're living essentially like people live thousands of years

375
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.890
ago.
Well that was what you really realize is that's how we're all supposed to be

376
00:21:44.891 --> 00:21:48.160
living.
That's what you really evolve to do.

377
00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:52.810
And like all this like shouldn't we move past that?
It shouldn't we or should we?

378
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.890
I think,
you know,
we,
we've,
we have and we have to be the art and science,

379
00:21:56.891 --> 00:21:58.480
you know,
everything comes from it.

380
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.170
But also like fucking fantasy football comes from it because like you're,

381
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.280
you're supposed to be this incredible student of your environment.
Like you know,

382
00:22:06.281 --> 00:22:08.650
if you,
I just always think about it like a little kid.

383
00:22:08.651 --> 00:22:10.420
Like when you were a little kid and you had a yard,

384
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.300
like you knew your yard so intimately,
right?

385
00:22:13.301 --> 00:22:17.530
You knew like every corner and like the sand and the texture of the grass and

386
00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:21.430
that's what you'd be like as an adult.
Over like a 10 mile chunk of land.

387
00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:24.370
You would just,
you would like feel kind of what's going on there.
You know,

388
00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:27.880
where the animals are and all your expertise.

389
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.840
Everything you ever learned to be good at would be focused on survival,

390
00:22:31.841 --> 00:22:35.440
hunting and fishing and yeah,
that would be your new game.
That'd be your,
that's,

391
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:39.820
that's without it.
Now you have fantasy football and now you have,
you know,

392
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.680
you need something to be an expert in.
You know what I mean?

393
00:22:41.681 --> 00:22:46.450
You have all this ability and if you're not using it,
it ends up,
you know,

394
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.560
at sports or ESPN,
but also,
you know,
math,
arts,
science,
you know,

395
00:22:50.561 --> 00:22:51.490
all human achievement.

396
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.220
<v 1>Yeah.
All Cuban achievements,
games,
all those things are there.</v>

397
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:59.080
They're essentially like sort of vehicles there.

398
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.760
They're vehicles for you to travel outside of the,

399
00:23:01.761 --> 00:23:05.420
the natural realm of the reward system.
Like instead of hunting,

400
00:23:05.421 --> 00:23:09.880
now you're playing chess.
Yeah.
Instead of fighting and transmogrified.
Yeah.

401
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.420
Toward it or it's weird how that happens.
Yeah.
That's the thing with the annex.

402
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.620
You know,
with addicts,

403
00:23:15.621 --> 00:23:18.950
the best thing for an addict is to get addicted to something really positive.

404
00:23:18.951 --> 00:23:23.300
Like golf or so running.
Running.
Yeah.
They say that you know,

405
00:23:23.301 --> 00:23:25.520
most self destructive,
crazy,

406
00:23:25.521 --> 00:23:30.521
addictive sort of behavior junkies and the like they can use that obsession.

407
00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.380
You know that a lot of it is just this,

408
00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:37.790
this ability to focus on things kind of crazily and they've connected that to a

409
00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:40.670
hunter gatherer cultures.
They say that that's why it exists.

410
00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:44.510
It exists because you had to have the ability to sit there for five hours and

411
00:23:44.511 --> 00:23:46.010
wait this deer out cause you

412
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.370
<v 3>had to eat that night and so you would focus there.
We're all going to die.</v>

413
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:50.204
Exactly.
Yeah.

414
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:55.340
You'd Focus Tensley on this one thing and become absolutely obsessed with it and

415
00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:57.440
that's how you would hunt.
That's how you would get animals.

416
00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.510
I mean how about persistence hunting?
Yeah,

417
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.360
I know in that crazy fucking completely insane.

418
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.730
That's what we used to do before we had weapons.

419
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.360
We chase things and we killed them with our fucking face cause they were so

420
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:10.700
tired.
You just walk up to him and strangle him or whatever.

421
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:15.260
Well it's funny because animals,
animals are la like fighters in the,

422
00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.460
the sprinters have shipped cardio.
They can't keep going and those deer,

423
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:22.970
they sprint and then they're fucking done.
Man.
If you keep going,

424
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.950
you keep chasing after him for like a day,

425
00:24:24.951 --> 00:24:28.130
they'll just drop her head and that's it.
They can't hear.
They can't handle it.

426
00:24:28.131 --> 00:24:30.410
They don't sweat.
Good.
Yeah.
So it's just like,
yeah,

427
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.400
like a lot of fighters that are like super explosive.
I know Trump muscular,

428
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.920
you know,
and the third round and like fuck this everybody.
Everybody's like,

429
00:24:36.921 --> 00:24:38.240
why can't they keep doing that?
And you're like,

430
00:24:38.241 --> 00:24:41.360
you don't know how much that's using up.
Every time he explodes.

431
00:24:41.361 --> 00:24:43.650
It's why he's going to wait.
It's interesting cause you know you,

432
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.950
you wonder about the racial side of things.
Of course,

433
00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:50.240
like you know when you see guys with tons of fast twitch black guys or whatever

434
00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:54.740
and then you know,
they don't have the,
sometimes the stamina is not,
you know,

435
00:24:54.741 --> 00:24:59.280
like their,
their stamina goes away,
right.
Because they're exploding and the home,

436
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:03.230
like all those receptors have to reset all your chemicals.

437
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.060
You have to find new ways of well and there's also psychological aspects of it,

438
00:25:08.061 --> 00:25:12.890
especially at the lower levels because the guys who are that like naturally

439
00:25:12.891 --> 00:25:15.250
athletic a lot of times don't have to work as hard.
Right.

440
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.470
And a lot of times they don't have the mental toughness of a guy who has had to

441
00:25:18.471 --> 00:25:22.910
grind it out his whole life because he has no fast twitch.
This is that.

442
00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:26.090
Now we're leading perfectly into this.
Next time I go.

443
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.960
This is actually something I really wanted to get into with you because I think

444
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:32.000
you're so well situated to see this,
you know,

445
00:25:32.001 --> 00:25:34.550
to see the mental side of things and and uh,

446
00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.740
in fighters and how they're watching guys,
moods change and stuff.

447
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:44.170
The question I had was have you ever seen stuff in the weigh ins that really

448
00:25:44.901 --> 00:25:49.180
gave the game away to you like that you knew something was hydrating,
right?

449
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.470
Extreme dehydrating was really the only thing.

450
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:56.480
Travis Luder is the worst example ever.
When Travis Luder fought Anderson Silva,

451
00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.540
he missed weight and it became a non title fight and I don't know what happened.

452
00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:04.280
Lino.
A lot of times something can happen during training.
Your body shuts down,

453
00:26:04.281 --> 00:26:07.160
you can't lose any water and you're fucked and that's where Travis was.

454
00:26:07.161 --> 00:26:11.930
He could not lose the extra weight and he stayed around after the weigh ins.

455
00:26:11.931 --> 00:26:14.780
He did the weigh ins,
Miss Weight and then tried to make the weight.

456
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:18.170
They gave him,
I believe that game a couple of hours,
but he couldn't do it man.

457
00:26:18.171 --> 00:26:21.770
He couldn't do it and he was shuffling towards the scale and I was like,

458
00:26:21.771 --> 00:26:25.490
Holy Shit.
He can't even walk.
Like he couldn't even step up and walk.

459
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.210
So I was like,
that's not a good sign.
That was any wound up losing by the way.

460
00:26:29.211 --> 00:26:33.590
He did fucking fantastic until you gassed until he got Travis Luder might be one

461
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:35.900
of the,
as far as like MMA goes,

462
00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:41.050
the one of the biggest loss potential guys that like when he was in his prime,

463
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.340
he was so physically his Jujitsu.

464
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:48.540
<v 1>It was so fucking solid and tight.
Yeah,
he missed the boat a little bit.
He just,</v>

465
00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:53.100
his cardio was never like never really went to like a full camp or you start off

466
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:54.660
doing it in his last couple of fights,

467
00:26:54.661 --> 00:26:57.240
but he should've done that when he was young.
You know,
he would,
uh,

468
00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.500
he would have been a fucking piece.

469
00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:02.400
His jujitsu was like head and shoulders above everybody and he had that kind of

470
00:27:02.401 --> 00:27:05.970
unstoppable quality.
I remember I talked to Charlie,
animal McCarthy said like,

471
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.760
you can never stop him from doing what he wanted.

472
00:27:08.761 --> 00:27:12.240
Like he was going to bull you across the cage and take you down on the far side.

473
00:27:12.241 --> 00:27:14.220
And then he was going to do what he did on the ground and like,

474
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:16.380
and that's what he did to Anderson Silva.
Like he really did.

475
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:20.010
He's a tough motherfucker.
I think if he was in shape and he was healthy,

476
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.300
Anderson Silva was fucked.

477
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.150
He was fucked because it was a bad time for Henderson to Anderson had double

478
00:27:25.151 --> 00:27:27.630
knee surgery six weeks before that fight.

479
00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.270
He had meniscus operation on both of his fucking needs.

480
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.620
So when I saw Anderson that night after the fight,
he was walking around limping.

481
00:27:34.621 --> 00:27:37.740
Like he just got double knee bard.
Right.
And nothing happened.

482
00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.790
You walked a triangle on Travis,
beat the shit out of him.
So he was,

483
00:27:41.791 --> 00:27:46.140
while his knees were in pain and he's beating the shit out of him.
Have a lot of,

484
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.460
that was one of the nastiest examples of what can happen if you get caught in a

485
00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.250
triangle.
It's gross.
Yeah,
because he doesn't just put you to sleep.

486
00:27:53.251 --> 00:27:56.820
He beats the fucking shit out of you inside of the triangle.
It was horrendous.

487
00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.570
I don't know.
Very rarely the guys tat I know from elbows from inside to try.

488
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.750
Weird scene Anderson's a motherfucker,
dude leaky tap from that.

489
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.850
But that Travis Luder fight was a perfect example of when I saw him at the way

490
00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:09.870
was like,
wow,
this guy might be in trouble.

491
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.040
So you've never seen like a emotional thing so hard to tell because some guys

492
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:17.040
look super nervous.
Jon Jones look super nervous when he fought Shogun,

493
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:21.180
not in the weigh ins,
but coming into the cage.
He was like,
he was really,

494
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.230
in my mind,

495
00:28:22.231 --> 00:28:25.950
it was like really reacting to the pressure where as opposed to when he fought,

496
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:30.450
um,
Quinten or in a,
in his last fight against Rashad,
he looked very calm.
He's,

497
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:34.680
he's becoming like,
not just,
he's not just ultra talented.

498
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.170
He's becoming ultra confident and not even an ultra competence.

499
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.520
He always was that,
but comfortable.
I'm okay.
He's like,

500
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.470
he's able to be himself in there.

501
00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.320
But when he looked a little nervous when he came out and fought Shogun,

502
00:28:46.321 --> 00:28:50.010
he fought fucking stellar.
So it doesn't mean anything.
Doesn't mean anything.

503
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:52.780
It doesn't mean anything.
I mean,
really.
Yeah.

504
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.160
I mean sometimes you see a guy and you say,
Oh,
you know,
I mean,
it's like,

505
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.230
you know,
when you're,
I try not to do this too much,

506
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:59.980
but when you're doing commentary,
yeah.

507
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.700
You want to think of something good to say.
You look at his face,

508
00:29:02.701 --> 00:29:05.340
he looks fired up.
You Go,
the dude looks fired up.
You know what I mean?

509
00:29:05.341 --> 00:29:08.880
You got to say it.
If you feel it,
even though it does sound,
it's kind of cliche.

510
00:29:08.881 --> 00:29:10.490
Look at the look at his eyes,
you know?
Well,

511
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.220
but I mean that's part of what you're doing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Setting it up.

512
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:17.130
But it is true too.
I mean,
I,
you know,
some guys,
they come in,

513
00:29:17.131 --> 00:29:21.700
they look fucking super focused.
You know what I just was thinking of this.
I,
I,

514
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.470
when I saw may have Miller fight,
um,
it was it,
who do you look terrible with?

515
00:29:25.471 --> 00:29:28.320
The biz.
Bisping?
Yeah.
I saw him and walked out.
I mean,

516
00:29:28.321 --> 00:29:30.750
I was watching it on TV and I saw him walk down the aisle and I was like,

517
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:35.430
oh my God,
mayhem.
It's got something to lose.
Uh,
you know what I mean?

518
00:29:35.431 --> 00:29:38.570
I caught them a little bit about it,
but at the time I was like,
oh my God,

519
00:29:38.571 --> 00:29:42.010
look at his face.
He's just got something to lose.
He's,
he was nervous

520
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.070
<v 3>not about getting it,
you know,
hurt or anything,
but he had a name now,</v>

521
00:29:45.071 --> 00:29:48.060
you know what I mean?
And it was like he was,
he was somebody,

522
00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:53.530
we wasn't the gun coming in the crazy man.
Who cares if he wins or loses?

523
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.280
Oh yeah.
Isn't that interesting?
Yeah.
It changes.
Yeah.

524
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.300
I thought that was really interesting.
Well,
you know,

525
00:29:58.301 --> 00:30:03.130
it's the hardest thing is I think becoming really good and then getting better.

526
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.100
You know,

527
00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.690
it's funny cause that's what one of the things in that fighter's mind book was

528
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:11.020
talking to,
you know,
um,
sports psychologists,

529
00:30:11.021 --> 00:30:14.440
you'd do like big golfers and stuff like that.
And there was this guy would say,

530
00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:18.010
you know,
if you hit it in the water,
you don't have a job.

531
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:22.040
But if you worry about that,
you're not going to make the shot.
Like you can't,

532
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:22.990
it's like you have to give it,

533
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.340
you have to not be scared enough to let it hang out.
You know what I mean?

534
00:30:27.341 --> 00:30:30.850
Like that Dan Henderson quality of,
right.
Well,
you know,

535
00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:33.460
it was where it's a sport.
What's really Po,
at least in golf,

536
00:30:33.461 --> 00:30:35.560
there's millions of dollars.
I mean,
those guys,

537
00:30:35.561 --> 00:30:38.350
when they're playing professionally,
they're already making money.

538
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.790
Pool players have a part of than anybody.
Oh,
a top level of pool player.

539
00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:46.690
It makes a hundred grand a year,
200 grand a year,
the best in the world.
You know,

540
00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.760
that's,
that's a real struggle.

541
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.200
So there's guys that are like former world champions that are like on the grind

542
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:58.060
trying to play and not a weekend tournament to win 1000 bucks.
You know,

543
00:30:58.061 --> 00:31:00.970
like the whole weekend you play and if you win you win 1000 bucks.

544
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:04.500
That's like common.
That's normal.
That's a normal week.
Wow.
Yeah.

545
00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:08.770
And you try to learn anything about it.
It's fucking brutal in every shot.

546
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:14.380
Consistencies so tough to maintain and hard to maintain focus,

547
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:19.040
you know,
anything where you worry about losing anything,
right?
Like in,

548
00:31:19.041 --> 00:31:21.490
in the game of pool.
If you worry about missing a shot,

549
00:31:21.491 --> 00:31:23.850
you're gonna fucking miss a shot period.
Absolutely.

550
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.320
If you start thinking about what if it rattles in the pocket,

551
00:31:26.321 --> 00:31:30.760
like you're literally projecting that you have to not just be good,

552
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:31.660
not just know what you're doing,

553
00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:35.530
but you have to have a clear idea what's going to happen.
Your thought process,

554
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.660
you know,
it doesn't mean you're always gonna make the ball.

555
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.450
But it definitely means you're going to fucking miss if we don't have that

556
00:31:40.451 --> 00:31:43.960
thought process in place.
And I believe that's the same thing with fighting.

557
00:31:43.961 --> 00:31:46.330
I think we,
I think that exists with everything.

558
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.130
The more negative thoughts you'd like.

559
00:31:48.131 --> 00:31:50.320
I've had some really bad comedy sets in my life.

560
00:31:50.321 --> 00:31:52.910
I've had some fucking horrendous bombing.

561
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:56.260
I've sucked some credible buckets of cock on stage,

562
00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:00.310
but every time I did it,
I was worried about doing that.

563
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.230
Every time I did it wasn't either.

564
00:32:02.231 --> 00:32:07.180
I wasn't confident enough with where I was as a comedian at the time or with my

565
00:32:07.181 --> 00:32:11.380
material or rather there was a reason,
you know?
And that overwhelmed me.

566
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.240
I wasn't ready for that.
You know,

567
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:17.420
for whatever reason I hadn't learned those lessons yet.
I think with,

568
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.000
with martial arts,

569
00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:23.650
it's way harder than anything else because like we were talking about with like

570
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:24.940
caveman reward systems,

571
00:32:24.941 --> 00:32:28.600
I mean that is the reward system that is the ultimate sport.

572
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:32.890
I mean this is nothing else that even comes close to it in terms of like the

573
00:32:32.891 --> 00:32:37.510
visceral connection with the human psyche than a one on one combat with another

574
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:40.130
man.
A hundred is so crushing,
just this

575
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.340
<v 2>devastating,
devastating,
I forget who it was,
but somebody said it's like,</v>

576
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:46.630
it's like sucking a thousand dicks.
I do any of your money and what was that new?

577
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.670
So bread is bombing on stage and getting your ass kicked.

578
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.220
That's like the most brilliant thing I've ever heard that all the time.

579
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:55.340
Cause it's like,
it's a little got little shock value.
You know what I mean?
It is.

580
00:32:55.341 --> 00:32:57.230
It's like sucking dicks in front of your mother.

581
00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:02.600
Getting especially like getting knocked out by a guy that's really hard.

582
00:33:02.601 --> 00:33:05.660
You know,
it's that thing about,
you know,
how much we value free will.

583
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:09.740
And something I really wrote about was like,
you know,
if you're unconscious,

584
00:33:09.741 --> 00:33:12.370
I can do whatever the fuck I want to you.
You've lost your free will.

585
00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:14.930
You know what I mean?
You're,
you're done.
And I think that's kind of,

586
00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.590
there's like a silly aspect of fighting sometimes when guys will say,

587
00:33:18.591 --> 00:33:21.320
I'm willing to die in there.
You know,
like really,
you're not going to die.

588
00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:22.940
You know.
But you have to think that though.

589
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.570
You do absolutely yourself to a dangerous,
dangerous place.

590
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.210
You have to be content.
Let's like being content with failure.
You're like,

591
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:34.190
if I die,
so be it.
That's important.
But also it's kind of about valuing that,

592
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:39.320
you know,
I'd sooner die than let you dominate me.
That kind of kind of mentality.

593
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:42.590
You know?
Like that's,
that's a big thing.
Randy couture talked a lot about,

594
00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:46.220
you know what you were saying with negative thoughts.
He would,
because he was,

595
00:33:46.221 --> 00:33:50.360
when he was coaching wrestlers,
he would say,
if I yelled at somebody like,

596
00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:54.650
you know,
don't get,
don't get taken down.
They get taken down,
right?
Then boom,

597
00:33:54.651 --> 00:33:58.010
they're down.
Whereas instead,
if I realized,
if I was like,
you know,

598
00:33:58.011 --> 00:34:01.340
work at the under hook at the under Hook Dude,
all this positive,

599
00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:05.900
give him something that he knows what to do,
then you can,
you can have success.

600
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.740
Which was an interesting,
you know,
sort of very simple lesson,
but it was a,
well,

601
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.800
nothing's worse than someone standing next to you telling you what not to do.

602
00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:17.210
Right.
That's a terrible thing.
Don't be not funny.
Yeah.

603
00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.440
We'll say anything stupid.
It's impossible.
Don't pull your cock out.

604
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.690
What's the fuck man?

605
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.230
I mean that is the one of the reasons why Catholic school girls would come
sluts.

606
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.800
Yeah,
right.
Absolutely.
There's a reaction.
What are you going to do?

607
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.430
People don't like suppression.
It doesn't work.
It doesn't work,
man.

608
00:34:34.431 --> 00:34:37.130
It doesn't work.
Yeah.
I tell it to parents all the time like that.

609
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:40.730
That shit doesn't work.
Her courage.
No.
Know those girls don't do it.
Don't do it.

610
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.840
Yeah.
Encouragement is where it's at.
Yeah.

611
00:34:42.841 --> 00:34:47.660
For suppression just creates part off stores.
Right?
Exactly.
Like we all need,

612
00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:52.520
it's such a weird thing.
The world fucking has a balance to it all.
I guess so.

613
00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.590
I think we were pretending it does.

614
00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:57.890
I wonder if we get to a point where we have CGI porn.
We'll,
we'll go.

615
00:34:57.891 --> 00:34:59.450
You know what?
We've got to start taking care of our kids.

616
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.560
They have that in Japan.
Do they have all that intimate anime porn?

617
00:35:03.561 --> 00:35:05.630
It's not real though.
It doesn't like no people.

618
00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:10.100
I mean like porn plugging into your brain or something where it looks like real

619
00:35:10.101 --> 00:35:13.460
humans.
Oh,
right.
If it's just going to,
I mean eventually it'll be the brain,

620
00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:17.930
but instead of looking at actual people,
fucking it was all CG.
Yeah.

621
00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.400
All CJ.
I mean that's,
that reality is not far away.
No.

622
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.370
Mean I would say it's probably here in some computer guys layer somewhere.

623
00:35:25.371 --> 00:35:29.810
You're not quite,
but it's pretty God damn close.
It's like you remember,
um,
uh,

624
00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:34.400
I am legend.
Yes.
Remember how bad the lions looked?
Yeah.
I mean,

625
00:35:34.401 --> 00:35:38.640
I vaguely remember the zombies not working at all.
Zombies weren't so good,

626
00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:41.910
but at least they were monsters.
I can accept some crazy looking at monsters,

627
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:46.230
but I know what a fucking lion looks like.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That ain't it.

628
00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.160
That's a fake ass look and law.
I mean,
listen,

629
00:35:48.161 --> 00:35:51.610
even if you can pull that up because it's so ridiculous.
Pull up this scene.

630
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:56.670
The lion scene in I am legend,

631
00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:01.180
fake Lyons and I am legend cause it looks so stupid.
It's gotta be online.

632
00:36:01.181 --> 00:36:05.890
Even the star wars,
to me,
the models look better.
The models had a little bit of,

633
00:36:05.891 --> 00:36:09.450
there's some million little details like your eyes aren't picking up or your

634
00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:13.750
conscious mind isn't picking up of like the weight of the model and the way the

635
00:36:13.751 --> 00:36:17.560
light is casting on the model versus the cgs like beautiful.

636
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:21.130
But it looks flat and it doesn't look,
you know,
it's not as good.

637
00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:24.880
It's not a real job.
Not as good but the fucking law,
you know,
whatever.
I mean,

638
00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.520
but CG for some shit is the way to go.

639
00:36:27.521 --> 00:36:31.840
Like they tried to do that wolf man movie with Benicio Del Toro and they tried

640
00:36:31.841 --> 00:36:35.030
to go with the models and stuff with like a Basque.
He's going to go

641
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:41.080
bad.
I was like,
no,
you can't do it anymore.
It's a tough one.
Yeah.
But they still,

642
00:36:41.081 --> 00:36:45.670
they spliced in some CGI shit like when he was running on rooftops,

643
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:49.960
CGI.
So it was like,
wait a minute,
you've got to fucking make a quick one here.

644
00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.870
Pick ones.
One of the other,
these sons of bitches lines.

645
00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.640
These lines are so bad looking.
First of all,
what a fucking bad ass movie.

646
00:36:57.641 --> 00:37:00.960
Cause I enjoyed it.
Even though it did have shit.
Special effects.
Yeah.

647
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:03.590
The lines didn't really bother me too much.
Oh No.

648
00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.570
I interested to see how really the idea of like being in Manhattan and hunting

649
00:37:07.571 --> 00:37:11.420
is cool.
Great.
I,
this is a,
this is what I'm talking about.
This,
it's such a,

650
00:37:11.421 --> 00:37:16.421
like a fervent myth of like the city's mine and like I can go wherever I want

651
00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:21.880
whenever I want and yeah,
that is a,
it's,
this is my new book.

652
00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:27.130
I actually got into this with some like professors and shit about like what the

653
00:37:27.131 --> 00:37:31.860
empty city means.
What does it mean?
You know,
it's tough.
I mean it's,

654
00:37:31.861 --> 00:37:34.990
it's,
it's a,
there's a historic,
you know,
it's Mary Shelley,

655
00:37:34.991 --> 00:37:39.991
the woman who invented Frankenstein wrote the first post apocalyptic novel real

656
00:37:40.301 --> 00:37:44.750
at the last man.
Whoa.
Pretty Wild,
right?
Mary Shelley was a bad,

657
00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.130
good imagination on your Mary.
We're going to go Mary,

658
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.170
I wonder if she was taking milk of the poppy

659
00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:56.170
and opium meters to Mary.
We eat and hand she,

660
00:37:56.171 --> 00:37:59.410
this is the beers out there and the deers fake too.

661
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:02.110
And he's getting ready to shoot the deer and the dean doesn't look too bad,

662
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:07.340
but sweat.
How bad this line looks aligned.
Came out and took down the tier.

663
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:11.650
That's okay right there.
But look at this whack ass fake lion.
Watch.

664
00:38:11.651 --> 00:38:14.920
How stupid the Luke's
Simba.

665
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:21.880
That's pretty straight so far.
No.
Look at this fake ass son.
Yeah,

666
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.290
no,
it looks like it looks like the Mgm Lion or thing is walking so fake.

667
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:32.310
It's not walking on that crown.
It looks like it would talk.
Yeah.

668
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.180
Well I'm as loud.

669
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:39.220
It's just looking at a video off of youtube too.

670
00:38:39.221 --> 00:38:41.680
If you look at it in high definition,
it's really obvious

671
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.640
to see that stupid looking line just staring at it.
Was that bad?
That's terrible.

672
00:38:47.641 --> 00:38:48.470
Over to be critical.

673
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:52.000
While you're looking at it in a terrible low resolution video.
I'll show you.

674
00:38:52.001 --> 00:38:54.620
I'll show you something crazy.
Or did you see this?
What they,
uh,

675
00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:59.020
that small town in China where they thought they found this like rare mushroom.

676
00:38:59.021 --> 00:39:03.220
It's a flashlight.
Yeah,
it's true.
It's a sex toy.
You kidding me?
Yeah.

677
00:39:03.221 --> 00:39:08.221
Look at us like they did a whole report about how they found this mushrooms and

678
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:11.830
they couldn't tell until like the next day people were like,
dude,

679
00:39:11.831 --> 00:39:14.170
that's a fleshlight.
You're hearing this.
Oh my God,

680
00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.490
what whole fleshlight awesome.
You're wondering,

681
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:24.530
is this crazy?
Is this a scam?
That's what I'm wondering,
is it?
No,

682
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.710
I don't think so because I mean I looked at it,

683
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:30.860
it was like on a lot of news light thing.
Yeah.
I mean they knew that,
oh my God,

684
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.010
Look Brian,

685
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.250
you sure this isn't even a real fresh like cause it's got a butt hole on one

686
00:39:36.251 --> 00:39:38.910
side and a fleshlight than the other.
That's a fake fleshlight.

687
00:39:38.911 --> 00:39:41.900
It's a fake knock off.
I could see where it kind of looks like,
I'm not sure.

688
00:39:41.901 --> 00:39:44.470
My mom,
man,
these people know what plastic is.

689
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:48.310
They wouldn't know that that's plastic.
This is a Goddamn scam.

690
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.820
Well I know that the,
the,

691
00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:54.850
the news company is legit and they had to give like this like apology letter.

692
00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.130
Maybe it's a scam.
Maybe it's a scam to the deepest level.

693
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.290
Maybe the news companies in there ain't on it.

694
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:07.210
These mother fuckers that surprise anyone touching it,

695
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:12.040
but I told him be more,
be more the webs.
The webs of ownership.

696
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:16.360
Yeah.
I get nothing.
Nothing shocks me anymore.
I love it.

697
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:21.190
It's crazy.
I know.
I saw a lion,
a lion kill a hog in Africa.

698
00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.430
When I was walking,
I was in on the foot and I saw him.

699
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.280
You saw the run and you saw like a pole and then you were on foot.
Yeah,

700
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:34.290
we had to get out of there because it's dangerous when the mail came in and

701
00:40:34.781 --> 00:40:37.930
he'll drive the females off and take it and then there'll be pissed and they'll

702
00:40:37.931 --> 00:40:41.740
come out and look at whatever you have to get out of there.
You,
oh my God.

703
00:40:41.741 --> 00:40:44.590
But it sounded like when he started roaring and sounded like he was amped,

704
00:40:44.591 --> 00:40:47.400
it sounded like there was like a,
like he had a mic and was,
there was like a,

705
00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:52.420
you know like a big stereo system back there.
Somebody cranking the line.
Yeah.

706
00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.880
So loud.
It's supposed to been weird.
It was pretty weird.

707
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.360
It's pretty cool to be around a giant cat roaring.
And it's,

708
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:03.620
how far away was it from you?
I mean the,
I mean the kid was pretty close.

709
00:41:03.621 --> 00:41:05.770
It was like maybe,
I mean it's a while ago,

710
00:41:05.771 --> 00:41:09.340
but a hundred yards or something like that,
you know,
not bad.
But,
uh,

711
00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.400
then we get into the car.
This,

712
00:41:11.401 --> 00:41:14.470
these guys came around with their jeeps and we got in.
Now you're safe.

713
00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:16.300
Like they don't care.
They don't,
they don't react.

714
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.470
That doesn't read his prey car doesn't read this.

715
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.660
Even though it's an open air jeep like lions never met.

716
00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:27.600
They don't mess with it because it doesn't read.
They don't care.
I can't,

717
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.970
I'm not buying that.
That's not,
it's not going to come into the jeep and drive.

718
00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:34.010
Fuck is that,
did they have guns that cheap?
Uh,

719
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.630
<v 4>we had,
yeah,
you guys had rifles.</v>

720
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:39.860
We almost had to kill an elephant on that trip while I was chasing us.
Yeah,
yeah,

721
00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:41.690
yeah.
On foot.

722
00:41:41.691 --> 00:41:46.220
We were walking and this young male elephant and it's like being followed home

723
00:41:46.221 --> 00:41:47.690
by a mugger,
you know what I mean?

724
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.230
Cause he's like still coming or like walk faster.
I actually,

725
00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:55.810
this is a funny story.
So they're like,
okay,
on an elephant charges,
he'll come,

726
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:59.750
they'll say he'll mock charge once or twice so you don't run because then he'll

727
00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:02.430
chase you so you don't,
don't run.
Right.

728
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:07.040
So cause he'll come and he'll make noise and the waivers years.

729
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.610
So we,
we were loose,
awesome elephants crossing these fields.

730
00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:14.680
We snuck around and I was with two guides to African guides and we sat down and

731
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:18.110
there was a couple of other tourists like me that were there.
And uh,

732
00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.850
this one elephant starts coming closer and he starts breaking stuff and getting

733
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:26.370
a little pissy and then he charges and I see the guard,

734
00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:30.890
the guides sprinting by me.
You know what I mean?
Like pushing little ladies over,

735
00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:34.220
not like nobody's standing up and I'm like,

736
00:42:34.221 --> 00:42:36.470
no charge and they're going to go to the guides.

737
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:39.710
So I turned and ran and then the,
the one,

738
00:42:39.711 --> 00:42:42.680
one of the guides turned around and he didn't have the right round.

739
00:42:42.681 --> 00:42:44.970
Chambered like to kill an elephant,
you need a big,
you know,

740
00:42:44.971 --> 00:42:47.390
a huge arc armor piercing,
round,
whatever.

741
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:51.560
He was like trying to get in his rifle and he sort of stripped it down and it

742
00:42:51.561 --> 00:42:56.480
did,
it backed off.
Oh Jesus.
But then it followed us for like maybe two miles.

743
00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:00.650
Oh my God.
Like you know,
at like 400 yards,
300 yards coming closer.

744
00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:03.890
But you'd look back and have her just coming along

745
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:08.720
<v 3>and it rarely possible that someone in that elephants life fucked with one of</v>

746
00:43:08.721 --> 00:43:10.880
it's loved ones and it was a person that shot one.

747
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:12.830
Well they're going to have to kill us a bad to kill it,

748
00:43:12.831 --> 00:43:16.130
I'm sure at some point because that was,
that was not too far from Kruger Park.

749
00:43:16.131 --> 00:43:19.860
So there's a lot of traffic and,
and he,
they have overcrowding elephant,

750
00:43:19.861 --> 00:43:21.680
so they have to kill the really aggressive ones.

751
00:43:21.681 --> 00:43:22.720
They usually kill him from Halligan.

752
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:27.590
What makes them aggressive visit any young males show.
Just young dickheads.

753
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:31.100
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
Elephants are so smart,
man.

754
00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.820
It's amazing.
Like how much information they store in their hands.

755
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:38.020
Elephants can draw pictures of themselves and ever seen.

756
00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:41.260
I've seen some of that stuff.
The Thailand stuff.
Crazy.
Yeah,

757
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.750
and they recognize each other after like seven,
10 year job.
His fault.

758
00:43:44.751 --> 00:43:48.320
When you first see that elephant painting that thing,
it's like,
yeah,
like what?

759
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:50.600
It's like,
yeah,
you're like,
I want to start crying or something.

760
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:54.770
You ever seen elephant get taken down by a line?
No.
Where did you see that?

761
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:59.170
Oh my God.
Not In person.
Online is that there's a bunch of lions.

762
00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:02.200
When lines get super hungry,
there's nothing they can do.
They'll,

763
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.340
they'll take a chance and try and take down an elephant.

764
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:06.220
It's a bunch of them and they cheat.

765
00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:09.920
They're jumping on this fucking line and taking it down.
It's really crazy.

766
00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.620
And they get the lion to a point where it's almost dead.

767
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.360
Like they're holding it down in the line,

768
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:17.820
freaks out and jumps up and goes for a fucking mad run.
Look at it.

769
00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:22.350
It's this elephants painting itself fucking crazy.
It's crazy.
It's completed.

770
00:44:22.351 --> 00:44:26.540
And I've seen this before in the beginning.
It's like this most beautiful,
well,

771
00:44:26.541 --> 00:44:28.250
not only that,
you have to stop and think,

772
00:44:28.251 --> 00:44:32.310
not only is this elephant capable of the fine motor that it takes to paint.

773
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.110
How long has he been painting?

774
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:37.140
Because if you gave that to a child and acid a pain,
trust me,

775
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:39.450
I have a two year old and you can't recognize anything she does.

776
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:44.610
I have a four year old and at four years old now I'm starting to see like where

777
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:48.800
this is a rabbit.
This is a person that often has a nice hand.
Nice.

778
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:50.280
That's a nice in the ear.

779
00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:53.970
That was like a nice aesthetic sort of line weight and I went to one school man

780
00:44:53.971 --> 00:44:57.780
line.
Wait,
there you go.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah,
like a tattoo.
Yeah.

781
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:02.130
It's amazing.
The elephants can be super smart,
man.
Now they're amazing.

782
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.070
I remember there was one and when I was living in Thailand at that camp,

783
00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:06.840
there was one a couple behind the camp.

784
00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:10.260
It was so you'd go a sleep in the hammock near him.

785
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:13.350
I said it crazy that people are after their fucking horns,

786
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.280
people killed them for their horns.
You know?
That's a,

787
00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:19.280
that's a weird fucking thing.
Yeah.

788
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.910
I did not know things horns handed.

789
00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.420
It's an incredible look at these paintings to credible.

790
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.640
That's better than monkey.
Yeah.
Way better than a monkey's painting.

791
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.970
I've never seen him a monkey paint back that it's got a tail.

792
00:45:35.971 --> 00:45:39.690
It's got a little portion hand to proportions are excellent.

793
00:45:39.691 --> 00:45:44.200
That's probably better than most people can draw.
Way Better.
100% do.

794
00:45:44.201 --> 00:45:47.130
I want it to be an artist and I couldn't do much better than that.
Yeah.

795
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.040
It's incredible.
No,
I couldn't pay.
I mean,
that's a better,
you know,

796
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.710
for what it is.
This is all CGI we're getting.
Yeah.
I do think that Ellen,

797
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.040
the fleshlight mushroom.
Yeah.
Didn't think that elephant's been been trained.
Oh,

798
00:45:59.041 --> 00:46:03.230
of course he has.
Yeah.
No,
no.
He's just picking up the brush.
But I mean,

799
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.570
how long did it take him to learn?
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,

800
00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:10.500
if it takes a child of that stroke with the trunk is pretty,

801
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.730
pretty sweet.
Yeah.
And especially the trunk is such a unwieldily sort of,
uh,

802
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.920
instruments I would think.
I Dunno,

803
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.430
but they could pick you up when you're fucking trunk and beat the shit out of
it.

804
00:46:19.431 --> 00:46:20.830
Be Fun to have one like,
you know,

805
00:46:20.831 --> 00:46:23.460
like in the middle of your chest or something like that.
Maybe more on the,

806
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.950
on your back if women didn't think it was Scott.
Everyone.
Yeah.

807
00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:31.710
Yeah.
Be Cool if everybody had one.
If it was just like,
like you know,

808
00:46:31.711 --> 00:46:35.010
like what if women were like weren't into dudes with arms,
you know?
It's like,
oh,

809
00:46:35.011 --> 00:46:37.740
you have arms.
Yeah.
That's a new thing.
Evolution.

810
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:42.900
We're not crawling them on our bellies anymore.
Shit.
Manipulate.
Yeah.

811
00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:45.690
If we all had an extra arm,
they would totally be effective.

812
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.770
It would help you have some sort of a trunk or tail alien could use or any of

813
00:46:49.771 --> 00:46:51.930
that stuff.
I think of the Jujitsu of options,
you know?

814
00:46:51.931 --> 00:46:54.150
That's what I always think of the options get submitted to

815
00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.870
check out this line going or this elephant goes ape shit.

816
00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.493
He's pissed.

817
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:05.260
<v 5>Oh,
I see.
Crazy.
Yeah.</v>

818
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:08.550
I guess we've seen an elephant losing its mind and the San Francisco Zoo was

819
00:47:08.551 --> 00:47:11.520
cooped up and he was walking in circles is going,

820
00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.180
<v 3>I don't want to watch this man.
He's going to start killing people.</v>

821
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.730
I've seen this video.
Yeah,
it bums me out.

822
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.990
Bums me out that someone has to live in India,
that it bumps me out.

823
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:26.150
Elephants there that it bums me out.
Those Poor Fox get trampled by the elephant.

824
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:30.160
That's just a bummer.
It's just a bummer all around,
all around.
There's nothing

825
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:30.920
<v 4>good there.</v>

826
00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.431
<v 1>It's crazy.</v>

827
00:47:31.431 --> 00:47:34.610
When you stop and think about how crowded America is and then think about a

828
00:47:34.611 --> 00:47:37.210
place like India where there is more than three times.

829
00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:37.600
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

830
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:42.180
People were like hard to even think if you have running water in your house,

831
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:44.820
you're like in the 1% of the world like you're in,
you're in,

832
00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:47.610
you're rich in the world.
It's not that much,

833
00:47:47.611 --> 00:47:50.520
but it's in the world like it really just you.
If you have running water,

834
00:47:50.521 --> 00:47:52.650
you're like in the top 50% you're rich.

835
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.780
I don't think people really understand well.

836
00:47:54.781 --> 00:47:57.080
You can't really wrap your head around it.

837
00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:00.510
Such a how lucky you are to even,
yeah,

838
00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.060
you don't even know if he'd be listening to this podcast.

839
00:48:03.061 --> 00:48:04.770
You're a lucky some bitch.
You know what I mean?

840
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:06.010
<v 1>It's,</v>

841
00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:10.910
it's hard to imagine living in a world where running water is not common,

842
00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:16.040
but that is a huge percentage of the plan.
And now weird dysentery.

843
00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:18.680
And does it ever get to a point where that's not the case?

844
00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:23.150
Does it ever get to a point where everybody has a full technological society and

845
00:48:23.151 --> 00:48:25.340
we're,
we'll get w and when it hits that point,

846
00:48:25.341 --> 00:48:29.060
will it be so fucking overpopulated and crazy that will have likely have heard

847
00:48:29.061 --> 00:48:30.110
of blown ourselves up?

848
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:32.980
<v 4>Right.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I mean there's,
what's interesting is like,
oh,</v>

849
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.160
what was I just reading about the city,
like the city,
you know,

850
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:38.230
the office small floozy and was like,

851
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:42.190
and that's what the early ideas of the population bomb coming.
I'm all,

852
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:46.120
this was this,
you know,
English philosopher or whatever.
But like,

853
00:48:46.121 --> 00:48:49.450
he was sure London was going to crash.
Like,
this isn't like,
you know,
17,

854
00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.720
80 or whatever it was from too many people.
It's too crowded.
Yeah.
Yeah.

855
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:56.620
But the city keeps growing and keeps working.
And actually like,

856
00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:59.510
because I know where I was reading it was in this Jonah Lehrer book,

857
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:01.870
but it becomes like,
no,

858
00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:06.980
now it's more than 50% of the world lives in cities and they are like successful

859
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.500
and somehow these very complex systems function and,
and these,

860
00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:16.400
these things evolve.
So I mean,
we'll everybody have running water.

861
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:19.030
Who knows?
Man,
that's a tough one.
Whatever workout.

862
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.210
<v 1>Well,
you know,
some woman,
um,
it's a,</v>

863
00:49:22.211 --> 00:49:26.110
there was a story that somebody sent me on Twitter today that I thought was just

864
00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:30.640
completely ridiculous.
A woman,
um,
they cut all her plants down.

865
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:35.260
She made sure that,
uh,
the,
the place where she lived had,

866
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:39.550
um,
uh,
it had exemptions for like growing plants.

867
00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.520
They couldn't be any higher than like 12 inches.
And they had to be edible.

868
00:49:42.521 --> 00:49:45.280
But you can plant whatever you wanted in your lawn as long as it fit those

869
00:49:45.281 --> 00:49:49.000
criteria.
So this woman apparently was like,
she was in the botany,

870
00:49:49.001 --> 00:49:52.450
so she grew like all these herbs and vegetables and all these different things.

871
00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:57.010
And so a fucking city,
oh,
Tulsa,
Oklahoma,
these fucking monkeys.

872
00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:02.140
So they came and the cops chopped her fucking garden down.

873
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:06.010
It's on my Twitter.
If you look@twitter.com Joe Rogan.
Yeah,

874
00:50:06.011 --> 00:50:10.500
today is a police work right there.
June 19th so there's a,
there's a whole,

875
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:13.420
there's a video about it,
which shows the garden and it's,
it's,

876
00:50:13.421 --> 00:50:17.470
it wasn't uncapped.
It was very beautiful.
It just looked like a natural garden.

877
00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:21.130
She had it roped off and it was the front line of our house.
And you know,

878
00:50:21.131 --> 00:50:24.670
as you would walk by when you would go,
oh,
there's a garden.
It's not like,

879
00:50:24.671 --> 00:50:27.470
you know,
it was anything like disgusting.
Like,
you know,

880
00:50:27.471 --> 00:50:31.400
she had fucking garbage laying around or anything.
It was,
it was very nice.

881
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:34.610
But what,
what kind of a world that we live in where you're,

882
00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:38.720
you can't even grow plants on your own fucking front lawn.
Like really,

883
00:50:38.721 --> 00:50:39.890
can you legislate that?

884
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:44.080
We've decided to make little things and write them down on paper.
Well,

885
00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:47.540
we can stop you from growing,
not even illegal plants,

886
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:52.600
regular vegetables and herbs and spices and things that you eat every day.

887
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.750
Normal Shit.
And we can cut some lady shit down.

888
00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.990
Some morons,
some jackbooted dildos

889
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:05.120
guys and nothing else to do.
Yeah,
today.
I mean that's,

890
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:08.000
that's what the police are up to.
Yeah.
You should have a priority list.

891
00:51:08.001 --> 00:51:10.720
You assholes.
A priority list.
Murderers,
if you've,

892
00:51:10.721 --> 00:51:12.570
if you've gotten all the murderers,
no,

893
00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:18.140
stop with the fucking parking tickets.
Stop it all the bullshit.

894
00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.350
It should be 100% focused on the bad shit

895
00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.570
<v 4>first.
Seeking him murders,
you know,</v>

896
00:51:22.571 --> 00:51:26.680
46% of murders and California going soft cheeses,

897
00:51:26.681 --> 00:51:29.950
crowd much 46% good odds.
Christ.

898
00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:34.040
You believe that a good change.

899
00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:36.970
It's a really good chance you're going to get away.
No,
that's not bad.

900
00:51:36.971 --> 00:51:39.330
I went to this,
um,
this thing about the,
I don't know if you've heard of this,

901
00:51:39.331 --> 00:51:43.740
this stuff,
Oj Simpson.
Is that because of the Mexicans?
Hey,
no,
I mean,

902
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:46.620
because like they don't have them on record like their names and stuff.

903
00:51:46.621 --> 00:51:50.290
So they don't think it's,
I think it's just because of too much crime.

904
00:51:50.291 --> 00:51:52.380
So hard to do.
You know?
I think it's,

905
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:57.310
they'd like you to think they're going to catch you,
but this ain't CSI.

906
00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:01.160
There's this thing called the safe act.
Have you seen this thing?
No.

907
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:04.210
Once I went to this,
this,
this meeting is actually like really interesting.

908
00:52:04.211 --> 00:52:05.740
They're trying to get rid of the death penalty.

909
00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.100
They're putting the death penalty on a referendum for the first time so you can

910
00:52:09.101 --> 00:52:13.060
vote on it.
Never been voted on before and take all the money they cause,

911
00:52:13.061 --> 00:52:16.570
you know,
it costs stupid amounts of money and nobody ever gets killed.

912
00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.720
So like the warden at a Pelican Bay was like,

913
00:52:19.721 --> 00:52:23.980
when I came here in the 70s there were six people on death row.
When I left,

914
00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:28.810
30 years later there were 700 people on death row and they'd executed for people

915
00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.310
in that time.
Why is it so hard to x?

916
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:36.311
Because of appeals and it goes on forever and then they die of old age or

917
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:39.910
complications.
You can just keep appealing and appealing.

918
00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:43.000
They get like 11 there's a tons of appeals really?

919
00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:48.280
And they're like,
they're like exonerating people off of death row.
What?

920
00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.300
Yes.
Who got exonerated off?
Jeff?

921
00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.200
There's been two people that had been exonerated or two or three.
This,

922
00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:58.030
there's website generated from their crimes in total.
Yes.
Wrong guy.

923
00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:02.710
Oh,
GNA.
Oops.
Oh Jesus.
That brings the question of like,

924
00:53:02.711 --> 00:53:07.010
why don't we just do life in jail?
And then it's like,
it's much cheaper isn't.

925
00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:11.490
Yeah,
it's,
it's keeping somebody on to throw is like,
I forget,
but the numbers,

926
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:15.980
it's like $150,000 a year.
I think we have this eye for an eye type shit.
Yeah.
No,

927
00:53:15.981 --> 00:53:20.360
it's emotionally satisfying,
but it's like it,
you know,

928
00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:23.860
there's like this and there's a lot,
there's a lot of,

929
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:29.430
if you start taking a hard look at the judicial system,
it's pretty bad.
Yeah.

930
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:29.821
You know,

931
00:53:29.821 --> 00:53:34.821
like there's like 2000 kids that are locked up,

932
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:39.660
tried as adults for nonviolent crimes in the whole country.
Whoa.

933
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.140
Like what crimes,
like they're in the clear,

934
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:45.060
in none of the other in the car because you can get tried.

935
00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.260
So like if you're in the car,

936
00:53:46.261 --> 00:53:50.220
if you're at the scene of a crime and a lot of states and as a capital crime

937
00:53:50.221 --> 00:53:51.054
committed,

938
00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:55.090
everyone is charged with that crime and it's a way that you can get you,

939
00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:57.180
if they don't have anything hard on you,
but still,

940
00:53:57.181 --> 00:54:00.360
if you're in a car and you're like your body runs into the liquor store.

941
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.820
So like a 13 year old kids in the car,

942
00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:06.750
in the backseat of a car and the other gang member runs into the liquor store

943
00:54:06.751 --> 00:54:07.680
and kill somebody.

944
00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.910
Oh he gets capital crime does life.

945
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:17.610
Oh and I think I just killed my numbers are,
look,
yeah,

946
00:54:17.611 --> 00:54:21.300
it's basically that's how it works.
But it's,
it's,
I don't,
you know,
I'm not,

947
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.210
I don't please fact check me on this,
but it's like,

948
00:54:24.211 --> 00:54:27.680
I think 100% of them are black dude.

949
00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:31.200
That guilt by associations.
Ridiculous.

950
00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:34.760
Cause we've all known fucked up people.
I mean we've all done a bad teacher.

951
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:38.040
Listen,
we all could be locked up if it had been us and somebody,

952
00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:40.140
you know what I mean?
Like we've all done shit where it's been like,

953
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.740
I've met people that turned out to be murderers.

954
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:47.880
I've met people that were thieves.
Really.
I first Susie meet who's a murderer.

955
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:52.140
There was a guy named,
uh,
well his fake name was Raphael Tori.

956
00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:55.080
And uh,
I don't remember his real name.

957
00:54:55.081 --> 00:54:58.320
Where did you meet him while he was friends with Eddie Bravo?
Uh,

958
00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:01.200
Eddie runs with some odd dude's,
well,
it wasn't even an ad.

959
00:55:01.201 --> 00:55:03.840
The guy was a reporter for a,

960
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:06.390
<v 1>an online MMA site.
And,
uh,</v>

961
00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:10.910
he was telling people that he was a Brazilian jujitsu black belt.
Um,

962
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:13.390
but Eddie figured out that he wasn't a black belt.

963
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:16.470
Eddie was Eddie rolled with the guy and he was like,
this doesn't make any sense.

964
00:55:16.471 --> 00:55:19.470
This guy's fucking terrible.
He doesn't have the right instincts.

965
00:55:19.471 --> 00:55:21.360
He doesn't know how to roll.
You know,
in a minute,

966
00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:26.100
obviously aren't what you say you are.
I became suspicious.

967
00:55:26.101 --> 00:55:30.720
I didn't know the dude.
I only met him like a couple of times,
but uh,
he,
uh,

968
00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:34.250
would go away and have these fake fights,
right.

969
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:38.610
He went away to Thailand and had an MMA fight,
you know,

970
00:55:38.611 --> 00:55:41.580
and this is back when you couldn't really check on that kind of shit was crazy.

971
00:55:41.581 --> 00:55:45.710
As he said,
he won by twister.
Twister is,
uh,
Eddie Bravo signature moves.

972
00:55:45.711 --> 00:55:46.950
It's like a guillotine of wrestling,

973
00:55:46.951 --> 00:55:50.880
but there's a bunch of setups and it becomes a submission when you a u s cup,

974
00:55:50.881 --> 00:55:55.090
the top of their head that's so hard to get.
The twister is so hard to get.
Yeah.

975
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:58.290
So for a guy who's some whack ass,
you know,

976
00:55:58.291 --> 00:56:01.980
submission guy who just got educated on the twister.

977
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:05.130
It's not like if you went and taught Jake shields the twister and then he got it

978
00:56:05.131 --> 00:56:07.050
that night,
I would say,
well of course he's Jake shields.

979
00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:09.360
You could basically do any kind of grabbing room.

980
00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.620
You just have to show it to him once.

981
00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:14.810
Now this is some guy who everybody was tapping and didn't want to roll with

982
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:17.990
anybody.
So we kind of knew that some sort a sniff that stuff.
Well,

983
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.700
it turns out homeboy,
um,

984
00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:22.920
was dating this woman who was married and killed the husband,

985
00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:24.130
it choked him to death.

986
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:28.930
<v 2>Wow.
Yeah.
We don't know if it's like did it with a cord or rear naked or what,</v>

987
00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:33.370
but he would choke some guy to death.
Yeah.
And then,
yeah,

988
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:37.300
he's in jail for it.
Yeah.
But so,
I mean,
what the fuck man,

989
00:56:37.301 --> 00:56:41.410
what if I was in the car with that guy because he was friends with Eddie.

990
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:45.800
He stopped in and that school to go choke that guy to sleep,
you know,

991
00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:49.120
or you know,
whatever.
You don't want to hear in the blank.
Don't want to hear it.

992
00:56:49.121 --> 00:56:53.360
I mean,
yeah.
And I think the main thing is,
is like if you start,
it's just,

993
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:55.840
you know,
I don't want to preach at you,
but he started getting into it.

994
00:56:55.841 --> 00:56:58.080
It's like pretty bad,
you know,
in terms of people,

995
00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:02.100
I met this kind of Florida because I was doing research.
I was in,

996
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:06.740
<v 4>in these jails in Florida and like he was real estate agent and he was sitting</v>

997
00:57:06.741 --> 00:57:11.540
in jail for a year and a half without a trial,
lost his job,
lost his house,

998
00:57:11.541 --> 00:57:15.800
lost everything because he had been,
when he was 18,
he'd been,

999
00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:19.070
he was a felon.
I think he'd done like a beanie or something like that.

1000
00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:22.310
This is now,
he's in his thirties,
late thirties or even in his early forties,

1001
00:57:22.311 --> 00:57:24.680
cleaned up his life,
had a job for 15 years.

1002
00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:29.220
<v 2>His mom's moving,
he helps his mom move into her new apartment.</v>

1003
00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:34.200
She loses her keys.
So he breaks the door to get her in,
gets arrested for it.

1004
00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:38.910
Oh No.
And we're like,
I'm telling this to some of the officers,
they're like,

1005
00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:43.860
oh,
these guys are all snuck her in you,
you idiot.
You know,
and uh,
no,

1006
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:46.980
we,
we got somebody to look at it and I'm like,
Oh yeah,
and this wrong.

1007
00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.400
But he sat there for a year and a half waiting for a lawyer cause he couldn't

1008
00:57:50.401 --> 00:57:53.940
get one,
you know,
like it just didn't have the connection.
Yeah.
In jail,
locked,

1009
00:57:53.941 --> 00:57:56.880
helping his mom get into her fucking house because of the cause.

1010
00:57:56.881 --> 00:57:59.900
And the three strikes you,
I mean,
you've heard of all that stuff.
The crazy,

1011
00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:02.710
I don't want to get into it,
but it's like,
it's cause it's so depressing,

1012
00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:05.280
but I don't want to preach,
but it's,
uh,
it's worth,

1013
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.830
it's worth the safe act anyway.
Get into it.
In California,

1014
00:58:07.831 --> 00:58:10.920
if you live in California,
so many cops are so fucking cynical.
I mean,

1015
00:58:10.921 --> 00:58:13.080
it's such a hard job,
you know,

1016
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:16.650
that they don't get paid enough and they get treated like shit and everybody,

1017
00:58:16.651 --> 00:58:18.500
you know,
thinks of them as the enemy.
Yeah.

1018
00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:21.740
And you can get so cynical because was the line you want to,

1019
00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:25.500
you've seen the worst of humanity.
You seen people on their worst day.
Yeah.

1020
00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.390
And uh,
it's like,
it's hammer

1021
00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:27.971
<v 4>thinking,
you know,</v>

1022
00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:31.440
it's like if all you see is nails and that's all you ever see it.

1023
00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:35.770
I actually got into this,
I was friends with this guy named Steve Rodriguez.

1024
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:40.170
I'm corresponding with him and he's a famous police sniper with like,
you know,

1025
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:41.880
he,
I think he's was,
you know,

1026
00:58:41.881 --> 00:58:44.920
at one point was a very well known police snipe rate's been on shows and stuff,

1027
00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:49.480
but we were talking a lot about,
you know,
cops,
you got it.
You got to train them,

1028
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:51.310
you've got to equip them,
you've got to arm them.
I mean,

1029
00:58:51.311 --> 00:58:52.900
most of them will never shoot their gun.

1030
00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:55.630
Most of them never end up using their stuff,

1031
00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:58.960
but they still have to have that mentality and what that creates,

1032
00:58:58.961 --> 00:59:01.140
that creates this system where you're,
no,

1033
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:04.040
you're seeing bad guys everywhere and you know,

1034
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:06.280
becomes a self fulfilling prophecy and all that stuff.

1035
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:06.841
<v 2>Well,
I,</v>

1036
00:59:06.841 --> 00:59:10.780
I have a friend that I liked very much and he's a cop and he's a good guy and a,

1037
00:59:10.781 --> 00:59:15.510
I know he is,
but he's got crazy ideas about pot and he's,

1038
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:20.920
you know,
before they decriminalized it,
you know,
he was like,

1039
00:59:20.921 --> 00:59:21.980
Hey,
don't give a fuck of

1040
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.400
<v 3>a guy's got a fucking medical marijuana card.
I'm fucking still arresting him.</v>

1041
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.910
And me and him,
we had a conversation about go,
bro,
that's fucking dumb.

1042
00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:31.370
That's dumb.
I go,
you like beer,
don't you like beer?

1043
00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:34.280
But if the government said you couldn't have a beer with you,
you'd be like,

1044
00:59:34.281 --> 00:59:37.550
what the fuck?
Kind of bullshit countries.
This why can't have a fucking beer.

1045
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:41.720
I work all day.
I want a beer.
I go,
that's the same thing.
It's a joint.

1046
00:59:41.721 --> 00:59:46.580
It ain't hurting anybody.
I'm like,
I smoke it,
dummy.
You're wrong.
You know,

1047
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:48.920
couldn't be more wrong.
I couldn't be more wrong.
I mean,

1048
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:51.500
this is after we did Jujitsu for an hour and a half.
We're like,
dude,

1049
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:54.140
we just strangled each other for a fucking hour and a half.

1050
00:59:54.141 --> 00:59:58.340
You're telling me bleeds bad for you.
You're crazy.
It's so stupid.
It's a,
it's a,

1051
00:59:58.341 --> 01:00:00.920
it's a dumb thing to get stuck on the wrong side of.

1052
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:05.360
And as a cop you sort of get trapped into this good guy,
bad guy.
Here's the law.

1053
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:09.740
This is the game.
This is,
I can go,
I can go after this one.
This one's a target,

1054
01:00:09.741 --> 01:00:12.910
this one's not,
you know,
becomes,
and then,
you know,

1055
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:18.140
California cops are suing the state because of quotas that are supposed to be

1056
01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:20.290
illegal.
But they get enforced anyway.

1057
01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:24.140
Quotas for speed tickets and all sorts of different stupid things where,

1058
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:29.000
what would we do if the fucking world became an unbelievably peaceful place?

1059
01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:33.380
We all achieved enlightenment.
And uh,
there was no more speeding tickets.

1060
01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.500
W W W would,
would you,
would you fucking,
what would you do?

1061
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:38.270
Would you make the cops responsible?

1062
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:41.030
Would you make them start pulling people over that were going the speed limit

1063
01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.760
and say,
fuck it.
Just write tickets.
They're gonna not gonna fight it.

1064
01:00:43.761 --> 01:00:46.230
They're just going to pay.
The people have jobs.
They don't have the time.
Right.

1065
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.220
And the cops become enemies.
Yeah.

1066
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:53.060
The cops start faking crimes and arresting themselves for the crimes.
I mean,

1067
01:00:53.061 --> 01:00:56.030
they're going to,
they're going to start chasing each other around.

1068
01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:58.010
They're going to start fucking making fake crime.

1069
01:00:58.090 --> 01:01:00.530
And essentially that's what they've done in a lot of places.

1070
01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:03.200
That's what occupy Wall Street and it's been a victim of totally.

1071
01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:07.910
Cops have become fake a instigators of crime.
There was a,

1072
01:01:07.911 --> 01:01:11.080
the thing that happened in Seattle at the World Trade Organization,

1073
01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:15.020
is that what it is?
A WTO for Seattle?
Yeah.
You remember that shit?
Well,

1074
01:01:15.021 --> 01:01:19.340
they had fucking military grade uniforms on.
They had military boots on.

1075
01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:22.820
Like Alex Jones might be a nutter and he might say some crazy shit,

1076
01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.660
but there's a certain percentage of the shit that he says it makes 100% totally

1077
01:01:26.661 --> 01:01:30.590
sense.
And that was one of them was that these people,
they the,
you know,

1078
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:33.830
they call them,
I don't know what,
what you call with the official word for them.

1079
01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:36.230
Is that someone that goes into a,

1080
01:01:36.231 --> 01:01:41.130
a place and purposely antagonizing things,
right?
Breaks windows.
Yeah.

1081
01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:43.790
Like a,
what do you call it?
I know what you're talking and her kiss,

1082
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:47.120
whatever you would call it.
The provocateur.
A provocateur.
Thank you.

1083
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.990
That's exactly what it is.

1084
01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:51.110
They create a situation where the situation is peaceful.

1085
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.450
So all of these people are basically walking around in there saying,
hey,

1086
01:01:53.451 --> 01:01:58.100
this is bullshit with stop.
You know,
let's stop this a horrible injustice.

1087
01:01:58.101 --> 01:02:02.510
And we were protesting peacefully and cops come and start smashing windows and

1088
01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:07.070
then they say [inaudible] someone smashed.
They send in fucking pocket some RPGs.

1089
01:02:07.071 --> 01:02:08.180
Yeah.
Well,
everyone's like,

1090
01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:13.090
what the fuck is that guy that wants to set everything on fire now?

1091
01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.620
They did that with the Patriot Act.
They had to,

1092
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:20.010
they busted a bunch of guys for terrorism and like it turned out like the FBI's

1093
01:02:20.011 --> 01:02:22.830
going to these guys who were,
of course they're anti American Muslims,

1094
01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:26.790
not that's not shocking and back there and the guy's like,
you know,

1095
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:31.000
coming to them as a somewhat,
he's from,
you know,
whatever Siri or whatever.

1096
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.470
And he's saying,
do you guys want to buy some RPGs and blow up the,
they're like,

1097
01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:38.680
yeah,
it sounds like boom,
like we got the sale.
You know what I mean?

1098
01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.260
These guys couldn't,
you know,
they would pull a certain issue.
First Sweatshirt,

1099
01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:46.760
I'm down for arresting them as well.
I met a guy in Dallas,

1100
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:50.270
they actually gave him a bomb.
There's that kind of shit is,
it's pretty bad.

1101
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:54.050
Some of it's pretty slick.
It's the chasing their tail,
you know,
like there's,

1102
01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.110
and no,

1103
01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:59.730
they did find a guy that had been involved for a long time in anti American

1104
01:02:59.731 --> 01:03:04.170
activities.
He did have the intent to,
he pressed the button.
He,

1105
01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.610
they gave him a fake bomb and tried to activate it.
So I say fuck him.
I know,

1106
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:14.190
I got no problem with that.
I say
when it comes to that,

1107
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:17.800
I don't like plant and coke on some teenager,
you know,
I mean there's,

1108
01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.020
there's been situations like that where they talk someone into selling drugs and

1109
01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.640
it turns out the person who would have never done it,

1110
01:03:23.641 --> 01:03:26.460
but it looks like they can get away with it until they go through and then they

1111
01:03:26.461 --> 01:03:28.950
arrest the kid.
And he wanted to do in 25 years.

1112
01:03:28.951 --> 01:03:31.260
And everybody has been talking to as a cop except for him.

1113
01:03:31.261 --> 01:03:35.430
And he's not means that those cops,
DEA agents wind up being junkies,
you know,

1114
01:03:35.431 --> 01:03:39.150
that happens a lot.
Dea Guys,
a lot.
You mean,
look,

1115
01:03:39.151 --> 01:03:43.570
they're not immune to the pull of the chemicals right there.

1116
01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.890
So there was a great rolling stone article about a kid who's doing 25 fucking

1117
01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:49.770
years and he wanted to,
uh,
he,

1118
01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:54.790
he was selling pot in like small amounts to his friends and this guy talked him

1119
01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:57.840
into a big coke deal and it was a fake coke deal,
right.

1120
01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:00.230
Was a coke deal that he had orchestrated.
The,

1121
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.700
the cop talked to him in his fake coke deal.
Boom.

1122
01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:05.880
The kid goes away for like 25 plus.
Okay.

1123
01:04:05.881 --> 01:04:08.640
The cop turns out to be a junkie,

1124
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.020
gets fired from the force for fucking with evidence and he gets disgraced as a

1125
01:04:13.021 --> 01:04:17.460
cop and this,
no one just goes back and looks at his cases and goes,
well,

1126
01:04:17.461 --> 01:04:19.580
let's find out who he fucked over.
No,

1127
01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:23.130
no one thought he was crazy and reckless [inaudible] about when she started

1128
01:04:23.131 --> 01:04:25.260
looking at some of these things.
Because once you get,
it's like,

1129
01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:28.110
there's a lot of like,
you know,
it's jailhouse.

1130
01:04:28.111 --> 01:04:31.350
Snitches pointed them out and they're like,
you know,
they're all,

1131
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.310
they've all recanted their test,
you know,
anyway,
it gets,
it gets pretty,

1132
01:04:35.311 --> 01:04:38.970
it's disturbing.
It's race stories like that and people don't care.
You know,

1133
01:04:38.971 --> 01:04:42.390
they don't care that the someone becomes just a number in a box that's out in

1134
01:04:42.391 --> 01:04:44.280
the middle of the field.
The prison box.
Yeah.

1135
01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:48.060
Because with the reality also is we have privatized prison systems in this

1136
01:04:48.061 --> 01:04:49.760
country and that's the roof.

1137
01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:53.640
That's one of the most terrifying things ever that someone can profit off of

1138
01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:56.520
people being in just really the,
the,
the union,

1139
01:04:56.570 --> 01:05:01.020
the CEO's union is so powerful and they get paid double time.
Yeah.

1140
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:03.150
Every time a prison's overcrowded cheese,

1141
01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:06.900
so they support heavily all the three strike laws and all that.

1142
01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.950
Of course they're profiting.
You know,
if you're a CEO you can make better,

1143
01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:11.910
better money.

1144
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:16.910
We have to figure out what is okay to profit on and what is prop it on and we

1145
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:20.530
need people get addicted to that money coming in.
Like,

1146
01:05:20.531 --> 01:05:23.080
I'm not saying each cigarettes should be illegal because I don't think you

1147
01:05:23.081 --> 01:05:25.630
should be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do.
Of course I liked cigars,

1148
01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.400
you know,
and I don't,
I don't like cigarettes,

1149
01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:30.400
but maybe if I lived in another life I would,
nothing wrong with it.

1150
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:35.320
But when a fucking company is responsible for selling something that absolutely

1151
01:05:35.321 --> 01:05:39.940
kills the fuck at a 400,000 people in this country every year,

1152
01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.740
that country,

1153
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:46.530
bad country owes or that rather than company owes that company on the hook for

1154
01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:49.570
they need to be on the hook for the medical.
And they are to a certain extent.

1155
01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:50.570
I mean they,
you know,
they,

1156
01:05:50.571 --> 01:05:54.880
they have big payouts that they have to do on a regular basis.
But you know,

1157
01:05:54.881 --> 01:05:58.690
you want to talk about like people that are something that's preying on society

1158
01:05:58.691 --> 01:06:01.100
that is a goddamn vampire.
You know,

1159
01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.110
I don't care if it's a vampire that's set a motion by personal freedom and

1160
01:06:05.111 --> 01:06:09.280
personal choices.
That's still a vampire.
That's a vampire on society.
No,

1161
01:06:09.281 --> 01:06:13.240
I mean there's this,
I this corporatization,
this is,

1162
01:06:13.241 --> 01:06:17.590
we're getting dangerously close to politics here,
but like,
you know,
it's,

1163
01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.620
corporations aren't people.
That's a dangerous idea.

1164
01:06:20.621 --> 01:06:22.630
Like you're responsible to shareholders.

1165
01:06:22.631 --> 01:06:25.780
You're responsible for maximizing profits.
There's not like an ethics there.

1166
01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:28.600
You know,
when someone says it's just business,
it's because they're fucking year.

1167
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:31.150
They're fucking diffusion of responsibility.
That's the issue.

1168
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:34.360
That's the only reason they would say that,
you know,
that's all that means is I,

1169
01:06:34.361 --> 01:06:35.520
this is my favorite,

1170
01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:40.530
my favorite it's business story was when my agent told me that they had a drop

1171
01:06:41.051 --> 01:06:43.210
me,
if I wouldn't apologize to Carlson and Sia,

1172
01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:47.860
and it's because they had Carlos men Sia with television and with standup,

1173
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:51.580
and they only had me with stand up so that we were making money off him and they

1174
01:06:51.581 --> 01:06:53.680
said,
well look,
it's business because he wanted them.

1175
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:56.980
He wanted me to apologize to him or he wanted them to drop me like those.

1176
01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:02.410
And I was like,
first of all,
there's,
it's not your choice to them.
I said,

1177
01:07:02.411 --> 01:07:05.920
because I won't work with you ever again because you proposed this is the most

1178
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:11.230
disgusting.
And you know,
they're saying,
they said,
listen man,

1179
01:07:11.231 --> 01:07:14.230
this is,
this is business.
It's all it is.
It's just business.
I go,
wow,

1180
01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:16.280
do you listen to what you're saying?
Right.
I go,
you're,

1181
01:07:16.281 --> 01:07:19.510
you're supporting literally a criminal and because you know that you could make

1182
01:07:19.511 --> 01:07:22.690
more money off of it.
I go,
you guys are selling art.
That's what you do.

1183
01:07:22.691 --> 01:07:27.520
You sell art got a guy who is stealing from the people who create the art that

1184
01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:29.860
you sell and you're like,
but he's stealing really well,

1185
01:07:29.861 --> 01:07:33.160
so we're going to keep supporting that.
And that's what business is like.

1186
01:07:33.161 --> 01:07:36.730
You're in the wrong business because you're in the art business.
You fuck heads,

1187
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.030
you're supporting a fucking vampire.
So you know it it.

1188
01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:44.050
The beautiful thing about it was that they wound up costing them because first

1189
01:07:44.051 --> 01:07:45.820
of all,
men see it leaves them in a year.

1190
01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:49.960
Second about Louis C K dumped them immediately,
right?
Louis C,
k p Fuck,

1191
01:07:49.961 --> 01:07:53.770
he's the best.
He's he right away.
He was like,
he came up to me at the end.

1192
01:07:53.771 --> 01:07:57.340
Provity goes,
is this all true?
They told you the Yoda apologize to him.
I said,

1193
01:07:57.341 --> 01:08:01.610
absolutely.
100% he goes,
okay,
fuck them.
And he goes,
I,
I'm firing them.
Right?
Yeah.

1194
01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:05.770
I love that guy.
Nick Swardson did the same thing.
Mixed wards.
It was like,
what?

1195
01:08:05.771 --> 01:08:10.220
Dude?
It was beautiful.
So two guys didn't the guy that told,

1196
01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:13.410
told you that also get fired or quit or something like that?
Awesome.
No,

1197
01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:17.000
the guy who he was supporting and went to CNN,
ca.

1198
01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:20.390
And then after all this had fell and the dude fell apart.
His fucking,

1199
01:08:20.391 --> 01:08:23.240
my former agent is,
I love the guy.
I'll never say his name.
I love him.

1200
01:08:23.241 --> 01:08:25.770
Still to this day you want,
I'm sitting next to me on a plane,
one

1201
01:08:27.710 --> 01:08:30.500
fucking three hours and shit.
I forget where we're going,

1202
01:08:30.501 --> 01:08:33.320
but just randomly sat next to me on this plane and we,
you know,

1203
01:08:33.321 --> 01:08:36.460
we talked but I let them know.
I mean I didn't have it.
He used,

1204
01:08:36.490 --> 01:08:37.221
he was an employee,

1205
01:08:37.221 --> 01:08:41.060
employee's an agent and I was on the phone with the actual owner of the agency

1206
01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:44.530
who's like rogue and to play ball,
I'm going to,

1207
01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.090
I'm going to lay it on the line for Broken Hill.
I,
I don't want to handle it.

1208
01:08:47.091 --> 01:08:50.060
Yeah.
I hit him with some,
first of all and they called me.
I was high as fuck.

1209
01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.130
Okay.
And when I hit him with some,
a heavy,
heavy Karma talk,
I said,
listen man,

1210
01:08:55.131 --> 01:09:00.080
I said,
I've been to your house.
I go,
you wealthy?
I go,
you're a rich guy.

1211
01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:04.670
Okay.
I know where you live.
I've been to your other house in Aspen,
right?
Okay,

1212
01:09:04.671 --> 01:09:08.360
you're a wealthy man.
You don't need to make this decision.
I go,

1213
01:09:08.361 --> 01:09:13.361
this is a terrible decision because you're setting in motion a very real ethic

1214
01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:17.390
and that ethic is,
I don't care about what's right.
I don't care about morals.

1215
01:09:17.391 --> 01:09:17.810
I don't care.

1216
01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:21.350
I care about what I can get away with and if I can support this criminal,

1217
01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.670
I'm going to do that and I'm going to profit off of that because I'm responsible

1218
01:09:24.671 --> 01:09:26.660
for this year who was like a silence on the phone.
I said,

1219
01:09:26.661 --> 01:09:30.560
listen very carefully to me cause the decision you make right now is going to be

1220
01:09:30.561 --> 01:09:34.070
one step.
It's going to affect pretty much the motion of the rest of your life.

1221
01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:37.910
This is who you are.
This is you're that guy.
And I go,

1222
01:09:37.911 --> 01:09:40.520
but I'm not doing business with you guys.
If I go,
I'm done.

1223
01:09:40.730 --> 01:09:44.270
I go up just because you suggested that to me.
I'm out,
but I wish you well.

1224
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:47.560
And I go on and if I see a,
I'll give you a big hug.
No hurt feelings.

1225
01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.570
That was just who you are.
This is who you are.
This is who you are.

1226
01:09:50.571 --> 01:09:54.930
Like this decision is defines you.
This business is that that,

1227
01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.900
why did you guys drop that bomb?

1228
01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:03.770
Why did you guys decide to invade that country?
It's been,
I know,
I know.

1229
01:10:03.771 --> 01:10:07.700
And that's why it's like the citizens United man.
It's,
it's afraid.

1230
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:10.730
Frightening idea.
It's a frightening idea of the corporation.

1231
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.790
The diffusion of responsibility that comes when you start just thinking of

1232
01:10:13.791 --> 01:10:15.950
numbers instead of humans and more Alan also.
Yeah,

1233
01:10:15.951 --> 01:10:18.870
like you're saying like no one's responsible.
Like it's,
it's,

1234
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:21.260
it's out in the ether.
Like it's not my decision.
I can't,

1235
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:24.710
I have this thing I have to take care of and will not only die.

1236
01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.230
That's what gets them bear in the first place.

1237
01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:31.220
The reason they have a Ferrari in a house in the Hamptons and all this shit is

1238
01:10:31.221 --> 01:10:36.110
because they've maintained this steadfast like loyalty to the numbers.

1239
01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:38.450
Right.
You know,
and that's why they're so successful.

1240
01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:41.340
So they look at that as proof positive.
They're doing the right thing.
You know,

1241
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:44.570
look at these fucking losers.
I love our $40 million house.

1242
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:49.700
I'm driving my own jet.
So they just feel like they got it right when instead,

1243
01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.700
what would you know?
First of all,
they all rot from the inside.

1244
01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:55.300
It doesn't work out.
It doesn't work out.

1245
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:59.900
All those guys die of cancer of the Dick and asshole.
I mean it's,
I mean,
don't,

1246
01:10:59.901 --> 01:11:03.170
this doesn't work out like true.
Never get to enjoy it and like it doesn't,

1247
01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:07.100
you fight so hard for it.
You can't ever depressions too much.

1248
01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.340
The negativities too much.
[inaudible] happy.
They've done a study recently,

1249
01:11:10.341 --> 01:11:12.200
I forget where I read this.
I read it yesterday though,

1250
01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.890
where they're talking about happy people

1251
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:16.200
<v 1>and they said that the,
the,</v>

1252
01:11:16.201 --> 01:11:20.220
the happiest people surround themselves with friends and family do something

1253
01:11:20.221 --> 01:11:24.150
they love to do.
It seems all symbol and forgive easily.
Right.

1254
01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:29.400
Are Generous and so the onus is on you.
Yeah.
Generous and forgive easily.

1255
01:11:29.401 --> 01:11:32.640
Those are fucking,
those two are huge.
That's huge.

1256
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:35.820
Surround yourself with family and friends.
So surround yourself with loved ones.

1257
01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:39.060
Huge influx.
You're saying like you see the guy,
you're going to give him a hug.

1258
01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:43.670
It's like,
yeah,
it's fine.
Yeah.
Who you are.
You know?
And like I,
and I'm a,
I'm,

1259
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.990
I wish it wasn't that guy and he's probably not that guy anymore.

1260
01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:49.050
I'm sure he's learned from that.
You know,
we,

1261
01:11:49.051 --> 01:11:52.590
he and I had a conversation on the plane and I just said,
I go,
it's,
sorry,

1262
01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:55.620
I don't care.
You know,
it's no big deal,
man.
I,
we had a great time together.

1263
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.310
You and I,
you know,
and he said,
listen,
this is what they were,
that was,

1264
01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.670
they were forcing me to do that.

1265
01:11:59.671 --> 01:12:02.420
And I was supporting my colleague who was the guy who,

1266
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:06.480
who was the agent of this kid.
Right.
You know,
so he was,

1267
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:10.470
he's fucked himself.
And I,
I hope that,
you know,
he learned from that.

1268
01:12:10.471 --> 01:12:13.800
But you know,
when you work in for somebody,
man,
that's a different ballgame.

1269
01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:16.770
When you work in for the guy and the boss gets on the phone with you and says,

1270
01:12:16.771 --> 01:12:20.910
this is the game plan.
Okay,
here we go.
And like,
Ugh,
no moral,

1271
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:24.720
it sounds awful,
but you know,
you,
you got a mortgage,
you know,

1272
01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:27.930
you gotta fucking Nice Mercedes.
Yeah.
It's not always easy,
you know,

1273
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.100
it's fucking terrible.

1274
01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:32.880
The diffusion of responsibility that comes from the corporation is that the

1275
01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:35.490
corporation acts as a,

1276
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:39.060
an entity that's trying to protect profits and ensure more profits.

1277
01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:43.530
And you're just a part of that,
you know?
Well,
look,
uh,
you know,
uh,
hate to say it,

1278
01:12:43.531 --> 01:12:45.660
but I'm in repossessions.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh,

1279
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:49.530
<v 2>you're living for the weekend and know you're living for your little hobby and</v>

1280
01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:53.480
trying to fuck that,
huh?
Yeah.
Well,
but not everybody can be a writer.

1281
01:12:53.481 --> 01:12:57.920
So lucky for us.
I mean,
me and Brian talk about that all the time.

1282
01:12:57.921 --> 01:13:02.770
Not everybody can be doing a podcast.
Nobody,
everybody be doing standup.

1283
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:06.800
Not everybody can know it ain't,
there's not enough jobs like that out there.

1284
01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.440
Yeah.
I know.

1285
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:11.030
It's funny too that like that's a lot of that like self help talk to,
it's like,

1286
01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:12.500
it's like everyone can do it.

1287
01:13:12.501 --> 01:13:15.410
You just get to know yourself and you can make what job you want and you're
like,

1288
01:13:15.411 --> 01:13:19.760
not everyone can be,
you know,
the guy from entourage,
you know what I mean?
Like,

1289
01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:22.130
and be rolling in it.
You know,
I think a lot of,
you know,

1290
01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.970
there's a lot of people I know who think that that's going to happen and that's

1291
01:13:25.971 --> 01:13:27.560
their,
that's their plan.

1292
01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:30.680
Do you remember when the secret came out where everybody was convinced that they

1293
01:13:30.681 --> 01:13:34.910
had the fucking new path?
So my mom just,
she's like,
this is like the secret.

1294
01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:38.720
Oh No,
he,
of course it's a long story,
but it was,

1295
01:13:38.721 --> 01:13:42.710
but it was just hilarious that she's like 15 years behind the curve on that.
Oh,

1296
01:13:42.711 --> 01:13:44.900
she just heard him back.
She's like,
oh,
that's so interesting.

1297
01:13:44.901 --> 01:13:46.220
I saw this thing on Netflix,

1298
01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:50.630
<v 1>a friend of mine from the comedy store,
very nice person.
She was like,</v>

1299
01:13:50.631 --> 01:13:53.280
I'm one of the friends of the waitresses.
And she would come by,

1300
01:13:53.281 --> 01:13:56.180
she was like one of those people that would come by on a regular basis and loved

1301
01:13:56.181 --> 01:13:58.260
comedy.
And I remember,

1302
01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:01.230
I didn't know heart to tell her any differently than she was.

1303
01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.140
She's always been real friendly.
And we were in the back of the comedy store.

1304
01:14:04.141 --> 01:14:05.190
She's friends to Kelly,
Kirsten,

1305
01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:10.250
I think Carson show a friend and this girl goes,

1306
01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:14.800
um,
I am happier than I've ever been.

1307
01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:19.270
And I know that within one year I'm going to be married and a year after that

1308
01:14:19.271 --> 01:14:21.240
I'm going to have a child and she starts like saying all this stuff.

1309
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:23.990
And I'm like,
what?
What's going on?
Like,
what the fuck is going on?

1310
01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:27.100
Like what are you saying?
Just put it on her and then she just goes,
she goes,

1311
01:14:27.101 --> 01:14:30.610
well what happened is I discovered the secret and I've completely changed my

1312
01:14:30.611 --> 01:14:35.410
life.
And she was totally serious.
Yeah.
And so I tried to figure out,
cause I,

1313
01:14:35.411 --> 01:14:37.900
you know,
was there a way to help your situation?

1314
01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:41.410
That's what's something you could say that would help and not,
well it's,

1315
01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:44.590
I'm the worst for that shit cause I'm like,
that's fucking retarded.

1316
01:14:44.650 --> 01:14:48.230
Especially back.
Can't go hard.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You got to go,
Hey,

1317
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:50.080
I would handle it much better than I did back then.

1318
01:14:50.081 --> 01:14:53.320
But even back then I wouldn't handle it bad with her because she was a very nice

1319
01:14:53.321 --> 01:14:55.930
person.
So I would go,
oh yeah.

1320
01:14:55.931 --> 01:14:59.800
Instead of like saying anything constructive that might steer her in the right

1321
01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:00.634
direction.
Right.

1322
01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:03.550
The real problem with anything like the secret is that you're only interviewing

1323
01:15:03.551 --> 01:15:05.890
the winters,
United interviewing the people that had this idea,

1324
01:15:05.891 --> 01:15:08.860
I'm going to be a rocket scientist and I'm going to go to the Mars Bitch.

1325
01:15:08.861 --> 01:15:11.710
He ain't gone tomorrow.
Whereas no one going to Mars,
you're fucking,

1326
01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.040
you could think you're going to Mars all day long.
The technology doesn't exist.

1327
01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:18.970
You can't say,
I'm going to start the first fucking stellar colony on Mars.

1328
01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:20.950
You're not going to do it.
It's not going to happen.

1329
01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:22.550
<v 4>It's like the,
the shipwrecks that like,
yeah,</v>

1330
01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:24.920
prayer works because I prayed and I'm alive.
Well,

1331
01:15:24.921 --> 01:15:28.190
we didn't interview all the guys who paid and die make it.

1332
01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:32.360
We've got bitten by spiders at night and fucking died.
Horrible deaths.

1333
01:15:32.690 --> 01:15:35.870
There's a great book called bright sided by Barbara Ehrenreich,

1334
01:15:35.871 --> 01:15:39.680
which is about the positive thinking movement in America cause she had cancer,

1335
01:15:39.681 --> 01:15:42.950
she had breast cancer and she started doing those things and they're like,

1336
01:15:42.951 --> 01:15:45.020
you know,
you're not,
you're not happy enough.
You're like,

1337
01:15:45.021 --> 01:15:47.990
you're not thinking positively about your cancer.
And she's like,
oh,

1338
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.140
he's great writer by the way,
Barbara Ehrenreich.
And uh,

1339
01:15:51.710 --> 01:15:55.490
so she went into the history and stuff and it was interesting as it comes,

1340
01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.640
there is like a little tiny bit of medical shred.

1341
01:15:59.650 --> 01:16:02.660
So in like the nine just of the industrial revolution,

1342
01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:04.550
there was something called Melancholia,
right?

1343
01:16:04.551 --> 01:16:05.780
Where people were getting depressed,

1344
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:09.920
mostly stay at home moms and older people because the world was moving so fast,

1345
01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.830
like with industry cars and whatever,

1346
01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:17.420
they felt like they didn't belong and they got really depressed and positive

1347
01:16:17.421 --> 01:16:19.160
thinking work for them.

1348
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:24.370
Like so there is like this little germ of like a medical fact of that positive

1349
01:16:24.681 --> 01:16:28.790
thinking worked in this one instance.
But then it's become this,
you know,

1350
01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.260
this incredible thing where

1351
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:33.760
<v 1>it's very hard to define whether or not someone's playing by the positive</v>

1352
01:16:33.761 --> 01:16:37.720
thinking goes.
So if you say that,
you know,
positive thinking is not working,

1353
01:16:37.721 --> 01:16:40.120
he said,
well what exactly we were just talking about,
right?

1354
01:16:40.121 --> 01:16:42.270
We were talking about with Randek into it,
like in the whole,
you know,
and,

1355
01:16:42.271 --> 01:16:43.104
and fighting.

1356
01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:48.030
<v 4>No,
there's,
when you're doing stuff,
that's when it's,
when it's making you active,</v>

1357
01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:51.870
then it can work.
But when it's,
when you're just relying on,

1358
01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:54.000
<v 1>that's the key,
right?
Lotion doing things.</v>

1359
01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.980
And that's what people don't like to do,

1360
01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:58.520
but people don't like to do as a difficult thing.
So they,

1361
01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:00.420
like they say the definition of insanity,
right.

1362
01:17:00.421 --> 01:17:02.820
Is like to doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different

1363
01:17:02.821 --> 01:17:07.690
results.
You know,
the year you hear it all the time,
let me do
that.

1364
01:17:07.691 --> 01:17:10.100
Some of that in my life.
That's how does I

1365
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.850
<v 3>think beds,
part of being a creative and impulsive person too.
You know,</v>

1366
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:17.780
impulsive people have like weird patterns,
right?
And fall into like me,

1367
01:17:17.781 --> 01:17:20.600
like I'll say like,
okay,
I gotta go to sleep.

1368
01:17:20.601 --> 01:17:22.880
It's fucking two o'clock in the morning.
I got to stop clicking on links.

1369
01:17:22.881 --> 01:17:26.330
I've got to go to bed.
And I walked by the pool table and I go,
you know what,

1370
01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:28.670
let me just fucking run a couple of racks here and next thing you know,

1371
01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:32.480
it's four 30 in,
the sun's coming up and I'm still playing pool.
You know,

1372
01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:35.370
it's interesting.
I get,
I just get a little something going on.

1373
01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:38.450
Crazy little drive crazy.
I'm crazy.

1374
01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:43.190
I have to regulate things,
keep myself from doing certain things.

1375
01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:46.010
Like I can't,
I don't allow myself to play in pool tournaments,

1376
01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.590
but like once every couple of months I'll play in one because I don't want to

1377
01:17:48.591 --> 01:17:51.470
get obsessed and then start like thinking about Joan and the pro tour,

1378
01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.760
fucking containing,
practicing eight hours a day.
Cause I really will do that.
I,

1379
01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:58.790
and then I don't know who I am and then I get crazy.
No,
that's tough.

1380
01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:02.540
It's identity and all that.
That's a tricky one.
Well it's,
it's an obsession.

1381
01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:05.530
It's handling and managing obsession.
You know?

1382
01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:08.810
That's like one of the most difficult things I think that people find,
you know,

1383
01:18:08.811 --> 01:18:13.100
so everybody does that.
Everybody fucking expects.
Yeah,

1384
01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:15.140
we're all crazy.
To a certain point.

1385
01:18:15.141 --> 01:18:19.100
It's like trying to enjoy it and manage it at the same time.
That's like the big,

1386
01:18:19.630 --> 01:18:22.430
the big key.
Trying to enjoy the whole process of life.

1387
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.680
Well it's like you say like being quick to forgive.
You know?

1388
01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.150
I find when I think about people,

1389
01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:33.110
people who handle bitterness in their lives well are the people that are happy.

1390
01:18:33.111 --> 01:18:36.380
You know,
it's like,
because it's so easy to be bitter about,
you know,

1391
01:18:36.381 --> 01:18:39.020
when you're a kid or when you thought you were going to have everything or you

1392
01:18:39.021 --> 01:18:41.180
thought you were going to be president or you thought this,

1393
01:18:41.181 --> 01:18:44.210
you deserve this and this and you don't always get what you think you deserve.

1394
01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:49.160
And the people that can kind of move on are the happy people that I know.

1395
01:18:49.161 --> 01:18:52.810
And there's people that haven't moved on for what they thought they deserved it

1396
01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.900
at 25 or 30 people that get crushed by a breakup in a relationship and they

1397
01:18:56.901 --> 01:19:00.770
never recover.
They just,
everybody's so it's women are cunts.
You know,

1398
01:19:00.771 --> 01:19:03.140
you ever met that guy and he say,
oh,

1399
01:19:03.141 --> 01:19:06.400
we're going to throw those boons row console just when James,
you,

1400
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:09.500
and then it was like,
no dude,
they just,
they're not in the you.
Yeah,

1401
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:13.850
you had a hard time.
So goddamn person,
no one deserves that.
People like them.

1402
01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.640
You have to work at it.
It's that easy.

1403
01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:20.870
There's a reason why people develop fun personalities like people to like them.

1404
01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:23.600
I hate that movie that the writers like the Nerd,
right?

1405
01:19:23.601 --> 01:19:27.170
So he writes like the hot really hot girl falls for the NERC cause she sees him

1406
01:19:27.171 --> 01:19:29.820
for who he really is.
Like that's such good,

1407
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:33.980
like no buddy clubs you for who you really are.
Like it's,
you have to,

1408
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:36.140
you have to try to be a good person.
You know,

1409
01:19:36.141 --> 01:19:39.590
you'd have to create a good person and then be it and then people will like you.

1410
01:19:39.591 --> 01:19:40.101
You know what I mean?

1411
01:19:40.101 --> 01:19:42.560
Remember that stupid movie as good as it gets with Jack Nicholson,

1412
01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.470
he's a racist and he's,
he's a boy.
He's crazy.

1413
01:19:45.471 --> 01:19:49.960
He's like an OCD or when she's a single mom and he's just doing,
and you know,

1414
01:19:50.150 --> 01:19:53.930
that movie drove me fucking crazy.
It made me angry because first of all,

1415
01:19:53.931 --> 01:19:57.920
it was like a real stupid way of dealing with it.
They forgave him a pill.

1416
01:19:58.610 --> 01:20:02.450
The pill is a pill.
Gonna fucking cure racism.

1417
01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:06.950
That is,
yeah.
It's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard in my life.

1418
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.430
There is a pill that cures racism.
Joe.
Really exercise.

1419
01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:16.670
My friends are all doing it,
you know,
that they're worried.
They're working on um,

1420
01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:21.480
uh,
proposing a legality of Mtma in Vancouver.
Apparently.

1421
01:20:21.481 --> 01:20:25.170
MDN first of all,
Vancouver system.
It is a wonderful place.
It is the shit.

1422
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:27.870
It's a city for adults is what it is.
The bathrooms are clean.

1423
01:20:27.871 --> 01:20:30.720
Like it's a nice city.
I was talking to Mrs Rogan,
I said,

1424
01:20:30.721 --> 01:20:33.160
if we ever left the country,
if we had to have to free fully,

1425
01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.430
that's what we would go to Vancouver every time we go there.
And I'm like,

1426
01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:38.460
we should maybe look at running north Vancouver like in the island,
sign up,

1427
01:20:38.461 --> 01:20:43.461
find something because you're in the deep woods and then awesome downtown five,

1428
01:20:43.771 --> 01:20:46.220
10 minutes away.
And people are nice.
You know,
it's,

1429
01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.410
it's like the number one city in the world.
They've like three or four times.

1430
01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:50.610
It's warm and you're right.

1431
01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:54.900
It's because it's at least half of that is because of the setting to setting a

1432
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:58.380
spec makes everyone feel good.
It does.
I,
that's,
that's so important.

1433
01:20:58.381 --> 01:21:01.740
That's one of the reasons why winter time and Boston is so goddamn depressing.

1434
01:21:01.770 --> 01:21:03.600
Let's fucking gray skies and England

1435
01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:10.320
and everybody talks like this pack packing fucking food into their fat face just

1436
01:21:10.321 --> 01:21:15.090
to try to stay warm.
You gotta do it.
When people do develop a layer of fat,

1437
01:21:15.091 --> 01:21:15.540
it's hard.

1438
01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:20.540
Finding skinny checks in the winter and post went off to college at Boston is

1439
01:21:21.481 --> 01:21:23.440
terrible.
Yeah he did.
He went to Cambridge at Harvard

1440
01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:29.700
and the tea and then go going to Lansdowne and looking for a cute girl and

1441
01:21:29.701 --> 01:21:34.701
Boston is good luck and there the few you find are off their rocker rocker cause

1442
01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:39.330
because there was so much get away with it.

1443
01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.690
One of the best things that ever happened to me was one of my first girlfriends

1444
01:21:42.691 --> 01:21:47.400
in high school was a total slut.
She was just completely broken.

1445
01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:50.310
Well it was good because it lowered my expectations about girls not cheating.

1446
01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.170
Oh Wow.
It's so crazy.

1447
01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:55.260
She cheated on me with one of my friends in front of my fucking house,

1448
01:21:58.290 --> 01:21:59.670
Catholic school,
the whole deal.

1449
01:21:59.671 --> 01:22:04.290
Just completely daddy attention issues and hot as fuck.
Like an aberration.

1450
01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.870
Her sister,
not that attractive.
Her older sister,

1451
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:11.340
not that attracted her off the charts.
So she was just completely crazy.

1452
01:22:11.341 --> 01:22:13.710
She had the Willy Wonka golden ticket.
Yeah,
exactly.

1453
01:22:13.770 --> 01:22:15.540
People don't believe what I tell.
Tell them then.

1454
01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:19.170
It's hard finding a pretty girl in Boston.
It's tough action.
It is.

1455
01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:23.710
It's like your friends would cry themselves to sleep every night in New York is

1456
01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.760
filled with pretty weird.
Yeah,
it's weird.
Yeah.

1457
01:22:26.890 --> 01:22:31.890
Mill filled with pretty model's pretty regular girls and they got,

1458
01:22:32.041 --> 01:22:34.080
you know,
even if they're not that pretty,
they've got something going on.

1459
01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:38.870
They intelligent a little fashion labor.
Would you live there in New York?
Yeah,

1460
01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:42.500
absolutely.
Would you take your family there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,

1461
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:46.290
I'm from the country I'm from.
I'm not like a sit comfortable in the city,

1462
01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.650
but I don't.
I have a three year old son now,
three,
almost four and I'm like,

1463
01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:55.700
I don't love the idea of growing up and being like a New Yorker or particularly

1464
01:22:56.371 --> 01:23:00.150
on Angel Layer.
The minute he looks,
he's like,
no,
Dad,

1465
01:23:00.151 --> 01:23:05.010
I'm going to be a skateboarder that's going to have worked out for Tony Hawk.

1466
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:10.240
Right.
I'm sure he's from the Midwest or something.
I don't know.
Where is he from?

1467
01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:13.750
Another,
he's got a great work ethic.
Yes,
you do.

1468
01:23:13.770 --> 01:23:16.440
You really mean how many Angelenos you don't have a great work ethic.
I know.

1469
01:23:16.441 --> 01:23:21.280
It was like to maybe Eddie Bravo,
believe it or not.
He's an Angeleno.

1470
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:24.670
He gets a lot done.
So there you go.
There you go.

1471
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:28.120
There's people everywhere you could develop org.
No,
I know.
And that's,

1472
01:23:28.121 --> 01:23:29.710
I think you're talking about raising kids.

1473
01:23:29.711 --> 01:23:32.770
I think that's the only thing you can do for a kid is give them a work ethic.

1474
01:23:32.771 --> 01:23:35.830
Because if they like to work,
give him more accounts.
They smart or not,

1475
01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.200
he's going to be fine.
He likes to work.
Here's my little dump.
Ditch digger.

1476
01:23:40.990 --> 01:23:44.470
He's going to be fine.
Yeah,
no,
but I mean,
that's all you can really do.
I mean,

1477
01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:47.890
yeah,
I guess in a way that is,
uh,
that's one of the few things he can do.

1478
01:23:47.891 --> 01:23:50.020
I mean he treated him to be nice to people,
treated him,

1479
01:23:50.021 --> 01:23:52.750
to teach him and explain to them,
you know,

1480
01:23:52.751 --> 01:23:56.080
how your philosophy on life and and uh,
you know,

1481
01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:00.940
it's not easy and then easy to raise human beings and that girl raise him and in

1482
01:24:00.941 --> 01:24:04.150
this environment and this world,
you know,
this world is ever changing.

1483
01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.330
We were just talking about this the other day that like how many people in La

1484
01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:07.631
Roofie people,

1485
01:24:07.631 --> 01:24:11.140
is it like one at a 10 is one out of 10 dudes out there trying to roofie chicks.

1486
01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:11.861
Are you serious?

1487
01:24:11.861 --> 01:24:14.860
I just try many stories of girls getting roofied so many stories.

1488
01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:18.100
It's friends of friends.
It's one of the,
that doesn't make any sense to me.

1489
01:24:18.101 --> 01:24:22.630
I think it's more just drunk girls that I can't do it.
No,
no,
no dude,

1490
01:24:22.631 --> 01:24:25.480
girls are getting roofied girls getting proofread for sure.

1491
01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:27.400
It's happening on a regular basis from that.

1492
01:24:27.450 --> 01:24:29.950
Misdefined cause like what's hot about that?
Like you want to bang,

1493
01:24:29.951 --> 01:24:33.040
this is nothing hot about it.
It's like look,

1494
01:24:33.850 --> 01:24:36.670
here's what happens to some dudes.
It's a horrible,
it's disgusting.

1495
01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:37.421
It's absolutely gross.

1496
01:24:37.421 --> 01:24:42.421
But what happens is some dudes is that they get rejected by girls all their life

1497
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:45.400
and so they're stupid and they're self centered.

1498
01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:49.030
So they associate this girl with making them feel bad.

1499
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:53.320
I could get back at her.
I could get back.
Power.
Power.
Yeah.
That girl,

1500
01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:55.720
the way she looks at you.
The fucking bitch won't even look at me.

1501
01:24:55.721 --> 01:24:57.340
She won't even talk to me.
Fucking bitch.

1502
01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:59.980
And then he dropped something in her drink and all of a sudden you're sticking

1503
01:24:59.981 --> 01:25:03.550
your dick inside of her.
Yeah.
Bitch.
Bitch didn't even know this was coming.

1504
01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:07.090
This sounds a little too detailed,
Jo.
She throws up

1505
01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:12.850
Joe.
Wait,
wait.
It sounds like you've been talking,
judge me,
man.

1506
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:17.790
You know,
I mean,
I think it's just a lot of idiots out there and that's up for,

1507
01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:18.101
first of all,

1508
01:25:18.101 --> 01:25:21.550
it's a terrible position to be in because attractive women have an undeniable

1509
01:25:21.551 --> 01:25:25.210
quality about them.
This is an undeniable magnetism.
It's really frightening.

1510
01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:28.510
You know,
that's like you have daughters,
right?
Like it's tough if you have a,

1511
01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:30.640
you mean if your daughters grow up to be really beautiful,

1512
01:25:30.641 --> 01:25:33.750
like that's not an easy thing.
It's tough,

1513
01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:37.540
which is we're going to take you serious.
Well,
it's,
it's not easy for them,

1514
01:25:37.541 --> 01:25:40.210
but it's easy.
It's easy to find men that want to fuck you,
that's for sure.
Oh,

1515
01:25:40.230 --> 01:25:41.110
you're never going to go hungry.

1516
01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:45.890
But it's easy to find people that want that are at you.
Because when you're,

1517
01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:50.110
when you're like a guy that has no chance,
you're ugly dude or your,
you know,

1518
01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:51.550
whatever the fuck is wrong with you,
right?

1519
01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:54.010
You have no chance of getting a beautiful girl.

1520
01:25:54.011 --> 01:25:57.130
Like that beautiful girl becomes like some sort of an unattainable kind of a

1521
01:25:57.131 --> 01:26:01.390
crazy Narnia,
like a human Narnia with serial killers do,
right.

1522
01:26:01.391 --> 01:26:03.830
You'd be objectified and it becomes this thing.

1523
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.370
<v 2>Well,
it's like,
you know,</v>

1524
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:08.780
the reason why people snap and they go crazy because they had been bullied the

1525
01:26:08.781 --> 01:26:12.110
whole life as because they associate bullies with this horrible negative
feeling.

1526
01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.110
You know,
a pretty woman is not bullying you by not fucking you,

1527
01:26:15.111 --> 01:26:19.580
but it still can be a negative constant reinforcement binder right there.

1528
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:21.400
Particularly if you've got other issues,
you know,

1529
01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:26.750
chemical imbalance and hence roofie let's do it.
That's fucking bad.
Can it be?

1530
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.660
We have to figure out a way to,
to really,
uh,

1531
01:26:31.670 --> 01:26:36.200
join people together with some sense of community even though was just a giant

1532
01:26:36.201 --> 01:26:39.650
number of us.
Even those 300 million of us or 7 billion,

1533
01:26:39.651 --> 01:26:40.640
if you count the whole planet,

1534
01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:45.820
we have to figure out a way to somehow or another not have progress based on

1535
01:26:45.981 --> 01:26:47.630
other people getting fucked over.
Yeah.

1536
01:26:47.631 --> 01:26:51.260
I don't know how the hell that's all I know there is this like the US and them

1537
01:26:51.261 --> 01:26:53.900
and it's like,
no,
that's just us.
That's all they like.

1538
01:26:54.450 --> 01:26:58.850
And it's such a prevalent style of thinking and it's,
it's very,
uh,

1539
01:26:58.910 --> 01:27:03.220
it's responsible for a lot of progress though cause it's responsible for the,

1540
01:27:03.221 --> 01:27:06.470
the drive to push forward is a lot of,
is based on competitive instincts.

1541
01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:09.980
There's this great book,
uh,
you knew Eo Wilson is,
he's a,

1542
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:15.070
he's a famous sort of famous professor of bugs like entomologist or whatever.

1543
01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.050
And he wrote,
he writes also about human evolution.

1544
01:27:18.051 --> 01:27:21.530
He wrote a book called the social conquest of earth is his new book.

1545
01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:26.600
And it's all about the social side,
you know,
like that,
that um,

1546
01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:30.110
groups competing,
right?
So there's,
you know,
we're all,
they used to,

1547
01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:32.740
they used to think there was a,
an altruistic gene,

1548
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:35.840
like part of your genetic makeup made you want to help other people,

1549
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:40.250
even if it hurt you.
And what they think now is that's not the case.
It's more,

1550
01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:45.380
it's kind of like a subtle distinction,
but it's kind of more just that groups,

1551
01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:46.610
there's select,
there's,

1552
01:27:46.630 --> 01:27:49.820
there's natural selection pressure on a group as well as on the individual.

1553
01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:54.380
So like,
you know,
for you by herself in a group,
like the more selfish you are,

1554
01:27:54.381 --> 01:27:55.400
the better you're going to do.

1555
01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:59.690
But if for our whole group is made up of selfish dudes,
that group,
that's not,

1556
01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:01.610
it's going to kick our ass.
Right?

1557
01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:06.380
So there's this competition of these two genetic,
it's an interesting,
you know,

1558
01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:07.850
he's,
and he's a super amped guy.

1559
01:28:07.851 --> 01:28:12.740
You have to have a place of prosperity and surplus before you start feeling

1560
01:28:12.741 --> 01:28:15.290
generous.
You know,
that's the problem with a lot of people.

1561
01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:19.400
Even some people are never happy like the Hamptons dudes.
It's like,
yeah,

1562
01:28:19.401 --> 01:28:22.710
you know,
my house is worth 40 but the guy down the street,
89 million,

1563
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:26.930
can you believe it?
One acres is son of a board is not enough.
Yeah.
And you,

1564
01:28:26.931 --> 01:28:30.000
you can,
you know,
the know that you get in that habit and it's,

1565
01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.660
that's why they can't enjoy it.
You know,
they,
they,
it's not,
it's,

1566
01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:36.370
they're not satisfied and never,
you'd never have enough.
You never,
yeah,

1567
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:38.870
I'm satisfied.
Like I,
there's businessmen then I can think of,

1568
01:28:38.871 --> 01:28:42.170
and that you can think of that like didn't sound enough.

1569
01:28:42.171 --> 01:28:46.130
They got six Ferrari's and they got everything they wanted and it's not enough.

1570
01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.120
Well,
it's part of the game for them as acquiring the numbers.
That's what's fun.

1571
01:28:50.121 --> 01:28:52.850
They love being a winner and they still don't feel like,
you know,

1572
01:28:52.851 --> 01:28:55.620
in their heart that they are a winner.
You know,
like that's the,
well,

1573
01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:56.181
they probably,

1574
01:28:56.181 --> 01:29:01.181
they do are lacking some really intense experiences in whether it's a emotional

1575
01:29:01.921 --> 01:29:02.460
experiences,

1576
01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:05.790
<v 1>psychedelic experiences.
I'm telling you,
man,
you know what,
um,</v>

1577
01:29:06.650 --> 01:29:08.030
<v 4>talking about psychedelic experiences,</v>

1578
01:29:08.031 --> 01:29:10.730
my wife has been really into this because her grandparents are dying.

1579
01:29:10.731 --> 01:29:15.731
Like they're in their nineties and apparently mushrooms for elderly people,

1580
01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:22.900
one trip increases their standard of living for a whole year because it just

1581
01:29:24.321 --> 01:29:24.560
like

1582
01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.010
<v 1>frees them up a little bit from like the bind of their own body or whatever</v>

1583
01:29:28.011 --> 01:29:29.070
reason.
Well,
the,

1584
01:29:29.071 --> 01:29:33.350
the idea is that it calms them and they don't worry about dying anymore.

1585
01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:37.630
It has like a huge,
uh,
affect positive.
They're positive effect

1586
01:29:37.690 --> 01:29:38.550
<v 4>dawn on,</v>

1587
01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:43.220
<v 1>on their,
their mindset,
which I love.
They idea of that.
Yeah.
Well I think it,</v>

1588
01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:48.240
it brings you to some sort of a divine state of mind that may or may not be

1589
01:29:48.241 --> 01:29:50.160
real.
It might just be euphoria.
I mean,

1590
01:29:50.161 --> 01:29:53.300
there's so many unanswered questions about what it doesn't matter.
No,

1591
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:56.260
it doesn't matter.
But it might be real as well.
Yes.

1592
01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:57.380
You don't know what the fuck life,

1593
01:29:58.110 --> 01:30:01.410
<v 4>you know,
your perspective and your,
I mean psychedelics from,</v>

1594
01:30:01.411 --> 01:30:04.320
I haven't done a lot of it.
I've done it a dozen times or whatever,

1595
01:30:04.321 --> 01:30:08.760
but hugely important in terms of my understanding of the world,
you know?

1596
01:30:08.761 --> 01:30:12.660
And I think,
you know,
you need to,
it's funny,
I always think about,

1597
01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:14.710
I do it with my hand because like you meet,

1598
01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:17.770
I would meet these Germans in Europe and they play chess and then they're like,

1599
01:30:17.970 --> 01:30:21.420
they're Germans,
right?
So it's like this,
everything's like this.
I'm like,
no,

1600
01:30:21.421 --> 01:30:24.160
you got,
you have to run like this.
You want to be a little bit,
just look,

1601
01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:27.090
look at it a little more,
you know?
And then when you,
if you do too much,

1602
01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:29.220
too much acid or whatever,
he started to get a little,

1603
01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:32.120
you can't quite keep it in at all.
You know what I mean?

1604
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:35.490
It's a little too frazzled,
but uh,

1605
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:38.410
<v 1>well what do you mean by cause for folks at home that are listening,
this alone,</v>

1606
01:30:38.411 --> 01:30:41.800
you're doing like you have blinders on when you're talking about Germans.

1607
01:30:41.801 --> 01:30:44.260
Then you spread your hands up when you're talking about looking at chess.

1608
01:30:44.261 --> 01:30:45.094
Creative.
Yeah,

1609
01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:47.890
<v 4>yeah.
Just casting your net really wide.
And I think,
you know,</v>

1610
01:30:47.891 --> 01:30:50.670
being this book Jonah Lehrer just wrote called imagine,

1611
01:30:50.671 --> 01:30:51.900
which is all about imagination.

1612
01:30:51.901 --> 01:30:55.830
It's like things that help you focus like chemicals,
like Ritalin and stuff.

1613
01:30:55.831 --> 01:31:00.330
Actually hamper your creativity because you need to be accessing distant deep

1614
01:31:00.331 --> 01:31:01.350
parts of your brain.

1615
01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:04.830
So like Adderall would hamper your creating anything like that.

1616
01:31:04.890 --> 01:31:08.670
Coffee Hampers your creativity.
It helps you concentrate,
it helps you work,

1617
01:31:08.671 --> 01:31:13.200
it helps you focus.
Uh,
but just in terms of like being innovative,

1618
01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.093
um,

1619
01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:18.120
that's why when you're falling asleep or taking a shower or relaxing or driving,

1620
01:31:18.121 --> 01:31:23.040
we were kind of half distracting your,
your focus mind is when you're,
you're,

1621
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:27.540
the system is still running and it's picking out these very strange,
oh,

1622
01:31:27.541 --> 01:31:29.890
I should use fishing line for that problem.
You know what I mean?
It's,

1623
01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:31.920
it's like they and travel,

1624
01:31:31.921 --> 01:31:36.921
like they find like immigrants hold a lot more patents per capita,

1625
01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:40.260
whatever it is,
you know,
because they,
they,
when you're in a new place,

1626
01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:44.660
you're forced to think differently.
And there's a website called [inaudible].

1627
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:46.420
Anyway,
it's a cool book is theirs,

1628
01:31:46.630 --> 01:31:50.820
but it's about this kind of crowd sourcing and,
uh,
that,
that,

1629
01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:55.170
that your imagination really comes from broad thinking,

1630
01:31:55.171 --> 01:31:56.310
not narrow thinking.

1631
01:31:56.660 --> 01:32:00.070
<v 1>Well,
uh,
I know the writers on news radio,
one of things that you should do to</v>

1632
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:02.950
<v 3>inspire themselves to stay up all night and then they went and start writing</v>

1633
01:32:02.951 --> 01:32:06.400
until like four o'clock in the morning when they're all half awake and you would

1634
01:32:06.401 --> 01:32:09.490
write the,
they would write the most silly and funny shit that way.
Right.

1635
01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:12.840
You know,
there's,
and that's,
you know what really interesting.
Yeah.

1636
01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:16.670
A lot of people do that.
They write when they're sleep deprived.
Right.

1637
01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.000
I thought I'd do that.
Yeah.
And they think that,
well,

1638
01:32:19.001 --> 01:32:21.550
I think it's comedy writing comedy is like a silly thing.

1639
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:26.830
Kind of like you're casting for funny,
funny,
funny links like,
yeah.
And this,
this,

1640
01:32:26.831 --> 01:32:29.530
and this is funny,
you know,
sometimes when you're doing something and like,

1641
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:32.560
especially when you're traveling and you were the friend and you're both

1642
01:32:32.561 --> 01:32:34.990
exhausted and you just start being just completely retarded.

1643
01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:37.630
And that's one of the best things about comedians.
It's like,

1644
01:32:37.631 --> 01:32:40.210
we'll be up the front slide it like six o'clock in the morning.
He'd be like,

1645
01:32:40.211 --> 01:32:44.840
shut up bitch.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We'll come up with a stupid shit to say to each other.

1646
01:32:44.841 --> 01:32:49.090
I mean that's half the fun of traveling,
you know?
No,
I know.
I miss it.
Yeah.

1647
01:32:49.091 --> 01:32:50.980
Being exhausted for whatever reason,

1648
01:32:51.010 --> 01:32:55.090
it just deactivates certain areas of the motherland and activates others.

1649
01:32:55.330 --> 01:32:56.290
The unconscious,

1650
01:32:56.410 --> 01:33:00.420
the ability to just let thoughts come instead of like direct Iraqi dreaming

1651
01:33:00.450 --> 01:33:04.060
director if you can kind of control your daydreaming.
Not like just space out.

1652
01:33:04.061 --> 01:33:07.300
But that was another thing he talks about.
It's a cool book but it's,
it's uh,

1653
01:33:08.290 --> 01:33:09.960
yeah,
there's so does it have like,
um,

1654
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:14.990
methodologies and it has like big picture stuff like Pixar studies and these

1655
01:33:15.221 --> 01:33:15.520
Kemp,

1656
01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:20.440
these companies that like they couldn't solve these engineering problems so they

1657
01:33:20.441 --> 01:33:20.921
put them on the,

1658
01:33:20.921 --> 01:33:25.921
on the web site called incentive and they have cash prizes and there are solved

1659
01:33:25.931 --> 01:33:30.100
like within weeks of course,
because it's like solved by like,
you know,

1660
01:33:30.101 --> 01:33:34.450
a botanist from Sweden who you would never hire,
you would never consult,

1661
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:38.380
but he's got an easy way to do it with like seeds that pull carbon from,

1662
01:33:38.381 --> 01:33:42.820
you know what I mean?
It's like just that crowdsourcing mine stuff.

1663
01:33:42.821 --> 01:33:46.360
It's kind of cool.
Well,
I love doing that and I do that all the time.

1664
01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:50.200
I did that recently on my message board.
I have a powerful tool,
man.

1665
01:33:50.201 --> 01:33:54.010
My message board is filled with some fucking brilliant motherfuckers.

1666
01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:58.110
The Internet and means in comedy.
Like can someone,
right like something.
I mean,

1667
01:33:58.111 --> 01:34:02.680
I think it's so funny.
I find means to be genius.
You know,
there's some,
oh yeah,

1668
01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:06.580
I'd love the crap things.
I love the Georgia,
by the way.
Giorgio sucralose.

1669
01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:09.430
Next Tuesday.
He's coming on next Tuesday,
another noon one.
Brian,

1670
01:34:09.431 --> 01:34:10.264
you're going to be okay.

1671
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:13.750
Don't go crazy on Monday night and stay up till seven o'clock in the morning.

1672
01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.510
You can do it.
You've gotta be here at noon next Tuesday.
Um,

1673
01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:21.040
but Giorgio is the guy from,
uh,
ancient aliens with the crazy hair.

1674
01:34:21.690 --> 01:34:25.950
I'm not saying it was aliens,
but it's that dude.
It's so funny.
Yeah.

1675
01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:30.370
That's like you've seen them.
Those are all huge.
He is a source for my,
I mean,

1676
01:34:30.371 --> 01:34:35.020
it really is.
I had a lot of my personal humor that I can't ever,
you.
Yeah.
Oh,

1677
01:34:35.021 --> 01:34:37.270
me too.
My wife showed me when my right.
She,

1678
01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:40.300
she finds him on the Internet and then save some for me.
But one of them says,

1679
01:34:40.301 --> 01:34:43.210
beware of the dog also,
that cat a shady as fuck.

1680
01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:51.790
Also that cat is shady as fuck.
I want,
I want that.
And then my house,

1681
01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.940
you know?
No,
I mean,
I loved them all,
man.
I mean,
I mean,

1682
01:34:54.941 --> 01:34:58.100
not all of a sudden a lot of them aren't funny,
but there are,
there's just some

1683
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:02.690
<v 1>diamonds out there.
Well,
there's also an,
it's sort of a new style of humor.
What,</v>

1684
01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:07.700
well,
one of the ways I met Brian,
I mean,
Brian is,
I mean,
he doesn't do it enough,

1685
01:35:07.730 --> 01:35:12.020
but he,
he's uh,
he's brilliant at editing videos,
making like really funny,

1686
01:35:12.021 --> 01:35:14.120
silly videos and putting them on the Internet.

1687
01:35:14.121 --> 01:35:16.040
And if you stop to think about it before the Internet,

1688
01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:17.960
that doesn't mean that didn't exist.

1689
01:35:17.961 --> 01:35:22.220
There was no individual funny videos that were five minutes long and the people

1690
01:35:22.221 --> 01:35:25.550
would make on something that just happened yesterday.
You know what I mean?

1691
01:35:25.551 --> 01:35:30.420
That is a really unique sort of,
uh,
humor tool for the Internet.
You know,
that,

1692
01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:34.200
those,
those photos,
memes,
you know?
Yeah.

1693
01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:39.470
A little videos,
things along those lines.
They didn't,
you know,
didn't exist.

1694
01:35:40.130 --> 01:35:44.300
Fucking podcast didn't exist yet.
This,
this show is weird as it is.

1695
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:47.170
Would have never existed.
You can never,
yeah,
the radios.
Radios.

1696
01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:51.550
<v 2>Yeah.
When are you gonna do ads?
Who's going to advertise?
Nobody.
Mushroom.</v>

1697
01:35:51.551 --> 01:35:54.490
Fleshlight fleshlight from China.

1698
01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.910
So are you allowed to talk about your new book at all?

1699
01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:02.500
I knew I'll just say I got it.
I mean just,
it's coming out in January,

1700
01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:06.900
so I'll hopefully be back to do a real press tour with you and,
Oh,
100% yeah,

1701
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:10.030
we'll do a big doubt.
I want to get Joe to blurb it if he likes it.

1702
01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:13.360
If he doesn't like it,
that's fine.
You know,
I'm going to like it.
That's fine.

1703
01:36:13.361 --> 01:36:16.480
That's fine.
Joe,
I want to talk to you about what you did though.

1704
01:36:16.481 --> 01:36:20.530
You can't talk about what you did.
Let's just,
what kind of a secrecy is this?

1705
01:36:20.531 --> 01:36:25.050
Sam Sheridan.
This is craziness.
Yeah,
I can talk about what I did.
So it's a story.

1706
01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:29.220
It's the book's about surviving the end of the world and what is it?

1707
01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:33.880
The working title is called real title.
This is a disaster diaries.

1708
01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:37.120
Um,
and why is this a secret?
Right?
It's not really a secret,

1709
01:36:37.121 --> 01:36:39.550
but it's like they don't,
they just this,
I'm just,

1710
01:36:39.610 --> 01:36:41.830
I'm an idiot and basically like I do what they tell me.

1711
01:36:41.831 --> 01:36:44.890
But here's the weird thing about owning being a writer,
you know,

1712
01:36:44.891 --> 01:36:49.420
you don't really own,
they buy it from you and then you kind of facilitate that,

1713
01:36:49.421 --> 01:36:53.380
you know?
So it's like I'm consult on the cover.
For instance,

1714
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:55.750
if I hate the cover,
like tough shit.

1715
01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:59.560
Well they're not going to make me go with a cover that makes me cry every time I

1716
01:36:59.561 --> 01:37:02.800
see it.
But we had a little battle.
I mean,
I liked his cover now,
but

1717
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:05.950
<v 1>gave back my money.
I had a book deal.</v>

1718
01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:10.300
I gave back the money because I didn't want to have the conversation.
I was like,

1719
01:37:10.301 --> 01:37:13.530
I would send them in stuff and they'd be like,
this is too weird.
This is to this,

1720
01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.460
that,
okay,
I can be like this.
We can't work out.

1721
01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:19.900
Like you guys don't understand my fans.
Like when I'm writing,
hold on,

1722
01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:24.730
what I'm writing about my own personal philosophy and how I handled the world.

1723
01:37:24.731 --> 01:37:28.030
Like you can't tell me that's weird.
You know it's also,
yeah,
I mean you're,

1724
01:37:28.150 --> 01:37:32.170
you don't,
that's the thing,
like nobody understands your fan base like you do.

1725
01:37:32.190 --> 01:37:36.220
And I had the same issue,
like when I was writing the MMA stuff,
they're like,
oh,

1726
01:37:36.221 --> 01:37:38.130
those guys don't buy books.
You're like,

1727
01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:43.600
these guys are designing gum for a serious conversation about,

1728
01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:47.320
you know,
fighting and,
and what it means.
And folks listening to this,

1729
01:37:47.321 --> 01:37:52.210
Sam has two of the best books ever written on MMA and in fighting and combat

1730
01:37:52.211 --> 01:37:56.220
sports period.
One of them is the first one he wrote called a fighter's

1731
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:59.010
<v 3>heart.
And the new one is called the fighter's mind.</v>

1732
01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:04.070
Both of them are outstanding and both of them are so detailed and documented and

1733
01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:07.800
you know,
and so honest about your approach.
And you know,

1734
01:38:07.801 --> 01:38:11.550
I watched the documentary that you did where you,
you spent some real time in a,

1735
01:38:11.551 --> 01:38:14.820
in a Moitai training camp and you know,
and you,
you had that fight,

1736
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.690
which was a fucking crazy fight with that Japanese dude.

1737
01:38:17.691 --> 01:38:20.590
Who's the Guy Missing Hacker,
right?
Full body tattoos and the full,

1738
01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:24.180
the guy's foot Donnelly that Sam had been training for.
How long?
Like,

1739
01:38:24.181 --> 01:38:27.660
I don't know,
four months.
Four months.
This guy was a bad motherfucker.

1740
01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:31.320
This guy was,
he was a total sandbagger.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1741
01:38:31.321 --> 01:38:34.290
He was a heavyweight karate champ.
Yeah.

1742
01:38:34.350 --> 01:38:37.110
Which he told me like two days before the fight,
but he never fought more time.

1743
01:38:37.230 --> 01:38:40.800
But he was at western Osaka headway crown.
It was,
it's so ridiculous.

1744
01:38:40.801 --> 01:38:44.440
But you kicked his ass.
Yeah.
He wasn't ready.
You know,
he wasn't a tape.

1745
01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:48.350
What time in is so conditioning.
Yeah.

1746
01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:52.200
<v 4>If you're not in shape,
don't you too?
If you took a heavy fucking right hand.</v>

1747
01:38:52.201 --> 01:38:55.320
Yeah.
I ate some shit on that one.
It's different.
The air.

1748
01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:59.190
But you got up while I was in amazing shape.
I mean,
I was retired.
I mean,

1749
01:38:59.191 --> 01:39:02.370
I was training twice a day and do an eight mile run in the morning with like the

1750
01:39:02.371 --> 01:39:06.930
top [inaudible] guys and you know,
that's your conditioning gets,

1751
01:39:07.770 --> 01:39:12.030
it's the kind of thing where it's so advanced that like I went into town and I

1752
01:39:12.031 --> 01:39:15.810
had a beer one beer and it set me back three weeks and my conditioning,

1753
01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.630
because you can measure how many pad rounds you can get through.

1754
01:39:18.631 --> 01:39:21.150
Like I'm getting through six hard pad rounds,
you know what I mean?

1755
01:39:21.151 --> 01:39:25.970
Or through eight I'm feeling pretty good.
And I actually,
it was like,
you know,

1756
01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:29.490
you become so fine tuned.
That's amazing.
Yeah,
it's weird.

1757
01:39:29.491 --> 01:39:31.710
I mean I was a little old too.
I was like 26 at the time.

1758
01:39:31.711 --> 01:39:35.430
What made you decide to do that?
What was that about?
I mean,
you know,

1759
01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:38.790
everybody has this,
we all watch Bruce Lee and we all,
you know what I mean?

1760
01:39:38.791 --> 01:39:41.550
Didn't we all,
I mean who didn't want to be an engine and a,

1761
01:39:41.610 --> 01:39:44.940
I was sailing around the world and working in Australia and I had boxed a little

1762
01:39:44.941 --> 01:39:48.510
in college,
um,
when I was like smoking and drinking and you know,

1763
01:39:48.511 --> 01:39:52.710
it was a terrible boxer.
But,
uh,
I wanted to try,

1764
01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:56.130
I wanted to get away from the partying that I was doing cause sailing's a pretty

1765
01:39:56.131 --> 01:40:00.870
hard drink in sport and um,
you know,
it seemed like a good idea at the time.

1766
01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:03.300
You know,
it's funny,
I did the daily show and it was,

1767
01:40:03.301 --> 01:40:05.460
I'd never done any press before ever.

1768
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:08.820
That was my first press and no one had told me how to do press,
which is like,

1769
01:40:08.821 --> 01:40:11.790
you got to stay on message,
right?
Like don't worry about what they ask you.

1770
01:40:12.150 --> 01:40:15.420
You're going to say two things,
you know what I mean?
I didn't know that.

1771
01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:19.200
Tell you to do that.
Yeah.
Well,
if you have a message,
try to get it out.

1772
01:40:19.201 --> 01:40:21.720
You know what I mean?
That's like,
yeah,
cause you only have a minute,
right.

1773
01:40:21.721 --> 01:40:24.680
Or whatever.
Those things suck.
That's why you should only do podcasts.
Yeah.

1774
01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:28.890
I know,
well yeah,
the time at the time.
But John Stewart goes,

1775
01:40:28.891 --> 01:40:33.720
so why did you do it?
And I was like,
uh,
it seems like a good idea at the time,

1776
01:40:35.690 --> 01:40:38.880
<v 3>Matt.
The smoothest,
but that's the most honest.
I mean,</v>

1777
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:44.570
any impulsive,
crazy thought than I've ever done.
It's like,
you know,
it's like,

1778
01:40:44.590 --> 01:40:48.810
well,
let's fucking chance see what this is going to be like getting tattoos.

1779
01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:52.370
Fuck.
Exactly.
Moving to Colorado fucking whatever.

1780
01:40:52.371 --> 01:40:55.750
Going hunting in where it's like fuck it.
Right?
Yeah.

1781
01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:59.440
Life has to be a series of those fucking things.
He never learned anything good.

1782
01:40:59.510 --> 01:41:02.350
Dammit.
Do you gotta do it?
I have a whole thing.

1783
01:41:02.351 --> 01:41:04.820
I have a whole bid on like nihilism and fucking and what,

1784
01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:08.390
where that comes from and,
and uh,
and uh,
you know,

1785
01:41:08.410 --> 01:41:10.880
I think there's like know I make it sound classics.

1786
01:41:10.890 --> 01:41:12.910
I throw in some Kafka quotes and stuff like that,

1787
01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:15.010
but there definitely is like this,

1788
01:41:15.370 --> 01:41:18.810
like this plunge towards like self destruction where you're like,
fucking,

1789
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:22.960
I don't care what happens.
And not many women will get on that train.

1790
01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:25.271
Yeah.

1791
01:41:25.271 --> 01:41:27.970
What's going to happen when the apocalypse comes and women and gonna fucking

1792
01:41:27.971 --> 01:41:31.100
toughen up and then
killing animals.

1793
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:34.630
The first thing I'm doing is shaving my head going low and it's like,
yeah,
yeah,

1794
01:41:34.631 --> 01:41:36.370
it's right.
That's when the apocalypse comes.

1795
01:41:36.371 --> 01:41:37.990
The first thing she's gonna do a shave her head going,

1796
01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:41.760
I'm going to your house too.
I'm going to live right after it.
Get after it.

1797
01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:46.790
I'm high.
Great spot.
Good spot.
Well offensible up there.
You've got water.
Yeah.

1798
01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:48.850
Yeah,
but I want to be even further away.

1799
01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:51.730
I mean I lived in the woods for a while and I really liked it.

1800
01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:53.980
I lived in Colorado for like four months,

1801
01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:58.060
but I really liked the idea that if the shit went down,
first of all,

1802
01:41:58.061 --> 01:42:01.570
I haven't well too,
there's deer everywhere.
Like yeah,
I like that.

1803
01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.850
Like I've been watching the show mountain men,
you ever watch it?

1804
01:42:03.850 --> 01:42:06.010
And new show history channel.
Good fucking show.

1805
01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:10.420
And it's all about these dudes that are living in like one guy's living in

1806
01:42:10.421 --> 01:42:14.890
Alaska,
he has to fly in with a,
with a plane to his lies everywhere.

1807
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:18.670
Like two is trapping cabin 40 below.
Outside.
Yeah.

1808
01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:22.120
And so he lives there for several months in the winter and then he flies back to

1809
01:42:22.121 --> 01:42:23.830
his family.
That's how he makes his living.

1810
01:42:23.831 --> 01:42:25.660
And he fucking has to collect furs and shit.

1811
01:42:26.230 --> 01:42:27.910
And then another dude is living in Montana.

1812
01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:31.360
They have another dude in North Carolina and they follow these guys as they're

1813
01:42:31.361 --> 01:42:35.560
trying to like prepare for winter and they're self set up and they're all

1814
01:42:35.561 --> 01:42:40.430
completely self sufficient.
And it's sort of fairly near guns.
I mean,
you know,

1815
01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:43.630
obviously I know you have your own supplies and stuff.
Yeah.
They get supplies,

1816
01:42:43.631 --> 01:42:46.200
but you know,
they're essentially live in their home doing it.

1817
01:42:46.210 --> 01:42:47.530
There were no grocery stores.
No.

1818
01:42:47.531 --> 01:42:49.460
And they got the skills and they got the know how.

1819
01:42:49.461 --> 01:42:53.020
And that's the fun of like all that,
you know.
Yeah.
I love,
I mean,
I would,

1820
01:42:53.410 --> 01:42:54.221
if I had my choice,

1821
01:42:54.221 --> 01:42:58.060
I would live somewhere in British Columbia that's accessible by boat,
you know,

1822
01:42:58.450 --> 01:43:01.390
that's where I would like to live,
you know,
along that coast somewhere up there.

1823
01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:05.630
The problem is you live in with some fucking crazy survivor type people.
Yeah.

1824
01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:07.860
But they're like a thousand miles away,
you know what I mean?

1825
01:43:08.110 --> 01:43:12.670
Do you just want to live in an area that's like rural but has access to us?
Well,

1826
01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.850
you know,
unfortunately my wife and you know,

1827
01:43:15.010 --> 01:43:19.840
she needs to be around the city a little bit and,
and uh,
you know,
I,
I,
it's,

1828
01:43:19.841 --> 01:43:23.650
I like to be around people.
I do,
you know,
it's,
I like to do both,
but I,
you know,

1829
01:43:23.651 --> 01:43:26.350
I miss the deep,
deep woods.
Well,

1830
01:43:26.351 --> 01:43:31.030
this piece out there that we don't realize how many signals are in the air,

1831
01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:34.960
whether it's fucking radio signals or cell phone signals from the barn of the

1832
01:43:34.961 --> 01:43:38.860
city.
I don't mean people can say all day that that doesn't affect you,

1833
01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:42.670
but there's a weird feeling that you get when you're in the top of a mountain

1834
01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:46.990
and you're standing out there and you hear nothing and you see a bird fly by and

1835
01:43:46.991 --> 01:43:49.660
you hear nothing.
It's like,
Whoa,
what did I feel like?
I feel light.

1836
01:43:50.170 --> 01:43:51.860
I feel like there's a weight off of me.

1837
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:55.040
<v 2>And I think part of that is the hum of the fucking city.</v>

1838
01:43:55.190 --> 01:44:00.020
The massive millions and millions of conscious minds that are all operating in

1839
01:44:00.021 --> 01:44:04.280
this one area.
We,
even if it's just the numbers of people on the highway,

1840
01:44:04.281 --> 01:44:08.780
the car's rolling,
the exhaust fumes away from all that.

1841
01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:13.190
I feel like that's a rare thing.
You don't,
you don't get that very often.

1842
01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:16.670
And when you do get it,
you,
you really sort of as,
especially as I get older,

1843
01:44:16.671 --> 01:44:20.420
I appreciate it more and more.
It's incredibly healthy.
I think,
you know,
it is,

1844
01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:23.870
again,
going back to what,
you know,
being in your natural state.
I mean,
I'm not,

1845
01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:26.850
I don't,
you know,
I don't want to,
I wouldn't want to do it forever.
Right.

1846
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:29.580
I like that.
You know,
I love New York.
I love going to New York.
You know,
it's,

1847
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:33.430
I love the restaurant.
Oh my God,
I love being able to get a hot shower.

1848
01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:37.620
I'll kill you.
I'll kill a man for a hot.
But you know,

1849
01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:42.800
it's,
it is so good for you to be,
and that's one thing,
you know,

1850
01:44:42.801 --> 01:44:46.040
I lived on sailboats for like three or four years and it was amazing because you

1851
01:44:46.041 --> 01:44:49.370
really do become isolated because you know,

1852
01:44:49.371 --> 01:44:52.610
it's three quarters of the earth's surface and not a lot is going on out there,

1853
01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:55.690
you know,
and you really get away on a sailboat.

1854
01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:57.830
Even going on a really well known route,

1855
01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:01.550
you'll see a boats for the first couple hours and then you won't see anybody for

1856
01:45:01.551 --> 01:45:04.940
15 days until you're coming in the last hundred miles.
Dude,

1857
01:45:04.941 --> 01:45:08.990
you've lived a fucking crazy life man.
You went open ocean,

1858
01:45:08.991 --> 01:45:13.950
sail boating for years.
I worked on boats,
I was a first mate type and uh,

1859
01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:17.850
did some charter work in the Caribbean and then we took this boat around to um,

1860
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:21.680
through the canal,
across the Pacific to sail boats or work too,
right?
Yeah.

1861
01:45:21.681 --> 01:45:24.950
I mean,
you know,
yeah,
yeah.
I was getting paid.
It was work.
Know what I mean?

1862
01:45:24.951 --> 01:45:29.690
Like it's difficult doing that also because you know it's,
you know,

1863
01:45:29.691 --> 01:45:32.630
she can break dude and like I can look at an engine like oh no,

1864
01:45:32.631 --> 01:45:34.160
but some sales she's like,
oh yeah,

1865
01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:37.310
we can still that shit up or put a rope here and make something work.

1866
01:45:37.311 --> 01:45:38.730
And I guess that's a way to look at it.

1867
01:45:38.731 --> 01:45:42.950
And like I would like for the end of the world much rather be in a sailboat than

1868
01:45:42.951 --> 01:45:46.250
the motor book because you run out of gas,
right.
Fucking row in that thing.

1869
01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:49.040
That's true.
Well it's the ultimate old school way to travel.

1870
01:45:49.041 --> 01:45:52.760
And you think like a manual transmissions.
Old School,
right?
Yeah.

1871
01:45:52.761 --> 01:45:57.350
The joke is it's the slowest,
most expensive and least comfortable way to travel.

1872
01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:01.070
Yeah.
My parents lived on a sailboat.
They just decided to take a,

1873
01:46:01.370 --> 01:46:06.180
they took about almost two years on that life.
Lived down in The Bahamas.
Sure.

1874
01:46:06.210 --> 01:46:09.530
And the keys and just bought a sailboat.
You go visit,
traveled around.

1875
01:46:10.050 --> 01:46:12.520
They actually came up here.
They didn't ever went down to the bone.

1876
01:46:12.530 --> 01:46:15.740
Never got on the boat.
Yeah,
I did.
I did a little of that too.
It was weird.

1877
01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:18.470
It was strange.
You get used to it and it's also,
you know,

1878
01:46:18.471 --> 01:46:21.020
with your parents maybe,
but it's,
you know,
well,

1879
01:46:21.021 --> 01:46:24.260
I was just like these crazy characters.
You guys,

1880
01:46:24.261 --> 01:46:25.640
you guys are living on this little tiny boat.

1881
01:46:25.641 --> 01:46:29.090
My mom was like totally not digging and after a while she was anyway at first,

1882
01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:32.210
but after a while.
So yeah,
it's a very small space.
Still have all your stuff.

1883
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:36.080
You don't get away from people across the Indian Ocean with my buddy and his

1884
01:46:36.081 --> 01:46:37.670
girlfriend.
And they were like,
they were,

1885
01:46:37.671 --> 01:46:41.360
he was British and she was French and they were fighting and that's like six

1886
01:46:41.361 --> 01:46:43.840
months they were fighting in the boat and you know,

1887
01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:45.840
we didn't see each other much because you're sleeping in shifts.

1888
01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:50.040
You actually don't deal with anybody that much.
But uh,
yeah,
it's

1889
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:54.750
<v 4>small.
I mean,
it was a 30 just the ones,
French ones,
English,</v>

1890
01:46:54.751 --> 01:46:56.250
you know what I mean?
They're funny about everything.

1891
01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:00.410
Outlook on life is completely different,
but wow.

1892
01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:04.560
That's what you did that for three years.
Ah,
yeah.
Off and on.

1893
01:47:04.710 --> 01:47:06.060
And was just another thing that you said.
Well,

1894
01:47:06.061 --> 01:47:07.440
I'm just going to go looking for adventure.

1895
01:47:07.650 --> 01:47:09.930
This was one of those things where I got offered the job and I was like,

1896
01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.010
I can't turn this down.

1897
01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:15.630
I was actually going to do the military and somebody's eye through a connection

1898
01:47:15.631 --> 01:47:18.360
of,
I was,
this guy offered me a job fixing his boat up and he's like,

1899
01:47:18.361 --> 01:47:22.650
I want to sit on around the world.
I want to pay you.
I was like,
I gotta do that,

1900
01:47:22.651 --> 01:47:25.450
you know?
I can't if I said no to this,
it's never going to happen again.
You know?

1901
01:47:25.451 --> 01:47:28.410
And this way you didn't have to do it anywhere where you're worried about

1902
01:47:28.411 --> 01:47:31.350
pirates.
Yeah.
No,
not really.
I mean there,

1903
01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:34.110
there is piracy and it certainly has actually gotten worse,

1904
01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:38.760
but you go around it like if you go through the Gulf by small,

1905
01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:41.070
yeah.
That's where it's really bad.
And then Indonesia,

1906
01:47:41.071 --> 01:47:45.750
there's some in Brazil there's some,
but you know,
yeah,
I don't wear it,

1907
01:47:45.751 --> 01:47:47.520
but you know,
you don't worry about that shit.
It's like being in Brazil,

1908
01:47:47.521 --> 01:47:51.480
like people get real.
Yeah.
I mean a lot of people get ripped off,
but it's,

1909
01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:53.850
<v 1>you got to know where to go and good luck,</v>

1910
01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:56.400
bad luck can happen to you and you can be the soccer stadium and eat it,

1911
01:47:56.401 --> 01:47:57.850
you know?
And it's just a little more lighter.

1912
01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:59.490
Can fall in your fucking hat right here.

1913
01:47:59.491 --> 01:48:02.650
Get hit by a bus right here so you can go right through that.

1914
01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:07.530
Some crazy messed up bus driver happened.
Some fucking dude on bath salts,
Sam,

1915
01:48:07.531 --> 01:48:09.450
Joe,
Brian Sitting in heaven like damn it dude.

1916
01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:12.520
Damn motherfucker wasn't what I was expecting at all.

1917
01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:14.710
We're just going to finish this podcast stuff from us.

1918
01:48:14.730 --> 01:48:19.140
Not how I thought it was going to go.
Yeah.
So,
um,
when you write a book like this,

1919
01:48:19.141 --> 01:48:20.490
a disaster diaries,

1920
01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:25.320
how much time do you spend doing research and preparing for it and like what is

1921
01:48:25.321 --> 01:48:27.780
the,
what's the process of uh,

1922
01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:29.400
<v 4>research?
You know,</v>

1923
01:48:29.401 --> 01:48:34.401
I read a ton and then you have to go do stuff partly for,

1924
01:48:34.801 --> 01:48:37.470
you know,
just to give the book some action,
you know,
if it was just research,

1925
01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:40.160
it's boring.
Right.
And then partly because,

1926
01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:42.780
I mean really this is all just an excuse for me to do fun shit.

1927
01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:44.490
It's not really about the book.

1928
01:48:44.590 --> 01:48:47.560
<v 1>Yeah.
So it's so it's,
well,
it's both.
It's a passion as well,
right.</v>

1929
01:48:49.210 --> 01:48:51.160
<v 4>Learning and there's like,
you know,</v>

1930
01:48:51.161 --> 01:48:55.450
lists of things that I want to do and this was a way for me to check off a bunch

1931
01:48:55.451 --> 01:48:57.250
of them.
And uh,
yeah,

1932
01:48:57.251 --> 01:49:01.840
I spent probably about three years total.
Wow.

1933
01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:03.940
And you know,
some take longer,
some are shorter.

1934
01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:06.000
The fighter's mind was more of a pure sports books.

1935
01:49:06.001 --> 01:49:08.740
So that was more like interviews and essays and research.

1936
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:12.640
So that I didn't about a year that I turned right around the fighter's mind.

1937
01:49:12.641 --> 01:49:14.740
The second book,
well,
the other books were longer.

1938
01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:18.170
<v 1>Has this idea of writing a survivalist book,</v>

1939
01:49:18.171 --> 01:49:21.170
has this made you think about your preparation for like,

1940
01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:24.590
like have you thought about like getting a place out in the middle of the

1941
01:49:24.591 --> 01:49:25.690
mountains or something like that?
Sure.

1942
01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:29.670
<v 4>Yeah.
No,
I like the kind of,
the bottom line I went with was like,</v>

1943
01:49:30.690 --> 01:49:33.000
there's so many ways it could happen.
Um,

1944
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:36.690
do you ever read the Black Swan or decline over time?
By Brian told me about it.

1945
01:49:36.691 --> 01:49:39.540
I haven't read it yet.
It's cool.
But it's like,
the idea is like,

1946
01:49:39.541 --> 01:49:42.960
you just don't know what's going to happen.
What if it's fucking aliens?

1947
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:46.820
You know what if it's,
if it's sky net,
you know,
you're in Montana,

1948
01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:49.600
most of the minuteman sites are in Montana.
There a lot of them.

1949
01:49:49.601 --> 01:49:53.610
So like skynet's going to hit Montana first,
right?
What if you're on tour,

1950
01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:57.940
on vacation,
you know,
so the,
the idea was like,
it's all about skills.

1951
01:49:57.941 --> 01:49:59.560
It's all about what you carry with you.

1952
01:49:59.561 --> 01:50:02.650
It's not about where you are because anyone about having stuff or how big did

1953
01:50:02.651 --> 01:50:06.100
make my a fallout shelter,
you know,
that's not me.
It's not my book.
You know,

1954
01:50:06.101 --> 01:50:09.460
like that's not,
there's other guys doing that that are way better at it.

1955
01:50:09.461 --> 01:50:14.461
So I'm just doing this about learning skills and kind of like the truth and what

1956
01:50:14.891 --> 01:50:17.110
those skills mean.
You know,
all that stuff.

1957
01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:22.040
<v 1>There's,
um,
a study that,
uh,
is,
uh,
come out really recently,
uh,</v>

1958
01:50:22.041 --> 01:50:25.790
where they,
uh,
they been working on this for a while where they've,
uh,

1959
01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:30.820
deduced that earth was hit by massive meteor showers about 12,000,

1960
01:50:31.101 --> 01:50:32.420
900 years ago.

1961
01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:36.620
And this is something that they've discovered evidence for it in many different

1962
01:50:36.621 --> 01:50:41.450
cultures,
many different,
uh,
countries.
And uh,
it's uh,
the type of,
um,

1963
01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:42.733
like a,

1964
01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:46.920
it's like grow the ground is actually turned into glass,

1965
01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:51.110
like a type of glass from the,
uh,
from the impact and the heat.
Oh my.

1966
01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:56.320
And this glass has been observed at nuclear test sites and also he all over the

1967
01:50:57.141 --> 01:51:00.560
planet in,
in places where they believe at 12,
it all,

1968
01:51:00.610 --> 01:51:05.540
all dates to 12,000,
900,
just seared the whole planet,
just flop rash,

1969
01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:06.201
flash fried.

1970
01:51:06.201 --> 01:51:10.040
It fucked the whole planet sideways in a bunch of different spots all over the

1971
01:51:10.041 --> 01:51:13.520
place.
It's something called,
um,
it's called melt glass.

1972
01:51:13.521 --> 01:51:17.960
It forms at 1,700 degrees equal to an atomic bomb and it's all over the place.

1973
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:21.530
It's all over the place in the world at 12,900 years ago.

1974
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:25.280
And this is when the wooly mammoths died is the end of the pleistocene.

1975
01:51:25.281 --> 01:51:28.160
This is when the saber tooth tigers were killed off.
And this is also,

1976
01:51:28.161 --> 01:51:31.430
they believe what killed off a bunch of different civilizations.
I think that,

1977
01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:31.851
you know,

1978
01:51:31.851 --> 01:51:35.760
like fucking 80% of the people were dead because of the sure fire for the
tongue.

1979
01:51:35.810 --> 01:51:38.350
<v 4>Got those like a,
you know,
evolutionary bottlenecks,
you know,</v>

1980
01:51:38.351 --> 01:51:42.340
like everything gets killed.
And then the one eight that's a little bit smarter,

1981
01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:44.560
it gets the gets to fill out that whole,

1982
01:51:45.250 --> 01:51:49.270
<v 1>yeah,
this is also a all over Syria Mesopotamia where you know,</v>

1983
01:51:49.390 --> 01:51:53.860
at that point in time,
6,000 years ago,
not 12,900 but 6,000 years ago,

1984
01:51:53.861 --> 01:51:55.720
that's the cradle of civilization.
That's the,

1985
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:58.660
what we know is the earliest known civilizations are all in this area.

1986
01:51:58.661 --> 01:52:03.290
So it kind of makes sense that it's like the survivors of this terrible thing to

1987
01:52:03.310 --> 01:52:07.150
sort of rebuild.
And it also makes sense why every single ancient culture,

1988
01:52:07.330 --> 01:52:09.730
whether it's a,
their stories like the epic of Gilgamesh,

1989
01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:13.600
they deal with in a previous more advanced coach that was fucked up by

1990
01:52:13.601 --> 01:52:14.920
cataclysmic disasters.

1991
01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:19.150
So this is probably like shit that was like passed down from generation to

1992
01:52:19.151 --> 01:52:21.130
generation of people who,
who survived.

1993
01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:25.300
So leaves down villages that they believe were were wiped out by this particular

1994
01:52:25.301 --> 01:52:30.010
thing.
They found it in Pennsylvania.
They founded in South Carolina.

1995
01:52:30.011 --> 01:52:33.220
They found the shit all over the place and it all dates the same period.

1996
01:52:33.250 --> 01:52:38.020
12,900 years.
It's cool.
Definitely like ubiquitous myth,
like we all have,

1997
01:52:38.090 --> 01:52:42.310
every culture has the end of the world myth and that shit can,

1998
01:52:42.450 --> 01:52:43.960
I mean we look at the moon.

1999
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:46.100
All you do is look at the moment God goddamn telescope.
Yeah.
What's

2000
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:47.240
<v 3>all those round circles?
Yeah.</v>

2001
01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:52.480
That that mother fucker got hit by giant rocks flying through space and one day

2002
01:52:52.641 --> 01:52:55.550
we're probably going to see that.
Which would be a trip and a half.

2003
01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:57.770
Could you imagine if you were looking at the wound,
get hit,

2004
01:52:57.870 --> 01:53:01.470
watch an asteroid hit the fucking are we fucked?
Does that it was two or,

2005
01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:04.520
and it's kind of grown.
Yeah.

2006
01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:08.270
Well did you see though there's been a bunch of them that they've observed.

2007
01:53:08.271 --> 01:53:12.450
One of them fairly recently,
an amateur astronomer observed something hitting,
um,

2008
01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:14.900
I believe it was Jupiter,
but it was,
yeah,

2009
01:53:14.901 --> 01:53:19.010
there was one that hit Jupiter that they monitored and it's sort of changed the

2010
01:53:19.011 --> 01:53:21.980
idea.
They knew it was going to hit you,
but it's like 94,

2011
01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:26.540
I forget the name of the comment,
but um,
when,
when they saw the amount of impact,

2012
01:53:26.541 --> 01:53:26.841
they were like,

2013
01:53:26.841 --> 01:53:29.120
well that's a lot more than we thought it was a lot bigger than we thought.

2014
01:53:29.370 --> 01:53:34.010
We made an earth size hole and I know like the scale,
right?

2015
01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:35.600
You have no idea.

2016
01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:39.740
But then the question comes like head around the scale if that does happen,

2017
01:53:39.741 --> 01:53:42.500
if everybody,
but 20% of the people are wiped out.

2018
01:53:42.501 --> 01:53:45.470
Do you want to be one of the guys a lot trying to eat corpses?

2019
01:53:45.730 --> 01:53:49.160
You know what I mean?
That's a tough,
the tough one.
Sure.
Beef jerky people.
Sure.

2020
01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:51.370
We'll just start off eating.
He fucking,

2021
01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:55.910
he didn't rape it ain't rape if they're dead.
That is true,

2022
01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:01.180
but I can't trust you if you go around fucking dead bodies.
Yeah,
why not?

2023
01:54:01.190 --> 01:54:04.900
Did you fuck my dead mom the first day?
It's a free for all.
Is it?

2024
01:54:05.730 --> 01:54:10.130
You get like a horrible kinds of problems and you are the new aids.

2025
01:54:10.490 --> 01:54:12.970
You know what?
If the new aids comes from that,
I'd be,

2026
01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:16.160
I remember when the whole did the rumor of aids was some dude's fucked a monkey.

2027
01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:20.990
You know?
I know there was the original rumor of how HIV was a,
that's you buddy.

2028
01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:23.780
You're going to get to rename.
If I get to name it,

2029
01:54:23.781 --> 01:54:25.810
I wouldn't have a problem with it.
That'd be Kinda cool to,

2030
01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:28.110
if you've got the name and new disease,
that would be it.
Just,

2031
01:54:28.770 --> 01:54:31.940
that's all he wants.
Come on dude.
He doesn't have a lot of what's going on.

2032
01:54:33.250 --> 01:54:36.680
A hope and a lot of hope there.
He just wants to be the new age.

2033
01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:42.110
It's all aim for as high.
A lot of mom's going to be proud of me.

2034
01:54:42.230 --> 01:54:46.730
You gotta Reichle infection in your day.
Some dead lady.
Well,

2035
01:54:46.731 --> 01:54:49.580
it makes sense that nature would eventually punish you for that.

2036
01:54:49.730 --> 01:54:53.480
I mean the reason why people get a Jacobs [inaudible] or which is mad cow

2037
01:54:53.481 --> 01:54:57.350
disease,
same thing.
It comes from uh,
in New Guinea.
It comes from cannibalism,

2038
01:54:57.380 --> 01:55:00.840
eating human brain tissue.
Oh yeah.
It causes you to have a neurological disorder.

2039
01:55:00.970 --> 01:55:04.670
Cause like nature is like listen to the fucking much brains don't do the hacking

2040
01:55:04.671 --> 01:55:07.940
it.
Yeah.
You can't eat,
don't eat your own species.
Especially genius.

2041
01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:11.390
It's like putting Osx and I'm like a PC.
It's not supposed to work.
It's act.

2042
01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:17.120
She were here that thing about,
uh,
this is,
this is,
it goes to like crazy theory,

2043
01:55:17.121 --> 01:55:20.630
but like what really caused aids was,
was um,

2044
01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:26.810
over inoculations.
I've never heard that.
There's a book called,

2045
01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:27.501
there is no,

2046
01:55:27.501 --> 01:55:31.130
you without me about a woman in Ethiopia who starts raising AIDS orphans.

2047
01:55:31.131 --> 01:55:35.510
But the first 50 pages are amazing cause it's about the latest theories on the

2048
01:55:35.511 --> 01:55:39.470
aids virus basically.
Uh,
you know,

2049
01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:44.000
Ngos were coming to Africa for a hundred a hundred years.
You,
you know,
help,
you

2050
01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.420
<v 4>know,
UNICEF,
whatever.</v>

2051
01:55:45.421 --> 01:55:49.230
And they're giving people inoculations and they would bring like five needles

2052
01:55:49.231 --> 01:55:52.020
and do the whole Goddamn village.
Oh God.
You know,

2053
01:55:52.021 --> 01:55:54.030
and they're throwing them in alcohol,
but that doesn't really do it.

2054
01:55:54.031 --> 01:55:56.760
And that's how you get shit to mutate.
So they find like,

2055
01:55:57.780 --> 01:56:00.210
I think it's called like I was pasteurization process.
You can get,

2056
01:56:00.211 --> 01:56:04.500
if you move something with from a bunch of petri dishes with the same needle,

2057
01:56:04.501 --> 01:56:08.730
it will mutate each time.
That makes it like when you were saying inoculations,

2058
01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:11.350
I was like,
Oh I don't know where you're going with this.
But so anyway,

2059
01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:15.750
it's conspiracy theory.
No,
because,
because there's,
um,
there's like,
uh,

2060
01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:20.840
a nonlethal form in some parts of Africa of an AIDS virus that's in people from

2061
01:56:22.681 --> 01:56:25.560
eating the monkey.
But it's not,
it's not,
it doesn't kill them.

2062
01:56:25.590 --> 01:56:27.780
I think dom might be here,
is that dot.
Barrera.

2063
01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:34.520
Why don't you see we're all the shadow walk around.
Is it dumb?
Okay,

2064
01:56:34.521 --> 01:56:39.110
hold on one second.
I'll bring him in anyway.
Yeah,
I mean it's like,
uh,

2065
01:56:41.150 --> 01:56:44.870
so anyway,
the more inoculations and,
and,
and in Africa,

2066
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:47.930
the witchdoctors do inoculations now.
Like it's,

2067
01:56:47.931 --> 01:56:51.140
it's like you haven't gotten medicine unless you've been inoculated.

2068
01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:55.970
So these witchdoctors all have needles and they're passing.
So there's like,

2069
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:57.060
cause you know there's

2070
01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:01.910
a morality kind of to aids where like people think like,
oh,

2071
01:57:01.911 --> 01:57:04.550
the Africans is can't control themselves or doing too much fucking,

2072
01:57:04.551 --> 01:57:06.800
so they're all getting aids.
But really it's,
it's,
you know,

2073
01:57:06.801 --> 01:57:11.360
there's people that are virgins that are getting it pre,
you know,

2074
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:16.040
pre sexual contact and uh,
that's the whole deal anyway.
Yeah.

2075
01:57:16.290 --> 01:57:20.880
<v 1>Hmm.
